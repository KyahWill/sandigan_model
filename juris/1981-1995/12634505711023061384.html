resolution of respondent judge of </span><st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 8, 1980</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> granting private respondent's petition for relief from the
judgment rendered by the same respondent judge on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 8, 1980</span></st1:date><span class="GramE"> in Civil Case No. 8480 of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> which dismissed private respondent's complaint for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of a parcel of land and damages.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That decision was rendered notwithstanding
the absence of petitioners at the pre-trial by reason of which they were
declared in default.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was based alone
on the testimony of private respondent Josefina D. <span class="SpellE">Lagar</span>
and the documents she presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 29, 1979, private respondent filed with respondent
judge a complaint for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of a parcel of
land and damages alleging <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
that respondent's father caused the land in question titled in his name alone
as "widower", after her mother's death, in spite of the property
being conjugal, and then sold it to the predecessor in interest of petitioners
from whom they bought the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the defendants, herein petitioners had filed their answer,
wherein they alleged lack of personality of plaintiff to sue, prescription and
that they are buyers in good faith, the case was set for pre-trial, but
petitioners failed to appear thereat.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Taking advantage of such absence, private respondent's counsel moved
that they be declared in default and that private respondent, with the
assistance of her counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Monje</span>, be allowed to present their evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was granted and after presenting
her evidence, counsel rested her case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same date, respondent judge rendered judgment finding the
evidence insufficient to sustain the cause of action alleged and therefore
dismissing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was on <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, <span style="">1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1980</st1:date>, respondent's counsel was served with
copy of the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Annex G of
the petition.)</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1980</st1:date>,
private respondent filed, thru a new counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Mapaye</span>, a motion for new trial and/or
reconsideration alleging that the insufficiency of her evidence was due to the
fault of her counsel who presented the same without her being fully
prepared.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, she claimed,
she had newly discovered evidence that could prove her cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is relevant to note that said motion was signed
and sworn to by private respondent herself together with her counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the said motion for new trial and/or reconsideration,
on <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1980</st1:date>,
respondent judge denied the same for having been filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, from January 15, 1980, when respondent's
counsel was served with the decision, to February 16, 1980, when the motion was
filed, more than 30 days had already elapsed (32 days to be exact).</p>

<p class="BODY">Persisting in her effort to pursue her claim, under date of <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1980</st1:date>, private respondent filed,
thru another new counsel, Atty. Ricardo Rosales, Jr., a petition for relief,
purportedly under Rule 38, claiming:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She filed civil case 8480 for <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> and Damages against defendants Luis Francisco,
et al., on <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1979</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The main trust in petitioner's action
against defendant was her unlawful deprivation of one-half of the property
covered by <span class="SpellE">TCT</span> No. 2720 and denominated as <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
4864 of the cadastral survey of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, as said
parcel belongs to the conjugal partnership of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagar</span> and <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Gaudencia</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Daelo</span>, plaintiff-petitioner's immediate
predecessor-in-interest.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Daelo</span> having predeceased her husband, petitioner contends
that one-half of the property belongs to her mother and therefore should
rightfully be inherited by her after her mother's death, but failed however, to
inherit any part t<span style="">hereof, because her
father sold the entire parcel to the defendant Luis Francisco.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1980</st1:date>, a pre-trial hearing
was scheduled, where defendants were declared as if in default thereafter an
order of default was issued and plaintiff adduced evidence ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the same date, <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1980</st1:date>, a decision was rendered
dismissing the case after plaintiff took the witness stand, <span class="GramE">who</span>
through excusable neglect was not able to expound on very vital points and
inadvertently failed to introduce in support of her theory.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because plaintiff-petitioner was under the
belief that the scheduled hearing was one where no testimony is yet to be
taken, coupled by the fact that she was not prepared to testify, and that it
was her first time to take the witness stand, she did not fully comprehend the
questions propounded to her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-petitioner filed a Motion for
Reconsideration and/or new trial but was denied in its order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1980</st1:date>, which petitioner
received on <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1980</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If plaintiff-petitioner will be allowed to
introduce evidence in her possession, which by excusable neglect and/or mistake
were not introduced, the same will necessarily alter and/or change the decision
in her favor, attached is her affidavit of merits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence in support of her claim that it is
a conjugal property <span class="GramE">consist</span> of a deed of sale executed
by Manuel <span class="SpellE">Zaballero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Germana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ona</span> in favor of the conjugal partnership of <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagar</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaudencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Daelo</span> (Doc. No. 412;
Page No. 55; Book No. II; Series of 1948 of Notary Public Francisco <span class="SpellE">Mendioro</span>), <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy thereof is
attached herewith as Annex 'A'.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"10.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The deed of sale ratified by Notary Public
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Ingente</span> (Doc. No. 68; Page No. 7; Book No.</span>
VI; Series of 1955) executed by <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lagar</span> should refer only to one-half (1/2) and therefore is <span class="SpellE">annulable</span> in so far as the other half of the property is
concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"11.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the petition wherein <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lagar</span> sought to change his civil status was not known
personally to the plaintiff-petitioner and/or not understood by her, otherwise
she could have made reservations in that petition eventually protecting her
right insofar as one-half (1/2) of the property is concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"12.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">Plaintiff-petitioner
has </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">valid substantial cause of action consisting
of evidence enumerated above, which by excusable negligence or error was not
presented otherwise, the decision will be in favor of the plaintiff herein
petitioner."(Petition for Relief of Judgment, pp. 50-52, Record)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Answering the petition for relief, petitioners maintained that
aside from the fact that no excusable negligence has been alleged, for, on the
contrary, there was an evident effort on respondent's part to take advantage of
the absence and default of petitioners when respondent presented her evidence,
the petition for relief was filed out <span style="">of
time in </span><span style="">the light of Section 3
of Rule 38, which provides that such a petition should be "filed within
sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the judgment, order or
proceeding to be set aside, and not more than </span><span style="">six </span><span style="">(6) months after such
judgment or order was entered or such proceeding was taken."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his resolution of </span><st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="10"><span style="">October
 8, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> now under
question, respondent judge ruled that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Defendants' claim that plaintiff is presumed to have learned of
the judgment of January 8, 1980, either on January 15, 1980 when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Monje</span> received a copy thereof or on February 15, 1980, when
plaintiff <span style="">signed the Motion for
Reconsideration and/or New Trial prepared by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mapaye</span>,
in either case, the petition for relief of May 8, 1980 by Atty. Rosales was
resorted to beyond the 60-day period prescribed under Section 3, Rule 38 of the
Rules of Court; from January 15 to May 8 is a period of 114 days and from
February 15 to May 8 is a period of 84 days; in either case, the filing of the
petition for relief is beyond 60 days from the time plaintiff is presumed to
have learned of said decision of January 8, although, in either or both events,
the filing thereof is admittedly within 6 months from the issuance of said
decision; on the other hand, the plaintiff stated that she did not actually
learn of the decision of January 8 until she received a copy thereof on March
17, 1980 (p. 67 of Record or 'G') and that she was not informed of the contents
of the motion for new trial and/or re­consideration on February 15, 1980 when
she was made to </span><span style="">sign </span><span style="">it (<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>, pp. 20-21, July 28, 1980).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">" 'Q</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From where did you secure
that copy of the decision?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I went to the court myself and secured a copy
of the decision.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>, p. 16-id).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>XX<span style="">X<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
you are sure of the fact that you only became aware of the decision in the
month of March, 1980?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir,' (<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>, p. 20, id).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of the circumstances obtaining in this case, it
is the opinion of the Court that it <span style="">is </span>the date when plaintiff actually learned
of the decision from which she seeks relief that should be considered in
computing the period of 60 days prescribed under Sec. 3, Rule 38 of the Rules
of Court for purposes of determining the timeliness of the said petition for
relief; this opinion finds support in <span class="SpellE">Cayetano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ceguerra</span>, et al., No. L-18831, 13 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>,
where the Supreme Court, in effect, held that the date of 'actual knowledge'
(and not the presumed date of receipt or knowledge) of the decision, order or
judgment from <span style="">which relief is sought
shall be the date which should be considered </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">determining the timeliness of the filing of a petition for relief; in
that case, the Supreme Court said:</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">" 'It is conceded that defendants re­ceived a first registry
notice on January 13, 1961, but they did not claim the letter, thereby giving
rise to the presumption that five (5) days after receipt of the first notice,
the defendants were deemed to have received the letter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, cannot justly attribute
upon defendants actual know­ledge of the decision, because there is no showing
that the registry notice itself contained any indication that the registered letter
was a copy of the decision, or that the registry notice referred to the case
being ventilated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot exact a
strict accounting of the rules from ordinary mortals, like the defendants.' <span class="GramE">" (</span>Resolution, pp. 67-68, Record.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree, for two reasons. First, according to Chief
Justice Moran:</p>

<blockquote>"The relief provided for by this rule is not regarded with
favor and the judgment would not be avoided where the party complaining 'has,
or by exercising proper diligence would have had, an adequate remedy at law, or
by proceedings in the original action, by motion, petition, or the like to
open, vacate, modify, or otherwise obtain relief against, the judgment.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> v. Judge <span class="SpellE">Bayona</span>,
etc., et al., 52 <span class="SpellE"><span style="">O.G</span></span><span style="">. </span>1937; See <span class="SpellE">Alquesa</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Cavoda</span>, L-16735, Oct. 31, 1961, citing 49 <span class="SpellE">C.J.S</span>. 695.)</span> The remedy allowed by this rule <span style="">is </span>an act <span style="">of grace, as </span>it were, designed to <span style="">give </span>the
aggrieved party another and last chance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being in the position of one who begs, such party's privilege is not to
impose conditions, haggle or dillydally, but to grab what is offered him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Palomares</span>,
et al. v. Jimenez, et al., L-4513, Jan. 31, 1952.)"</span> <span class="GramE">(Page 226, Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 2, 1979
Edition.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In other words, where, as in this case, another remedy <span style="">is </span>available,
as, in fact, private respondent had filed a motion for new trial and/or
reconsideration alleging practically the same main ground of the petition for
relief under discussion, which was denied, what respondent should have done was
to take to a higher court such denial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
party who has filed a timely motion for new trial cannot file a petition for
relief after his motion has been denied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These two remedies are exclusive of each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only in appropriate cases where a party
aggrieved by a judgment has not been able to file a motion for new trial that a
petition for relief can be filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, it is beyond doubt that the petition for relief of
private respondent was filed out of time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We cannot sanction respondent court's view that the period should be
computed only from March 17, 1980 when she claims self-servingly that she first
knew of the judgment because, as stated above, she signed and even swore to the
<span style="">truth of the allegations in </span><span style="">her motion </span><span style="">for new trial filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mapaye</span> on
February 16, 1980 or a month earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
give way to her accusations of <span class="SpellE">incompetency</span> against
the lawyer who handled her case at the <span style="">pre-trial,
</span>which resulted in a decision adverse to her despite the absence of
petitioners, and charge again later that her new counsel did not inform her
properly of the import of her motion for new trial and/or reconsideration is to
strain the quality of mercy beyond the breaking point and could be an
unwarranted slur on the members of the bar.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That, however, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Mapaye</span> did not pursue the
proper course after his motion for new trial was denied is, of course,
unfortunate, but We are unaware of the circumstances of such failure and how
much of it could be attributed to respondent <span style="">herself, hence </span>We cannot say definitely that it was counsel's
fault.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that notice to
counsel of the decision is notice to the party for purposes of Section 3 of
Rule 38.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">principle </span>that notice to the party, when he is represented by a <span style="">counsel of record, is </span>not valid is
applicable here in the reverse <span style="">for the
very </span>same reason that it is the lawyer who is supposed to <span style="">know the next </span>procedural steps or what
ought to be done in law <span style="">henceforth for </span>the
protection of the rights of the client, and not the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that respondent
judge <span style="">acted beyond his jurisdiction in </span>taking
cognizance of private respon<span style="">dent's
petition for relief </span>and, therefore, all his actuations in con­nection
therewith are null and void, with the result that his decision of <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1980</st1:date> should be allowed to
stand, the same having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style=""><span style="">ACCORDINGLY,</span></b><span style=""> </span><span style="">judgment
is hereby rendered setting aside the resolution of respondent judge of October
8, 1980 and reinstating his decision of January 8, 1980 in Civil Case No. 8480
of his court, which latter decision may now be executed, the same being already
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
