testimonies are summarized in the appealed decision as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">“Among the fifteen (15) highway engineering districts which
comprised Region VII of the MPH [Ministry of Public Highways (now Department of
Public Works and Highways)], is the <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> City Highway
Engineering District (BCHED).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
headed by the City Engineer of <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> City with its own
auditing staff headed by the City Auditor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Its jurisdiction encompasses the territorial limits of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bais</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
including the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bais-Kabangkalan</span>
  Road</st1:address></st1:street> and the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> North Road</st1:address></st1:street>, for
which annual maintenance allotments are issued to it and other districts by the
MPH through the Regional Office in the form of Letters of Advice of Allotment (<span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>) which serve as authority for the district office to
incur obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> are derived from Sub-Advice of Allotments (<span class="SpellE">SAAs</span>) which are issued to all regional offices by the MPH
based on Advices of Allotment (<span class="SpellE">AAs</span>) issued by it by
the Ministry of the Budget after the annual government appropriations act or
budget has been approved.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">“While <span class="SpellE">AAs</span>, <span class="SpellE">SAAs</span>
and <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> serve as authority to incur obligations by
the MPH, its regional offices and the latter’s district offices, the authority
to make payments for said obligations incurred is derived from Cash
Disbursement Ceilings (<span class="SpellE">CDCs</span>), which are issued by the
Ministry of Budget to the MPH together with the <span class="SpellE">AAs</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The MPH, in turn, issue Advices of Cash
Disbursement Ceilings (ACDC) to its regional office, and the latter then issues
the corresponding Sub-Advice of Cash Disbursement Ceilings (<span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span>)
to the different engineering districts under it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All releases of funds by the MPH to its
regional offices are made at the outset of every quarter, based on the
programmed needs of the region’s district offices, and said releases made
through <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and <span class="SpellE">CDCs</span> to
each district are entered in the appropriate logbooks or ledgers of the
Regional Office, principally in the Budget and Finance Division thereof.</p>

<p class="2Q">“In the case of the <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> CHED,
disbursement of the quarterly allotments for maintenance or other needs of the
districts is effected through the proper written request by the District
Engineer for the release of such funds, accompanied by the supporting programs
of work, directed to the Regional Director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon approval of said request by the latter, an LAA is issued to the
District Engineer by the Regional Finance Officer, certified as to the
availability of funds by the Regional Accountant, and countersigned by the
Regional Director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Correspondingly, the
requisite SACDC is prepared by the Regional Finance Officer to be signed by him
and the Regional Director, after which they are duly recorded in a
logbook.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both the LAA and SACDC are then
sent to the district office and are carried and received by duly-authorized
representatives.</p>

<p class="2Q">“Implementation of the district’s programs of work now go into the
requisition stage, wherein the proper Requisition for Supplies and Equipment
(RSE), needed for the prosecution of its projects and embodied in the approved
program of work, is prepared by the requisitioning officer, certified as to the
availability of funds by the District Accountant and approved by the District
Engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Project Engineer also
prepares a Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) which the Accountant
certifies as to availability of funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The RSE, together with a copy of the program of work, is then
transmitted to the Regional Office for the approval of the Regional Director
and thereafter returned to the district concerned for prosecution of the
project after compliance with bidding and award procedures.</p>

<p class="2Q">“Based on the approved RSE, the district’s Property Custodian or
Purchasing/Supply Officer, with the approval of the District Engineer, sends
out Request for Sealed Quotations to various contractors or suppliers
requesting them to submit, on or before a date fixed therein, their quotations
for the materials or supplies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notices
thereof are likewise publicized through either newspaper publications or
postings in public places.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, the sealed bid forms are opened by the
Committee on Bidding and Award in the presence of representatives of the
District Engineer and the District/City Auditor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lowest price quotation or bid is
determined and the corresponding Abstract of Bids is prepared and signed by the
members of the committee, as well as the auditor’s and district engineer’s
representatives, after which the corresponding award is made to the said lowest
bidder, duly approved by the District Engineer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A Purchase Order (PO) is thereafter prepared by the Property Custodian,
addressed to the winning bidder, certified as to availability of funds by the
Accountant and approved by the District Engineer.</p>

<p class="2Q">“Delivery is then <span class="GramE">effected</span> by the winning
bidder, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the <st1:place>PO</st1:place>,
which may include the time required to start and terminate said deliveries and
the places of delivery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inspection of
deliveries are made at the delivery or project sites by a representative of the
Auditor’s office upon receipt of a verbal or written request for such inspection
prepared by the Property Custodian to the Auditor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Auditor’s representative inspects the
deliveries, signs the Delivery Receipts (<span class="SpellE">DRs</span>) and
finally, the Report of Inspection (ROI), duly concurred in by the Property
Custodian.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During said deliveries,
samples of the materials are also tested for their conformity with
specifications and the results of such tests are submitted to the District
Engineer to be attached to the payment vouchers, together with all other
supporting documents.</p>

<p class="2Q">“After completion of deliveries, the corresponding General Voucher
(GV) for the payment of the supplies or materials delivered is prepared,
usually by someone at the district office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said GV contains on the face thereof five (5) certifications to be
signed by the proper officials, namely, the Property Custodian, the Project
Engineer, the District or City Engineer, the Accountant and the District or
City Auditor attesting and certifying to the correctness, legality and
propriety of the transaction covered by said GV.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached to <span class="GramE">said</span> GV
and required to be examined and verified by the proper district officials and
their subordinates are the requisite supporting documents, such as, the RSE,
ROA, Program of Work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Detailed
Estimates, Request for Sealed Quotations, Abstract of Bids, <st1:place>PO</st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">DRs</span>, <span class="GramE">Request</span> for Inspection,
Test Reports and Tax Clearance Certificate of the supplier-contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the GV is processed, pre-audited and
approved, the papers are brought to the Cashier for the preparation of the
check or treasury warrant or TCAA check, which is also pre-audited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The check is then released to the
supplier-contractor or his duly authorized representative who issues the
corresponding official receipt.</p>

<p class="2Q">“At the end of each calendar month, the District Accountant
prepares several reports, including the Report of Obligations Incurred (ROI)
and the Report of Checks Issued (RCI), which are submitted to the Regional
Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the Regional Budget and
Finance division, these reports, together with those coming from other
districts, are entered in the proper journals and, in the course of ordinary
accounting procedures, are entered in the General Ledger.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In turn, the entries in the General Ledger
become the basis for monthly Trial Balances (<span class="SpellE">TBs</span>)
which are prepared cumulatively by the Regional Accountant, recommended for
approval by the Regional Finance Officer and approved by the Regional Director,
which <span class="SpellE">TBs</span> are also submitted every month to the
Central Office of the MPH.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the end of
the fiscal calendar year, the final Trial Balance is prepared by the Regional
Office and likewise submitted to the MPH.” <span class="GramE">(pp. 31-37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the evidence presented at the trial, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
found that:</p>

received its allocation of P568,487.80 for 1978 for the maintenance and repair
of roads and bridges in that district the defendants caused the disbursement of
an additional sum of P627,239.88 through 14 fake general vouchers paid to
accused Jaime Ponce De Leon, for supposed deliveries from January to April 1978
of materials for the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City North Road (2-1/2
<span class="SpellE">kms</span>.) and the <span class="SpellE">Bais</span>- <span class="SpellE">Kabankalan</span> Road (4 <span class="SpellE">kms</span>.),
utilizing three (3) fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and four (4) <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span> (pp. 60-61, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Per estimate of the Central Office, the
average cost of maintenance was only P11<span class="GramE">,000</span> per
kilometer of highway in 1978 (p. 57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) but
P627,239.88 was spent by the defendants in January to April 1978 to repair or

and inspected the two projects (p. 73, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) which
otherwise would have been done if there was actual ongoing work in those
projects.</p>

<p class="BODY">8. The accused public officials, by the nature of their duties,
would have known that the documents (<span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>, <span class="SpellE">SACDs</span>, <span class="SpellE">RSEs</span>, POs, and <span class="SpellE">GVs</span>) were fake by merely scrutinizing them, or by the
exercise of ordinary diligence, for the funding of the three <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> was irregular and the <span class="SpellE">RSEs</span>
and <span class="SpellE">GVs</span> had been “split” into uniform amounts of not
more than P50<span class="GramE">,000</span> each.</p>

<p class="BODY">9. Ponce De Leon knew fully well that his participation in the
transactions was “only make-believe or a farce;” but he whole-heartedly
cooperated and conspired with his co-accused to consummate their common plan to
defraud the Government (p. 79, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, which the petitioners
violated, provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">The elements of this offense are:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the
accused are public officers or private persons charged in conspiracy with them;</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said
public officers commit the prohibited acts during the performance of their
official duties or in relation to their public positions;</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That they
cause undue injury to any party, whether the Government or a private party;</p>

<p class="BODY">(4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That such
injury is caused by giving unwarranted benefits, advantage or preference to
such parties; and</p>

<p class="BODY">(5)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the
public officers have acted with manifest partiality, evident bad faith or gross
inexcusable negligence (pp. 82-83, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">As observed by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, all
these elements are present in these 14 cases.</p>

<p class="2Q">“In the cases at bar, all the above-cited requisite elements are
present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When accused <span class="SpellE">Bagasao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span>, as Asst.
Regional Director and Regional Accountant, respectively, issued the fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and corresponding <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span> to
the BCHED, knowing fully well that the allotments and/or allocation <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> were not properly authorized by the Ministries
of the Budget and the Public Highways and neither have they been programmed for
release in accordance with standard operating procedure, they thus acted with
evident bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Renacia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delostrico</span> likewise
acted with evident bad faith in receiving and implementing the fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span> since they should
have known and noticed that the allotments released <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
were not for ‘regular maintenance,’ especially so when the district had just received
its first quarter allocations for 1978; that they had not requested formally
for such extra allocations; that the <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span> were fake or spurious on their faces and signed by
unauthorized officials, and that they had not prepared any program of work to
justify such extra allocations.</p>

<p class="2Q">“All the accused officials from the BCHED, namely, <span class="SpellE">Renacia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarra</span>, Ramirez, <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mananquil</span>, who were all engineers, and their subordinates
in the prosecution of projects in the district, namely, <span class="SpellE">Babao</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Altura</span>, together with those involved in
administrative, accounting and auditing functions, namely, <span class="SpellE">Mier</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Delostrico</span>, <span class="SpellE">Racho</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pascualdo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span>, likewise
acted with evident bad faith and manifest partiality in participating in the
preparation, processing and approval of the <span class="SpellE">GVs</span> and
supporting documents, such as <span class="SpellE">RSEs</span>, Requests for
Obligation of Allotment (<span class="SpellE">ROAs</span>), Abstracts of Bids,
POs, Delivery Receipts (<span class="SpellE">DRs</span>), Summary of Deliveries,
Reports of Inspection (<span class="SpellE">ROIs</span>) and Checks in payment of
‘ghost projects’ to a fake or spurious contractor-supplier, Jaime Ponce de
Leon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They not only connived and
confederated in the hasty and mass production of such ante-dated documents,
including programs of work, but also allowed their names, positions and
signatures to be used in completing the cycle which would lend a semblance of
legality or regularity to the questioned transactions and illegal disbursements
[of public funds to a fake contractor-supplier], thus causing undue injury to
the Government in the total amount of P627<span class="GramE">,230.99</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also
knew for a fact that the district had no prior year’s <span class="SpellE">unliquidated</span>
obligations in the amount of P650<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, hence, any
and all <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> with <span class="SpellE">correspsonding</span>
<span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span> would be questionable, if not fake, spurious
or irregular.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He and accused <span class="SpellE">Delostrico</span>, the district accountant, were fully aware of
the standard operating procedure in the release of quarterly allotments and
should not have accepted, much less, utilized the fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>
and <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span> for alleged ‘ghost projects’ which were
not supported by approved programs of work and <span class="SpellE">RSEs</span>
approved in the Regional Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">“Finally, <span class="SpellE">Mangubat</span> cannot escape or be
absolved from liability in the sordid mess.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He initiated the entire scheme, together with accused Asst. Regional
Director Jose <span class="SpellE">Bagasao</span>, when they issued fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and which he followed up by issuing fake <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He later
tried to cover-up the illegal and improper disbursement of public funds by
certifying to the correctness of the Journal Vouchers at the end of the year
through the utilization of ‘negative entries’ which enabled the region’s financial
records to reflect what he only wanted to reflect, which is, the disbursements
of funds thru regular <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span>
for 1978 but negating the amounts of the disbursements thru the fake <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and <span class="SpellE">SACDCs</span>.”<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 83-87, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners’ attempt to denigrate the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses, Apollo <span class="SpellE">Sayo</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">Quejada</span>, members of the investigating team, is unavailing
for the principal evidence against the accused in these cases are
documentary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The existence of the
documents and of their signatures therein, is not denied by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their guilt of the crimes charged had been
established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appealed decision in SB <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
