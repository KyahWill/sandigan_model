				<H3>OFFICE OF THE COURT ADMINISTRATOR, COMPLAINANT, VS. PABLO R. RACADAG, COURT INTERPRETER, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 27, NAGA CITY, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1987</st1:date>,
while the respondent Pablo R. <span class="SpellE">Racadag</span> was employed as
Court Interpreter of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>
at <span class="SpellE">Irosin</span>, a criminal <span class="SpellE">lnformation</span>
for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds as defined under
Article 217, par. 3 of the Revised Penal Code, was filed against him before the
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the information filed, the herein respondent, the therein
accused, while employed as Regional Trial Court Staff Assistant II, and
designated and discharging duties then as acting clerk of court of the Regional
Trial Court, Branch 55 in <span class="SpellE">lrosin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>,
and as such accountable for public funds received by him by reason of the
duties of his position, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> and unlawfully
allowed Attys. Henry <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and Jaime Fortes, Clerk of
Court of RTC, Branch 55, and counsel for the defendant in Civil Case No.
1204-033, entitled "Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span> vs.
Perfecto <span class="SpellE">Erasco</span>," respectively to appropriate
for their personal use and benefit the sum of P12,000.00 representing the
redemption money deposited by Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>, the
plaintiff in the said civil case, without any order or authority from the court
trying the case directing delivery to said persons and in disregard of the
written directives of his superiors for him (<span class="SpellE">Racadag</span>)
to deposit the money with the Philippine National Bank, <span class="SpellE">Irosin</span>
Branch, to the damage and prejudice of said Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Mercader</span>
and the government in the said amount.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the filing of the aforementioned criminal
information, and by virtue of the Court En Banc Resolution dated March 12,
1981, ordering the Office of the Court Administrator (OCA) to initiate <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> the filing of
administrative proceedings against judges and/or employees of anterior courts
who have been charged before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, the
necessary administrative complaint for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>
of public funds and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service was
filed against the respondent on July 22, 1987.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite notices however, the respondent failed to submit an answer or
comment to the administrative charge against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, at the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, the
respondent, after having entered a plea of not guilty, jumped bail and has
remained at large since then thus prompting that court to conduct the trial <b style="">in absentia</b>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 30, 1989, after appreciating the
testimonial, as well as the documentary, evidence presented by the prosecution
through its witnesses, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> rendered a
decision finding the respondent guilty as charged and accordingly sentenced him
to an indeterminate penalty ranging from seven (7) years, four (4) months and
one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><b style="">prision</b></span><b style=""> mayor</b> as the minimum, to eleven (11)
years, six (6) months and twenty-one (21) days, also of <span class="SpellE"><b style="">prision</b></span><b style=""> mayor</b> as the maximum; to suffer perpetual special
disqualification:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to pay a fine of P12,000.00
equal to the amount <span class="SpellE">malversed</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to indemnify the Government of the Republic
of the Philippines in the same amount of P12,000.00:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>and to pay the costs of the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The promulgation of the decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> was likewise held <b style="">in absentia</b>. The judgment of conviction became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="7">July
 11, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the criminal case against him, the respondent was <span class="SpellE">apppointed</span>
Interpreter (transfer of station) of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 27, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Naga</span></span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
upon the recommendation of Judge Roberto C. <span class="SpellE">Rañola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer was made possible by the
respondent’s non--disclosure of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> case against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the respondent has repeatedly failed, despite
due notice, to submit an explanation/answer as to why he should not be
penalized for his act, and considering further that he had been found guilty
beyond reasonable doubt by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> of the
crime of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds and penalized
with perpetual special disqualification which renders him ineligible to hold
any public office, the Office of the Court Administrator, in a memorandum dated
April 23, 1990, recommended the dismissal of the respondent from the service
with forfeiture of retirement benefits and with prejudice to reinstatement in
any branch of the government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records of this case, and in the
light of the circumstances obtaining, we find the recommendation given to be
well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the continued failure of the respondent to offer any
explanation on the administrative charge against him speaks ill of his
position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, his having jumped
bail and going into hiding during the trial of his criminal case before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> only revealed his guilt of the charge against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the respondent's
conviction in the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> erased any doubt in
our mind as to his culpability.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the respondent, Pablo R. <span class="SpellE">Racadag</span>,
Court Interpreter of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 27, <span class="SpellE">Naga</span>
City is hereby DISMISSED and SEPARATED from the service effective July 11,
1989, with forfeiture of all retirement benefits, and with prejudice to
re-employment in any branch, agency, or instrumentality of the government, including
government-owned or controlled corporations.</p>
