				<H3>HON. ALFREDO S. LIM, IN HIS CAPACITY AS MAYOR OF MANILA; AND THE CITY OF MANILA, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. FELIPE G. PACQUING, AS JUDGE, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF MANILA; AND ASSOCIATED DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>QUIASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the
Revised Rules of Court to set aside the Orders dated March 28, 1994, April 11,
1994 and April 20, 1994 of Judge Felipe G. Pacquing, presiding judge of the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 40, Manila, issued in Civil Case No. 88-45660.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Order dated March 28, 1994 granted the motion of private
respondent to compel petitioner Mayor Alfredo S. Lim to issue a permit or
license in favor of private respondent pursuant to Ordinance No. 7065 upon
compliance by private respondent with all the requirements set thereunder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Order dated April 11, 1994 denied the motion for
reconsideration filed by petitioners of the Order dated May 28, 1994.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Order dated April 20, 1994 reiterated the order of March 28,
1994, directing Mayor Lim to immediately issue to private respondent the
necessary permit or license pursuant to Ordinance No. 7065.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 7, 1971, the Municipal Board of Manila passed
Ordinance No. 7065 pursuant to Section 18(jj) of the Revised Charter of Manila,
granting private respondent a franchise to operate a jai-alai in the city.  The ordinance is reproduced as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"AN ORDINANCE AUTHORIZING THE MAYOR TO ALLOW AND PERMIT THE
ASSOCIATED DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION TO ESTABLISH, MAINTAIN AND OPERATE A
JAI-ALAI IN THE CITY OF MANILA, UNDER CERTAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND FOR
OTHER PURPOSES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Be it ordained by the Municipal Board of the City of Manila, that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>SECTION 1.  The Mayor is
authorized, as he is hereby authorized to allow and permit the Associated
Development Corporation to establish, maintain and operate a jai-alai in the
City of Manila, under the following terms and conditions and such other terms
and conditions as he (the Mayor) may prescribe for good reasons of general
interest:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">a.  That the construction, establishment and
maintenance of the jai-alai shall be at a place permissible under existing
zoning ordinances of Manila;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">b.  That the games to be played daily shall
commence not earlier than 5:00 in the afternoon;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">c.  That the City of Manila will receive a share
of 2 1/2% on the annual gross receipts on all wagers or bets, 1/2% of which
will accrue to the Games and Amusement Board as now provided by law;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">d.  That the corporation will, in addition, pay
to the city an annual license fee of P3,000.00 and a daily permit fee of
P200.00;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">e. That the
corporation will, to insure its faithful compliance of all the terms and
conditions under this ordinance, put up a performance bond from a surety
acceptable to the city, in the amount of at least P30,000.00.</p>

<blockquote>SECTION 2.  The Mayor and
the City Treasurer or their duly authorized representatives are hereby
empowered to inspect at all times during regular business hours the books,
records and accounts of the establishment, as well as to prescribe the manner
in which the books and financial statements of the entrepreneur shall be kept.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SECTION 3.  This ordinance
shall take effect upon its approval.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Enacted originally by the Municipal Board on September 7, 1971;
vetoed by the Mayor on September 27, 1971; modified and amended by the
Municipal Board at its regular session today, October 12, 1971.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Approved by His Honor, the Mayor, on 13 November 1971."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, private respondent took steps preparatory to the
establishment of the jai-alai at Ermita, Manila.  Private respondent retained the services of an architectural firm
from Hongkong to design the fronton and contracted with a local firm for the
construction of the building.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 20, 1975, after the declaration of Martial Law,
President Ferdinand E. Marcos promulgated Presidential Decree No. 771 revoking
the powers of the local government to grant permits or licenses and cancelling
all existing franchises to operate jai-alais.</p>

<p class="BODY">Less than two months after P.D. No. 771 was issued, the
Philippine Jai-Alai and Amusement Corporation, an enterprise controlled by
Alfredo Romualdez, a brother-in-law of President Marcos, was granted a
franchise to operate a jai-­alai within the Greater Manila Area under P.D. No.
810.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, after the EDSA Resolution, President Corazon C. Aquino
issued Executive Order No. 169, repealing P.D. No. 810.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 5, 1988, private respondent sought the resumption of its business
operations under its franchise issued under Ordinance No. 7065.  Mayor Gemiliano C. Lopez denied private
respondent's request, as well as its motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 2, 1988, private respondent filed a petition for <i>mandamus</i>
and specific performance with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 40, Manila,
docketed as Civil Case No. 88-45660.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated September 9, 1989, Judge Augusto E. Villarin
of Branch 40 held that Ordinance No. 7065 created a binding contract between
the City of Manila and private <span style="">respondent
and that the City Mayor had no discretion but "to grant the necessary
permit or license allowing it to operate and maintain a jai-alai in the City of
Manila pursuant to Ordinance No. 7065."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court noted:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A careful reading, however, of Ordinance No. 7065 will
readily show that the discretion, if any, allowed respondent Mayor, under the
Ordinance, will be exercisable only after the permit, which he is mandated to
issue, has been issued and the jai-alai fronton is already operational.  The Ordinance stipulates that the Mayor is
authorized 'to allow and permit petitioner to establish, maintain and operate a
jai-alai in the City of Manila,' under the five conditions enumerated in subparagraphs
'a' to 'e' of Section 1 of the Ordinance.  But a simple reading of these 'terms and conditions' patently shows that
subparagraphs 'b' to 'e' are clearly conditions that will only come into play
after the jai-alai fronton has been put up or established; while the condition
under sub-paragraph 'a' appears to have been complied with satisfactorily by
the petitioner, since no objection at all has been made by respondents to the
proposed site for the jai-alai fronton, that is, the 25,000 sq. m. land area
behind the present Harrison Plaza Complex located at Ermita, Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is therefore, quite evident to this Court that no discretion is
left to the respondent Mayor to allow or not petitioner 'to establish, maintain
and operate a jai-alai in the City of Manila.' The Court is satisfied that the
requirements of Sec. 3, Rule 65, have been met.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, it is well-settled that the grant of a franchise, when
accepted and acted upon by the grantee, creates a contract.  And, going by contract law, under the
undisputed circumstances in this case, respondent Mayor, in behalf of the City,
is obliged to comply with what is required of him under the Ordinance.  At the very least, the enactment and
approval of Ordinance No. 7065 on November 13, 1971, created a bilateral
contract between petitioner and respondents.  Petitioner has commenced the performance of its obligation under the
contract, but was prevented by events over which it has no control from
completely fulfilling what was called for on its part to establish, operate and
maintain a jai-alai in the City of Manila" (Rollo, pp. 39-40).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court disposed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the petitioner is GRANTED and respondent City of
Manila, is ordered to immediately issue to petitioner, the permit/license
required under Ordinance No. 7065" (Rollo, p. 40).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mayor Lopez appealed said decision to the Court of Appeals (CA
G.R. No. 16477 SP) but on February 9, 1989, he filed a Notice of Withdrawal of
Appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 5, 1989, the Court of Appeals promulgated a resolution,
the dispositive part of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"For the reasons stated in the NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF APPEAL
which was filed on February 9, 1989 by respondents appellants thru counsel let
their appeal from the Decision dated September 9, 1989 and Order dated August
25, 1988, of the Regional Trial Court of Manila in Civil Case No. 88-45660 be
as it is hereby considered WITHDRAWN" (Rollo, p. 126).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With the withdrawal of the appeal, the judgment in Civil Case No.
45560 became final and executory and was entered in the Book of Entries of
Judgment of the Court of Appeals on May 26, 1989 and <span style="">in </span>the Book of Entries of Judgment of the Regional Trial Court
on October 27, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1991, the City of Manila filed an action to annul the
franchise of private respondent with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 23,
Manila, docketed as Civil Case No. 91-58913.</p>

<p class="BODY">In said complaint, the City of Manila claimed that private
respondent had abandoned its franchise granted under Ordinance No. 7065 and
that said ordinance had been repealed by P.D. Nos. 771 and 810.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge William Bayhon of Branch 23 noted that the issue of
abandonment was squarely raised and resolved in Civil Case No. 88-45660, while
the issue of the repeal of Ordinance No. 7065 could have been pleaded but was
not by the City of Manila as a defense in Civil Case No. 88-45660.  According to him, the city had waived such a
defense.  To make matters worse, the
city was in estoppel to raise said issue since it had been issuing permits pursuant
to the decision in Civil Case No. 88-45660 and collecting the corresponding
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 91-58913, questioning the effectivity of the
franchise granted private respondent under Ordinance No. 7065, was therefore
dismissed on December 21, 1991.  No
appeal was taken from said dismissal of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The City of Manila filed with this Court another case for
declaratory judgment to nullify the franchise to operate a jai-alai under
Ordinance No. 7065 (G.R. No. 101768).  The petition was dismissed in a resolution dated October 3, 1991 "for
lack of jurisdiction."</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be of interest to note that three Manila councilors also
filed an action to compel Mayor Lopez to cancel the permit and license he
issued in favor of private petitioner pursuant to Ordinance No. 7065 (Maceda v.
Lopez, Civil Case No. 91-58930, Regional Trial Court, Branch 37, Manila).  In his answer to said petition, Mayor Lopez
pointed <span style="">out that in issuing the permit
and license, he was just acting in obedience to the final judgment in Civil
Case No. 88-45660.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Judge Enrico A. Laxamana,
presiding judge of Branch 37, made the following observations:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The license was issued by Mayor Lopez in obedience to a final
order of a court of justice.  For him to
refuse to issue the license would place him in danger of being cited in
contempt of court.  And for him now to
revoke or cancel such license or permit definitely would place a greater risk
and danger of being cited in contempt of court" (Rollo, p. 184).</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a preliminary issue,
private respondent urged the dismissal of the petition on the grounds that it
was in violation of Circular No. 28-91, prohibiting forum shopping, and Revised
Circular No. 1-88, requiring the inclusion in the petition of a verified
statement of the dates when notice of the judgment, order or resolution subject
thereof, was received, when a motion for reconsideration, if any, was filed,
and when the notice of the denial thereof was received.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent
averred that the certification submitted by petitioners did not disclose (1)
that the trial court had rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 88-­45660 on
September </span>9, 1988 <span style="">holding that
Ordinance No. 7065 was in full force and effect; (2) that said decision had
become final and executory after the petitioners withdrew their appeal
therefrom; (3) that petitioners had also </span>filed Civil Case No. 91-58913,
questioning the effectivity of Ordinance No. 7065, which was dismissed.  Likewise, they alleged that the affidavit
did not state the material dates necessary for the Court to determine the
timeliness of the filing of the petition (Rollo, pp. 108-110).</p>

<p class="BODY">The certification submitted in compliance with Circular No. 28-91
stated that the petitioner in said petition "has not commenced a similar
action in any court or administrative body against said respondents nor is
there any pending case of the same nature and parties in any court or
administrative body." Rightly, there was no case filed nor was there any
case pending wherein the question of whether the decision in Civil Case No.
88-45660 can be executed by motion is raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">The affidavit on the material dates submitted by petitioners
attested to the dates when petitioners received the three orders of respondent
judge being questioned in the petition for <i>certiorari</i>.  These are the dates material for reckoning
the timeliness of the filing of the petition to nullify said orders.  As far as the issue of the proper mode for
executing the decision is concerned, the dates given in the affidavit are
sufficient for the Court to determine whether the petition was filed within a
reasonable time contemplated in Rule 65.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no violation of Circular No. 28-­91 and
Revised Circular No. 1-88 to speak of.</p>

<p class="BODY">On their part, petitioners alleged that the decision in Civil
Case No. 88-45660, which is being implemented by the three orders in question,
is null and void for want of jurisdiction of the trial court that rendered
it.  They posited their claim on the
theory that Ordinance No. 7065 had been cancelled by P.D. No. 771 in 1975 and
that the trial court had traduced the law when it made it appear in its
decision that Ordinance No. 7065 was still in full force and effect (Rollo, pp.
10-13).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners failed to appreciate the distinction between a void
and an erroneous judgment and between jurisdiction and the exercise of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisdiction should be distinguished from the exercise thereof
(Lamagan v. De La Cruz, 40 SCRA 101 [1971]).  The authority to decide a case at all and not the decision rendered
therein, is what makes up jurisdiction.  The fact that the decision is erroneous does not divest the court that
rendered it of the jurisdiction conferred by law to try the case (Quiason,
Philippine Courts and their Jurisdictions, p. 199 [1993 ed.]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine a
particular case, or the jurisdiction over the subject matter, it does not
depend upon the regularity of the exercise by the court of its power (Century
Insurance Co. v. Fuentes, 2 SCRA 1168 [1961]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bench,
there is no question that the Regional Trial Court has the competence to hear
and decide </span>Civil Case No. 88-45660, a special civil action for <i>mandamus</i>
under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court.  There is also no quarrel that said court has jurisdiction over an action
for specific performance under Section 19(1) of the Judiciary Reorganization
Act of 1990 (Lapitan v. Scandia, 24 SCRA 479 [1968]).  Assuming <u>arguendo</u> that the Regional Trial Court did not
have jurisdiction over the said civil case, the principle of estoppel will
operate to bar petitioners from raising the question of jurisdiction for the
first time in the instant case (Ti jam v. Sibonghanay, 23 SCRA 29 [1968]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Having jurisdiction over the civil case, whatever error may be
attributed to the trial court, is simply one of judgment, not of
jurisdiction.  An error of judgment
cannot be corrected by <i>certiorari</i> but by appeal (Robles v. House of
Representatives Electoral Tribunal, 181 SCRA 780 [1990]; De Castro v. Delta
Motor Sales Corporation, 57 SCRA 344 0[1978]; Galang v. Endencia, 73 Phil. 391
[1941]).  In fact, Mayor Lopez availed
of such a remedy when he appealed the decision in Civil Case No. 88-45660 to
the Court of Appeals (CA G.R. No. 16477-SP).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue on the cancellation of Ordinance No. 7065 by President
Marcos could have been raised as a special defense in Civil Case No. 88-54660
but was not.  The Revised Rules of Court
frown at the piecemeal presentation of issues, and jurisprudence bars from
subsequent litigation between the same parties matters that could have been
raised in a previous case (Revised Rules of Court, Rule 39, Sec. 49[b];
Gonzales v. Gonzales, 26 SCRA 72 [1968]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The City of Manila should have pursued in the appellate courts
its appeal questioning the dismissal of Civil Case No. 91-58913, where the
trial court ruled that Mayor Lopez and the city could no longer claim that
Ordinance No. 7065 had been cancelled by President Marcos because they failed
to raise this issue in Civil Case No. 88-54660.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the unilateral cancellation of the franchise, which
has the status of a contract, without notice, hearing and justifiable cause is
intolerable in any system where the Rule of Law prevails (Poses v. Toledo
Transportation Co., 62 Phil. 297 [1935]; Manila Electric Co., v. Public Utility
Commissioners, 30 Phil. 387 [1915]).</p>

<p class="BODY">As a fall-back, petitioners claimed that assuming <u><span style="">arguendo</span></u><span style=""> </span>that the judgment in Civil Case No. 88-45660 dated September 9,
1986 is valid, its execution by mere motion on March 11, 1994 is
irregular.  Citing Section 6 of Rule 39
of the Revised Rules of Court, they contended that the decision must be
enforced by action, not motion (Rollo, pp. 13-14).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners erroneously counted the five-year period under
Section 6 of Rule 39 from the date of the decision.  Said Rule provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Execution by Motion or by Independent Action.  A judgment may be executed on motion within
five (5) years from the date of its entry or from the date it becomes final and
executory.  After the lapse of such time
and before it is barred by the statute of limitations, a judgment may be
enforced by action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be remembered that Mayor Lopez appealed the decision in
Civil Case No. 88-45660 to the Court of Appeals, that he filed the motion to
withdraw the appeal on February 9, 1989, and that the Court of Appeals approved
the withdrawal of the appeal only on May 5, 1989.  The entries of judgment were made on May 26, 1989 in the Court of
Appeals, and on October 27, 1992 in the Regional Trial Court.  The motion to compel the City Mayor to issue
the permit or license pursuant to Ordinance No. 7065, was filed on March 14,
1994, or well within the five-year period whether such period is counted from
May 5, 1989, May 26, 1989 or October 27, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners hypothesized that the withdrawal of an appeal
operates as if no appeal was taken at all and that the five-year period should
be counted from January 24, 1989, the fifteenth day from the service of a copy
of the decision on Mayor Lopez.  Petitioners anchored their theory on Section 9, Rule 40 and Section 2,
Rule 50 of the Revised Rules of Court (Rollo, pp. 15-16).</p>

<p class="BODY">We find nothing in said Rules to support petitioners' posture.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 9 of Rule 40, in pertinent part, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x If the appeal is withdrawn, or dismissed for failure to
prosecute, the judgment shall be deemed revived and shall forthwith be remanded
to the justice of the peace or municipal court for execution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Rule 40 governed the procedure for appeals from the inferior
courts to the Court of First Instance before they became courts of record.  A provision on the revival of the judgment was
necessary because at those times the decisions appealed from were automatically
vacated and trials <u>de</u> <u>novo</u> had to be conducted by the Court of
First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of Rule 50, which governs the dismissal <span style="">of </span>an appeal by the Court of Appeals,
in pertinent part, provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Upon the receipt of such certification [of the Clerk of Court
that the appeal has been dismissed] in the lower court the case shall stand
there as though no appeal had ever been taken, and the judgment of the said
court may be enforced with the additional costs allowed by the appellate court
upon dismissing the appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The phrase "the case shall stand there as if no appeal has
been taken" refers to the manner of how the judgment may be enforced as
can be gleaned from the phrase following it that "the judgment of said
court may be enforced with the additional costs allowed by the appellate court
xxx." In other words, the judgment shall be executed in accordance with
its original disposition, no modifications thereof having been ordered by the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, said Rule has nothing to do with the five-year period
for enforcing a judgment by motion, which is governed by Section 6 of Rule 39.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mayor Lim's vow to clean the city of vices, like gambling, is
commendable.  But in the process, he
should <span style="">bear in mind that there are
forms of gambling, and jai-alai is one them, that Congress has deigned to
allow.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The pronouncement of
Justice Isagani A. Cruz in </span><u>Mayor</u> <u>Pablo</u> <u>Magtales</u> <u>v</u><span style="">. </span><u>Pryce</u> <u>Properties</u> <u>Corporation</u>,
<span style="">G.R. No. 111097, July 20, 1994, </span><u>apropos</u>
<span style="">the operation of a gambling casino in
Cagayan de Oro by the Philippine Amusement and Games Inc., is cogent to the
instant case, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The morality of gambling is not a justiciable issue.  Gambling is not illegal <u>per</u> <u>se</u>.  While it is generally considered inimical to
the interests of the people, there is nothing in the Constitution categorically
proscribing or penalizing gambling or, for that matter, even mentioning it at
all.  It is left to Congress to deal
with the activity as it sees fit.   In
the exercise of its own discretion, the legislature may prohibit gambling
altogether or allow it without limitation or it may prohibit some forms of
gambling and allow others for whatever reasons it may consider sufficient.  Thus, it has prohibited <i><span style="">jueteng</span></i><span style=""> </span>and <i><span style="">monte</span></i><span style=""> </span>but permits lotteries, cockfighting
and horse-racing.  In making such
choices, Congress has consulted its own wisdom, which this Court has no
authority to review, much less reverse.  Well has it been said that courts do not sit to resolve the merits of <span style="">conflicting theories.  (Garcia v. Executive </span>Secretary, 204
SCRA 516, quoting Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, 8th ed., 379-380) That is
the prerogative of the political departments.  It is settled that questions regarding the wisdom, morality, or
practicability of statutes are not addressed to the judiciary but may be
resolved only by the legislative and executive departments, to which the
function belongs in our scheme of government" (Decision, p. 8).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It was Mayor Lopez
himself who assessed the benefits that will accrue to the city with the
operation of the jai?alai.  Explaining his motion to withdraw the appeal from the decision in Civil
Case No. 88-45660, he said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The beneficient effects to the appellant City of Manila,
especially during this critical period in our national economy, are manifold
and undeniable.  The franchise operation
shall be a great boost toward generating much needed revenues for the City
coffers estimated at P100,000.00 a day by way of franchise fees alone, not to
mention other municipal taxes and regulatory fees.  Millions of pesos in real estate taxes on the improvements would
be realizable.  Employment opportunities
to little less than five hundred people in the main building and hundreds of
others in the off track fronton shall also be created.  These is also the fact that the jai-alai
building, together with all the equipment therein, with an aggregate estimated
cost of P100 million shall belong to the city upon termination of the franchise
terms" (Rollo, p. 127).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considerations of equity and fair play militate against the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Mayor of the City of Manila issued on January
19, 1990, January 21, 1991 and May 25, 1992 business permits in favor of
private respondent to operate a jai-alai fronton and collected the
corresponding license and regulatory fees (Rollo, pp. 151-153; 175-177;
178-198).  Private respondent has spent

<p class="BODY">Said Rule and law refer to appeals to the Supreme Court from the
decisions of the Regional Trial Court.  Clearly, they do not involve the review of orders of the Regional Trial
Court rendered after the decision of the trial court has become final and
executory.  Such a review must be taken
under Rule 65, which can be given due course only when there is a showing of
lack or excess of jurisdiction or grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
trial court (Revised Rules of Court, Rule 67, Section 1; Planter's Products v.
Court of Appeals, 193 SCRA 563 [1991]).  We find no abuse of discretion, much less lack of or excess of
jurisdiction, on the part of respondent judge.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result.  I
wish, however, to express my view on the matter of the constitutionality of
P.D. No. 771 and on the alleged waiver of the defense of repeal of the
ordinance by P.D. No. 771.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ordinance No. 7065 of the City of Manila was enacted on 7
September 1971 pursuant to Section 18(jj) of the Revised Charter of
Manila.  It authorized the City Mayor
"to allow and permit the Associated Development Corporation to establish,
maintain and operate a jai alai in the City of Manila" under the terms and
conditions therein provided and "such other terms and conditions as he
(the Mayor) may prescribe for good reasons of general interest." The
Ordinance was vetoed by the Mayor on 27 September 1971; it was later modified
and amended by the Municipal Board on 12 October 1971.  The amended ordinance was approved by the
Mayor on 13 November 1971.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 August 1975, then President Ferdinand E. Marcos enacted
P.D. No. 771 "revoking all powers and authority of local government to
grant franchise, license or permit and regulate wagers or betting by the public
on horse and dog races, jai alai or basque pelota, and other forms of
gambling." Sections 1 and 3 thereof expressly provide:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.  Any
provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, the authority of chartered
cities and other local governments to issue license, permit or any form of
franchise to operate, maintain and establish horse and dog race tracks, jai
alai or other forms of gambling is hereby revoked.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>SECTION 3.  All existing
franchises and permits issued by local government are hereby revoked and may be
renewed only in accordance with the Decree."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 5 </span>May 1988, the
Associated Development Corporation, herein private respondent, sought to
enforce its rights under Ordinance No. 7065, but then Mayor Gemeliano C. Lopez
denied its request.  Having failed in
its motion to reconsider the denial, the private respondent filed with the
Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Manila a petition for <i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span>and
specific performance, which was docketed as Civil Case No. 88-45660 and assigned
to Branch 40 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision rendered on 9 September 1989 in the aforesaid
civil case, the trial court held that Ordinance No. 7065 created a binding
contract between the City of Manila and the private respondent and that the
City Mayor has no discretion but "to grant the necessary permit or license
allowing it to operate and maintain a jai-alai in the City of Manila pursuant
to Ordinance No. 7065." It then ordered the City of Manila to immediately
issue to the private respondent the permit/license required under Ordinance No.
7065.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal from the aforesaid decision to the Court of Appeals <span style="">(CA-G.R. No. 16477 SP) </span>having been
withdrawn, the Court of Appeals issued its Resolution of 5 May 1989 considering
the appeal as withdrawn.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1991, the City of Manila instituted Civil Case No. 91- 58913
in the RTC of Manila to annul the franchise granted to the private respondent
on the grounds that the latter had abandoned its franchise under Ordinance No.
7065 and that P.D. Nos. 771 and 810 had repealed said Ordinance No. 7065.  The court <span style="">(per Judge William Bayhon, Branch 23) </span>dismissed the case because
the issue of abandonment was squarely raised and resolved in Civil Case No.
88-45660, while the issue of repeal was not raised or pleaded therein as a
defense, hence the City was in estoppel to raise it considering further that it
has been issuing permits pursuant to the decision in said Civil Case No.
88-45660 and collecting the corresponding fees.  The City of Manila did not appeal from the dismissal order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 March 1994, the RTC issued an order in Civil Case No.
88-45660 granting the private respondent's motion to compel petitioner Mayor
Lim to issue a permit or license pursuant to Ordinance No. 7065 upon compliance
by the private respondent with all the requirements prescribed therein.  A motion to reconsider the order was denied
in the Order of 11 April 1994.  On 20
April 1994, the court reiterated the Order of 28 March 1994 and directed Mayor
Lim to immediately issue to the private respondent the necessary permit or
license pursuant to <span style="">Ordinance </span>No.
7065.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition.</p>

<p class="NUM">I.   There can be no
question that, as written, Sections 1 and 3 of P.D. No. 771 revoked the
authority of chartered cities and other local governments to issue a license,
permit, or any other form of franchise to operate, establish and maintain jai
alai, <i>etc</i>., as well as all existing franchises and permits issued <span style="">by local governments.  Indisputably, the decree affected the </span>Charter
of the City of <span style="">Manila (R.A. No. 409, as
amended).  </span>It repealed, more
specifically, paragraph (jj) of Section 18 of the said Charter on the authority
of the City of Manila to grant exclusive rights to establish, <i><span style="">inter alia</span></i><span style="">, </span>jai alai, which is the source and authority of Ordinance No.
7065.  This decree was published in the
15 September 1975 issue of the Official Gazette (71 <span style="">O.G. No. 37, p. 5946).  I </span>agree
that insofar as Ordinance No. 7065 and the franchise granted therein are
concerned, P.D. No. 771 cannot validly revoke them; otherwise, and to that
extent, the decree would be unconstitutional under the non-impairment of <span style="">contract clause </span>(Section 10, Article
III, 1987 Constitution).  <span style="">The </span>franchise is a contract solemnly
entered into between the City of Manila and the private respondent.  In all other respects, however, the said
decree is valid and binding.</p>

<p class="NUM">II.   The failure of the
City of Manila to plead as a defense the repeal of the ordinance by P.D. No.
771 is not fatal.  In the first place,
the trial court should have taken judicial notice of P.D. No. 771.  Under Section 1, Rule 129 of the Rules of
Court, courts are mandatorily required to take judicial notice of, among other
things, "the official acts of the legislative, executive and judicial
departments of the Philippines." Besides, even granting for the sake of
argument that P.D. No. 771 validly repealed Ordinance No. 7065, such repeal
could have only meant <u>lack</u> <u>of</u> <u>cause</u> <u>of</u> <u>action</u>
on the part of the private respondent in the action for <i><span style="">mandamus</span></i><span style=""> </span>to enforce the ordinance.  Failure to set up the defense of lack of cause of action in a motion to
dismiss or in the answer is not a waiver thereof.  Section 2, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"Defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to
dismiss or in the answer are deemed waived; <u>except</u> <u>the</u> <u>failure</u>
