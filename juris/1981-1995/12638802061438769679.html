<p class="BODY">This action was affirmed in a First <span class="SpellE">Indorsement</span>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Records show that the Secretary has appointed
Mr. Agustin B. <span class="SpellE">Docena</span> as <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> Member as of November 19, 1990; the
Secretary has extended another appointment to the same post in favor of Atty.
Socrates <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> on November 27, 1990; the Secretary, on
December 19, 1990, has recalled the appointment of Atty. Socrates <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> on the basis <span style="">of

where it reiterated <span style="">its </span>previous
recognition of <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> and declared that "the
recall order issued by Secretary Santos, dated December 19, 1990, recalling the
appointment of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> has no legal <span style="">basis </span>in fact and in law and issued to
fit his whimsical, capricious and wishy-washy desires to the detriment of
decency and due process of law."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, Provincial Prosecutor Dario S. Labrador had
rendered an opinion that the recall order of Secretary Santos was "void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style="">" </span>because
<span class="SpellE">Alar's</span> right to the office "had become

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Docena</span> then came to this Court in <span style="">a </span>petition <span style="">for </span><i><u><span style="">mandamus</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>to compel the respondents to recognize
and <span style="">admit </span>him as <span style="">a </span>lawfully appointed member of <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> of <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
also seeks to hold them officially and personally liable in <span style="">damages for </span><span style="">their </span>refusal to do so in spite of his clear title <span style="">to </span>the disputed office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending resolution of this case, we issued <span style="">a temporary restraining </span>order on <st1:date year="1991" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1991</st1:date>, enjoining both <span class="SpellE">Docena</span> and <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> from assuming the
office of member of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> of <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent legal provision is Section 50 of the Local
Government Code reading <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 50.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Permanent Vacancies in Local <span class="SpellE">Sanggunians</span></u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In case of <u>permanent vacancy in the <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">panlalawigan</span></u>, <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">panlungsod</span>, <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">bayan</span>, or <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>, the
President of the Philippines, upon recommendation of the Minister of Local
Government, shall appoint a qualified person to fill the vacancy in the <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">panlalawigan</span> and the <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">panlungsod</span>; the
governor, in the case of <span class="SpellE">sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">bayan</span> members; or the city or municipal mayor, in the case

the appointee shall come from the </u><u><span style="">political
</span>party of the <span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span> member who caused the
vacancy</u>, and shall serve the unexpired term of the vacant office.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner makes the point; and it has not been disputed by
the respondents, that both he and <span class="SpellE">Capito</span> ran for the
provincial board in the 1988 elections under the banner of <span class="SpellE">Lakas</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Bansa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, they both joined the <span class="SpellE">Laban</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Demokratikong</span>
Pilipino under the leadership of Speaker <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>, who
administered the oath of office to him when he was appointed to the SPES on <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1990</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Docena</span> argues that
he has a preferential right to the disputed office even on equitable grounds
because he placed ninth in the election, next to <span class="SpellE">Capito</span>,
compared to <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> who did not even run for the office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents do not challenge the qualifications of the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they contend that the
appointment in his favor on <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="11">November
 19, 1990</st1:date>, had been superseded by the appointment in favor of <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> on <st1:date year="1990" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1990</st1:date>, and that the recall of the second appointment on <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1990</st1:date>, was null and void
<span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span> for
lack of previous hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Curiously,
they do not have the same view of the recall of <span class="SpellE">Docena's</span>
appointment on <st1:date year="1991" day="20" month="2">February 20, 1991</st1:date>,
which was also issued without hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the tenor of the appointment extended to <span class="SpellE">Docena</span>
on <st1:date year="1990" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1990</st1:date>,
there is no question that it was intended to be <u>permanent</u>, to fill the
permanent vacancy caused by <span class="SpellE">Capito's</span> death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it was to be valid for the unexpired
portion of the term of the deceased member, who was entitled to serve
"until <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1992" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1992</st1:date>," in accordance
with Article XVIII, Section 2, of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said appointment had been accepted by <span class="SpellE">Docena</span>,
who had in fact already assumed office as member of the SPES, as per
certification of the Provincial Secretary.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
For all legal intents and purposes, the petitioner's appointment had already
become complete and enforceable at the time it was supposed to have been
"superseded" by the appointment in favor of <span class="SpellE">Alar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents are ambivalent about the power of the Secretary
of Local Government to recall his appointments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They described the appointment as "whimsical, capricious and
wishy-washy" but they had no similar complaints about the recall of <span class="SpellE">Docena's</span> appointment although also apparently indecisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they maintained <span style="">a </span>deep silence about this other recall
and insisted simply that the subsequent appointment of <span class="SpellE">Alar</span>
had invalidated the earlier appointment of <span class="SpellE">Docena</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that absolutely no reason was given for the recall
of <span class="SpellE">Docena's</span> appointment (or for that matter, the
recall of <span class="SpellE">Alar's</span> appointment).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that after appointing <span class="SpellE">Docena</span> and later twice sustaining his title to the office,
Secretary Santos simply had a change of heart and decided to award the position
to <span class="SpellE">Alar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not the way things are done in <span style="">a </span>democracy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Docena's</span> appointment having been issued
and accepted earlier, and the petitioner having already assumed office, he
could not thereafter be just recalled and replaced to accommodate <span class="SpellE">Alar</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appointment was permanent in nature, and for the unexpired portion of the
deceased predecessor's term.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Docena</span> had already acquired security of tenure in the
position and could be removed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> only for any
of the causes, and conformably to the procedure, prescribed by the Local
Government Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
These requirements could not be circumvented by the simple process of recalling
his appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whatever gave the SPES the impression that the questioned
appointments were revocable at will can <span style="">only
</span>be left to conjecture; what is certain is that it was not based on
careful legal study.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial
Prosecutor's opinion that the office had "become vested" in <span class="SpellE">Alar</span> suffers from the same flaw and a lack of understanding
of the nature of a public office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Political
rather than legal considerations seem to have influenced the action of the
provincial government in rejecting the petitioner's claim despite its obvious
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents also argue that the petitioner should have sought
to enforce his claimed right in a petition not for <i><u><span style="">mandamus</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>but for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">warranto</span></u></span><span style="">, </span>as his purpose is to challenge <span class="SpellE">Alar's</span> title to the disputed office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is only secondary in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The real purpose of the present petition is
to compel the respondent SPES to recognize and admit <span class="SpellE">Docena</span>
as a member of the body by virtue of a valid appointment extended to him by the
Secretary of Local Government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i><u><span style="">Mandamus</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>is employed to compel the performance
of a ministerial duty to which the petitioner is entitled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In arguing that the recognition and admission
of the petitioner is not a ministerial duty, the respondents are asserting the
discretion to review, and if they so decide, reject, the Secretary's
appointment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have no such
authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Faced with a strictly legal
question, they had no right and competence to resolve it in their
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What they should have done <span style="">was </span>reserve their judgment on the
matter, leaving it to the courts of justice to decide which of the conflicting
claims should be upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a local
legislative body subject to the general supervision of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the SPES had no discretion to rule on the validity of the decisions of the
Secretary of Local Government acting as her alter ego.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that the proper remedy is <span style="">a </span>petition for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>, </span>the
Court may in its own discretion consider the present petition as such and deal
with it accordingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find that as a
petition for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>, </span>it
complies with the prescribed requirements, to wit, that it be filed on time and
by <span style="">a </span>proper party asserting
title to the office also claimed by the respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acting thereon, we hold that <span class="SpellE">Docena</span> has proved his right to the disputed office and
could not be legally replaced by <span class="SpellE">Alar</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court will make no award of damages, there being no sufficient
proof to overcome the presumption that the respondents have acted in good faith
albeit erroneously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the
petitioner is entitled to the payment of the salaries and other benefits
appurtenant to the office of a Member of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> of <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>, from the time of his assumption of
office and until he is actually admitted or reinstated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner is DECLARED the lawfully
appointed member of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> of <st1:place>Eastern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>,
which is hereby DIRECTED to admit or reinstate him as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining order dated <st1:date year="1991" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1991</st1:date>, is LIFTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
