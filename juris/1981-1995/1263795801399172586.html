1975, plaintiffs being the owners of a parcel of land situated at Barrio San

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1984</st1:date>,

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="11">November 26,
 1984</st1:date>, the respondent-Court denied the motion to dismiss.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order reads:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Defendants through counsel filed a Second Motion to Dismiss dated
July 24, 1984 based on an affirmative defense raised in their answer, that is,
that the complaint fails to state a cause of action for rescission against
defendants because (1) - plaintiffs are not entitled to the subsidiary remedy
of rescission because of the presence of the remedy of fore­closure in the Deed
of Sale with Mortgage (Annex "A", Complaint) and (2) - assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that rescission were a proper remedy, it is
apparent from the face of the Complaint that the plaintiffs failed to comply
with the requirements of law, hence the rescission was ineffective, illegal,
null and void, and invalid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'After a careful perusal of the allegations of the complaint
considered in the light of existing applicable law and jurisprudence touching
on the matters in issue, and mindful of the settled rule that in a motion to
dismiss grounded on lack of cause of action the allegations of the complaint
must be assumed to be true, the Court finds and holds that the motion to
dismiss dated July 24, 1984 filed by defendants lacks merit and therefore
denied the same.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition was denied in a minute resolution on <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1986</st1:date> but was given due
course on <st1:date year="1986" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1986</st1:date>
on a motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court rejected the petitioners' reliance on
paragraph (H) of the contract which grants to the vendors-mortgagees the right
to foreclose "in the event of the failure of the vendees-mortgagors to
comply with any provisions of this mortgage." According to the appellate
court, this sti­pulation merely recognizes the right of the vendors <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">to </span>fore­close and realize on the
mortgage but does not preclude them from availing of other remedies under the
law, such as rescission of contract and damages under Articles 1191 and 1170 of
the Civil Code in relation to Republic Act No. 6552.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court committed reversible error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As will be explained later, Art. 1191 on
reciprocal obliga­tions is not applicable under the facts of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Art. 1383 of the Civil Code
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The action for rescission is subsidiary; it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">cannot </span>be instituted except when the
party suffering damage has no other legal means to obtain reparation for the
same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The concurring opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes in <u>Universal</u>
<u>Food</u> <u>Corp</u><i>.</i> <u>v</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>
(33 SCRA 22) was cited by the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In that case, Justice J.B.L. Reyes explained:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span class="GramE">The</span> rescission on account of breach of stipulations is not
predicated on injury to economic interests of the party plaintiff but on the
breach of faith by the defendant, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that </span>violates
the reciprocity between <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>par­ties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not a subsidiary action, and Article
1191 may be scanned without disclosing anywhere that the action for rescission <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> is subordinated to anything other than the culpa­ble
breach of his obligations by the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This rescission is a principal action retaliatory in <span class="GramE">character,</span>
it being unjust that a party be held bound to fulfill <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">his </span>promises when the other violates his.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As expressed in the old Latin aphorism:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>'Non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">servanti</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>fidem</u></span>, </span><u>non</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>est</u></span> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">fides</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>servanda</u></span>.' </span>Hence,
the reparation of damages for the breach is purely secondary.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the contrary, in the res­cission by reason of lesion or
economic prejudice, the cause of action is subordinated to the ex­istence of that
prejudice, because it is the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">raison</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><u>d</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">'<span class="SpellE">etre</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span>as well as the measure of the right to rescind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, where the defendant makes good the
damages caused, the action cannot be maintained or con­tinued, as expressly
provided in Articles 1383 and 1384.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
the operation of these two articles is limited to the cases of rescission for
lesion enumerated in Article 1381 of the Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and does not apply to cases under Article 1191.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is probable that the peti­tioner's confusion arose from
the defective technique of the new Code that terms both instances as 'rescis­sion'
without distinctions between them; unlike the previous Spanish Civil Code of
1889, that differen­tiated 'resolution' for breach of stipulations from
'rescission' by reason of lesion or damage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the terminological vagueness does not justify confusing one case
with the other, considering the patent difference in causes and results of
either action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the private respondents, the applicable law is
Article 1191 of the Civil Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The power to rescind obli­gations is implied in reciprocal
ones, in case one of the obligors should not comply with what is in­cumbent
upon him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the
rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may also seek rescission, even after he
has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The court shall decree the res­cission claimed, unless there he
just cause authorizing the fixing of a period.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This is understood to be with­out prejudice to the rights of
third persons who have acquired the thing, in accordance with articles 1385 and
1388 and the Mortgage Law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the parties entered into a contract <u>of</u>
sale as distinguished from a contract <u>to</u> sell.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the contract of sale, the vendor obligates himself to transfer
the ownership of and to deliver a determinate thing to the buyer, who in turn,
is obligated to pay a price certain in money or its equivalent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(Art. </span>1458, Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the respondents' own arguments, we note
that they have fully complied with their part of the reciprocal
obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, they
have already parted with the title as evidenced by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">trans­fer </span>certificate of title in the petitioners' name as of <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The buyer, in turn, fulfilled his end of the bargain when he
executed the deed of mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
payments on an installment basis secured by the execution of a mortgage took
the place of a cash payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, the relationship between the parties is no longer one of buyer and
seller <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">because the contract </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of sale </span>has
been perfected and consummated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is already one </span>of a mortgagor and a

the respondents, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">latter have ac­</span>cepted
the mortgage as security for <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the
obligation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The situation in this case <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

obligations created by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">mortgage </span>contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remedy of rescission is not a principal
action retaliatory in character but becomes a subsidiary one which by law is
available only in the absence of any other legal remedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 1384, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">Foreclosure here <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>not
only a remedy <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">accorded </span>by law

<p class="BODY">The petitioners have offered to pay all past due accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the lower purchasing value of the
peso in terms of prices of real estate today, the respondents are correct in
stating they have suffered losses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, they are also to blame for trusting persons who could not or
would not comply with their obligations in time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They could have foreclosed on the mortgage
immediately when it fell due instead of waiting all these years while trying to
enforce the wrong remedy.</p>
