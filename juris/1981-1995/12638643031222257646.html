<p class="BODY">This amendment of Section 8 of P.D. No. 967 eliminating the
prohibition against the sale, transfer, conveyance, and encumbrance of lands acquired
under R.A. No. 477 including the permanent improvements therein and validating
all those which had been consummated prior to July 24, 1976 has extinguished
the Government's cause of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">action </span>for
the recovery of the land from <span class="SpellE">Atencio</span> because the
