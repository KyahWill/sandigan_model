				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This refers to nine (9) consolidated cases concerning the
legality of the closure and receivership of petitioner Banco Filipino Savings
and Mortgage Bank (Banco Filipino for brevity) pursuant to the order of
respondent Monetary Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Six (6) of
these cases, namely, G.R. Nos. 68878, 77255-58, 78766, 81303, 81304 and 90473
involve the common issue of whether or not the liquidator appointed by the
respondent Central Bank (CB for brevity) has the authority to prosecute as well
as to defend suits, and to foreclose mortgages for and in behalf of the bank
while the issue on the validity of the receivership and liquidation of the
latter is pending resolution in G.R. No. 70054.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Corollary to this issue is whether the CB can be sued to fulfill
financial commitments of a closed bank pursuant to Section 29 of the Central
Bank Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the other
three (3) cases, namely, G.R. Nos. 70054, which is the main case, 78767 and
78894 all seek to annul and set aside M.B. Resolution No. 75 issued by
respondents Monetary Board and Central Bank on January 25, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of each of the nine (9) cases are as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><u>G.R. No. 68878<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">This is a motion for reconsideration, filed by respondent
Celestina Pahimuntung, of the decision promulgated by this Court on <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1986</st1:date>, granting the petition
for review on <i>certiorari</i> and reversing the questioned decision of respondent
appellate court, which annulled the writ of possession issued by the trial
court in favor of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent-movant contends that the petitioner has no more
personality to continue prosecuting the instant case considering that
petitioner bank was placed under receivership since <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1985</st1:date> by the Central Bank pursuant to
the resolution of the Monetary Board.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><u>G.R. Nos. 77255-58<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners Top Management Programs Corporation (Top Management
for brevity) and Pilar Development Corporation (Pilar Development for brevity)
are corporations engaged in the business of developing residential
subdivisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Top Management obtained a loan of P4,836,000 from Banco Filipino
as evidenced by a promissory note dated <st1:date year="1982" day="7" month="1">January
 7, 1982</st1:date> payable in three years from date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The loan was secured by real estate mortgage
in its various properties in <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, Pilar Development obtained loans
from Banco Filipino between 1982 and 1983 in the principal amounts of
P6,000,000, P7,370,000 and P5,300,000 with maturity dates on December 28, 1984,
January 5, 1985 and February 16, 1984, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To secure the loan, Pilar Development
mortgaged to Banco Filipino various properties in Dasmariñas, <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1985</st1:date>,
the Monetary Board issued a resolution finding Banco Filipino insolvent and
unable to do business without loss to its creditors and depositors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It placed Banco Filipino under receivership
of Carlota Valenzuela, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1985</st1:date>,
the Monetary Board issued another resolution placing the bank under liquidation
and designating Valenzuela as liquidator.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By virtue of her authority as liquidator, Valenzuela appointed the law
firm of Sycip, Salazar, et al. to represent Banco Filipino in all litigations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1985</st1:date>,
Banco Filipino filed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> in G.R. No. 70054
questioning the validity of the resolutions issued by the Monetary Board
authorizing the receivership and liquidation of Banco Filipino.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated August 29, 1985, this Court in G.R. No.
70054 resolved to issue a temporary restraining order, effective during the
same period of 30 days, enjoining the respondents from executing further acts
of liquidation of the bank; that acts such as receiving collectibles and
receivables or paying off creditors' claims and other transactions pertaining
to normal operations of a bank are not enjoined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Central Bank is ordered to designate a
comptroller for Banco Filipino.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Top Management failed to pay its loan on the due date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the law firm of Sycip, Salazar, et al.
acting as counsel for Banco Filipino under authority of Valenzuela as
liquidator, applied for extra-judicial foreclosure of the mortgage over Top
Management's properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
Ex-Officio Sheriff of the Regional Trial Court of Cavite issued a notice of
extra-judicial foreclosure sale of the properties on <st1:date year="1985" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1985</st1:date>,
Top Management filed a petition for injunction and prohibition with the
respondent appellate court docketed as CA-G.R. SP No. 07892 seeking to enjoin
the Regional Trial Court of Cavite, the ex-officio sheriff of said court and
Sycip, Salazar, et al. from proceeding with foreclosure sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, Pilar Development defaulted in the payment of its
loans.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law firm of Sycip, Salazar et
al. filed separate applications with the ex-officio sheriff of the Regional
Trial Court of Cavite for the extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage over its
properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, Pilar Development filed with the respondent appellate court
a petition for prohibition with prayer for the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction docketed as CA-G.R. SP Nos. 08962-64 seeking to enjoin
the same respondents from enforcing the foreclosure sale of its properties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CA-G.R. SP Nos. 07892 and 08962-64 were
consolidated and jointly decided.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1986</st1:date>,
the respondent appellate court rendered a decision dismissing the
aforementioned petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition was filed by the petitioners Top Management
and Pilar Development alleging that Carlota Valenzuela, who was appointed by
the Monetary Board as liquidator of Banco Filipino, has no authority to proceed
with the foreclosure sale of petitioners' properties on the ground that the
resolution of the issue on the validity of the closure and liquidation of Banco
Filipino is still pending with this Court in G.R. 70054.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><u>G.R. No. 78766<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner El Grande Development Corporation (El Grande for
brevity) is engaged in the business of developing residential
subdivisions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was extended by respondent
Banco Filipino a credit accommodation to finance its housing program.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioner was granted a loan in the
amount of P8,034,130.00 secured by real estate mortgages on its various estates
located in <st1:city><st1:place>Cavite</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1985</st1:date>,
the Monetary Board forbade Banco Filipino to do business, placed it under
receivership and designated Deputy Governor Carlota Valenzuela as
receiver.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1985</st1:date>, the Monetary Board confirmed
Banco Filipino's insolvency and designated the receiver Carlota Valenzuela as
liquidator.</p>

<p class="BODY">When petitioner El Grande failed to pay its indebtedness to Banco
Filipino, the latter thru its liquidator, Carlota Valenzuela, initiated the
foreclosure with the Clerk of Court and Ex-officio sheriff of RTC Cavite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, on <st1:date year="1986" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1986</st1:date>, the ex-officio sheriff issued the
notice of extra?judicial sale of the mortgaged properties of El Grande
scheduled on <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to stop the public auction sale, petitioner El Grande
filed a petition for prohibition with the Court of Appeals alleging that
respondent Carlota Valenzuela could not proceed with the foreclosure of its
mortgaged properties on the ground that this Court in G.R. No. 70054 issued a
resolution dated August 29, 1985, which restrained Carlota Valenzuela from
acting as liquidator and allowed Banco Filipino to resume banking operations
only under a Central Bank comptroller.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1987</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals rendered a decision dismissing the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> was filed alleging
that the respondent court erred when it held in its decision that although
Carlota P. Valenzuela was restrained by this Honorable Court from exercising
acts in liquidation of Banco Filipino Savings &amp; Mortgage Bank, she was not
legally precluded from foreclosing the mortgage over the properties of the
petitioner through counsel retained by her for the purpose.</p>

petitioner Pilar Development Corporation (Pilar Development for brevity) filed
an action against Banco Filipino, the Central Bank and Carlota Valenzuela for
specific performance, docketed as Civil Case No. 12191.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that the former management of
Banco Filipino appointed Quisumbing &amp; Associates as counsel for Banco
Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1986</st1:date> the said law firm filed an answer

Sycip, et al., acting for all the defendants including Banco Filipino moved
that the answer filed by Quisumbing &amp; Associates for defendant Banco
Filipino be expunged from the records.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite opposition from Quisumbing &amp; Associates, the trial court
granted the motion to expunge in an order dated <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Pilar Development moved to reconsider the order but the
motion was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Pilar Development filed with the respondent appellate
court a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> to annul the order
of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
rendered a decision dismissing the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;

petitioner filed a second supplemental complaint to which respondents filed a
motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 9, 1985, the trial court granted the motion to dismiss
the supplemental complaint on the grounds (1) that plaintiff has no contractual
relation with the defendants, and (2) that the Intermediate Appellate Court in
a previous decision in AC-G.R. SP. No. 04609 had stated that Banco Filipino has
been ordered closed and placed under receivership pending liquidation, and
thus, the continuation of the facility sued for by the plaintiff has become
legally impossible and the suit has become moot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of dismissal was appealed by the petitioner to the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1987</st1:date>, the respondent
appellate court dismissed the appeal and affirmed the order of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> was filed,

the respondents Central Bank and Carlota Valenzuela.</p>

the conservatorship over Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank." (pp.

<p class="BODY">On February 2, 1985, petitioner BF filed a complaint docketed as
Civil Case No. 9675 with the Regional Trial Court of Makati to set aside the
action of the Monetary Board placing BF under receivership.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 28, 1985, petitioner filed with this Court the
instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> under Rule 65 of the
Rules of Court seeking to annul the resolution of January 25, 1985 as made
without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion, to
order respondents to furnish petitioner with the reports of examination which
led to its closure and to afford petitioner BF a hearing prior to any
resolution that may be issued under Section 29 of R.A. 265, also known as
Central Bank Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 19, 1985, Carlota Valenzuela, as Receiver and Arnulfo
Aurellano and Ramon Tiaoqui as Deputy Receivers of Banco Filipino submitted
their report on the receivership of BF to the Monetary Board, in compliance
with the mandate of Sec. 29 of R.A. 265 which provides that the Monetary Board
shall determine within sixty (60) days from date of receivership of a bank
whether such bank may be reorganized/permitted to resume business or ordered to
be liquidated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report contained the
following recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing and considering that the condition
of the banking institution continues to be one of insolvency, i.e., its
realizable assets are insufficient to meet all its liabilities and that the
bank cannot resume business with safety to its depositors, other creditors and
the general public, it is recommended that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Banco Filipino Savings &amp; Mortgage Bank
be liquidated pursuant to paragraph 3, Sec. 29 of RA No. 265, as amended;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Legal Department, through the Solicitor
General, be authorized to file in the proper court a petition for assistance in
the liquidation of the Bank;</blockquote>

Liquidator of said Bank; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Management be instructed to inform the
stockholders of Banco Filipino Savings &amp; Mortgage Bank of the Monetary
Board's decision to liquidate the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(p. 167, <u>Rollo</u>, Vol. I)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 23, 1985, petitioner filed a motion before this Court
praying that a restraining order or a writ of preliminary injunction be issued
to enjoin respondents from causing the dismantling of BF signs in its main
office and 89 branches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
issued a resolution on August 8, 1985 ordering the issuance of the aforesaid
temporary restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 20, 1985, the case was submitted for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated August 29, 1985, this Court Resolved to
direct the respondents Monetary Board and Central Bank to hold hearings at
which the petitioner should be heard, and to terminate such hearings and submit
its resolution within thirty (30) days.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court further resolved to issue a temporary restraining order
enjoining the respondents from executing further acts of liquidation of a
bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Acts such as receiving
collectibles and receivables or paying off creditors' claims and other
transactions pertaining to normal operations of a bank were not enjoined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Central Bank was also ordered to
designate a comptroller for the petitioner BF.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court also ordered the consolidation of Civil Cases Nos. 8108, 9676
and 10183 in Branch 136 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on September 12, 1985, this Court in the meantime
suspended the hearing it ordered in its resolution of August 29, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 8, 1985, this Court submitted a resolution ordering
Branch 136 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati then presided over by Judge
Ricardo Francisco to conduct the hearing contemplated in the resolution of
August 29, 1985 in the most expeditious manner and to submit its resolution to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Court's resolution of February 19, 1987, the Court stated
that the hearing contemplated in the resolution of August 29, 1985, which is to
ascertain whether substantial administrative due process had been observed by
the respondent Monetary Board, may be expedited by Judge Manuel Cosico who now
presides the court vacated by Judge Ricardo Francisco, who was elevated to the
Court of Appeals, there being no legal impediment or justifiable reason to bar
the former from conducting such hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, this Court directed Judge Manuel Cosico to expedite the hearing
and submit his report to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 20, 1988, Judge Manuel Cosico submitted his report to
this Court with the recommendation that the resolutions of respondents Monetary
Board and Central Bank authorizing the closure and liquidation of petition BF
be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 21, 1988, petitioner BF filed an urgent motion to
reopen hearing to which respondents filed their comment on December 16,
1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed their reply to
respondent's comment of January 11, 1989.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After having deliberated on the grounds raised in the pleadings, this
Court in its resolution dated August 3, 1989 declared that its intention as
expressed in its resolution of August 29, 1985 had not been faithfully adhered
to by the herein petitioner and respondents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The aforementioned resolution had ordered a hearing on the reports that
led respondents to order petitioner's closure and its alleged pre-planned
liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court noted that
during the referral hearing however, a different scheme was followed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents merely submitted to the commissioner
their findings on the examinations conducted on petitioner, affidavits of the
private respondents relative to the findings, their reports to the Monetary
Board and several other documents in support of their position while petitioner
had merely submitted objections to the findings of respondents,
counter-affidavits of its officers and also documents to prove its claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the records disclose that both
parties had not waived cross-examination of their deponents, no such
cross-examination has been conducted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reception of evidence in the form of affidavits was followed
throughout, until the commissioner submitted his report and recommendations to
the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court also held that the
documents pertinent to the resolution of the instant petition are the Teodoro
Report, Tiaoqui Report, Valenzuela, Aurellano and Tiaoqui Report and the
supporting documents which were made as the bases by the reporters of their
conclusions contained in their respective reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court also Resolved in its resolution to
re-open the referral hearing that was terminated after Judge Cosico had
submitted his report and recommendation with the end in view of allowing
petitioner to complete its presentation of evidence and also for respondents to
adduce additional evidence, if so minded, and for both parties to conduct the
required cross-examination of witnesses/deponents, to be done within a period
of three months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To obviate all doubts
on Judge Cosico's impartiality, this Court designated a new hearing commissioner
in the person of former Judge Consuelo Santiago of the Regional Trial Court,
Makati, Branch 149 (now Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals).</p>

<p class="BODY">Three motions for intervention were filed in this case as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, in G.R. No. 70054 filed
by Eduardo Rodriguez and Fortunato M. Dizon, stockholders of petitioner bank
for and on behalf of other stockholders of petitioner; second, in G.R. No.
78894, filed by the same stockholders, and, third, again in G.R. No. 70054 by
BF Depositors’ Association and others similarly situated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, on March 1, 1990, denied the
aforesaid motions for intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 28, 1991, the hearing commissioner, Justice Consuelo
Santiago of the Court of Appeals submitted her report and recommendation (to be
hereinafter called, "Santiago Report") on the following issues stated
therein as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had the Monetary Board observed the
procedural requirements laid down in Sec. 29 of R.A. 265, as amended to justify
the closure of the Banco Filipino Savings and Mortgage Bank?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the date of BF's closure (January 25,
1985) was its condition one of insolvency or would its continuance in business
involve probable loss to its depositors or creditors?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The commissioner after evaluation of the evidence presented, found
and recommended the following:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the TEODORO and TIAOQUI reports did not
establish, in accordance with Sec. 29 of the R.A. 265, as amended, BF's
insolvency as of July 31, 1984 or that its continuance in business thereafter
would involve probable loss to its depositors or creditors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the evidence indicates that
BF was solvent on July 31, 1984 and that on January 25, 1985, the day it was
closed, its insolvency was not clearly established;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That consequently, BF s closure on January
25, 1985, not having satisfied the requirements prescribed under Sec. 29 of RA
265, as amended, was null and void;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That accordingly, by way of correction, BF
should be allowed to re-open subject to such laws, rules and regulations that
apply to its situation."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents thereafter filed a motion for leave to file
objections to the Santiago Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the same motion, respondents requested that the report and recommendation be
set for oral argument before the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On February 7, 1991, this Court denied the request for oral argument of
the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 25, 1991, respondents filed their objections to the
Santiago Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 5, 1991,
respondents submitted a motion for oral argument alleging that this Court is
confronted with two conflicting reports on the same subject, one upholding on
all points the Monetary Board's closure of petitioner, (Cosico Report dated
February 19, 1988) and the other (Santiago Report dated January 25, 1991)
holding that petitioner's closure was null and void because petitioner's
insolvency was not clearly established before its closure; and that such a
hearing on oral argument will therefore allow the parties to directly confront
the issues before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 12, 1991 petitioner filed its opposition to the motion
for oral argument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 20, 1991, it
filed its reply to respondents' objections to the Santiago Report.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 18, 1991, a hearing was held where both parties were
heard on oral argument before this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The parties, having submitted their respective memoranda, the case is
now submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><u>G.R. No. 78767<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 2, 1985, Banco Filipino filed a complaint with the
trial court docketed as Civil Case No. 9675 to annul the resolution of the
Monetary Board dated January 25, 1985, which ordered the closure of the bank
and placed it under receivership.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 14, 1985, the Central Bank and the receivers filed a
motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the receivers had not
authorized anyone to file the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
a supplemental motion to dismiss, the Central Bank cited the resolution of this
Court dated October 15, 1985 in G.R. No. 65723 entitled, "Central Bank et
al. v. Intermediate Appellate Court" whereby We held that a complaint
questioning the validity of the receivership established by the Central Bank
becomes moot and academic upon the initiation of liquidation proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the motion to dismiss was pending resolution, petitioner
herein Metropolis Development Corporation (Metropolis for brevity) filed a
motion to intervene in the aforestated civil case on ground that as a
stockholder and creditor of Banco Filipino, it has an interest in the subject
of the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1985, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss
and also denied the motion for reconsideration of the order later filed by
Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 5, 1985, the trial
court allowed the motion for intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the Central Bank and the receivers of Banco Filipino filed
a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the respondent appellate court alleging
that the trial court committed grave abuse of discretion in not dismissing
Civil Case No. 9675.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 17, 1986, the respondent appellate court rendered a
decision annulling and setting aside the questioned orders of the trial court,
and ordering the dismissal of the complaint filed by Banco Filipino with the
trial court as well as the complaint in intervention of petitioner Metropolis
Development Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition was filed by Metropolis Development
Corporation questioning the decision of the respondent appellate court.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify;"><u>G.R. No. 78894</u></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 2, 1985, a complaint was filed with the trial court
in the name of Banco Filipino to annul the resolution of the Monetary Board
dated January 25, 1985 which ordered the closure of Banco Filipino and placed
it under receivership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receivers
appointed by the Monetary Board were Carlota Valenzuela, Arnulfo Aurellano and
Ramon Tiaoqui.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 14, 1985, the Central Bank and the receivers filed a
motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the receiver had not
authorized anyone to file the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 22, 1985, the Monetary Board placed the bank under
liquidation and designated Valenzuela as liquidator and Aurellano and Tiaoqui
as deputy liquidators.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Central Bank filed a supplemental motion to dismiss which was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the latter filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the respondent appellate court to set aside
the order of the trial court denying the motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 17, 1986, the respondent appellate
court granted the petition and dismissed the complaint of Banco Filipino with
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> was filed with the
petitioner contending that a bank which has been closed and placed under
receivership by the Central Bank under Section 29 of RA 265 could file suit in
court in its name to contest such acts of the Central Bank, without the
authorization of the CB-appointed receiver.</p>

81304 and 90473 devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 29 of the Republic Act No. 265, as amended, known as the
Central Bank Act, provides that when a bank is forbidden to do business in the
Philippines and placed under receivership, <u>the</u> <u>person</u> <u>designated</u>
<u>as</u> <u>receiver</u> <u>shall</u> <u>immediately</u> <u>take</u> <u>charge</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank's</u> <u>assets</u> <u>and</u> <u>liabilities,</u>
<u>as</u> <u>expeditiously</u> <u>as</u> <u>possible,</u> <u>collect</u> <u>and</u>
<u>gather</u> <u>all</u> <u>the</u> <u>assets</u> <u>and</u> <u>administer</u> <u>the</u>
<u>same</u> <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>benefit</u> <u>of</u> <u>its</u> <u>creditors,</u>
<u>and</u> <u>represent</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank</u> <u>personally</u> <u>or</u> <u>through</u>
<u>counsel</u> <u>as</u> <u>he</u> <u>may</u> <u>retain</u> <u>in</u> <u>all</u>
<u>actions</u> <u>or</u> <u>proceedings</u> <u>for</u> <u>or</u> <u>against</u>
<u>the</u> <u>institution</u>, exercising all the powers necessary for these
purposes including, but not limited to, <u>bringing</u> <u>and</u> <u>foreclosing</u>
<u>mortgages</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>name</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Monetary Board shall later determine
and confirm that the banking institution is insolvent or cannot resume business
with safety to depositors, creditors and the general public, it shall, if
public interest requires, order its liquidation and appoint <u>a</u> <u>liquidator</u>
<u>who</u> <u>shall</u> <u>take</u> <u>over</u> <u>and</u> <u>continue</u> <u>the</u>
<u>functions</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>receiver</u> <u>previously</u> <u>appointed</u>
<u>by</u> <u>the</u> <u>Monetary</u> <u>Board</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liquidator may, in the name of the bank
and with the assistance of counsel as he may retain, <u>institute</u> <u>such</u>
<u>actions</u> <u>as</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>necessary</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u>
<u>appropriate</u> <u>court</u> <u>to</u> <u>collect</u> <u>and</u> <u>recover</u>
<u>accounts</u> <u>and</u> <u>assets</u> <u>of</u> <u>such</u> <u>institution</u>
<u>or</u> <u>defend</u> <u>any</u> <u>action</u> <u>filed</u> <u>against</u> <u>the</u>
<u>institution</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the issue on the validity of the closure and receivership of
Banco Filipino bank was raised in G.R. No. 70054, the pendency of the case did
not diminish the powers and authority of the designated liquidator to
effectuate and carry on the administration of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, when We adopted a resolution on <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1985</st1:date> and issued a
restraining order to respondents Monetary Board and Central Bank, We enjoined
merely further acts of liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
acts of liquidation, as explained in Sec. 29 of the Central Bank Act are those
which constitute the conversion of the assets of the banking institution to
money or the sale, assignment or disposition of the same to creditors and other
parties for the purpose of paying the debts of such institution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We did not prohibit however acts such as
receiving collectibles and receivables or paying off creditors' claims and <u>other</u>
<u>transactions</u> <u>pertaining</u> <u>to</u> <u>normal</u> <u>operations</u>
<u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>bank</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no doubt that the prosecution of suits for collection and the foreclosure of
mortgages against debtors of the bank by the liquidator are among the usual and
ordinary transactions pertaining to the administration of a bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did Our order in the same resolution
dated <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1985</st1:date> for
the designation by the Central Bank of a comptroller for Banco Filipino alter
the powers and functions of the liquidator insofar as the management of the
assets of the bank is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
mere duty of the comptroller is to supervise accounts and finances undertaken
by the liquidator and to determine the propriety of the latter's expenditures
incurred in behalf of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notwithstanding this, the liquidator is still empowered under the law to
continue the functions of the receiver in preserving and keeping intact the
assets of the bank in substitution of its former management, and to prevent the
dissipation of its assets to the detriment of the creditors of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These powers and functions of the liquidator
in directing the operations of the bank in place of the former management or
former officials of the bank include the retaining of counsel of his choice in
actions and proceedings for purposes of administration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, in G.R. Nos. 68878, 77255-58, 78766 and 90473, the
liquidator by himself or through counsel has the authority to bring actions for
foreclosure of mortgages executed by debtors in favor of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. 81303, the liquidator is likewise
authorized to resist or defend suits instituted against the bank by debtors and
creditors of the bank and by other private persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, in G.R. No. 81304, due to the
aforestated reasons, the Central Bank cannot be compelled to fulfill financial
transactions entered into by Banco Filipino when the operations of the latter
were suspended by reason of its closure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Central Bank possesses those powers and functions only as provided
for in Sec. 29 of the Central Bank Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">While We recognize the actual closure of Banco Filipino and the
consequent legal effects thereof, on its operations, We cannot uphold the
legality of its closure and thus, find the petitions in G.R. Nos. 70054, 78767
and 78894 impressed with merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold
that the closure and receivership of petitioner bank, which was ordered by
respondent Monetary Board on January 25, 1985, is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-recognized principle that administrative and
discretionary functions may not be interfered with by the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In general, courts have no supervising power
over the proceedings and actions of the administrative departments of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is generally true with
respect to acts involving the exercise of judgment or discretion, and findings
of fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when there is a grave abuse
of discretion which is equivalent to a capricious and whimsical exercise of
judgment or where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner,
then there is a justification for the courts to set aside the administrative
determination reached (Lim, Sr. v. Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, L­-26990, August 31, 1970, 34 SCRA 751).</p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisdiction of this Court is called upon, once again,
through these petitions, to undertake the delicate task of ascertaining whether
or not an administrative agency of the government, like the Central Bank of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> and
the Monetary Board, has committed grave abuse of discretion or has acted
without or in excess of jurisdiction in issuing the assailed order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Coupled with this task is the duty of this
Court not only to strike down acts which violate constitutional protections or
to nullify administrative decisions contrary to legal mandates but also to
prevent acts in excess of authority or jurisdiction, as well as to correct
manifest abuses of discretion committed by the officer or tribunal involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law applicable in the determination of these issues is
Section 29 of Republic Act No. 265, as amended, also known as the Central Bank
Act, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 29.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Proceedings
upon insolvency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- Whenever, upon
examination by the head of the appropriate supervising or examining department
or his examiners or agents into the condition of any bank or non-bank financial
intermediary performing quasi?banking functions, it shall be disclosed
that the condition of the same is one of insolvency, or that its continuance in
business would involve probable loss to its depositors or creditors, it shall
be the duty of the department head concerned forthwith, in writing, to inform
the Monetary Board of the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Board may, upon finding the statements of the department head to be true,
forbid the institution to do business in the Philippines and designate an
official of the Central Bank or a person of recognized competence in banking or
finance, as receiver to immediately take charge of its assets and liabilities,
as expeditiously as possible collect and gather all the assets and administer
the same for the benefits of its creditors, and represent the bank personally
or through counsel as he may retain in all actions or proceedings for or
against the institution, exercising all the powers necessary for these purposes
including, but not limited to, bringing and foreclosing mortgages in the name
of the bank or non-bank financial intermediary performing quasi-banking
functions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Monetary Board shall thereupon determine within sixty
days whether the institution may be reorganized or otherwise placed in such a
condition so that it may be permitted to resume business with safety to its
depositors and creditors and the general public and shall prescribe the
conditions under which such resumption of business shall take place as well as
the time for fulfillment of such conditions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In such case, the expenses and fees in the collection and administration
of the assets of the institution shall be determined by the Board and shall be
paid to the Central Bank out of the assets of such institution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"If the Monetary Board shall determine and confirm within the
said period that the bank or non-bank financial intermediary performing
quasi-banking functions is insolvent or cannot resume business with safety to
its depositors, creditors, and the general public, it shall, if the public
interest requires, order its liquidation, indicate the manner of its
liquidation and approve a liquidation plan which may, when warranted, involve
disposition of any or all assets in consideration for the assumption of
equivalent liabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liquidator
designated as hereunder provided shall, by the Solicitor General, file a
petition in the regional trial court reciting the proceedings which have been
taken and praying the assistance of the court in the liquidation of such
institutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court shall have
jurisdiction in the same proceedings to assist in the adjudication of the
disputed claims against the bank or non-bank financial intermediary performing
quasi-banking functions and in the enforcement of individual liabilities of the
stockholders and do all that is necessary to preserve the assets of such
institutions and to implement the liquidation plan approved by the Monetary
Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Monetary Board shall
designate an official of the Central bank or a person of recognized competence
in banking or finance, as liquidator who shall take over and continue the
functions of the receiver previously appointed by the Monetary Board under this
Section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The liquidator shall, with all
convenient speed, convert the assets of the banking institutions or non-bank
financial intermediary performing quasi-banking functions to money or sell,
assign or otherwise dispose of the same to creditors and other parties for the
purpose of paying the debts of such institution and he may, in the name of the
bank or non-bank financial intermediary performing quasi-banking functions and
with the assistance of counsel as he may retain, institute such actions as may
be necessary in the appropriate court to collect and recover accounts and
assets of such institution or defend any action filed against the
institution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, However, That

<p class="BODY">Based on the aforequoted provision, the Monetary Board may order
the cessation of operations of a bank in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and place it under receivership upon a finding of insolvency or when its

<p class="BODY">Specifically, the basic question to be resolved in G.R. Nos.
70054, 78767 and 78894 is whether or not the Central Bank and the Monetary
Board acted arbitrarily and in bad faith in finding and thereafter concluding
that petitioner bank is insolvent, and in ordering its closure on <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As We have stated in Our resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1989</st1:date>, the documents pertinent to the
resolution of these petitions are the Teodoro Report, Tiaoqui Report, and the
Valenzuela, Aurellano and Tiaoqui Report and the supporting documents made as
bases by the supporters of their conclusions contained in their respective
reports.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We will focus Our study and
discussion however on the Tiaoqui Report and the Valenzuela, Aurellano and
Tiaoqui Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The former recommended
the closure and receivership of petitioner bank while the latter report made
the recommendation to eventually place the petitioner bank under liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court shall likewise take into consideration
the findings contained in the reports of the two commissioners who were
appointed by this Court to hold the referral hearings, namely the report by
Judge Manuel Cosico submitted February 20, 1988 and the report submitted by
Justice Consuelo Santiago on January 28, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that under Section 29 of the Central Bank
Act, the following are the mandatory requirements to be complied with before a
bank found to be insolvent is ordered closed and forbidden to do business in
the Philippines:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, an examination
shall be conducted by the head of the appropriate supervising or examining
department or his examiners or agents into the condition of the bank; secondly,
it shall be disclosed in the examination that the condition of the bank is one
of insolvency, or that its continuance in business would involve probable loss
to its depositors or creditors; thirdly, the department head concerned shall
inform the Monetary Board in writing, of the facts; and lastly, the Monetary
Board shall find the statements of the department head to be true.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first requirement, the Tiaoqui report, submitted on <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1985</st1:date>, revealed that the
finding of insolvency of petitioner was based on the partial list of exceptions
and findings on the regular examination of the bank as of <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1984</st1:date> conducted by the Supervision and
Examination Sector II of the Central Bank (p. 1, Tiaoqui Report).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1984</st1:date>,
this list of exceptions and findings was submitted to the petitioner bank (p.
6, Tiaoqui Report).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was attached to
the letter dated December 17, 1984, of examiner-in-charge Dionisio Domingo of
SES Department II of the Central Bank to Teodoro Arcenas, president of
petitioner bank, which disclosed that the examination of the petitioner bank as
to its financial condition as of July 31, 1984 was not yet completed or
finished on December 17, 1984 when the Central Bank submitted the partial list
of findings of examination to the petitioner bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter reads:</p>

<blockquote>"In connection with the regular examination of your
institution as of <st1:date year="1984" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1984</st1:date>,

<u>assets</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These shall be submitted
to you in due time" (p. 810, <u>Rollo</u>, Vol. III; emphasis ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is worthy to note that a conference was held on <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1985</st1:date> at the Central Bank
between the officials of the latter and of petitioner bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What transpired and what was agreed upon
during the conference was explained in the Tiaoqui report.</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The discussion centered on the substantial exposure of
the bank to the various entities which would have a relationship with the bank;
the manner by which some bank funds were made indirectly available to several
entities within the group; and the unhealthy financial status of these firms in
which the bank was additionally exposed through new funds or refinancing
accommodation including accrued interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Queried in the impact of these clean loans, on the bank
solvency, Mr. Dizon (BF Executive Vice President) intimated that, collectively,
these corporations have large undeveloped real estate properties in the suburbs
which can be made answerable for the unsecured loans as well as the Central
Bank's credit accommodations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A</u> <u>formal</u>
<u>reply</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank</u> <u>would</u> <u>still</u> <u>be</u>
<u>forthcoming</u>." (pp. 58-59, <u>Rollo</u>, Vol. I; emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, Tiaoqui based his report on an incomplete examination of
petitioner bank and outrightly concluded therein that the latter's financial
status was one of insolvency or illiquidity.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He arrived at the said conclusion from the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that as of July, 31, 1984, total capital
accounts consisting of paid-in capital and other capital accounts such as
surplus, surplus reserves and undivided profits aggregated P351.8 million; that
capital adjustments, however, wiped out the capital accounts and placed the
bank with a capital deficiency amounting to P334.956 million; that the biggest
adjustment which contributed to the deficit is the provision for estimated
losses on accounts classified as doubtful and loss which was computed at P600.4
million pursuant to the examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This provision is also known as valuation reserves which was set up or
deducted against the capital accounts of the bank in arriving at the latter's
financial condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tiaoqui however admits the insufficiency and unreliability of the
findings of the examiner as to the setting up of recommended valuation reserves
from the assets of petitioner bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
stated:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>The</u> <u>recommended</u> <u>valuation</u> <u>reserves</u>
<u>as</u> <u>bases</u> <u>for</u> <u>determining</u> <u>the</u> <u>financial</u>
<u>status</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank</u> <u>would</u> <u>need</u> <u>to</u>
<u>be</u> <u>discussed</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank</u>, <u>consistent</u>
<u>with</u> <u>standard</u> <u>examination</u> <u>procedure</u>, <u>for</u> <u>which</u>
<u>the</u> <u>bank</u> <u>would</u> <u>in</u> <u>turn</u> <u>reply</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Also,</u> <u>the</u> <u>examination</u> <u>has</u>
<u>not</u> <u>been</u> <u>officially</u> <u>terminated</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(p. 7, Tiaoqui report; p. 59, <u>Rollo</u>,
Vol. I)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony in the second referral hearing before Justice
Santiago, Tiaoqui testified that on January 21, 1985, he met with officers of
petitioner bank to discuss the advanced findings and exceptions made by Mr.
Dionisio Domingo which covered 70%-80% of the bank's loan portfolio; that at
that meeting, Fortunato Dizon (BF's Executive Vice President) said that as
regards the unsecured loans granted to various corporations, said corporations
had large undeveloped real estate properties which could be answerable for the
said unsecured loans and that a reply from BF was forthcoming; that he
(Tiaoqui) however prepared his report despite the absence of such reply; that
he believed, as in fact it is stated in his report, that despite the meeting on
January 21, 1985, there was still a need to discuss the recommended valuation
reserves of petitioner bank and; that he however, did not wait anymore for a
discussion of the recommended valuation reserves and instead prepared his
report two days after January 21, 1985 (pp. 3313-3314, <u>Rollo</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Records further show that the examination of petitioner bank was
officially terminated only when Central Bank Examiner-in-charge Dionisio
Domingo submitted his final report of examination on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident from the foregoing circumstances that the
examination contemplated in Sec. 29 of the CB Act as a mandatory requirement
was not completely and fully complied with.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite the existence of the partial list of findings in the examination
of the bank, there were still highly significant items to be weighed and
determined such as the matter of valuation reserves, before these can be
considered in the financial condition of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be a drastic move to conclude
prematurely that a bank is insolvent if the basis for such conclusion is
lacking and insufficient, especially if doubt exists as to whether such bases
or findings faithfully represent the real financial status of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The actuation of the Monetary Board in closing petitioner bank on
<st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1985</st1:date> barely
four days after a conference with the latter on the examiners' partial findings
on its financial position is also violative of what was provided in the CB
Manual of Examination Procedures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
manual provides that only after the examination is concluded, should a
pre-closing conference led by the examiner-in-charge be held with the
officers/representatives of the institution on the findings/exception, and a
copy of the summary of the findings/violations should be furnished the
institution examined so that corrective action may be taken by them as soon as
possible (Manual of Examination Procedures, General Instruction, p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to understand how a period of four
days after the conference could be a reasonable opportunity for a bank to
undertake a responsive and corrective action on the partial list of findings of
the examiner-in-charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">We recognize the fact that it is the responsibility of the
Central Bank of the Philippines to administer the monetary, banking and credit
system of the country and that its powers and functions shall be exercised by
the Monetary Board pursuant to Rep. Act. No. 265, known as the Central Bank
Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the power and
authority of the Monetary Board to close banks and liquidate them thereafter
when public interest so requires is an exercise of the police power of the
state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Police power, however, may not be
done arbitrarily or unreasonably and could be set aside if it is either
capricious, discriminatory, whimsical, arbitrary, unjust or is tantamount to a
denial of due process and equal protection clauses of the Constitution (Central
Bank v. Court of Appeals, Nos. L-50031-32, <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1981</st1:date>, 106 SCRA 143).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the basic standards of substantial due
process were not observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Time and
again, We have held in several cases, that the procedure of administrative
tribunals must satisfy the fundamentals of fair play and that their judgment
should express a well-supported conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the celebrated case of Ang Tibay v. Court of Industrial
Relations, 69 Phil. 635, this Court laid down several cardinal primary rights
which must be respected in a proceeding before an administrative body.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, as to the requirement of notice and hearing, Sec. 29 of
RA 265 does not require a previous hearing before the Monetary Board implements
the closure of a bank, since its action is subject to judicial scrutiny as
provided for under the same law (Rural Bank of Bato v. IAC, G.R. No. 65642,
October 15, 1984, Rural Bank v. Court of Appeals, G.R. 61689, June 20, 1988,
162 SCRA 288).</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the foregoing, administrative due process does
not mean that the other important principles may be dispensed with,
namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the decision of the
administrative body must have something to support itself and the evidence must
be substantial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Substantial evidence is
more than a mere scintilla.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It means
such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support
a conclusion (Ang Tibay v. CIR, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, where the decision is merely based upon pieces of documentary
evidence that are not sufficiently substantial and probative for the purpose
and conclusion they are presented, the standard of fairness mandated in the due
process clause is not met.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
at bar, the conclusion arrived at by the respondent Board that the petitioner
bank is in an illiquid financial position on January 23, 1985, as to justify
its closure on January 25, 1985 cannot be given weight and finality as the
report itself admits the inadequacy of its basis to support its conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second requirement provided in Section 29, R.A. 265 before a
bank may be closed is that the examination should disclose that the condition
of the bank is one of insolvency.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the concept of whether the bank is solvent or not, the
respondents contend that under the Central Bank Manual of Examination
Procedures, Central Bank examiners must recommend valuation reserves, when
warranted, to be set up or deducted against the corresponding asset account to
determine the bank's true condition or net worth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of loan accounts, to which
practically all the questioned valuation reserves refer, the manual provides
that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For doubtful loans, or loans the ultimate
collection of which is doubtful and in which a substantial loss is probable but
not yet definitely ascertainable as to extent, valuation reserves of fifty per
cent (50%) of the accounts should be recommended to be set up.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For loans classified as loss, or loans
regarded by the examiner as absolutely uncollectible or worthless, valuation
reserves of one hundred percent (100%) of the accounts should be recommended to
be set up (p. 8, Objections to Santiago report).</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing criteria used by respondents in determining the
financial condition of the bank is based on Section 5 of RA 337, known as the
General Banking Act which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The following
terms shall be held to be synonymous and interchangeable:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>f.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘Unimpaired Capital and Surplus,’ 'Combined
capital accounts,' and 'Net worth,' which terms shall mean for the purposes of
this Act, the total of the 'unimpaired paid-in capital, surplus, and undivided
profits net of such valuation reserves as may be required by the Central
Bank."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that the Central Bank Act vests authority upon
the Central Bank and Monetary Board to take charge and administer the monetary
and banking system of the country and this authority includes the power to
examine and determine the financial condition of banks for purposes provided
for by law, such as for the purpose of closure on the ground of insolvency
stated in Section 29 of the Central Bank Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But express grants of power to public officers should be subjected to a
strict interpretation, and will be construed as conferring those powers which
are expressly imposed or necessarily implied (Floyd Mechem, Treatise on the Law
of Public Offices and Officers, p. 335).</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, there can be no clearer explanation of the concept
of insolvency than what the law itself states.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sec. 29 of the Central Bank Act provides that insolvency under the Act,
shall be understood to mean that "<u>the</u> <u>realizable</u> <u>assets</u>
<u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>bank</u> or a non-bank financial intermediary performing
quasi-banking functions as determined by the Central Bank <u>are</u> <u>insufficient</u>
<u>to</u> <u>meet</u> <u>its</u> <u>liabilities</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the contention of the Central Bank that a bank's true
financial condition is synonymous with the terms "unimpaired capital and
surplus," "combined capital accounts" and net worth after
deducting valuation reserves from the capital, surplus and unretained earnings,
citing Sec. 5 of RA 337 is misplaced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, it is clear from the law that a solvent bank is one in
which its assets exceed its liabilities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is a basic accounting principle that assets are composed of
liabilities and capital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term
"assets" includes capital and surplus" (Exley v. Harris, 267 p.
970, 973, 126 Kan., 302).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the term "capital" includes common and preferred stock, surplus
reserves, surplus and undivided profits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Manual of Examination Procedures, Report of Examination on Department
of Commercial and Savings Banks, p. 3-C).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If valuation reserves would be deducted from these items, the result
would merely be the networth or the unimpaired capital and surplus of the bank
applying Sec. 5 of RA 337 but not the total financial condition of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the statement of assets and liabilities is used in
balance sheets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Banks use statements of
condition to reflect the amounts, nature and changes in the assets and
liabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Central Bank Manual of
Examination Procedures provides a format or checklist of a statement of
condition to be used by examiners as guide in the examination of banks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The format enumerates the items which will
compose the assets and liabilities of a bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assets include cash and those due from banks, loans, discounts and
advances, fixed assets and other property owned or acquired and other
miscellaneous assets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount of
loans, discounts and advances to be stated in the statement of condition as
provided for in the manual is computed after deducting valuation reserves when
deemed necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
liabilities are composed of demand deposits, time and savings deposits,
cashier's, manager's and certified checks, borrowings, due to head office,
branches and agencies, other liabilities and deferred credits (Manual of
Examination Procedure, p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
amounts stated in the balance sheets or statements of condition including the
computation of valuation reserves when justified, are based however, on the
assumption that the bank or company will continue in business indefinitely, and
therefore, the networth shown in the statement is in no sense an indication of
the amount that might be realized if the bank or company were to be liquidated
immediately (Prentice Hall Encyclopedic Dictionary of Business Finance, p.
48).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, based on respondents'
submissions, the allowance for probable losses on loans and discounts
represents the <u>amount</u> <u>set</u> <u>up</u> <u>against</u> <u>current</u>
<u>operations</u> to provide for possible losses arising from non-collection of
loans and advances, and this account is also referred to as valuation reserve
(p. 9, Objections to Santiago report).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, the statement of condition which contains a provision for
recommended valuation reserves should not be used as the ultimate basis to
determine the solvency of an institution for the purpose of termination of its
operations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents acknowledge that under the said CB manual, CB
examiners must recommend valuation reserves, <u>when</u> <u>warranted</u>, to
be set up against the corresponding asset account (p. 8, Objections to Santiago
report).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tiaoqui himself, as author of
the report recommending the closure of petitioner bank admits that the
valuation reserves should still be discussed with the petitioner bank in
compliance with standard examination procedure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, for the Monetary Board to unilaterally deduct an uncertain amount
as valuation reserves from the assets of a bank and to conclude therefrom
without sufficient basis that the bank is insolvent, would be totally unjust
and unfair.</p>

<p class="BODY">The test of insolvency laid down in Section 29 of the Central
Bank Act is measured by determining whether the realizable assets of a bank are
less than its liabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, a bank
is solvent if the fair cash value of all its assets, realizable within a
reasonable time by a reasonable prudent person, would equal or exceed its total
liabilities exclusive of stock liability; but if such fair cash value so
realizable is not sufficient to pay such liabilities within a reasonable time,
the bank is insolvent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Gillian v.
State, 194 N.E. 360, 363, 207 Ind. 661).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated in other words, the insolvency of a bank occurs when the actual
cash market value of its assets is insufficient to pay its liabilities, not
considering capital stock and surplus which are not liabilities for such
purpose (Exley v. Harris, 267 p. 970, 973, 126 Kan. 302; Alexander v.
Llewellyn, Mo. App., 70 S.W. 2n 115, 117).</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at the computation of realizable assets of petitioner
bank, respondents used its books which undoubtedly are not reflective of the
actual cash or fair market value of its assets.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not the proper procedure contemplated in Sec. 29 of the Central
Bank Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the CB Manual of
Examination Procedures does not confine examination of a bank solely with the
determination of the books of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The latter is part of auditing which should not be confused with
examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Examination appraises the <u>soundness</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>institution's</u> <u>assets,</u> <u>the</u> <u>quality</u>
<u>and</u> <u>character</u> <u>of</u> <u>management</u> <u>and</u> <u>determines</u>
<u>the</u> <u>institution's</u> <u>compliance</u> <u>with</u> <u>laws,</u> <u>rules</u>
<u>and</u> <u>regulations</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Audit is
a detailed inspection of the institution's books, accounts, vouchers, ledgers,
etc. to determine the recording of all assets and liabilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, examination concerns itself with
review and appraisal, while audit concerns itself with verification (CB Manual
of Examination Procedures, General Instructions, p. 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court however, is not in the position to
determine how much cash or market value shall be assigned to each of the assets
and liabilities of the bank to determine their total realizable value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proper determination of these matters by
using the actual cash value criteria belongs to the field of fact-finding
expertise of the Central Bank and the Monetary Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the fact that the figures
arrived at by the respondent Board as to assets and liabilities do not truly
indicate their realizable value as they were merely based on book value, We
will however, take a look at the figures presented by the Tiaoqui Report in
concluding insolvency as of July 31, 1984 and at the figures presented by the
CB authorized deputy receiver and by the Valenzuela, Aurellano and Tiaoqui
Report which recommended the liquidation of the bank by reason of insolvency as
of January 25, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Tiaoqui report dated January 23, 1985, which was based on
partial examination findings on the bank's condition as of July 31, 1984,
states that total liabilities of P5,282.1 million exceeds total assets of
P4,947.2 million after deducting from the assets valuation reserves of P612.2
million.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since, as We have explained in
our previous discussion that valuation reserves can not be legally deducted as
there was no truthful and complete evaluation thereof as admitted by the
Tiaoqui report itself, then an adjustment of the figures will show that the
liabilities of P5,282.1 million will not exceed the total assets which will
amount to P5,559.4 if the 612.2 million allotted to valuation reserves will not
be deducted from the assets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can
be no basis therefore for both the conclusion of insolvency and for the decision
of the respondent Board to close petitioner bank and place it under
receivership.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the financial position of the bank as of January 25,
1985, the date of the closure of the bank, the consolidated statement of
condition thereof as of the aforesaid date shown in the Valenzuela, Aurellano
and Tiaoqui report on the receivership of petitioner bank, dated March 19,
1985, indicates that total liabilities of 4,540.84 million does not exceed the
total assets of 4,981.53 million.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the consolidated statement of condition of petitioner bank as
of January 25, 1985 prepared by the Central Bank Authorized Deputy Receiver
Artemio Cruz shows that total assets amounting to P4,981,522,996.22 even
exceeds total liabilities amounting to P4,540,836,834.15.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing, there was no valid
reason for the Valenzuela, Aurellano and Tiaoqui report to finally recommend
the liquidation of petitioner bank instead of its rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We take note of the exhaustive study and findings of the Cosico
report on the petitioner bank’s having engaged in unsafe, unsound and
fraudulent banking practices by the granting of huge unsecured loans to several
subsidiaries and related companies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
do not see, however, that this has any material bearing on the validity of the
closure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 34 of the RA 265,
Central Bank Act empowers the Monetary Board to take action under Section 29 of
the Central Bank Act when a bank "persists in carrying on its business in
an unlawful or unsafe manner." There was no showing whatsoever that the
bank had persisted in committing unlawful banking practices and that the
respondent Board had attempted to take effective action on the bank's alleged
activities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the period from <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1984</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1985</st1:date>, when petitioner bank
was under conservatorship no official of the bank was ever prosecuted,
suspended or removed for any participation in unsafe and unsound banking
practices, and neither was the entire management of the bank replaced or
substituted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in her testimony
during the second referral hearing, Carlota Valenzuela, CB Deputy Governor,
testified that the reason for petitioner bank's closure was not unsound, unsafe
and fraudulent banking practices but the alleged insolvency position of the
bank (TSN, August 3, 1990, p. 3315, <u>Rollo</u>, Vol. VIII).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, another circumstance which point to the solvency of
petitioner bank is the granting by the Monetary Board in favor of the former a
credit line in the amount of P3 billion along with the placing of petitioner
bank under conservatorship by virtue of M.B. Resolution No. 955 dated July 27,
1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This payed the way for the
reopening of the bank on August 1, 1984 after a self-imposed bank holiday on
July 23, 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">On emergency loans and advances, Section 90 of RA 265 provides
two types of emergency loans that can be granted by the Central Bank to a
financially distressed bank:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 90.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In</u> <u>periods</u> <u>of</u> <u>emergency</u>
<u>or</u> <u>of</u> <u>imminent</u> <u>financial</u> <u>panic</u> which
directly threaten monetary and banking stability, the Central Bank may grant
banking institutions extraordinary advances secured by any assets which are
defined as acceptable security by a concurrent vote of at least five members of
the Monetary Board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While such advances
are outstanding, the debtor institution may not expand the total volume of its
loans or investments without the prior authorization of the Monetary
Board."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Central Bank may, at its discretion, <u>likewise</u> <u>grant</u>
<u>advances</u> <u>to</u> <u>banking</u> <u>institutions</u>, even during
normal periods, <u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>purpose</u> <u>of</u> <u>assisting</u>
<u>a</u> <u>bank</u> <u>in</u> <u>a</u> <u>precarious</u> <u>financial</u> <u>condition</u>
<u>or</u> <u>under</u> <u>serious</u> <u>financial</u> <u>pressures</u> brought
about by unforseen events, or events which, though forseeable, could not be
prevented by the bank concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, however, <u>That</u> <u>the</u> <u>Monetary</u> <u>Board</u> <u>has</u>
<u>ascertained</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>bank</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>insolvent</u>
and has clearly realizable assets to secure the advances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, further, That a concurrent vote of
at least five members of the Monetary Board is obtained." (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first paragraph of the aforequoted provision contemplates a
situation where the whole banking community is confronted with financial and
economic crisis giving rise to serious and widespread confusion among the
public, which may eventually threaten and gravely prejudice the stability of
the banking system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the emergency
or financial confusion involves the whole banking community and not one bank or
institution only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second situation
on the other hand, provides for a situation where the Central Bank grants a
loan to a bank with uncertain financial condition but not insolvent.</p>

<p class="BODY">As alleged by the respondents, the following are the reasons of
the Central Bank in approving the resolution granting the P3 billion loan to
petitioner bank and the latter's reopening after a brief self-imposed banking
holiday:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, <u>the</u> <u>closure</u> <u>by</u> <u>Banco</u> <u>Filipino</u>
<u>Savings</u> <u>and</u> <u>Mortgage</u> <u>Bank</u> of its Banking offices <u>on</u>
<u>its</u> <u>own</u> <u>initiative</u> <u>has</u> <u>worked</u> <u>serious</u>
<u>hardships</u> <u>on</u> <u>its</u> <u>depositors</u> and has affected
confidence levels in the banking system resulting in a feeling of apprehension
among depositors and unnecessary deposit withdrawals;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the Central Bank is charged with the function of
administering the banking system;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS,<span style=""> </span>the reopening
of Banco Filipino would require additional credit resources from the Central
Bank as well as an independent management acceptable to the Central Bank;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, it is the desire of the Central Bank to rapidly
diffuse the uncertainty that presently exists;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x." (M.B. Min. No. 35 dated July 27, 1984 cited in
Respondents' Objections to Santiago Report, p. 26; p. 3387, <u>Rollo</u>, Vol.
IX; Emphasis ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the foregoing "Whereas" clauses
unmistakably show that the clear reason for the decision to grant the emergency
loan to petitioner bank was that the latter was suffering from financial
distress and severe bank "run" as a result of which it closed on July
23, 1984 and that the release of the said amount is in accordance with the
Central Bank's full support to meet Banco Filipino's depositors' withdrawal
requirements (Excerpts of minutes of meeting on MB Min. No. 35, p. 25, <u>Rollo</u>,
Vol. IX).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nothing therein shows an
extraordinary emergency situation exists affecting most banks, not only as
regards petitioner bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court
thereby finds that the grant of the said emergency loan was intended from the
beginning to fall under the second paragraph of Section 90 of the Central Bank
Act, which could not have occurred if the petitioner bank was not solvent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where notwithstanding knowledge of the
irregularities and unsafe banking practices allegedly committed by the
petitioner bank, the Central Bank even granted financial support to the latter
and placed it under conservatorship, such actuation means that petitioner bank
could still be saved from its financial distress by adequate aid and management
reform, which was required by Central Bank's duty to maintain the stability of
the banking system and the preservation of public confidence in it (Ramos v.
Central Bank, No. L-29352, <st1:date year="1971" day="4" month="10">October 4,
 1971</st1:date>, 41 SCRA 565).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing premises, We believe that the closure of
the petitioner bank was arbitrary and committed with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting <u>in</u> <u>gratia</u>
<u>argumenti</u> that the closure was based on justified grounds to protect the
public, the fact that petitioner bank was suffering from serious financial
problems should not automatically lead to its liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 29 of the Central Bank provides that
a closed bank may be reorganized or otherwise placed in such a condition that
it may be permitted to resume business with safety to its depositors, creditors
and the general public.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are aware of the Central Bank's concern for the safety of
Banco Filipino's depositors as well as its creditors including itself which had
granted substantial financial assistance up to the time of the latter's
closure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there are alternatives to
permanent closure and liquidation to safeguard those interests as well as those
of the general public for the failure of Banco Filipino or any bank for that
matter may be viewed as an irreversible decline of the country's entire banking
system and ultimately, it may reflect on the Central Bank's own viability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, the Central Bank and the
Monetary Board should exercise strict supervision over Banco Filipino.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should take all the necessary steps not
violative of the laws that will fully secure the repayment of the total
financial assistance that the Central Bank had already granted or would grant
in the future.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, decision is hereby rendered as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Dissenting Opinion</span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">MELENCIO-HERRERA, <i>J.</i><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I join Mme. Justice Carolina G. Aquino in her dissent and vote to
deny the prayer, in G.R. No. 70054, to annul Monetary Board Resolution No. 75
placing Banco Filipino (BF) under receivership.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that the BF <span style="">was
</span>not, as alleged, in a literal state of insolvency at the time of the
passage of said Resolution, there was a finding in the Teodoro report that,
based on that Bank’s illiquidity, to have allowed it to continue in operation
would have meant probable loss to depositors and creditors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That <span style="">is
</span>also a ground for placing the bank under receivership, as a first step,
pursuant to Section 29 of the Central Bank Act (Rep. Act No. 265, as
amended).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The closure of BF, therefore,
can not be said to have been arbitrary or made in bad faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was sufficient justification,
considering its inability to meet the heavy withdrawals by its depositors and
to pay its liabilities as they fell due, to forbid the bank from further
engaging in banking.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter of reopening, reorganization or rehabilitation of BF
is not within the competence of this Court to ordain but is better addressed to
the Monetary Board and the Central Bank considering the latter’s enormous
infusion of capital into BF to the tune of approximately P3.5 Billion in total
accommodations, after a thorough assessment of whether or not BF is, indeed, <span style="">possessed, as </span>it stoutly contends, of
sufficient assets and capabilities with which to repay such huge indebtedness,
and can operate without loss to <span style="">its </span>many
depositors and creditors.</p>
