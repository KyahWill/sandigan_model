Elsie Bagista from the decision dated September 26, 1988 of the Regional Trial
Court of La Trinidad, Benguet, Branch 10, finding her guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of violating Section 4, Article II of Republic Act No. 6425, and
sentencing her to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and to pay <span style="">a </span><span style="">fine</span><span style=""> of</span><span style=""> </span>P20,000.00, with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency,
and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:  On July <span style="">4, </span>1988,
at around 8:00 o'clock in the morning, the Narcotics Command (NARCOM)
Detachment Office located at the Arix Building, Bokawkan Road, Baguio City,
received information from one of its regular informants that a certain woman,
23 years of age, with naturally curly hair, and with a height of 5'2" or
5'3", would be transporting marijuana from up north.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Acting upon this piece of information, Sgt. Oscar Parajas testified that he,
Sgt. Godofredo Fider and a civilian NARCOM agent proceeded to Km. 16, Acop,
Tublay, Benguet.  Upon arriving at said
location at around 11:00 o'clock that same morning, they established a
checkpoint and flagged down all vehicles, both private and public, coming from
the north to check if any of these vehicles were carrying marijuana leaves on
board.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After about 4 1/2 hours, the NARCOM agents stopped a Dangwa
Tranco bus with Plate No. AVD 938 and body number 428, which came from Lepanto,
Benguet.  Sgts. Parajas and Fider
boarded the bus and thereupon Sgt. Parajas announced to the passengers that
they were NARCOM agents and that they were going to search their baggages.  Sgt. Parajas then proceeded to the rear of
the bus while Sgt. Fider began inspecting the bags in the front.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While at the back, Sgt. Parajas noticed a woman with curly hair
seated at the right side (as one is facing the driver) of the last seat of the
bus, with a travelling bag with black and orange stripes<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> on
her lap.  Sgt. Parajas inspected the bag
and discovered three (3) bundles of marijuana leaves covered by assorted
clothing.  The bag and the contents
thereof were confiscated and the woman arrested; she was later brought to the
NARCOM office in Baguio City where she was booked and investigated.  The woman was then identified as
accused-appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The confiscated bundles were subjected to laboratory examination, and found
positive for marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's defense rests solely on denial.  She claimed that she was engaged in the
buying and selling of vegetables, particularly cabbages.  On the day in question, she boarded the
Dangwa Tranco bus at Abatan, Benguet, bringing with her ten (10) sacks of
cabbages which she intended to sell to a certain Maria Opino in Baguio
City.  While inside the bus, she
approached the conductor for her ticket to cover the fare for her sacks of
cabbages, but was told by the latter that he would attend to her later.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the <span style="">bus </span>reached
Tublay, Benguet, it was stopped by the NARCOM agents who boarded the same and
began inspecting the baggages of the passengers.  Accused-appellant claimed that the bag containing the marijuana
was taken from the luggage carrier above the passenger seats.  When nobody admitted owning the bag, the
NARCOM agent approached her, took the shoulder bag on her lap, and asked her to
come with them for investigation as she fits the description of the would-be
transporter of the marijuana given by the NARCOM informer.  She denied having anything to do with the
marijuana found on the bus.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To corroborate her story, accused-appellant presented the
conductor <span style="">of </span>the Dangwa Tranco
bus, Nestor Yangkin.  He testified that
when the NARCOM agents boarded the bus at Tublay, Benguet, one of them got a
bag from the luggage carrier, opened it, and smelled the contents.  The agent then asked the passengers who
among them owned the bag; when nobody answered, he walked to the back of the
bus, all the time looking at the faces of the passengers.  When the agent approached accused-appellant,
who was seated at the rear of the bus, the former talked to her, then escorted
her out of the bus.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During Yangkin's cross-examination, it came out that the 10 sacks
of vegetables that were loaded at Abatan were brought by a man who told him
that the fare for the sacks will be paid upon arrival at the Dangwa Station in
Baguio City but that the owner of the sacks would be riding in the bus.  And yet, Yangkin did not seek out the
alleged owner of the sacks.  The witness
also testified that none of the passengers approached him and offered to <span style="">pay </span>for the fare of the sacks,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
contrary to accused-appellant's testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">In convicting accused-appellant, the trial court found the<span style=""> testimony </span>of Sgt. Parajas
credible.  Said the court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style="">:</span></p>

<blockquote>“. . . The testimony of Sgt. Oscar Parajas
was direct and straightforward as he gave all the requisite details of the
entrapment operation they conducted based on an information provided by a
coordinating individual.  His testimony
reveals that the bag containing the marijuana leaves was found on the lap of
the accused.  There is nothing in the
record to suggest that Sgt. Parajas was moved by any motive than simply the
carrying out of his official mission or duty.  Where there is no evidence and nothing to indicate that the principal
witness for the prosecution was actuated by improper motives, the presumption
is that he was not so actuated and his testimony is entitled to full faith and
credit (<u>People vs. Francia</u>, L­-69253, September 30, 1987, 154 SCRA
495)."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court brushed aside the defense's observation that
there were discrepancies between the testimony of Sgt. Parajas and the evidence
presented, such as the color of the bag allegedly taken from accused-appellant
and the kind of marijuana taken from the bag, as immaterial.  Similarly brushed aside was the defense's
contention that the evidence against accused-appellant, such as the Receipt of
Property Seized<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and her signature thereon,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> and
the Booking Sheet and Arrest Report<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> and
her signature thereon,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> were
inadmissible due to the absence of counsel, since these were not confessions or
extra-judicial statements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the trial court did not give credence to the testimonies
of accused-appellant and her witness Nestor Yangkin, in view of the testimony
of Sgt. Parajas that he took the bag containing the marijuana from
accused-appellant's lap.  Moreover, the
court <i><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>observed that there was a discrepancy
between the testimonies of accused-appellant and Yangkin on the matter of the
10 sacks of cabbage, which led the court to conclude that the former was in the
act of transporting marijuana at the time of her arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant filed a motion for reconsideration, alleging that
the marijuana leaves found in the bag taken from her was inadmissible in
evidence as it was the product of a warrantless search, which motion was denied
by the trial court for lack of merit on November 22, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved, accused-appellant filed the instant appeal, alleging
that the court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>erred
(1) in not finding the warrantless search conducted by the NARCOM agents as
illegal and unconstitutional, and (2) <span style="">in
</span>admitting the illegally obtained evidences and convicting her on the
basis of said evidences.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant is in error.</p>

<p class="BODY">The general rule regarding searches and seizures can be stated in
this manner:  no person shall be
subjected to a search of his person, personal effects or belongings, or his
residence except by virtue of a search warrant or on the occasion of a lawful
arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The basis for the rule can be found in Article <span style="">III, </span>Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution, which states:</p>

<blockquote>"The right of the people to be secure in their persons,
houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures of
whatever nature and for any purpose, shall be inviolable, and no search warrant
or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be determined
personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation of the complainant
and the <span style="">witnesses </span>he may
produce, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons
or things to be seized."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article III, Section 3 (2) further ordains that any evidence
obtained in violation of the aforementioned right shall, among others, "be
inadmissible for any purpose in any proceeding."</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional proscription against warrantless searches and
seizures admits of certain exceptions.  Aside from a search incident to a lawful arrest, a warrantless search
had been upheld in cases of a moving vehicle,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> and
the seizure of evidence in plain view.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the search of moving vehicles, this had been
justified on the ground that the mobility of motor vehicles makes it possible
for the vehicle to be searched to move out of the locality or jurisdiction in
which the warrant must be sought.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This in no way, however, gives the police officers unlimited
discretion to conduct warrantless searches of automobiles in the absence of
probable cause.  When a vehicle is
stopped and subjected <span style="">to </span>an
extensive search, such a warrantless search has been held to be valid only as
long as the officers conducting the search have reasonable or probable cause to
believe before the search that they will find the instrumentality or evidence
pertaining to a crime, in the vehicle to be searched.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The NARCOM officers in the case at bar had probable cause to stop
and search all vehicles coming from the north at Acop, Tublay, Benguet in view
of the confidential information they received from their regular informant that
a woman having the same appearance as that of accused-appellant would be
bringing marijuana from up north.  They
likewise have probable cause to search accused-appellant's belongings since she
fits the description given by the NARCOM informant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since there was a valid warrantless search by the NARCOM agents,
any evidence obtained during the course of said search is admissible against
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, no objection was raised by the accused-appellant in
the court below on the inadmissibility of the evidence against her on the
ground that the same was obtained in a warrantless search.  This amounts to a waiver of the objection on
the legality of the search and the admissibility of the evidence obtained
therefrom.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Amid a waiver, the court is duty bound to admit the evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Reviewing the evidence, We find the same sufficient to prove
accused-appellant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution had shown, primarily through the positive
testimony of Sgt. Parajas, that the bag containing the dried marijuana leaves
was taken from accused-appellant's possession.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">She denies this fact and contends that the bag in<span style=""> </span>question was actually taken from the
luggage carrier above the passenger seats and not from <span style="">her.  </span>Indisputably, We
have two opposing versions of what actually happened at the checkpoint in Km.
16, Acop, Tublay, Benguet, resulting in the accused-appellant's apprehension,
that of the prosecution and that of the defense.  In situations like this, the matter of assigning values to the
testimony of witnesses is best performed by the trial courts because, unlike
appellate courts, they can weigh such testimony in the light of the demeanor,
conduct and attitude of the witnesses at the trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
The exception is when the trial court has overlooked certain facts of substance
and value that, if considered, might affect the result,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
which We <span style="">do not </span>find in the
instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, accused-appellant's defense was weakened by the fact
that her witness Nestor Yangkin contradicted <span style="">her on </span>the matter of the 10 sacks of vegetables appellant claims
to have brought with her at the time of her arrest.  Appellant claims she loaded the sacks of vegetables on the bus
and tried to pay for its fare, but that conductor Yangkin, put her off.  Yangkin claims otherwise:  the sacks of vegetables were loaded by a man
<span style="">who </span>told him that the fare for
the sacks will be paid upon arrival in Baguio City, and that no one on the bus
offered to pay for the same.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In weighing contrary declarations and statements, greater weight
must generally be given to the positive testimonies of the prosecution
witnesses than the denials of the accused-appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Given the discrepancy on this point, the trial court correctly
disregarded <span style="">the </span>corroborative
testimony of Nestor Yangkin.  The matter
of the ownership of the 10 sacks of vegetables is material since appellant's
reason for being on the bus was to deliver these sacks to Baguio City.  If the sacks of vegetables are not hers,
then the only conclusion that can be drawn is that she was on her way to Baguio
City to sell the marijuana found in her possession.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged discrepancies in the prosecution's case, such
as the color of the stripes of the bag which contained the marijuana and
whether the items seized from accused-appellant were marijuana leaves or
marijuana fruit tops, these are minor in character and do not detract from the
prosecution's case since it was shown by the Receipt of Property Seized,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
which was signed by accused-appellant, that these were the very items taken
from her at the time of her arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no error in the decision appealed from,
the same is hereby AFFIRMED <i><span style="">in toto.</span></i>  Costs against accused-appellant.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION<u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PADILLA, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Although there is a similarity in the factual circums­tances of
the case at bar with those of the <u>Malmstedt</u> case (GR No. 91107, 19 June
1991, 198 SCRA 101) where the Court upheld the validity of the warrantless
search, however, in the present case, I am of the view that the information
alone received by the NARCOM agents, <u>without</u> <u>other</u> <u>suspicious</u>
<u>circumstances</u> <u>surrounding</u> <u>the</u> <u>accused</u>, did not give
rise to a probable cause justifying the warrantless search made on the bag of
the accused.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Malmstedt</u> case, it will be recalled that no
extensive search was immediately made of the personal effects of the
accused.  It was <u>only</u> <u>after</u>
the NARCOM agents noticed <span style="">a</span>
bulge on the waist of the accused (causing them to suspect that he was carrying
<span style="">a </span>gun) and <u>only</u> <u>after</u>
he failed or refused to present his passport when required to do so, that <span style="">a </span>warrantless search was made of <span style="">the </span>personal effects of the
accused.  In other words, the
information received by the NARCOM agents that a certain Caucasian travelling
from Sagada to Baguio City was <span style="">carrying
</span>prohibited drugs <u>together</u> <u>with</u> the suspicious failure or
refusal of the accused to present his passport, supplied the probable cause
that reasonably led the NARCOM agents to believe that the said accused was then
and there committing a crime.  Thus -<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Warrantless search of the personal effects of an accused has been
declared by this Court as valid, because of existence of probable cause, where
the smell of marijuana emanated from a plastic bag owned by the accused, or
where the accused was acting suspiciously, and attempted to flee.”<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxxx<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“The receipt of information by NARCOM that a Caucasian coming from
Sagada had prohibited drugs in his possession, plus the suspicious failure of
the accused to produce his passport, taken together as a whole, led the NARCOM
officers to reasonably believe that the accused was trying to hide something
illegal from the authorities.  From
these circumstances arose a probable cause which justified the warrantless
search that was made on the personal effects of the accused.  In other words, the acts of the NARCOM
officers in requiring the accused to open his pouch bag and in opening one of
the wrapped objects found inside said bag (which was discovered to contain
hashish) as well as the two (2) travelling bags containing two (2) teddy bears
with hashish stuffed inside them, were prompted by accused’s own attempt to
hide his identity by refusing to present his passport, and by the information
received <span style="">by </span>the NARCOM that a
Caucasian coming from Sagada had prohibited drugs in his possession.  To deprive the NARCOM agents of the ability
and facility to act accordingly, including, to search even without warrant, in
the light of such circumstances, would be to sanction impotence and
ineffectiveness in law enforcement, to the detriment of society.” (198 SCRA
401)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the NARCOM agents searched the bag of the
accused <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>basis</u> <u>alone</u> of an information they
received that a woman, 23 years of age with naturally curly hair, and 5’2” or
5’3” in height would be transporting marijuana.  The extensive search was indiscriminately made on <u>all</u> the
baggages of <u>all</u> passengers of the bus where the accused was riding,
whether male or female, and whether or not their physical appearance answered
the description of the suspect as described in the alleged information.  If there really was such an information, as
claimed by the NARCOM agents, it is a perplexing thought why they had to search
the baggages of ALL passengers, not only the bags of those who appeared <span style="">to </span>answer the description of the woman
suspected of carrying marijuana.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the accused was not at all acting suspi­ciously when
the NARCOM agents searched her bag, where they allegedly found the marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the circumstances of the case at bar, it would seem that the
NARCOM agents were only fishing for evidence when they searched the baggages of
all the passengers, including that of the accused.  They had no probable cause to reasonably believe that the <u>accused</u>
was <u>the</u> <u>woman</u> carrying marijuana alluded to in the information
they allegedly received.  Thus, the
warrantless search made on the personal effects of herein accused on the basis
of mere information, <u>without</u> <u>more</u>, is to my mind bereft of
probable cause and therefore, null and void.  It follows that the marijuana seized in the course of such warrantless
search was inadmissible in evidence.</p>
