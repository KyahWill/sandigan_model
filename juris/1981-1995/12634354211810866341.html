				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issues in this case are the validity of the dismissal of a
state witness and the credibility of his testimony.  The trial court resolved both affirmatively, resulting in the
conviction of the accused-appellant.  He
seeks reversal, claiming the decision is erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 28, 1983, two dead bodies were found on the shoulder of a
road in Barangay Carmay, in Rosales, Pangasinan.  They were sprayed with bullets.  Autopsy revealed that the cause of death was "shock, irreversible,
due to massive internal and external hemorrhage, due to gunshot wounds."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Sixteen empty shells were recovered near the corpses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Investigation focused suspicion on three soldiers, namely, Robin
Estoesta, Herminigildo Lamigo, and Catalino Quiming, all of the 152nd PC
Company stationed at Lingayen, Pangasinan.  They had earlier used a mini-cruiser jeep found later with a dented
bumper and bloodstains at the rear of the vehicle.  Upon separate interrogations, Estoesta pointed to Lamigo as the
killer;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Lamigo pointed to Estoesta;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and so too did Quiming.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The paraffin tests proved positive for Estoesta and negative for both Lamigo
and Quiming.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The ballistics tests showed that the empty shells came from the firearms
assigned to Quiming and Lamigo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 23, 1980, all three suspects were charged with the
murders of Herminio Casimiro and Pedro Robina, committed with treachery and
evident premeditation and with the aggravating circumstance of having taken
advantage of their public position as members of the Philippine Constabulary.  Each of the accused pleaded not guilty.  On motion of the prosecution, Quiming was
subsequently discharged, over the objection of the defense, to become a state
witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
After trial, during which Quiming as well as the remaining two accused took the
stand, Judge Manuel D. Victorio of the Regional Trial Court of Rosales,
Pangasinan, found Estoesta guilty of double murder and sentenced him to serve
the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> for each of the offenses, to
indemnify the heirs of the victims in the amount of P30,000.00 for each victim;
and to pay the costs.  Lamigo was
acquitted for insufficiency of the evidence against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the appellant's brief, the discharge of Quiming to become a
witness for the prosecution is challenged on the ground that his testimony, as
revealed during his examination at the trial, was "perjurious" and
full of contradictions.  The ground is
irrelevant.  Credibility is not the test
of the discharge of an accused so he can become a state witness.  The requisites for this step are laid down
in Section 9 of Rule 119 of the Rules of Court, and it is by these requisites,
if satisfied, that the discharge is allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said section provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>When two or more persons are jointly charged with the commission of
any offense, upon motion of the prosecution before resting its case, the court
may direct one or more of the accused to be discharged with their consent so
that they may be witnesses for the state when after requiring the prosecution
to present evidence and the sworn statement of each proposed state witness at a
hearing in support of the discharge, the court is satisfied that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a) There is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused
whose discharge is requested;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) There is no other direct evidence available for the proper
prosecution of the offense committed, except the testimony of said accused;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) The testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated
in its material points;</blockquote>

<blockquote>d) Said accused does not appear to be the most guilty;</blockquote>

<blockquote>e) Said accused has not at any time been convicted of any offense
involving moral turpitude.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Evidence adduced in support of the discharge shall automatically
form part of the trial.  If the court
denies the motion for discharge of the accused as state witness, his sworn
statement shall be inadmissible in evidence.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Given the peculiar circumstances of this case, where the only
eyewitnesses to the killings were the three original accused themselves, we
feel that the trial court did not err in allowing the discharge.  The grant of the motion to discharge was
made in the sound discretion of the trial court after ascertainment of the
presence of the conditions set forth in the above-quoted provision.  Significantly, Quiming's discharge was
ordered first by Judge Cornelio W. Wasan, Sr.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
to whom the case was first raffled, and later, upon its transfer, by Judge
Victorio in resolving the motion for reconsideration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was an absolute necessity for the testimony of Quiming
because no other direct evidence was available against Estoesta and Lamigo, who
remained accused of the killings.  The
testimony of Quiming could be substantially corroborated in its material
points, particularly by the autopsy and ballistics reports and, curiously, by
Lamigo himself.  Quiming did not appear
to be the most guilty (and in fact appeared to be the least guilty) because,
while Estoesta and Lamigo accused each other, neither of them pointed to
Quiming as the killer.  Finally, it had
not been shown that Quiming had ever been convicted of a crime involving moral
turpitude.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the commission itself of the offenses, we find from
the testimonial and other evidence presented that Estoesta was, indeed, the
lone killer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes at the outset that he was the leader of the group
that went on official mission that day, being a 1st Class constable whereas the
other two were merely constables and so had to take orders from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the testimonies of the soldiers themselves that
upon accomplishment of their mission in the afternoon of that day, they had a
drinking spree in two towns before deciding to head back for their headquarters
in Lingayen at about five-thirty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Lamigo, who was driving, hit an ipil-ipil tree and dented the bumper of the
mini-cruiser.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Seated beside him was Quiming while Estoesta was in the rear, sitting in one of
the benches opposite each other.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Estoesta and Quiming were at that time holding their respective firearms, with
Lamigo's M-16 rifle lying near the gear shift.  At Barangay Carmay, two men signaled to them, probably thinking they
were hailing a passenger jeep.  Estoesta
ordered Lamigo to stop and take them in.  The two hitchhikers, who appeared to be intoxicated, sat on the other
bench facing Estoesta and immediately behind Quiming.  After a while, Estoesta got Lamigo's gun, placing his own gun on
his lap, as he moved to the rearmost part of the bench.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
About three or four kilometers later, Quiming was startled by the sound of
gunfire, causing him to involuntarily fire his own gun, and when he looked back
he saw the two hitchhikers sprawled and bloodied.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Estoesta had shot them.  Lamigo
immediately stopped the jeep and asked Estoesta why he had done this.  Estoesta's response was to order Lamigo and
Quiming to unload the two corpses, which they did, placing them face down, one
on top of the other, on the shoulder of the road.  Estoesta later alighted at Urdaneta to go home to La Union,
telling them not to report the matter as he would take care of it.  Lamigo and Quiming proceeded to their
headquarters at Lingayen.  The next
morning, upon discovery of the bloodstains and the dented bumper in the jeep
they had used, they were taken into custody.  Estoesta returned on May 30, 1983, and was also detained in the
stockade.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quiming's testimony was substantially corroborated by Lamigo.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Estoesta insists that it was not he but Lamigo who
shot and killed the two hitchhikers and later threatened him and Quiming
against reporting the incident.  He
faults the credibility of his two companions, arguing that they were friends
and province-mates and so supported each other against him.  He also cites some contradictions in their
separate testimonies that he says brand them as perjured and unreliable
witnesses.  For example, Quiming said in
his sworn statement that Estoesta used his own gun in killing the hitchhikers
but he changed his mind at the trial and said that the gun used was Lamigo's.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have held that variance between the testimony and the
affidavit of a witness does not of itself affect his credibility.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Affidavits executed during custodial investigation are as a rule abbreviated
and inaccurate and usually made without the aid of an attorney.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Generally, standard questions are asked, laced with suggestions intended to
elicit answers which turn out to be not wholly the product of the declarant's
fallible power of recall.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
So it must have been in the case of Quiming when he made the cited
contradictions.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, we find that the discrepancies in Quiming's
testimony are of minor character only and do not affect its veracity as a
whole.  As for the alleged bias of
Lamigo and Quiming against him because of their relationship, this charge has
not been proved at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a long-standing policy of the Court to defer to the factual
findings of the trial court on the theory that it has the opportunity to
observe the witnesses on the stand and determine by their deportment whether
they are telling or distorting the truth.  The only exception is where such findings are not supported by substantial
evidence, but that exception is not applicable in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision found the accused-appellant guilty as charged beyond
reasonable doubt, but the statement is not entirely accurate.  We agree that the killings were qualified by
treachery because, as all three eyewitnesses testified, the victims were
completely defenseless and taken by surprise when they were shot down.  But there is no showing that there was
evident premeditation of the murders; in fact, the victims were picked up by
happenstance and killed only minutes afterwards.  Neither has it been proved that Estoesta took advantage of his
official position as a constable when he murdered them.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no mitigating or aggravating circumstances, the
imposable penalty for each of the murders is <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.  The civil indemnity to be paid to the heirs
of each of the two victims shall, however, be increased to P50,000.00,
conformably to existing policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has time and again warned that liquor and firearms are
a deadly combination that must be shunned, especially by men in uniform, who
are supposed to protect rather than endanger the public.  The incidence of drunken soldiers and
policemen killing or injuring defenseless civilians has grown to disconcerting
proportions.  The higher authorities in
the military and the police must take more drastic measures against this evil
lest the toll rise still higher even as respect for our law-enforcement
agencies fall further down.  There is no
excuse for their tolerant inaction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED as above
modified and the appeal is DISMISSED, with costs against the accused-appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
