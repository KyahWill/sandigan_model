Appeals which affirmed the convictions of Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Cruz of the theft or hijacking of 540 cases
of <st1:city><st1:place>Salem</st1:place></st1:city> cigarettes from Clark Air
Base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon separate motions for
reconsideration filed by the accused, Cruz was acquitted on the ground of
reasonable doubt but Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat's</span> conviction was
maintained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat's</span> petition for review was
denied by this Court on <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="9">September 29,
 1978</st1:date> in a minute resolution (p. 97, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
but on motion for reconsideration the court decided to give his petition due
course (p. 157, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are recited in the decision of the Court of
Appeals as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Airman First Class James A. <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>
is an American Negro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was a member of
the 6200th U.S. Security Police Squadron stationed at Clark Airbase, <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, he used to escort the shipment of
cargoes from the Central Exchange Warehouse at Clark Airbase to the Manila Port
Area (p. 129, Rec.; p. 2, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, July 16, 1969).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="9">September
 2, 1968</st1:date>, after <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> had just come off
from his job at the base, a certain Filipino approached him and invited him to
a place called the 'Block.' Upon reaching said place, he was brought to the
'Sky High Club' just across the street.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While drinking San Miguel Beer in said club, they were joined by two or
three other Filipinos, one of them was in PC uniform (pp. 2-3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1969</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the usual introduction, the three Filipinos started
asking <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> questions about his job.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then the trio proposed to <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>
the idea of hijacking the shipment of blue seal cigarettes to be escorted by
the latter on <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="9"><span style="">September 4, </span>1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At first, <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> was afraid because he was
about to get married.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the three
convinced <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> by telling him not to worry as
they knew all the people in the warehouse as well as in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
(pp. 2-5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1969</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Then, <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="9">September 4,
 1968</st1:date> came.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That same morning, 540 cases of 'blue seal' </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Salem</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> cigarettes
were readied for shipment from the U.S. Clark Air Base, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">Angeles</span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE"> to the
Manila Port Area.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cigarettes
were placed inside six (6) <span class="SpellE">connexes</span> (metal shipping
container).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the <span class="SpellE">connexes</span> were loaded with
ninety (90) cases of 'blue seal' <st1:city><st1:place>Salem</st1:place></st1:city>
cigarettes each, they were sealed and welded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the <span class="SpellE">connexes</span> were placed in a flat bed on
a trailer pulled by a tractor (pp. 4-7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1969" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1969</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The tractor with the trailer driven by accused Adriano <span class="SpellE">Sigua</span> left Clark Air Base at about <st1:time minute="15" hour="9">9:15 to 9:30</st1:time> that same morning of <st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> who was assigned as escort brought
with him the shipping record (Exhibit 'A') evidencing the shipment for delivery
to the Liaison officer stationed at the Manila Port Area (pp. 5-10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, July 16, 1969).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Instead of going straight to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
however, the trailer proceeded to the compound of the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
Bicycle Manufacturing Company located at Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the compound a group of men started
moving as soon as the trailer arrived.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Among these men were the appellant Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> and
two of the men who talked with <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> at the 'Sky
High' night club in the evening of <st1:date year="1968" day="2" month="9">September
 2, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also with the group
was the accused <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter, a small truck entered the
compound; and the men started <span class="SpellE">unwelding</span> the <span class="SpellE">connexes</span> with the equipment carried by this small truck
(pp. 11-12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1968</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Then the appellant, Major <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span>
Cruz, arrived with two bodyguards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> was told to go down the trailer to meet Major
Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the introduction, Major Cruz
assured <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> that he (Major Cruz) controlled all
the people and police in the area.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After<span style=""> </span> the <span class="SpellE">connexes</span> were <span class="SpellE">unwelded</span>, Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> instructed the men to unload the cases of <st1:city><st1:place>Salem</st1:place></st1:city>
cigarettes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Beside Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> was the accused <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
Tan who helped supervise the unloading.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then the cigarettes were replaced with hollow blocks brought by Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> inside the compound three days prior to the
incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After filling up five of the
six <span class="SpellE">connexes</span> with hollow blocks, they were welded
back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The sixth <span class="SpellE">connex</span>
was welded back without replacing the cigarettes inside it (pp. 13-15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1969</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After talking for 5 to 10 minutes, Major Cruz told <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> to go back to the trailer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Major Cruz left with his
bodyguards; while <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> proceeded to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
to submit the shipping papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
papers were checked, <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> started back for Clark
Air Base (pp. 14-18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1969</st1:date>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"On their way home, a Filipino employee from the Central
Exchange <span class="SpellE">motorpool</span> got inside the tractor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>
that he knew what happened, and alighted from the tractor about a quarter of a
mile away from the main gate to Clark Air Base where <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>
alighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>
was proceeding to the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> stand, a Filipino took
him downtown to a club (p. 18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, July 16, 1969).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> was brought before the accused
Alfonso Torres who was then seated alone inside the club.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Torres <span class="GramE">ask</span> <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> to sit down and told the latter that he was the
brain of the hijacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Torres then
brought <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> to a corner nearby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He (Torres) went inside and came back with a
portfolio (Exhibit 'C') containing P14<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Torres then took <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>
into a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> and after <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
for a distance, they both got off.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Torres gave <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> the portfolio and
repeated his (Torres) warning to <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> not to
report what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> boarded a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> to
report for work at the base (pp. 18­-19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1969</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile, after the cigarettes were piled in the basketball
court inside the compound of the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Bicycle
Manufacturing Company on instruction of Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>, a
big red truck arrived at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 P.M.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cigarettes were then loaded inside the
red truck and after Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> had introduced <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> Tan as his wife to Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>,
the two (<span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>)
brought their truckload of cigarettes to 264 Roosevelt Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
remaining cigarettes were loaded inside the panel truck and were also hauled to
<st1:street><st1:address>264 Roosevelt Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> by Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> (pp. 3-4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="8">Aug. 14, 1969</st1:date>).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

in the evening, many automobiles were hauling the cigarettes from the house at <st1:street><st1:address>264
  Roosevelt Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balmes</span>
themselves rode the panel truck fully loaded with <st1:city><st1:place>Salem</st1:place></st1:city>
cigarettes to deliver them to <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Banawe</span>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1969</st1:date>,
seventeen (17) persons were charged for Qualified Theft before the Circuit
Criminal Court of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. <span class="GramE">COC-V-049), among them the petitioner Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>, James <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>, Major <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> Tan and
Alfonso Torres.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> was dropped from the complaint based on the terms
of the US?Phil. Bases Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;

Alfonso Torres pleaded not guilty, but Torres escaped during the trial of the
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial resulted in the acquittal of <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Cruz were found guilty beyond
reasonable doubt, "as principals of the crime defined and penalized in
Article 308 (Simple Theft) of the Revised Penal Code." Absent any
mitigating or aggravating circumstances, they were each sentenced by the
circuit criminal court, "to suffer an indeterminate penalty of NINE (9)
YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY of <span class="SpellE"><u>Prision</u></span>
<u>Mayor</u>, as minimum imprisonment, to FOURTEEN (14) YEARS, EIGHT (8) MONTHS

accused <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Cruz is concerned, and the other
accessories of the law and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(pp. 32­-33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the conviction of Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> Cruz was
affirmed (CA-G.R. No. 13004-CR, April 29, 1977) (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Separate motions for reconsideration were
filed by Cruz and Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz was acquitted upon reconsideration, but
Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat's</span> conviction remained, hence, this petition
for review by Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> alleging that:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in convicting him on the same evidence which it found 'incredible,'
'polluted,' and 'inadequate' to convict his co? accused;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in convicting him of 'conspiracy' while it acquitted his co-conspirator;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in convicting him on mere suspicion, surmises, and conjectures;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Court of Appeals erred in sustaining the jurisdiction
of the trial court although the crime was committed in Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>; and<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals
erred in not upholding Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat's</span> right to presumption
of innocence." <span class="GramE">(pp. 8-9, Petitioner's Brief, p. 170, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the petition, the appellants' brief, the Solicitor
General's comment and brief for the respondents, we are not persuaded that the
petition should be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petitioner's first,
second, third and fifth assignments of error may be reduced to the single
question of whether the Court of Appeals erred in affirming his conviction
although it let Cruz go free.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
acquittal of Cruz on reasonable doubt did not necessarily mean acquittal for Co
<span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> as well.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Firstly, the only evidence against Cruz was provided by Juanita Barrios
Co and James <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> who declared that he was at the
<span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> Bicycle Manufacturing plant when the stolen
cigarettes were delivered there by <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sigua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Cruz was
able to convince the Court of </span>Appeals that the identification of him by
the prosecution witnesses was unreliable and should not prevail over his
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, besides these
witnesses, there was other evidence connecting Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>
with the theft for he not only admitted being present at the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> Bicycle Manufacturing Compound when the stolen goods
were delivered there, but the prosecution proved that he brought the hollow
blocks which were loaded in the <span class="SpellE">connexes</span> in place of
the cigarettes, and that he supervised the stock piling of the cigarettes on
the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, he was inside
the panel truck transporting the stolen cigarettes when apprehended by ASAC
agents at the corner of <st1:street><st1:address>Roosevelt Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>
and San Francisco Del Monte.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
literally "caught with the goods."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's <span class="GramE">arguments that in view of Cruz's
acquittal, he (Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span>) may not be convicted as
Cruz's co-conspirator in the commission of the theft has</span> no merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cruz was not the only co-conspirator of Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> in the commission of the theft.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifteen (15) other persons, including <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span> (who was convicted by the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
court martial) were charged with Co <span class="SpellE">Kiat</span> as co-­conspirators
in the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason why only the petitioner, Cruz, and <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
Tan stood trial is that all the others escaped.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the <span class="SpellE">asportation</span> of the cigarettes
commenced when they were taken out of Clark Air Base by <span class="SpellE">Sconiers</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Sigua</span> and continued when the goods passed through
Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, until they were seized by the
ASAC agents in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, the courts in any of
those places had jurisdiction over the offense (<span class="SpellE">Buaya</span>
vs. Polo, 169 SCRA 471).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled doctrine in this jurisdiction, that factual
findings of the trial court are entitled to great weight and authority (<span class="SpellE">Macua</span> <span style="">vs. </span>Intermediate
Appellate Court, 155 SCRA 29) and that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in
cases brought to it from the Court of Appeals, is limited to reviewing and
revising the errors of law imputed to it, its findings of facts being
conclusive (Chan vs. Court of Appeals, 33 SCRA 737).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a petition for review of decisions of the Court of Appeals,
the jurisdiction of this Court is confined <span style="">to reviewing questions of law, unless the factual findings are totally
bereft of support in the records or are so glaringly erroneous as to constitute
a serious abuse of discretion (<span class="SpellE">Canete</span>, et al. vs.
Court of Appeals, 171 SCRA 13).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Except in criminal cases in which the penalty imposed is <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> or higher, appeals to the Supreme
Court are not a matter of right but of sound judicial discretion and are
allowed only on questions of law and only when there are special and important
reasons, which we do not find in this case (<span class="SpellE">Balde</span> vs.
Court of Appeals, 150 SCRA 365).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals
