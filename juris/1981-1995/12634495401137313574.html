				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These related cases, concerning the position of mayor of San
Pablo City, have a common factual back­ground and involve <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>
as a ground for disquali­fication.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. In 1963, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, as official candidate of the Liberal Party, was
elected mayor of <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
while Cesar P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
candi­date, was elected vice-mayor.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. In 1967, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> <span class="GramE">candidate,</span> was
elected mayor of <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He beat <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, the
official candidate of the Liberal Party.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. In 1971, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, again as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>, was reelected mayor, beating <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, who ran as a <u>rebel Liberal Party candidate</u>,
and Pedro <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span>, the official Liberal Party
candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of the transitory
provisions of the Constitution, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> continued to
serve as mayor after the expiration of his four-year term in 1975.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">4. According to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, he remained a
member of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party up to the early part
of 1978 when he campaigned for the candidates for the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Kilusang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipunan</span> (KBL) in the
elections held on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1978</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was the official KBL candidate
for mayor of <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in the elections on <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1980</st1:date>
while, ironically, his old antagonist, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, was
the official candi<span style="">date of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span><u> Party.</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">6. In <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> certificate of candidacy
filed on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1979</st1:date>
he indicated that he was <span class="SpellE">partyless</span> or an independent
candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He withdrew that certificate
of candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1980</st1:date>, he filed a new certificate of
candidacy wherein he alleged that he was the official <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span>
standard-bearer.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. The change in party affiliation made by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> provoked the filing against them of the
charge of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1980</st1:date>, Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Armedilla</span>,
a registered voter of <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
filed with the Commission on Elections a petition to disqualify <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> on the ground that in his certificate of candidacy
dated <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="1">Jan<span style="">uary 3, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">
he indicated that he was the KBL official can</span>didate although he was
formerly affiliated with the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party (Case
No. 166).</p>

<p class="NUM">8. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in his verified answer to that
petition alleged that during his four-year term in office, he did not change
his party affiliation because he continued to be a member of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party; that he remained in office after
December 31, 1975 not as an elected official but as a "casual"; that
his change of party affiliation was beyond the six-month prohibitory period
because he became a KBL member in 1978 and that the constitutional prohibition
should not be applied retroactively to his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said that he was the KBL cam­paign manager
in <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in the elections for <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span> members on <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1978</st1:date> (p. 7, Memorandum).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His cer­tificate of affiliation with the KBL
is dated <st1:date year="1978" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1978</st1:date> and
is attested by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Secretary General Jose A. <span class="SpellE">Roño</span> (Annex B of <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> Memo).</p>

<p class="NUM">9. On the other hand, on <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="1">January
 23, 1980</st1:date>, Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Cosico</span>, a registered
voter, filed with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> a petition to
disqualify <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> because in his second certifi­cate
of candidacy he stated that he was nominated by the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party although he admittedly ran as a Liberal Party candidate in the 1971
elections (Case No. 235).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifty-­eight <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captains and chairmen of <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, in a
resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1980</st1:date>,
asked Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to push through the
disqualification case against <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> (pp. 89-91, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G. R. No. 52678).</p>

<p class="NUM">10. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> in his answer to that
petition alleged that in 1971 he was <u>expelled</u> from the Liberal Party
because he had run as a rebel candidate and, consequently, in January, 1980
when he ran for mayor, he was <span class="SpellE">partyless</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attached to his answer was an affidavit of
Manuel A. Concordia, the acting chairman of the district committee of the
Liberal Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Concordia attested to the
<u>expulsion</u> of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> from the Liberal Party in
1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(According to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, no answer was filed by <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>,
pp. 72 and 85, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G. R. No. 52678).</span></p>

<p class="NUM">11. The disqualification case against <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
was submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="2">February
 6, 1980</st1:date> when <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> offered as rebuttal
evidence the affidavit of Senator Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, the
president of the Liberal Party, affirming that in 1971 <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
was <u>expelled</u> from the party for acts inimical to its objectives (pp.
30-31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G. R. No. 52678).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Governor <span class="SpellE">Felicisimo</span>
San Luis, the provincial chairman of the Liberal Party, stated in his affidavit
that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was not expelled from the party (p. 86, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
disqualifi­cation cases were not decided before the elections.</p>

<p class="NUM">12. A third case, Case No. 462, was filed by <span class="SpellE">Ceferino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ambray</span>, the KBL campaign manager in <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
against the <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
chapter of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party for having included
among its candidates for councilor a guest candidate <span style="">named <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Laset</span>,
Jr., a member of the National Union for Liberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of that guest candidacy, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in its resolutions of February 13 and 16, 1980
treated the can­didates of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party in
San Pablo City as <u>indepen­dent candidates</u> not entitled to the benefit of
block-voting (pp. 223 and 285 to 287, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G. R.
No. 52678).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">13. In the meantime or in the evening of <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1980</st1:date>, the city board of canvassers
started the canvass of the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> later asked the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to change the board of canvassers on the ground of bias and partiality (p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G. R. No. 52678).</p>

<p class="NUM">14. The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in a telegram dated <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1980</st1:date> to the city board of
canvassers directed that should it appear that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
had won, then his proclamation should be <span style="">suspended
in view of the pending disqualification case against him (p. 292, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G. R. No. 52678).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">15. On <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
a verified petition praying, alternatively, for the suspension of the canvass
and the proclamation or for the nullification of the election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged the following grounds:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"3<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span> prior to the
elections of January 30, 1980, in the City of San Pablo, many registered voters
in the per­manent list of voters were not included in the certified list<span style=""> of voters prepared for each voting center,
so that thousands of registered voters were <u>disenfranchised</u> and not able
to vote on Election Day, which registered disenfranchised voters had they been
able to vote, would materially alter the results of the election, more
particularly with respect to the position of City Mayor;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That private respondent (<span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>)
on or before Election Day has resorted to <u>widespread vote-buying and has
employed strong-arm tactics</u>, resulting in the nullification of the free
will of the electorate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That</span> the election
returns submitted appear to be tampered with, altered or falsified and that
there exists dis­crepancies in the authentic copies from a voting center or
discrepancies in the votes <span style="">of </span>the
candidates, which tampering, alteration, or falsification and discrepancies in
the returns would materially affect the results of the elections, more
particularly that of the position of City Mayor." (Annex A of <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> Memorandum.)</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">16. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was furnished with a copy of
that petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
acted on it by sending a directive dated Feb­ruary 1, 1980 to the provincial
election officer of Laguna to stop the canvass of the votes for city mayor,
vice-mayor and members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglungsod</span> in San Pablo City and advising that -"no
canvass or proclamation shall be undertaken until further orders" from the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (p. 32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G.
R. No. 52678).</p>

<p class="NUM">17. That directive triggered the filing by <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>'
of a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in this Court on <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1980</st1:date> for the purpose of suspending its
enforcement (G. R. No. 52451, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> was made a respondent in that case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ticzon</u></span><u>
did not <span class="SpellE">implead</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as a
respondent in that case</u>. This Court issued a resolution with a restraining
order on <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1980</st1:date>,
enjoining the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from enforcing its directive
insofar as it suspended the canvass and instructing the city board of
canvassers to <span class="GramE">proceed</span> with the canvass of the election
returns (p. 33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Not being <span style="">a respondent, </span><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was not aware of
that resolution</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provincial
election officer of Laguna was advised by telegram on February 6 of that
restraining order.</p>

<p class="NUM">18. However, that restraining order was not imple­mented because
before it was served upon the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, it had issued
a resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1980</st1:date>,
replacing the city board of canvassers with a new board of canvassers composed
of three <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was stated in the resolution that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> had sought the replacement of the city board of
canvassers due to acts prejudicial to his candidacy (p. 35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> contends that
this Court's restraining order did not prohibit the change of the city board of
can<span style="">vassers.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">19. </span><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> had complained to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
that the city superintendent of schools and the city fiscal, two of the three
members of the city board of canvassers, were partial to <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fiscal allegedly owed his appoint­ment to
Congressman Manuel A. Concordia (<span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> lawyer)
while the city superintendent of schools had allegedly campaigned on the sly
for Tic <span class="SpellE">zon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> investi­gating team found it
advisable that a new board of canvassers <span class="GramE">be</span> appointed
and that the venue of the canvass be changed to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
(pp. 78-79, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">20. On February 7, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
instructed the new board of canvassers to bring the election returns to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and to canvass them in the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Comelec</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span> session hall (p. 36, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in a sworn
letter to the city board of can­vassers dated February 7, 1980 alleged that the
previous members of the board were partial and biased; that there <span style="">was lack of notice or improper notice to the
parties in the previous partial canvass of the returns and that there was undue
haste in the previous canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> asked for a <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> in
the interest of fairness and justice (pp. 38-39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">21. The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in its resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="2">February 11, 1980</st1:date> held that the <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> was not prohibited by this Court's restraining
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered the new board to
canvass all the election returns including those already <span style="">canvassed </span>by the old board (p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the new
board canvassed all the returns.</p>

<p class="NUM">22. At the instance of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and
without the knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, this Court issued on <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1980</st1:date> an order
restraining the canvass of the election returns in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
by the <st1:city><st1:place>new city</st1:place></st1:city> board of
canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That order was served in the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">ten o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning of <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1980</st1:date>
when the <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span> was about to be terminated and
after <span class="SpellE"><u>Ticzon</u></span><u> had learned of the resolution
of February 12, disqualifying him</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
copy of the restraining order was sent to the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Comelec</span></span><span class="GramE">' s</span> Law Department at
four-quarter in the <span style="">afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> of the Law Department sent </span>the restraining
order to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Chairman at five-forty in the
afternoon of the following day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
day before, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> had already been proclaimed as
mayor (p. 4, Memo of Solicitor General of August 1, 1980).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">23. In the meanwhile, or on <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1980</st1:date> before the <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span>
was completed, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in its Resolution No.
9085, Case No. 235, <span class="SpellE">Cosico</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>,
ruled that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was disqualified because <u>without
having resigned from the Liberal Party or being expelled <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
he ran as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span></u> (pp. 40-41, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="NUM">24. The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> found that, according to
the affidavit of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span>, a former vice-mayor
and Liberal Party standard bearer, and other documentary evidence, <span class="SpellE"><u>Ticzon</u></span><u> continued as a member in good standing of
the Liberal Party</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> candidacy was not given due course, the votes in
his favor were regarded as stray votes and the new city board of canvassers was
directed to proclaim <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as the winning candidate
for mayor of San Pablo City (p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court's second restraining order
of Feb­ruary 14, enjoining the canvass by the newly constituted board of
canvassers, <u>was useless</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
useless because of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> prior resolution of <u>February
12,</u> disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and ordering the
proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span>
disqualification, there was no need to canvass or determine the votes for him
as tallied in the election returns.</p>

<p class="NUM">25. In a separate resolution No. 9098 i<span style="">n</span> Case No. 166, dated <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1980</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> dismissed <span class="SpellE">Armedilla's</span>
petition to disqualify <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petition was submitted on the basis of
the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal was
anchored on the ground of insufficiency of evidence (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>
of G. R. No. 53393).</p>

<p class="NUM">26. On <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1980</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> filed in this <span style="">Court </span>against the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cosico</span> a <u>second petition</u> <span style="">for <i>certiorari</i> </span>wherein he prayed that the resolution
disqualifying him <span style="">be set </span>aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Again, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
did not <span class="SpellE">implead</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> </u><u><span style="">as a respondent</span></u><span style=""> </span>(G. <span style="">R. </span>No. 52678).</p>

<p class="NUM">27. On that same day, after <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">five
 o'clock</st1:time> in the after­noon, this Court issued a third restraining
order, enjoining the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from implementing the

the votes in favor of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> were not counted and
were considered stray votes (pp. 45, 49, 102, 109 and 112, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">28. It </span>should be

February 22, 1980, seeking to oust <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as mayor on

<p class="NUM">30. With respect to the disqualification case against <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Armedilla</span> interposed in
this Court on <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1980</st1:date>
an "appeal by <i>certiorari</i>" wherein he contended that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not observe due process in dismissing the case
(G. R. No. 53393).</p>

<p class="NUM">31. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> in his comment on that appeal
traversed the allegation as to nonobservance of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said <span style="">that
at </span><span style="">the hearing of the petition
for disqualification on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="1"><span style="">Jan­uary 26, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> the
case was submitted on the basis of the pleadings (p. 30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>
of G. R. No. 53393).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>The issues are whether the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> committed a grave abuse of discretion in
changing the city board of can­vassers and the venue of the <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span>
of the returns, in disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> on the ground
of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>, in dis­missing the petition for
disqualification against <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and in ordering his
proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving those issues, we have to take into account the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> unique position in our scheme of government and
its dominant and pervasive role in insuring the holding of free, orderly and
honest elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is empowered to
"enforce and admi­nister all laws relative to the conduct of
elections" and is "the sole judge of all contests relating to the
elections, re­turns, and disqualifications" of elective officials (Sec.
2[1 &amp; 2], Art. <span class="GramE">XII[C], Constitution; <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">185 and 188, 1978 Election Code).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is "the sole judge of all pre-proclamation con­troversies
and any of its decisions, orders or rulings shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>" (Art. 175, 1978 Election Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, its decision, order or ruling may be
reviewed by <span style="">this Court on <i>certiorari</i>
(Sec. 11, Art. XII[C] of the Cons­titution).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It has "direct control and supervision over the board of
canvassers" and any member of the board "may at any time be relieved
for cause and substituted <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span><span style=""> by </span>the
Commission" (Sec. 168, Election Code of 1978).</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not abuse
its discretion in changing the city board of canvassers, in directing that the
canvass be held in its session hall in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and in allowing <span style="">a <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span>
of the returns already canvassed by the old board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> acted
within its powers and jurisdiction in taking those steps based on its
findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It investigated the situation
in the light of the representations made by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question as to the <span class="SpellE">recanvass</span>
was argued by the parties before the city board of canvassers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no justification for this Court to interfere with the
actions taken by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In factual matters, the Co-melee is "en <span class="SpellE">mejores</span> <span class="SpellE">condiciones</span> <span class="SpellE">que</span> <span class="SpellE">ningun</span> <span class="SpellE">otro</span>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the petition in the first case, G. R. No. 52451, should be
dismissed for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other cases, G. R. Nos. 52678 and 53393, are pre-proclamation
controversies which arose because of <span style="">the
</span>constitutional prohibition that "no elective public officer may
change his political party affiliation during <u>his term </u><u><span style="">of </span>office</u>, and no candidate for <span style="">any </span>elective public office <span style="">may </span>change his political party
affiliation <u>within </u><u><span style="">six </span>months
imme­diately preceding or following an election"</u> (Sec. 10, Art. <span class="GramE"><span style="">XII(C)).</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>That prohibition is incorporated in section 4
of Batas <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 52 which took effect on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="12"><span style="">December 22, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of that law provides that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
"shall <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span><u>,</u>
or upon sworn petition of any voter, political party or candidate, after due
notice and hearing, refuse to give due course to a certificate of candidacy if
it is shown that the person filing the same does not possess all the necessary
qua­lifications for the office concerned or is disqualified from run­ning for
said office as provided by law".</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> found that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, a Liberal in the 1971 elections, indicated that he
was a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> in the certificate of candidacy
which he filed for the elections on <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="1">January
 30, 1980</st1:date>. "The records do not disclose that he resigned his
membership from the said Liberal Party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither was he expelled from his<span style=""> party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">On the contrary, the affidavit of Ex-Vice-Mayor Pedro <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span> shows" that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
remained with the Liberal Party.</span> "All other documentary evidences
on record indicate his conti­nuance as member in good standing of the Liberal
Party" (Reso­lution No. 9085, p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> of G.
R. No. 52678).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had jurisdiction to make
the factual find­ing that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> changed his party
affiliation within six months preceding the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not a whimsical and capricious
finding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is supported by documentary
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
was not denied due process when the finding was made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was duly heard and he presented evidence
at the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, that
finding cannot be set aside in this <i>certiorari</i> <span style="">proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is binding and
conclusive on this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, in special civil actions for <i>certiorari</i>, the
main issue is one of jurisdiction - lack of jurisdiction or grave abuse of
discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction whereas petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i>
are limited to the consideration of questions of law" (<span class="SpellE">Lucman</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, L-31558, May 29, 1970, 33 SCRA 387,
399-400.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>See <span class="SpellE">Bashier</span>
vs. Commission on Elections, L-33692, <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="2">February
 24, 1972</st1:date> and two other cases, 43 SCRA 238).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A review of the decision, order or ruling of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> by means of <i>certiorari</i> means that this Court
cannot review its factual findings (Sotto vs. Commission on Elections, 76 Phil.
516, 521).</p>

<p class="BODY">If the courts do not disturb the factual findings of
administrative agencies created by law, except when there is no substantial
evidence to support such findings, then there is no reason to believe that the
Constitution intended to place the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (which was
created by the Constitution as an independent body) on a lower level than those
adminis­trative agencies (<span class="SpellE">Lucman</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dimaporo</span>, 33 SCRA 387, 401).</p>

<p class="BODY">Another contention of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is that
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> erred in regarding the votes obtained by
him as stray votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> ruling is based on section 155(24) of the 1978
Elec­tion Code which provides that "any vote cast in favor of a <span style="">candidate who has been disqualified under
this Code shall be considered as stray and shall not be counted but it shall
not invalidate the ballot".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
a new provision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that because that rule is found among the
"rules for the appreciation of ballots", it should be applied by the <span class="GramE">citizens</span> election committee in the counting of votes and <span style="">it cannot be applied by the board of
canvassers in canvassing the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That contention has no merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 24 means that the votes cast for a disqualified candidate
fall into the category of invalid or inexistent votes because a disqualified
candidate is no candidate at all or is not a candidate in the eyes of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Monsale</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Nico</span>,
83 Phil. 758, a candidate who withdrew his candidacy but who, nevertheless,
obtained the highest number of votes, was not proclaimed because he had ceased
to be a candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His opponent, who
obtained the next highest number of votes, was proclaimed as the duly elected
municipal mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not give due course to <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> candidacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He became a non-candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
votes for a non-candidate cannot be counted and cannot influence the result of
the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The votes for <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> were properly adjudged as stray votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the disqualification case against Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> (G. R. No. 53393), the contention that due pro­cess
was not observed in dismissing that case is not well-taken because petitioner <span class="SpellE">Armedilla</span> was given a chance to controvert <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> defense that he was already a KBL par­tisan in
April, 1978, or more than six months prior to Jan­uary 30, 1980 but <span class="SpellE">Armedilla</span> was not able to overthrow that defense lie
submitted the case for decision by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> on the
pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> concluded that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> did not violate the prohibition against <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See
Resolution of January 25, 1980 in <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, G. R. No. 52375 where a gubernatorial candidate
who was a KBL member for a short time and then ran as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
in the election of January 30, 1980 was not considered disqualified.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Armedilla's</span> counsel, who is also <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> counsel, did not discuss in his memorandum the
disqualification case against <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">latter' s</span>
counsel discussed it in his me­morandum.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> contends that the constitutional
provision dis­qualifying an elective officer from changing his political party
affiliation during his term of office cannot be given retroactive effect to his
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argues that in 1971, when he
was elected mayor for a four-year term ending on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="12">Decem­ber 31, 1975</st1:date>, there was no legal provision
prohibiting an elective public official from changing his party affiliation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After his four-year term expired, he continued to hold office by
virtue of the provision that "all officials and employees in the existing
Government shall continue <span style="">in </span>office
until otherwise provided by law or decreed by the incumbent President of the
Philippines" (Sec. 9, Art. <span class="GramE">XVII, Transitory Provisions
of the Constitution).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> assumed that the other
portion of section 10, Article XII[C], regarding change of political party
within six months prior to the elections, has no application to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> because, as alleged in his answer, he changed his
party in April, 1978 or <u>more than six months before January 30, 1980.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">However, since, as stated earlier, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
had filed with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> a <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> <span class="GramE">proceeding</span> against
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, wherein <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
alleged disqualification is in issue, that same matter may again be threshed
out in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (Case No. 80-15).</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ABAD SANTOS, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to grant the petitions.  I join Justice Melencio-Herrera's dissent except for the last paragraph
thereof.  This is another instance where
the Commission on Elections did not live up to the high expectations of the
people and of this Court.  The vast
powers entrusted to the COMELEC by the Constitution and statutes should have
given it a sober sense of res­ponsibility.  Instead it has even dealt unfairly with this Court.  Add to this its flip-flopping resolutions
and we have a constitutional body whose credibility has been seriously eroded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Zacarias A. Ticzon appears to have obtained the plurality of
votes over Cesar P. Dizon for the office of the mayor of San Pablo City.  He should be proclaimed the winner and
accordingly allowed to hold office.  Thereafter,
Dizon can file the appropriate proceedings to test Ticzon's title to the office
on the alleged ground of turn-coatism if he is so minded.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DE CASTRO, <i style=""><span style="">J.</span></i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I wish, however, to write this separate
opinion not so much to place its weight behind one of the contending <span style="">parties </span>and thereby advance his cause
against the other, but more to raise a voice of defense of <span style="">COMELEC, </span>which came under <span style="">a scathing </span>attack in the, dissenting
opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span> (hereafter referred to
for brevity as "dissent") which, to me, <span style="">is unkind </span>and undeserved.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I </span>assuredly am one
with my brethren who would feel serious concern and strong displeasure for any
act of dis­respect, disregard or disobedience to any court order, writ <span style="">or </span>process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But looking at the instant case with an
absolutely objective eye and serenity, not with a mind agitated with anger and
a heart heavy with frustration, I <span style="">see </span>no cause for an out­burst <span style="">of </span>severe denunciation against the
COMELEC for what is seen in the "dissent" <span style="">as </span>willful, oppressive and brazen dis<span style="">regard </span>of three restraining orders of
this Court, and other alleged acts of arbitrariness committed by the
COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A constitutional body like the
Supreme Court, the <span style="">COMELEC </span>should,
I believe, even with some faults or errors it is susceptible of committing, be
spared that kind of stinging castigation that might quite properly be visited
upon on lesser bodies <span style="">in </span>appropriate
instances or occasions, except perhaps when a measure of severity of
condemnation <span style="">is,
</span>with undisputable propriety, unavoidably and compellingly called for.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
</span><span style="">the present instance, I see no
"gross disregard or</span> <span style="">violation"
</span>of the restraining order issued <span style="">by
</span>this Court on <span style="">February 5, </span>1980
against the enforcement of a directive dated February 1, 1980 of the COMELEC to
stop "until further orders," the canvass of the votes of city mayor,
vice-mayor and members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglusod</span> in San Pablo City, and directed <span style="">the San </span>Pablo City Board of Canvassers
to proceed with the can­<span style="">vass </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span>election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the COMELEC, before the <span style="">restraining </span>order
could be served on it, issued Resolution of <span style="">February 6, </span>1980 to replace the original members of the city board
of canvassers with three COMELEC lawyers; on a sworn <span style="">letter and </span>a verified petition of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
filed on January 31, <span style="">1980 for </span>the
suspension of the canvass and proclamation, <span style="">or in the alternative, </span>the annulment of the election in <span style="">San </span>Pablo City, it could not have
disregarded the Court's restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The grounds of the petition were all of grievous nature, <span style="">and COMELEC </span>could
not have left it <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon without a <span style="">feeling of guilt for dereliction of duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that COMELEC <span style="">did was </span>to discharge its duty </span><span style="">on </span><span style="">the premises in the
best </span>light that dawned on it, and the actions it took did not violate, <span style="">even </span><span style="">in </span>the <span style="">slightest, our restraining order of February 5, 1980.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In changing the members of the city board of canvassers, COMELEC <span style="">acted </span>clearly within its power of
having direct control and supervision over the board of canvassers, to relieve
them for cause, and substitute them even <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span><u>.</u><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Two
members of the city board of canvassers, the City Fiscal and School
Superintendent, were denounced as partial by <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dizon</span></span><span style="">, </span>and the charge was properly investigated by COMELEC which
thereupon acted as it saw fit and proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">When COMELEC also directed the canvass to be held in its Session
Hall in Manila, and ordered the canvass to include the returns already
canvassed by the old board, the order was issued only after an investigation
into the charges contained in the aforementioned verified petition filed by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, the
Commission acted well within its powers in dutiful <span class="SpellE">fulfilment</span>
of its grave responsibility to insure clean, honest and orderly elections,
likewise violating no directive of the restraining order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Transfer of venue of <span class="SpellE">canvass.had</span>
been ordered <span style="">as in </span>the case of <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> municipality involving mayoralty candidates,
and <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> province, involving the gubernatorial
aspirants therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The very plain terms, therefore, of the restraining order of
February 5, 1980, the main thrust of which is only for the canvass to proceed
and proclamation to follow thereafter, do not justify branding the issuance, of
February 6 Resolution of the COMELEC <span style="">as
</span>"arbitrary," much less "in gross disregard and
violation" of Our first restraining order of February 5, 1980, for neither
the reconstitution of the board nor the <span class="SpellE">recanvassing</span> <span style="">was </span>expressly, or even impliedly,
prohibited by said restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was when <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> came again to this
Court that We issued on February 14, 1980 a second restraining order against
the canvass of the election returns in Manila by the new City Board of
Canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a clear inference
that before this restraining order of February 14, 1980, the canvassing of the<span style=""> election returns by a newly formed board of
canvassers in the premises of the COMELEC was not prohibited since indeed all
that this Court had ordered in its first restraining order was for the canvass
to proceed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, the order of <span style="">COMELEC </span>on February 1, 1980, which suspended canvassing and
proclamation, was not arbitrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>apparently considered the move
necessary and well-advised because in all good faith, as it must be so assumed,
it felt that it was <span style="">its </span>inescapable
duty to decide the pre-election disqualification cases against both <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ticzon</span></span><span style=""> and <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> </span>before
the canvassing and proclamation, considering the distinct possibility that one
of the two opposing candidates, or even both of them, may be found disqualified
to run for the elective <span style="">office </span>they
sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission must have seen
the propriety and wisdom of first resolving the pre-election disqualification
controver­sies quickly to avoid what may amount to a virtual grabbing of
proclamation by one not qualified to hold the elective office, excludi<span style="">ng </span>the legally entitled aspirant from
assuming the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">So, </span>as early as February 12, 1980,
after due hearing which ended <span style="">on February </span><span style="">6, </span><span style="">1980, </span><span style="">when the case was submitted for </span><span style="">decision, </span><span style="">COMELEC </span><span style="">issued a resolution finding <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
disqualified on <span style="">ground of "<span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>".<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
also found the evidence against <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dizon</span></span><span style=""> </span>for <span style="">a similar </span>charge insufficient, and it,
accordingly, dismissed the petition for his disqualification on February 13,
1980, after the case had been submitted on the pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This led to the votes of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
being considered stray, </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">expressly so ordained by the Election Code of
1980,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">and
</span><span style="">paved the way for the
proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as the remaining unopposed can­didate,
late <span style="">in </span>the afternoon on
February 15, 1980, before our <span style="">second
restraining </span>order of the same date could be served on the Board of
Canvassers that proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is all too evident, therefore, that when <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
came to this Court with his second petition for <i>certiorari</i> praying for
the setting aside of the COMELEC resolution disqualifying him, it was a bit too
late, even if on the same day after 5:00 o'clock p. m., this Court issued a
third restraining order enjoining COMELEC from implementing the
disqualification reso­lution of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and the city
board of canvassers from proclaim­<span style="">ing </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Dizon</span></span><span style="">, </span>for the latter was already
proclaimed <u>before</u> the restraining order could actually be served on the
Board of Canvassers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing are the salient facts to consider in deciding these
related cases, in all of which the crucial issue, consistent with the limited <i>certiorari</i>
jurisdiction of this Court over the COMELEC,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
is whether said body acted with grave abuse of dis­cretion or with lack or in
excess of its jurisdiction, or otherwise against the law; questions of facts
being deemed settled by the COMELEC itself beyond Our interference, except in
case of denial of due process or evident arbitrariness<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which, as I said at the outset, and with due respect, I fail to <span style="">see </span>with a calm and objective mind.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need not look as far back as the order of February 1, 1980 of
the Commission suspending the canvassing of the election returns, which it
issued manifestly because of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
pre-election disqualification cases against the two opposing candidates, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, as well as the
sworn letter and verified petition of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed on
January 31, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For as soon as the
first restraining order of February 5, 1980 was served on it, .the Commission
took steps towards the canvassing of the election returns, in <u>compliance
therewith</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only had to change the
original membership of the board of canvassers, on being made to appear to it
that, as charged by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, and after its own
investigation, the City Fiscal and School Superin­tendent were not impartial
members, the first, for having owed his position to <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span>
counsel, ex-Congressman Manuel Concordia, and the second, for having campaigned
<span style="">for </span><span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>,
on the sly, as Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> said in his main
opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also changed the venue of
the canvassing to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> within its
office premises, obviously to free the proceedings from possible extraneous
illegal influences or pressures, certainly not to manipulate <span style="">the canvass to favor one of the candidates,
which, if COMELEC had done so, would deserve the severest censure and
indictment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>Commission's
power of control and supervision over the Board of Canvassers leaves absolutely
no room for doubt as to the legality of its action, without any vestige of
grave abuse of discretion or arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A motive other than one related to the goal and in the interest, of a
free, honest and orderly elections to the end that the legitimate will of the
people is given effect not being demonstrable <span style="">to </span>have influenced the Commission, and also considering the
presumption of regularity in the performance of official functions, <span style="">a strongly </span>critical
thrust against the COMELEC is, to my mind, clearly unkind and unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, when the Commission ordered the suspension of the
canvass on February 1, 1980, there was yet no ruling of this Court on whether such
a suspension based on the <span class="SpellE">pen­dency</span> of pre-election
or pre-proclamation disqualification <span style="">cases against </span>both opposing candidates for
Mayor, or either of them, is proper or not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A direct ruling on the impropriety of COMELEC suspension of proclamation
(not canvassing) due to <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of a
disqualification suit was handed down in <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> <span style="">vs. </span><span style="">COMELEC, </span>et <span style="">al</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and possibly other earlier cases before it, but positively not before the
questioned order of the COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even the
case of Pimentel vs. COMELEC, et al,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
G. R. No. 53581-83, which annulled the suspension of the proclamation of
Pimentel because of the invalidity of the COMELEC resolution of his
disqualification for having been issued in violation of procedural due process,
was decided on February 21, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
COMELEC suspending the canvass of the election returns of San Pablo City,
therefore; does not de­serve so castigating a stricture as the
"dissent" appears to be bristling with.</p>

<p class="BODY">But should We annul <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> proclamation
in the same way that We did <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span> proclamation in the
<span class="SpellE">Singco</span> case?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Or stated differently, should We order the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> as We did order the proclamation of Pimentel in the
Pimentel case?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> proclamation on February 15,
1980 came after COMELEC had pronounced <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span>
disqualification in a resolution issued on February 12, 1980, before
proclamation of the winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unlike in
the Pimentel case, the resolution disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
is not vitiated by any violation of due process, as this Court <span style="">has </span>found,
at least with no member, except Justice <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Teehankee</span></span><span style="">, expressly </span>holding
that the disqualification of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is not valid for
lack of due process, or being contrary to the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Singco</span>,
his proclamation was suspended by COMELEC because it found him
disqualified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <i>certiorari</i>, We
found the resolution disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> void <span style="">as </span>We did
in Pimentel, for lack of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there was no legal obstacle <span style="">to </span>their proclamation since the
canvassing showed them to be the winners.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing observations, the answers to the questions
earlier propounded should be clear and unmistakable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, I need not elaborate on them, for
this separate opinion is primarily intended, as I have stated at the outset, in
defense of the COMELEC from the virulent attack against its <span style="">credibility, competence, and impartiality, as
I sense it from the vigorous language used in the "dissent".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its effect on either of the opposing
candidates </span>by <span style="">way of advancing
his cause, is thus only incidental, insofar as the real objective of this
separate opinion </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">just pointed out once more, is concerned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At this juncture, may I
be permitted to state a few words </span><span style="">oh
</span><span style="">the following portion of the
"dissent":<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Before, the <u>loser's</u> tactic, was to 'grab the
proclamation at all costs and prolong the protest.' Now, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has refused to even <u>count</u> the votes <span style="">of the <u>winner</u> (in </span><u><span style="">gross</span> violation</u> <span style="">of the Court's <u>standing</u> February 5,
1980 restraining order) and enabled the loser to grab not only the <u>proclamation</u>
but the <u>election</u> as well with <u>not</u> even a right of <u>protest </u>by
the winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
did this by an arbitrary <u>post-election </u>disqualification of the winner as
a 'turncoat' <u>from</u> the <u>Liberal</u> Party (which had <u>boycotted</u>
the elections as well as the previous 1978 elections and was considered by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> itself as 'inexistent') to <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party and ordering the proclamation of the loser as 'the remaining winning
candidate' with <u>'no </u></span><u><span style="">oppo­</span></u><u><span style="">nent</span></u><span style="">.' There might as well have been no elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the words of the late Chief Justice Fred
Ruiz Castro, the loser continues to <u>fraudulently represent</u> </span><span style="">people who </span><span style="">had in law and in fact duly elected <u>some­</u></span><u><span style="">one</span></u><span style=""> else </span><span style="">to represent them.'
Furthermore, the prevailing doctrine since the 1912 case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Topacio</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span></u> that the repudiated loser </span>who <span style="">succeeds in disqualifying the winner is not
entitled to be proclaimed, much less to assume office, since he has not
received the majority of the votes cast in the elections as well as the
sovereign will of the San Pablo electorate have simply been disregarded and
swept aside without even a passing nod."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The disqualification suits against both <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> were <u>pre-election controversies</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier intimated, the Commission must
have felt, in all good faith, backed by the legal presumption of regularity in
the performance of official functions, that it was its duty to resolve them as
quickly as possible to prevent the proclamation of a disqualified candi­date
which would be not only a futile ceremony, but also un­fair to the qualified
candidate who actually would be a victim of "grabbing of
proclamation", so well exemplified by the case of Santos vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, et al., G. R. No. 52390, March 31, 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, Santos was declared disqualified by
COMELEC before the elections, but was nevertheless allowed to run because of a
restraining order issued by this Court, when he came to this Court for a review
of the COMELEC resolution disqualifying him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We affirmed the resolution of the COMELEC disqualifying Santos, but not
after he was proclaimed winner and has held office for more than a year, to the
prejudice of the qualified can­didate who should have been unopposed since
Santos was declared disqualified by COMELEC as early as before the election.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is apparently to prevent occurrence of cases where there would
be "grabbing of proclamation" that COMELEC would not want
proclamations to be rushed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What would
have happened if <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> had been proclaimed and
allowed to assume office because COMELEC had not suspended the proclamation
"until further orders?" <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> who actually
was the only candidate qualified to be elected would have had to oust <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> through <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span><u>
</u>proceedings which may take years before it could finally be decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Would not <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
have grabbed the procla­mation?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> cannot be pointed to as the
culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not exclude <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> from lawfully assuming the position of Mayor of San
Pablo City, for <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is legally barred from the
position.</p>

<p class="BODY">How then can the act of the Commission in deciding a disqualification
case before the completion of the canvass and of the proclamation, be
considered "arbitrary" specially when, as it now turns out, the
Supreme Court, in its decision herein, has found no reason to annul the COMELEC
resolution of disqualification against <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission's action on the <span style="">premises </span>would
precisely achieve the aim of the policy that condemns "grabbing the
proclamation" by one who, by the people's will, as expressed in the
Constitution in its "innova­tive and mandatory" provision against '<span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>,' is dis­qualified from running for an elective
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fully qualified candidate
voted for, even with less votes than those obtained by the disqualified
candidate, which are legally "stray" votes, justly deserves to be
proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would not be the loser
who "continues to <u>fraudulently represent</u> the people", <span style="">as </span>Chief
Justice Fred Ruiz Castro said in the case of <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span>
vs. COMELEC,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
cited in the "dissent", for had the disqualified candidate not run as
the people would not have wanted him to, the so-called "loser" would
unquestionably have been elected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
least, he could not be said to have grabbed the proclamation <u>unlawfully,</u>
or to continue representing the people <u>fraudulently.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">In the above-quoted portion of the dissenting opinion of Justice <span class="SpellE">Teehankee</span>, the case of <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, 23 Phil. 238, is cited for the
proposition that even if <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is dis­qualified, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> is not entitled to be proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A different ruling appears to have been
enunciated much later in the case of <span class="SpellE">Monsale</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Nico</span>, 83 Phil. 758, cited in the main opinion (p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
as the only remaining candidate and therefore the legally proclaimed winner may
be ousted only at the instance of possibly the Vice-Mayor-elect who may have a
valid claim to the position of Mayor if <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> is
himself disqualified, in a <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
proceedings seasonably filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crux of the present controversy, therefore, actually hinges
on no other question than whether the Resolution of COMELEC disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is valid or not, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
having already been proclaimed and had since acted as City Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If its validity is upheld, all other issues
would be moot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> would be legal, and his continuance in office can be tested
only in a <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> proceedings, not
by an election protest by <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> whose
disqualification, as herein pronounced, would bar him from such remedy, nor
that of <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>, not being
qualified to make a lawful claim on the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is
</span>of course on the premise that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> <span style="">is </span>not disqualified as so demonstrated
with convincing lucidity, in <span style="">the main opinion, to </span><span style="">which
I do not propose to add anything </span><span style="">more</span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">To </span><span style="">do
</span><span style="">so might deviate from the
primary object of </span><span style="">this separate </span><span style="">opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But because </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">assailing the </span><span style="">validity </span><span style="">of the </span><span style="">COMELEC </span><span style="">resolution disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>,
the "dissent" is equally vigorous in lashing at the poll body for
what </span>it <span style="">alleges to be whimsical
and capricious acts committed with apparent bias and evident arbitrariness, in
the evaluation </span>of the evidence as well as the application of the law
relative to the cause of the disqualification, I would like to put in a <span style="">few </span><span style="">words too on the matter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> violation of the
constitutional prohibition against so-called "<span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>"
is premised on his having been with no other party than the Liberal Party, but
he became a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> just days before the <span style="">last </span>election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to overcome the adverse effect of
this switch of party by claiming to have been expelled from the Liberal Party when
he ran as a rebel Liberal candidate for Mayor of San Pablo City <span style="">in </span>1971 and therefore he had no <span style="">party </span>to switch from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His
claim </span>of expulsion is sought to be proven by an affidavit of his own
counsel, Atty. Manuel Concordia, who had been the Liberal Party Chairman in one
of the congressional districts of Laguna, and a certification of former Senator
Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> as President of the Liberal Party,
presented on rebuttal during the hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By way of counter evidence, an affidavit of a former Liberal Party
Vice-Mayor, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span>, firmly attests to <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> having always remained with the Liberal Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At once manifest <span style="">is </span>that ex-Congressman Concordia, as
counsel of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, cannot be as unbiased or
disinterested a witness as Pedro <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span> whose
affidavit, accordingly, deserves more <span style="">faith
and credence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As President of the Liberal Party, former Senator <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, likewise, could not be as reliable as <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span> in <span style="">his </span>knowledge of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span>
standing as a Liberal Party man.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">His duties and concern as the Liberal Party
head are nationwide in scope and extent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He, therefore, could not have been so intimately aware of the status of </span><span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, as a fellow Liberal as <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span>
was.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Magca<span style="">s</span>e</span>
belong to the same City chapter of the party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As Liberals <span style="">of some prominence
in their locality, </span>they certainly have <span style="">been in frequent personal contacts </span>with each other, which
Senator <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> may never have had at all with <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>. </p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was expelled
from the Liberal Party, <span style="">his </span>expulsion was only a punishment for being perhaps an
undisciplined party man, but that does not necessary mean that he had to give
up <span style="">his </span>adherence to, and belief
in, the ideals and objectives of that party if he wanted to stick to them even
outside of the party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is condemned
by the Constitution is to adopt and adhere to the ideals and objec­tives of a
political party different from those of the party to which one had always
affiliated himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> did when he turned <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
from a different party that he had been before within the prohibited period
before an election as specified in the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> readmission to the
Liberal Party soon after the 1971 elections, in preparation of the 1973
presidential elections, could be a very strong probability, not a mere
possibility, if we consider the well-known and simple political dictum of one
of Our most loved and revered politicians, <span style="">Don </span><span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> (<span class="SpellE">Amang</span>)
Rodriguez, Sr., that "politics is addition not subtraction." <span style="">This </span>observation would give even more
credence <span style="">to </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Magcase's</span></span><span style=""> affirmation that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
had always been a Liberal </span><span style="">of </span>good
<span style="">standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> alleged
expulsion is indeed hard </span><span style="">to
believe for the party </span>would gain nothing by it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A declaration of a <span style="">"free </span>zone" when two candidates of the same party are
bent on running is usually what is done, instead of expulsion to preserve the
strength of the party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> expulsion could have been so momentary, for the
party was always willing, for practical reasons, to forgive him, and to take
him back, that <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span> did not even know <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was ever ex­pelled.</p>

<p class="BODY">I can neither subscribe to the idea or proposition that the
Liberal Party has become <u>inexistent</u> for its not participating in both
1978 and 1980 elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its
non-participation in said elections was more an evidence of its
well-disciplined existence, and solid organizational compactness as shown by
its boycott of the past two elections which can be only under a strong unity of
decision of the Party, than as showing its disintegration or dissolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No strongly viable party of pre-martial law
vintage like the Liberal Party appears to have dissolved, itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would be an act so contrary to the
simple political aphorism that "politics is addition not subtraction"
as earlier adverted to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a fact
easily borne out by recent events in the political scene, with the organization
of the UNIDO in which the Liberal Party President, former Senator Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, is Co-Chairman, an undeniable evidence of the
party's continued and healthy existence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuing, further, the main purpose of this opinion, I would like
to say that I cannot agree with the accusation against COMELEC implicit in the
statement in the "dissent" that "<span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
case was arbitrarily, whimsically and discriminate­ly <u>plucked</u> by the
COMELEC from hundred of pending disqualification cases in order to select the
losers as the winners with no opponent by disqualifying the elected winners and
not count­ing their votes as stray votes." The action of COMELEC is one
done purely in administering the laws relative to the conduct of
elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this Court to rebuke the
COMELEC for this simple and pure act of administration would be to overstep the
bounds of its reviewing authority over the Com­mission, no law having been
violated by COMELEC in this regard, administrative discretion only being
involved - fixing priori­ties among cases pending before it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be emphasized that the resolution disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was before the proclamation of any winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was submitted for decision on
February 6, 1980, after <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> has presented <u>rebuttal</u>
evidence, thus negating any claim of absence of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Commission picked the <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> case for an early disposition together with the <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> disqualification case, it evidently was because of
the petition of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> for the suspension of the
canvass and proclamation, or the annulment of the election in <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span style="">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, </span>filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1980</st1:date> with the COMELEC, just after the
election day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A decision on either or
both of the cases finding "<span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>" to
have disqualified either or both respondents therein would obviously render the
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> petition moot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By and large, the Commission cannot be blamed for finding an expeditious
way of quickly solving so grave a problem as that posed before it by the <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>COMELEC has shown thereby its thorough grasp of its priorities and
responsibilities, <span style="">and its capacity for
sound and efficient administration of its massive and multifarious activities
and affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An act </span><span style="">pur</span><span style="">ely one of administration, it may be repeated, does not come </span><span style="">within the <i>certiorari</i>
</span><span style="">authority of this Court, to
permit it </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">castigate the
COMELEC </span><span style="">for any error committed
by it, which is one, not</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">jurisdiction but only
of judgment or discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It </span><span style="">must, </span><span style="">likewise, </span><span style="">be stressed that in deciding the </span>two <span style="">disqualification </span><span style="">cases </span><span style="">against
both <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, the
first </span>having been submitted on February 6, 1980, but decided on February
12, 1980 again negating any suggestion of "railroading" the COMELEC
did so before proclamation of a winner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It thus,<span style=""> fully adhered to the
ruling in <span class="SpellE">Arcenas</span> vs. COMELEC,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> where it was stated that "it is now the
prevailing doctrine that after an election duly held </span><span style="">and a </span><u><span style="">proclamation thereafter</span></u><span style="">
made, a </span><span style="">pre-proclamation
controversy should no longer be viable." Did not COMELEC, therefore, act
correctly and </span><span style="">wisely in deciding
the disqualification cases of both <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> <u>before proclamation</u>, for thereby it relieved
itself of what otherwise would have taken much of its precious time, and also
this Court to which the </span><span style="">petition
</span><span style="">will, in all likelihood, be </span><span style="">eventually elevated for <span style="">review?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>City elective position </span><span style="">being involved, COMELEC </span><span style="">had,
with commendable foresight, wisely gave priority to these disqualification
cases in </span><span style="">San Pablo mayoralty,
for </span><span style="">once decided by it and its </span><span style="">decision finally passed by the </span><span style="">Supreme Court on review, it has disposed of </span><span style="">two </span><span style="">cases with </span><span style="">most </span><span style="">salutary effect in its </span><span style="">concern for an expeditious disposition of the
numerous cases before it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the supposed assurance of COMELEC, given to its counsel, then
Asst. Solicitor General Vicente Mendoza, (not to this Court) that the officials
of the <span style="">COMELEC </span>would not
implement the questioned order to proclaim <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as
the only remaining candidate, then Asst. <span style="">Solicitor
</span>General Mendoza could have been a little precipitate, if not indiscreet,
in making the mani­festation of said assurance to this Court, since it does not
appear that <span style="">COMELEC </span>wanted or
asked him to pass on the same assurance to this Court as to make it feel
solemnly bound not to implement the order on <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">could </span>also be that the Board of Canvassers had not been timely
advised not to proclaim <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> because of oversight or
inadvertence, on <span style="">the </span>part of the
<span style="">COMELEC, </span><span style="">the officials </span>thereof at the time being under tremendous
pressure of work all to be attended to with utmost urgency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A realization of this fact evidently was the
reason why the motion for contempt later filed with this Court against <span style="">COMELEC </span>was not entertained which, if
it was, would <span style="">have </span>given the <span style="">COMELEC officials </span>concerned the
opportunity to explain their side.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Condemning now <span style="">COMELEC </span>without
hearing would not be in keeping with our ever zealous concern for the solemn observance
of the right of procedural due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, any sign of disregard of any of the court's
restraining orders as the "dissent" would see in the actuations <span style="">of </span>the COMELEC, which hopefully, has
been erased by this humble opinion, need no longer excite so much fury and
frustration, <span style="">for with the ultimate
disposition of this case as the "plurality decision" would have it,
finding <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> disqualified for "<span class="SpellE">turn­coatism</span>", absolutely no prejudice was inflicted
on him by said actuation except perhaps that from his personal standpoint, not
from that of the electorate which undoubtedly holds to stronger allegiance to
the Constitution, had he been proclaimed, </span><span style="">should have </span><span style="">held </span><span style="">the position and <span style="">exercised </span>the
prerogatives and enjoyed the</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">privileges thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But surely, the COMELEC </span><span style="">cannot be condemned </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">by its actuations, in the sound <span style="">exercise
of its discretion </span>and wise application of its powers, such <span style="">an </span>eventuality did not come to pass,
for this would have been a Constitutional transgression.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Of no practical value then would it be to propose, as the
"dissent" does at this stage, even in the name of justice, to undo
everything that has already been done, for what is allegedly in gross violation
and disregard of the restraining orders issued in this case by the COMELEC,
(which is not clearly or<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> so, as hereinabove demonstrated) only for the
sake of asserting the court's authority to uphold its <span style="">restraining </span>orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
this may not be done now without transgressing or violating the Constitution by
allowing a disqualified person to hold <span style="">an
</span>elective office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Injustice would
also be inflicted on <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, for the allegedly
arbitrary acts committed not by him but by COMELEC, whose enjoined acts would
have been perfectly lawful without the restraining orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, this Court has not set aside
any proclamation except only when the person proclaimed had before the election
<span style="">or </span>the proclamation been found
by COMELEC to be disqualified, and the disqualifica­tion had been affirmed, as
it had to be, so affirmed, by this Court after the proclamation.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Another point raised in the "dissent" is the question
of whether P.D. 1661 <span style="">is </span><u><span style="">ex </span></u><u><span style="">post facto</span></u><span style=""> </span>if made to apply to <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, or even
to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
"dissent" still insists on said decree being <u><span style="">ex post facto,</span></u><span style=""> </span>and should not be given retroactive
effect despite that in the case of Santos vs. COMELEC, et al, <u>supra</u>,
this Court already held that P.D. No. 1661 is not "banned under the <u>ex
post facto</u> clause of the Constitution", for if it were, all
disqualification cases would have all been brushed aside on this account by one
stroke of the pen.</p>

<p class="BODY">The high regard I hold for democratic tenets and processes would
make my personal sympathy go for <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> if he had
indeed obtained more votes than <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, without fraud
or any other election irregularity <span style="">as </span>those
charged by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, and yet unable to assume office by
reason of disqualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The will of
the people, however, as expressed in the Constitution against "<span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>" may not be disregarded, even if only
momentarily in order to give effect to the supposedly winning votes cast by the
electorate of a given locality in favor of a certain candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The constitutional prohibition, like all
constitu­tional provisions, is mandatory and unyielding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It constitutes a basic, permanent and
continuing expression of the will of the people, unlike a passing fancy or
preference for, certain candidates expressed at intervals of time when
elections are held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, my commitment
as a member of the Supreme Court, the judicial guardian of the Constitution,
leaves me with no choice but to subordinate my personal sympathy to the
supremacy of the fundamental law.</p>

<p class="BODY">I have always felt that it might be doing a disservice to the
cause of effective government if the different agencies created by the
Constitution were to treat each other with distrust and suspicion, and not with
benign confidence and gentle faith that all of them are equally striving to ful<span style="">fill their responsibility in their respective
domain with the highest degree of integrity, competence, impartiality and good
faith, entirely without malice, bias or prejudice for or against any person or
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same spirit that animated me
to write a separate opinion in the case of <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span> vs.
</span>COMELEC, <span style="">et al,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> has moved me to write this opinion, in a
desire to maintain the faith and trust of the people in the COMELEC, not to
contribute, even if only un­wittingly, to their erosion as might happen when
its good faith and impartiality </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">placed
under a cloud of doubt for whatever error it may have committed, to which like
this Court itself and all other human institutions, it is suscep­tible, not
being endowed with the attribute of infallibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, I said in the <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span>
case where certain official actua­tions of </span>COMELEC <span style="">were also placed under severe scrutiny before
this Court </span><span style="">after </span><span style="">the 1978 elections:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We must refrain from imputing to the COMELEC which has been
enlarged with fresh man­date and a bigger trust by the Constitution failure in
the performance of its functions by willful neglect, official incompetence,

capability."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It must be to the credit of COMELEC that it has just recently
proclaimed NP Candidate Elias B. Lopez <span style="">as </span><span style="">Mayor
</span>of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, whose proclamation it has
suspended on peti­tion of KBL Candidate Luis T. Santos, on the ground that
numerous voters were unable to vote because of rampant terrorism which it found
to be well-founded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered a new
election to be held in a widely affected area, and the Supreme Court affirmed
its decision for a new election <span style="">to </span>be
held, but only in some portions of said area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This the COMELEC did after realizing the impracticability of holding the
new elections, because the state of peace and order of the affected area has
not improved but worsened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this act,
COMELEC had clearly demonstrated its capacity for <span class="SpellE">fairnets</span>,
justice and impartiality, which, from the very start, as may be gleaned from
the above quoted portion of the very first separate opinion I wrote upon my
joining this Court, <span style="">I have nurtured
hopes, would continually mark and unceasingly characterize its </span><span style="">work </span><span style="">and service to the nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">my well-considered opinion that the
Commission has not failed in that hope and in the expectation of the people at
large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>C.J.</i>:<u><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be admitted that there is support for the conclusion
reached based on the appraisal of the facts as set forth in the majority opinion
penned with his usual clarity by Justice Aquino. It cannot be denied either
that once there be acceptance of the proclamation of respondent Dizon, reliance
on the now prevailing doctrine given full expression in Aguinaldo v. Commission
on Elections leads to such a result. Nonetheless, I find myself unable to yield
my assent <span style="">in view of what I consider to
be the failure of respon­dent Commission on Elections to heed and comply with a
restraining order issued by this Court as early as February 6, 1980. Without,
therefore, joining dissent­ing Justices Teehankee and Abad Santos in their
condem­nation in strongly-worded terms of the actuation of respondent
Commission on Elections, it is my belief that it could have acted with more
prudence and circum­spection on the matter and thus avoid what on its face was
a failure to abide by what was ordered by this Court. In therefore, dissenting
from the exhaustive and able opinion of the Court, I am inclined to follow the
approach taken by Justice Melencio-Herrera. I reach the same conclusion as she
did that for the </span><span style="">present, </span><span style="">it would be premature for either petitioner
Ticzon and respondent Dizon to discharge the functions of city mayor. I shall
explain why.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. There is still need it seems, to recall fundamentals at times.
This is one of them. The categorical affirmation of Chief Justice Marshall in
the landmark decision, Marbury v. Madison, comes to mind: "It is
emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the
law is."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">That is the basis for the exercise of the
function of judicial review, which is a corollary to the cardinal postulate
that the Constitution is the fundamental</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">law. In the leading
case of Angara v. Electoral Commission, Justice Laurel spoke of this peculiarly
American doctrine imposing upon the judiciary the duty of enforcing the
Constitution in the determination of actual cases and controversies.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Such a principle is the necessary
consequence of the supremacy of the Constitution, with the Supreme Court, in
the last analysis, as its guardian. There is this <u>caveat.</u> It can act as
such only when it exercises its judicial function. This Tribunal then cannot
avoid its sworn duty to give effect to its mandates.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It must not sanction a constitutional
breach.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It should strike down legislative or
executive acts in conflict with the fundamental law.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It can, of course, on the other hand affirm
their validity. The function of judicial review has thus both a checking and a
legitimating aspect.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2. Nor is the fundamental concept of the Supreme Court as the
ultimate arbiter on questions of law limited only to issues of constitutional
dimensions. In all other cases where it has to <span style="">rule on a legal question, it can speak authoritatively. It may change
its view as it has the right to. As long, however, as a resolution issued by
this Tribunal stands in force and unreversed, it must be obeyed. If it were
otherwise, the rule of law becomes a myth. It would, at the very least, erode
respect for jural norms as traditionally, conceived in all legal systems. An
excerpt from an opinion of Justice J.B.L. Reyes in Albert v. Court of </span><span style="">First </span><span style="">Instance</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> has relevance. Thus: "Judge Gaudencio
Cloribel need not be reminded that the Supreme Court, by tradition and in our
system of judicial administration, has the last word on what the law is; it is
the final arbiter of any justiciable controversy. There is only one Supreme
Court from whose decisions all other courts should take their bearings".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> That such </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">principle obtains in
the United States is quite evident upon a cursory perusal of such recent
American Supreme Court decisions as Cooper v. Aaron,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">Baker
v. Carr,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Powell v. McCormack,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and United States v. Nixon.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is worth noting that in Aaron, the
opinion of the Court was quite unique. It is not only that it is a unanimous
decision but also that the nine Justices of the Court from Chief Justice Burger
down to the most Junior Justice, Justice Whitaker, were </span><u><span style="">ponentes.</span></u><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">3. Let there be no misunderstanding. There is no thought of
interfering in any wise or form with the prerogative vested by the Constitution
in the Commission on Elections. Its independence must be preserved --but not to
the extent of allowing it to follow a course of conduct contrary to order of
this Court. For the wide discretion it enjoys is subject to this specific
provision of the Constitution: "Any decision, order, or ruling of the
Commission may be brought to the Supreme Court <span style="">on </span><i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style=""> </span>by the aggrieved party within thirty
days from his receipt of a copy thereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
When, therefore, a case is properly before us, <span style="">it must </span>ever be alert to avoid the slightest suspicion that it
pays no heed to what this Court has required it to do. There must be awareness
that this Tribunal is entitled to and must insist on obedience to its judgments
or resolutions. Any other view would <span style="">entail
pernicious consequences to the rule of law. Confronted as it was by the
February 5, 1980 Resolution with its restraining order, it should have filed a
petition with this Court to have it lifted. Then it would have avoided the serious
predicament in which it finds itself at present. There is plausibi­</span><span style="">lity, it </span><span style="">must be conceded, to its submission that such
restraining order came too late. At the most, that would only be </span><span style="">indicative </span><span style="">of its good faith. Thereafter, knowing that this Court had assumed
jurisdiction, the proper and lawful thing to do was to avoid any hasty action
which could be characterized as a failure to accord this Court the respect due
it. So constitutiona­lism mandates.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence my concurrence in the dissent of Justice Melencio-Herrera,
coupled with the hope that respon­dent Commission, perhaps not laboring under
the time pressure that plagued it in the 1980 election would <span style="">not, in the future, be found lacking in that
degree of care and circumspection to avoid a recurrence of this deplorable
situation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Laguna, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> Cesar P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
(then incumbent Mayor) were the respective NP and KBL official candidates for
the position of City Mayor of San Pablo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to said elections, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> were
respondents in cases for disqualification on the ground of poli­tical <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> before respondent COMELEC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In PDC 235 entitled <span class="SpellE">Cosico</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>, it was alleged that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> did not resign from his former political party, the
Liberal Party, and became a member of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party only on December 31, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In PDC
166, entitled <span class="SpellE">Armedilla</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>,
it was alleged that <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
was a member of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party until he filed
his candidacy for City Mayor as the KBL candidate on <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 31, 1980, <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> filed a Petition with respondent COMELEC alleging
that prior to the elections many registered voters in the permanent list of
voters were not included in the certified list of voters prepared for each
voting center, so that thousands of registered voters were disenfranchised and
not able to vote on Election Day, and who, if able to vote, would mate­rially
alter the results of the election particularly with respect to the position of
City Mayor; that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> had resorted to
wide­spread <span class="GramE">vote-buying</span> and had employed strong-arm
tactics; and that the election returns appear to be tampered, altered or
falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> thus prayed to <u>suspend</u> <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> the canvassing of the election returns, more
particularly that of City Mayor, and to <u>suspend</u> <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> the proclamation of the candidate elect and/or to
annul any proclamation already made, more particularly that of City Mayor of
San Pablo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the aforesaid Petition of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, respondent COMELEC issued a directive on <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1980</st1:date> addressed to the
Provincial Election Officer of Laguna, the pertinent portion of which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"You are hereby directed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To</span> stop the canvassing of the votes
for city positions from Mayor, vice?mayor and Member of <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panglungsod</span> in the
City of <st1:city><st1:place>San Pablo</st1:place></st1:city> and that no
canvass or proclamation shall he undertaken until further orders from the
Commission.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="2"><span style="">February
 4, </span>1980</st1:date>, petitioner filed <span style="">a </span>Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, Injunction with Preliminary
Injunction (G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-52451) with this Court questioning the
<span class="SpellE"><span style="">aforequoted</span></span><span style=""> directive </span><span style="">of </span>respondent COMELEC as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of
section 175 of the 1978 Election Code.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2"><span style="">February
 5, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, we issued a
Restraining Order reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Acting on the petition, the court RESOLVED <span style="">in </span>the light of the provisions of the
Election Code and the applicable jurisprudence <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> to
restrain the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Comelec</span></span><span style=""> from enforcing </span>the said direct<span style="">ive </span>insofar as it suspended the canvas<span style="">sing, and to direct the city board of
canvassers to proceed with the canvas­sing of the election returns."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the issuance of
said </span>Restraining Order, which was served on COMELEC on <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1980</st1:date>, that poll body
became fully aware <span style="">of the controversy
before this Court and of the Restraining Order issued herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, COMELEC continued to take <span style="">steps the results of which tended to make the
pending case before </span>this Court moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, </span>on <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="2"><span style="">February <span style="">6, 1980</span></span></st1:date><span style="">, it replaced </span><span style="">the City board of canvassers with a <span style="">new board of canvassers composed of </span>3
COMELEC lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="2"><span style="">February
 7, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, it
transferred the <span style="">place </span>of canvass
<span style="">from </span></span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San Pablo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> to </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="2"><span style="">February
 11, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><span style="">it ordered a re-c</span>anvass
<span style="">of election returns previously canvassed
by the former Board <span style="">of Canvassers and </span>to
continue canvassing election returns not as yet <span style="">canvassed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span></span><st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="2"><span style="">February
 12, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, it
disqualified petitioner <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span style="">A. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> for <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> on the basis of </span>pleadings and exhibits
and <span style="">without a full-dress hearing,
considered the votes cast for him as </span>stray votes, and directed the City
Board of Canvassers of San Pablo City to proclaim </span>the <span style="">remaining winning <span style="">candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span></span><st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="2"><span style="">February 15, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was proclaimed winner by </span><span style="">the City Board of Canvassers <span style="">with "no opponent." And this,
notwithstanding the manifestation by Asst. Solicitor General Vicente </span></span>Mendoza
<span style="">at the hearing before this Court in the
afternoon of February 15, 1980, of the COMELEC officials assurance that
implementation of the Resolution disqualifying peti­tioner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
and directing the proclamation of the remaining candidate would be suspended
pending this Court's action on his petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The end result </span>was <span style="">that
the canvassing of the election returns ordered </span>by this Court,
undoubtedly to include the votes of <u>both</u> <span class="GramE">contestants,</span>
was completely thwarted.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote, therefore, to grant the Petitions, the actuations of the
COMELEC having been contrary to the spirit and intendment of our Restraining
Order of <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation of Cesar P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as Mayor of San Pablo City should be set aside with
the elected Vice-Mayor assuming office in the meantime; a canvass of the votes
of <u>both</u> candidates should be held pursuant to the Restrain­ing Order of
this Court dated February 5, 1980; and the disqualification case against <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> should be remanded to the COMELEC for a full-dress
hearing, or that issue ventilated anew in the <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span>
proceeding filed by <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> against <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> with the COMELEC.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. This is a sorry tale that will go into the record books as the
case where <u>three (3)</u> successive restraining orders issued <u>unanimously</u>
by the Supreme Court enjoining enforcement of an <u>equal</u> num­ber of
successive <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolutions arbitrarily issued <u>ex
<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u> <u>after</u> the elections (1) suspending
the canvass of the election returns of San Pablo City (to prevent the
proclamation of the winner); (2) replacing the original board of canvassers
with a new and more pliant board and transferring the venue of the canvassing to
Manila; and (3) disqualify­ing the winning mayoralty candidate <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> for alleged <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> and directing the board to proclaim the loser
Cesar P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> "as the remaining winning
candidate"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
have been <u>grossly disregarded and violated by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>,
and yet the Supreme Court has dismally fail­ed (by a vote of seven [7]
members<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>against</u> to four [4]
members <u>for</u>) to en­force its own restraining orders and compel
compliance therewith.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. This case marks the <u>nadir</u> of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Comelec's</u></span><u>
credibility</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos' separate dissent says it all: "This is
another instance where the Commission on Elections did not live up to the high
expectations of the people and of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The vast power entrusted to the COMELEC by the Constitution and statutes
should have given it a sober sense of responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead it has even dealt unfairly with this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Add to this its flip-flopping
reso­lutions and we have a constitutional body whose credibility has been
seriously eroded."</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Before, the <u>loser's</u> tactic was to "grab
proclamation at all costs and prolong the protest." Now, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has refused to <u>even count</u> the votes of the <u>winner</u>
(in <u>gross violation</u> of the Court's <u>standing</u> <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1980</st1:date> restraining order) and enabled
the loser to grab not only the <u>proclamation</u> but the <u>election</u> as
well with <u>not</u> even a right of <u>protest</u> by the winner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did
this by an arbitrary <u>post-election</u> disqualification of the winner as a
"turncoat" <u>from</u> the <u>Liberal</u> Party (which had <u>boycotted</u>
the elections as well as the pre­vious 1973 elections and was considered by the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> itself as "<u>in­existent</u>") to <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party and ordering the proclamation of the
loser as "the remaining winning candidate" with "<u>no opponent</u>."
There might as well have been no elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the words of the late Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro, the loser
"continues to <u>fraudulently</u> <u>represent</u> the people who had in
law and in fact <u>duly elected someone </u>else to represent them."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, the prevailing doctrine since the 1912 case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Topacio</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that the repudiated loser who succeeds in disqualifying the winner is not
entitled to be proclaimed, much less to assume office, since he has not
received the majority of the votes cast in the elections as well as the
sovereign will of the San Pablo electorate have simply been disregarded and
swept aside without even a passing nod.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. As early as one day <u>after</u> the elections on January 31,
1980, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> already exhibited the loser's perennial
tantrums and filed his petition with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> "for
suspension of the canvass and proclamation or for <u>nullification</u> of the
election with the usual cries of "disenfranchise­ment and widespread
vote-buying" notwithstanding the vast powers at his disposal as incumbent
KBL mayor and the utter lack of any authentic <u>election day</u> reports of
such alleged irregularities which the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
certainly would have attended to, considering the alacrity with which the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> accommodated his every petition after the elections
to thwart the winner as this case shows.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(See decision at pages 5-6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <u>without</u> the notice and hearing required by
Section 175 of the 1978 Election Code forthwith accommodated him in its
peremptory order of February 1, 1980 directing that "no canvass or
proclamation shall be undertaken until further orders" which the Court <u>set
aside</u> in February 5, 1980 restraining order ordering the board to proceed
with and terminate the canvassing - <u>futilely</u>, as it turned out now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For where other agencies and subordinate
courts generally refrain, as matter of deference, from taking any action on
questions pending with this Court even where <u>no</u> restraining order is
issued by this Court, here in <u>gross disregard</u> of the <u>two</u>
restraining orders of February 5 and 14, 1980 and still the <u>third</u>
restraining order that was issued right after the Court's hearing of February
15, 1980, as well as of the Solicitor General's assurance given solemnly on its
behalf, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <u>raced</u> to beat the force
and effects of the said orders, and has gotten away with it, as well as beaten
the contempt charges filed against it and the canvassing board which the
plurality decision has just ignored.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. At the same time, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
whimsically refused to disqualify the loser <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> on
the <span class="SpellE">Armedilla</span> petition for "petitioner's failure
to present sufficient evidence, " when <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span>
(who was <u>elected</u> mayor as the <u>official</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span>
Party candidate in the 1967 and 1971 elections but in the last 1980 elections
turned coat and ran as <u>official KBL</u> candidate) was patently guilty of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> for <u>changing</u> his political party
affiliation <u>during</u> his <u>term</u> of office against the express
prohibition of Article XII C, Section 10 of the 1973 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The plurality's decision has disregarded their pledge during our deliberations of
applying the same measure of "<span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>"
to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and necessarily also disqualifying him.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. What is worse, <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> abrupt
disqualification of the winner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was against the
President's own post-election order to "the lawyers of the KBL to <u>withdraw
all disqualification charges</u> to allow already proclaimed opposition
candidates involved in such cases to assume office without prejudice to filing
an election protest."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Questioned about such order, <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> counsel replied
that the order was just a newspaper order and they did not receive it.</p>

<p class="NUM">7. The core issue at bar is the validity and fairness of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> post-election disqualification of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> as a turncoat for having run as an <u>oppositionist</u>
Liberal in 1971 and <u>nine years later</u> as an <u>oppositionist</u> <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> in 1980 against the <u>dominant KBL</u> candi­date,
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, who had been elected in both the 1967 and 1971
elections as the <u>then</u> <u>dominant</u> <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
official candidate.</p>

<p class="NUM">(a) The said disqualification of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
should be <u>dismissed out­right</u> by this Court for <u>lack of substantial
evidence </u>(see my Memoran­dum to the Court of <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="3">March 25, 1980</st1:date>, reproduced hereunder, at pages 4-5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Potencion</u></span><u>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
involving the governorship of the Province of Aurora, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
as sustained in the comment filed by the Solicitor General on its behalf,
"dismissed the disqualification case against respondent for <u>switching</u>
<u>from Liberal Party</u> (under which he was elected) to the KBL on the ground
that 'the Liberal Party may be deemed to have become <u>inexistent</u> as it did
<u>not</u> nominate candidates both in the <u>elections</u> of <u>1978 and 1980</u>.'"
But the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <u>inconsistently</u> flip-flopped
here and did not equally apply this reasoning and in the case of the winner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> who became <span class="SpellE">partyless</span> and
switched from the "<u>inexistent</u>" Liberal Party <u>not</u> to the
<u>dominant KBL</u> (as the loser <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> did,
switching from the <u>former</u> majority <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party under which he was elected) but to the <u>opposition</u> <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This action of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> violates the very
spirit of the cited cons­titutional prohibition against turn <span class="SpellE">coatism</span>, which is to curtail opportunism and desertion of
the opposition ranks;</p>

<p class="NUM">(b) The <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> disqualification of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> likewise denied him "the <u>rudimentary
requirements of fair play</u> [which] demand that [he] be afforded ample
opportunity to prove" his defenses against the charge of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> - to borrow the very phrase of Mr. Justice
Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> for a unanimous Court in <u>Gonzales
vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
In setting aside therein the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> disqualification
of the winner of the election for the mayoralty of <span class="SpellE">Polangui</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, and the proclama­tion of the loser (because
the winner's votes were considered as stray votes and not counted, as in <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> case here), Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
pointed out that he was denied procedural due process: "(T)he <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <u>disqualified Gonzales without hearing his
evidence</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It denied his mo­tion for
reconsideration in a <u>somewhat high-handed or cavalier man­ner</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did <u>not bother</u> to <u>resolve</u>
the <u>factual issues</u> raised in the affidavits supporting his motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>There is no find­ing
as to when the KBL became a duly accredited political party</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the release of the <u>disqualification</u>
resolution <u>on the eve of the election</u> was quite <u>unfair</u> and
disconcerting to Gonzales, " - which con­siderations are <u>fully
applicable</u> to the present case; and worse, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
was disqualified <u>16 days after</u> the <u>election</u> and on the <u>eve</u>
of his <u>proclama­tion</u>;</p>

<p class="NUM">(c) The <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> <u>post-election</u>
disqualification of the win­ner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> offends all
notions of fair play and equal protection as well as of substantive due process
and transgresses the constitutional injunc­tion that all "<u>bona fide
candidates</u> shall be <u>free</u> from any form of <u>harassment and
discrimination</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> case, like that of An­tonio O. <span class="SpellE">Singco</span> the opposition winner of the last mayoralty election
for <span class="SpellE">Ginatilan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> (whose
arbitrary post-election disqualification on February 26, 1980 by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> was <u>set aside</u> by a unanimous Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Singco</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>) was
arbitrarily, whimsically and discrimina­torily <u>plucked</u> by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from <u>hundreds</u> of pending disqualification
cases in order to <u>select</u> the losers as the winners with "<u>no
opponent</u>" by <u>disqualifying the elected</u> <u>winners</u> and not
counting their votes as "stray votes"; and</p>

<p class="NUM">(d) In <span class="SpellE"><u>Arcenas</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the Chief Justice, speaking for a <u>unanimous</u> Court, essayed to write <u>finis</u>
to all such pending disqualification cases still being utilized to harass the
winners and clear the Court's dockets by restating that "It is now the <u>prevailing
doctrine</u> that after an election duly held and a proclamation [of the
winner] thereafter made, a <u>pre-proclamation</u> controversy should <u>no
longer</u> be <u>viable</u>" and "resort [must] be had to the remedy
of an <u>election protest</u> or a quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>,
whichever is proper." This doctrine has been affirmed and reaffirmed in
all subsequent cases, the latest being <span class="SpellE"><u>Agcaoili</u></span><u>
vs. Santos and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
In this latest case, the Court thru the Chief Justice once again reiterated <u>election
day,</u> <u>January 30, 1980</u>, as the <u>cut-off date</u> and that <span class="SpellE"><u>disgualification</u></span><u> cases</u> which had <u>not been
acted upon</u> prior to <u>that date</u> by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
"should be <u>dismissed without prejudice</u> to such ground being passed
upon in a proper <u>election protest </u>or quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>
proceeding." Inexplicably, this settled doctrine has <u>not</u> been
applied to the present case of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> who should have
long been proclaimed the winner (since January 31st and at the latest in <u>February
of last year </u>pursuant to the Court's three restraining orders) and assumed
his rightful office pursuant to the electorate's verdict.</p>

<p class="NUM">8. In <u>Esquivel vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
a plurality of six members of the Court sanctioned the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
belated unseating of petitioner as mayor of <span class="SpellE">Palayan</span>
City despite the lapse of almost two months since his assumption of office, on
the ground that the canvassing board which proclaimed him was "illegally
constituted" and "as such its acts are pa­tent nullities without
force and effect in law" because its chairman, the election registrar, was
not a lawyer as directed by section 11 of B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
52, although said board was constituted according to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
own guidelines, which imposed no such requirement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then all the more so, should the
unjustifiable act of the new canvassing board of proclaim­ing <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as the "remaining winning candidate" with
"no opponent" be deemed a "patent nullity without force and
effect in law" by virtue of the Court's restraining orders of February 14
and 15, 1980 enjoining en­forcement of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
orders replacing the original board and ordering <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
"proclamation."</p>

<p class="NUM">9. The plurality decision's assertion (at page-8) that "this
Court's <u>second</u> restraining order of February 14, enjoining the canvass
by the newly constituted board of canvassers, was <u>useless</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <u>useless</u> because of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> prior resolution of February 12, disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and ordering the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span>
disqualification, there was no need to canvass or determine the votes for him
as tallied in the election returns,"<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
is <u>untenable</u>, <u>because</u>: -</p>

<p class="BODY">- The Court's <u>first</u> restraining order of February 5th
directed the canvassing board to disregard the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
suspension of the canvass and "to proceed with the canvassing" and
count, of course, the votes of <u>both</u> <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, and the board acknowledged the same and
pledged compliance therewith in its February 7th telegram;</p>

<p class="BODY">- This triggered the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
arbitrary order <u>replacing</u> the original board and transferring the venue
to Manila, which was also enjoined by the Court's <u>second</u> restraining
order of February 14th; and hence, the new board was "<u>illegally
constituted</u>" and its acts were "patent nullities" - in the
language of <u>Esquivel</u>, <u>supra</u>;</p>

<p class="BODY">- This Court's <u>second</u> restraining order of February 14th
can hardly be <u>downgraded</u> as "<u>useless</u>". <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> <u>11th hour disqualification</u> by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution dated February 12, 1980 but <u>released
only</u> on <u>February 14, 1980</u> when the canvassing showed <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> with an <u>insurmountable margin</u> of <u>2,994
votes</u> with only 62 more precincts to be tallied was another "patent
nullity" in <u>gross violation</u> of the Court's <u>first</u> restraining
order, which <u>ordered</u> that the board and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
<u>canvass <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> votes</u>, as well as of the
Court's <u>third</u> restraining order of February 15th which <u>expressly</u>
enjoined enforcement of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> 11th hour <u>disqualification</u>
of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>;</p>

<p class="BODY">- As <u>admitted</u> in the plurality decision, (at pages 7 and
8), the Court's second restraining order restraining the canvass in Manila by
the new board "was <u>[timely</u>] served in (sic) the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>

that it took up to <u>4:30 p. m. that day</u> for the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
records section to send a copy of the restraining order to its Law Department,
which in turn took <u>more than 24 hours</u> until 5:30 p.m. of the <u>next</u>

<p class="BODY">- For on <u>that very afternoon of February 15th</u>, the Court
was <u>hearing <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> urgent petition</u> for a

Appeals Justice, Vicente V. Mendoza in representation of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <span class="SpellE"><u>solemly</u></span><u>

order to proclaim <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as the only remaining

Mendoza was so visibly shocked when it turned out that as he gave his assurance
at the hearing, the new board was at that very hour <u>rushing</u> its proclamation
of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, that at the subsequent hearing of February
26, 1980 to set aside <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> proclamation and to
hold the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in contempt, he candidly stated to
the Court that on his own, he was recommending to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
and to this Court the <u>setting aside</u> of <span class="SpellE">Di­zon's</span>
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Callous proof of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> forfeiture of "a sober sense of
responsibility" is its obdurate failure to heed its own counsel's
recommendation and set aside <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> railroaded"
proclama­tion" against its chairman's plighted word.</p>

<p class="BODY">- No matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the nullity of said proclama­tion and the
brazenly oppressive and arbitrary action of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
it lies within the inherent power of the Court to enforce its restraining order
against the parties who were <u>racing</u> to beat the order and to set aside
the "proclamation" and restore the <u>status quo</u>, as this Court
has done in many such other cases.</p>

<p class="NUM">10. The plurality decision's pronouncements to the effect that the

"there is no justifica­tion for this Court to interfere with the actions

manifests the Court's reluctance to disturb the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>

finding <u>cannot</u> be "binding and conclusive on this Court, " as asserted
by the plurality decision (at page 13).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Contrary</u>
to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> incorrect statement, the <u>documentary
evidence of record</u> amply shows that both former Con­gressman Manuel
Concordia as LP chairman for the Laguna first con­gressional district and LP
president Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> had submitted <u>sworn
statements</u> that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> had been <u>expelled </u>from
the Liberal Party for having run as a <u>rebel</u> Liberal candidate in the <u>1971</u>
elections (resulting in the victory of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>

disgruntled official Liberal Party candidate, ex-vice mayor Pedro <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span> upon whose barren affidavit the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>

remained with the Liberal Party" which the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
itself had held to be now "<u>inexistent</u>" since it had not
participated in the 1978 and 1980 elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So how could <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> be a turncoat from an
"<u>inexistent</u>" Liberal Party?) The plurality deci­sion itself
does <u>not</u> even mention these vital documents that reveal the <span class="SpellE">baselessness</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>

"(T)he proposition that this Court should sparingly use its power of

correct but this is one case where we should firmly exercise our power because
of the <u>flip-flopping</u> resolutions of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>."
These "flip-flopping" resolutions have had to be "<u>interfered

out in my separate concurrence that "Respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>

P. Mendoza takes the position that '(I)t is worth noting that the people of <span class="SpellE">Pozorrubio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> have

disregarded by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u> as may be seen from
the following sum­mary.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. On <u>February 1, 1980</u> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
Chairman <u>without any given reason</u> issued a directive to the provincial
election officer of Laguna "to <u>stop the canvassing</u> of the votes for
city positions from Ma­yor, Vice-Mayor and Members of <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Panglungsod</span> in the City of San Pablo and that <u>no
canvass or proclamation</u> shall be undertaken until further orders from this
Commission." Upon petition of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
who attached thereto the quick-count certificate based on the du­plicate
originals of election returns of San Pablo City as submitted by the chairman of
the Citizens' Election Committee showing that <span class="SpellE"><u>Ticzon</u></span>
had <u>won</u> the mayoralty by a majority of 2,204 votes <u>together with his
entire <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> ticket</u>, the Court issued its <u>restraining
order of February 5, 1980</u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"restraining the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from enforcing
the said directive insofar as it suspended the canvassing" and
"directing the City Board of Canvassers to<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>proceed with the canvassing</u> of the election returns "</p>

<p class="NUM">2. While the City Board of Canvassers in a telegram dated February
7, 1980 informed this Court that it would comply with said restraining order,
petitioner filed an urgent motion on February 8, 1980 complaining that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> <u>without</u> any explanation <u>changed</u> the <u>original
composition</u> of the Board of Canvassers and designated in their stead three
(3) lawyers who arrived at San Pablo City to com­ply with still another
directive of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to <u>bring the election
returns</u>, and other records <u>to Manila</u> for the canvassing
notwithstanding that untoward<span style="">&nbsp; </span>incident
had been reported nor any anomaly recorded during the canvassing by the
original Board of Canvasser that was peremptorily suspended by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
issued its <u>restraining order of February 14, 1980</u> enjoining the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from enforcing (its) directive that the canvassing
of the election returns be conducted by a new Board of Canvassers in Manila at
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> Election and <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Affairs Department (instead of by the City Board of Canvassers in San Pablo
City ).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second restraining order of

motion to stop the returns from being transferred to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The new Board of Canvassers escorted by
heavily armed troopers had lost no time in taking possession the ballot boxes
and transporting them in a <u>closed van</u> to which the as­signed NP
representative was denied access. </p>

<p class="NUM">3. On <u>February 15, 1980</u>, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
had to file a still more urgent petition complaining that on the preceding day,
<u>February 14, 1980</u>, while the new Board of Canvassers was still in the
process of canvassing results from 213 voting centers out of a total of 275
which had been already tallied showing that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
was leading his opponent <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
(the incum­bent KBL mayor) by an <u>insurmountable margin</u> of 2,994 votes
(22, 871 votes for <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and 19,877 votes for <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>) with only 62 election returns not yet canvassed
which <u>could not</u> affect the result, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
released its resolution dated February 12,1980 granting a voter's petition for
the <u>disqualification of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span></u> for alleged <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> (while at the same time <u>leaving unresolved</u>
another voter's petition for the <u>disqualification of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span></u>
who had been elected as mayor as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> in
1971 and changed his political affiliation to KBL on January 3, 1980) and

Canvassers of the city of San Pablo to consider all votes cast in favor of

enjoining the enforcement of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
"directive that the canvass of the election returns be conducted by a new

of Ce­sar P. <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> as Mayor of San Pablo City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2. <span style=""> </span>I am for the <u>continuance</u> of the canvass

</span>

<div class="Section2">

<blockquote>"3. <span style=""> </span>If <span class="SpellE"><u>Ticzon</u></span>
turns out to have the plurality of votes and the question of his
disqualification is not resolved by the COMELEC in a full dress hearing be­fore
March 3, 1980, he <u>should be proclaimed</u> as the duly elected Mayor of San
Pablo City and allowed to assume office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proclamation

<blockquote>"My position in the <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> case
applies to all other similar cases pending before us, and I request that you

<p class="BODY">Even if we were to apply solely the <u>criterion</u> of <u>substantial</u>
<u>evidence</u>, I hold that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> is entitled to an
<u>outright dismissal</u> by this Court of the disqualification case against
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
in its belated re­solution of disqualification of <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1980</st1:date> disqualified <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
on the following rationale:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
appears from the pleadings and ex­hibits that on <u>December 28, 1979</u>
respondent filed his certificate of candidacy as an <u>Independent</u> (Exhibit
'B').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That on <u>December 31, 1979</u>,
he withdrew his Certificate of Candidacy (Exhibit 'C') and on January 7, 1980,
he filed his second certificate of candidacy as a member of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Nacionalista</u></span><u> Party</u> (Exhibit 'D').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that on <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="11"><u>November 8, 1971</u></st1:date>, he filed his
certificate of can­didacy for Mayor in <st1:place><st1:placename>San Pablo</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, as a member of the <u>Liberal
Party</u> (Exhibit 'A').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records do
not disclose that he <u>resigned</u> his membership from the said Liberal
Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was he <u>expelled</u>
from his party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary the <u>affidavit</u>
of Ex-Vice Mayor Pedro <span class="SpellE">Magcase</span> shows respondent
remained with the Liberal Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>All</u>
<u>other documentary evidence on record</u> indicate his con­tinuance as member
of good standing of the Liberal Party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">But the <span class="SpellE"><u>Comelec's</u></span><u>
statement</u> was <u>far from fair nor complete</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <u>failed</u> to mention the evidence of
record that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> had run as a <u>rebel</u> Liberal
candidate in 1971 for the same office of mayor by virtue of which he was <u>expelled
from the Liberal Party</u> as attested in a <u>verified statement</u> of <u>former
Congressman Manuel Concordia</u> then <u>Liberal Party district chair­man</u>
for the Laguna first congressional district and in the <u>sworn certificate of
Sen. Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></u>, <u>president of the Liberal
Party</u>, <u>confirming</u> such <u>expulsion.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It failed to mention further that it had <u>failed
to act</u> on the <u>pending</u> petition for <u>disqualification against <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span></u> for being an NP turncoat who changed his party
affiliation to KBL only upon filing of his certificate of candidacy on <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>Solicitor General's answer</u> to the
petition assailing the questioned disqualification resolution is a bit more
candid, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Even if, as argued, <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should not have relied on
this evidence alone but should, likewise, consider the affidavit of Manuel Concordia,
the contents of which are certified to by Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
the result would substantially be the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <u>two affidavits</u> would merely <u>offset and neutralize</u> <u>each
other</u> which would leave the following undisputed facts: that petitioner was
a <u>Liberal in 1971 and that on </u><st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="1"><u>January
 7, 1980</u></st1:date><u> he filed his certificate of candidacy as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candidate</u>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The undisputed facts that remain after
mutual neutralizing or offsetting of the contradictory affidavits as stated by
the Solicitor General should be that <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> was a
Liberal in 1971 and that on <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="1">January 7,
 1980</st1:date> or <u>9 years later</u> he filed his certificate of candidacy
as a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> candi­date after having filed an
earlier certificate of candidacy as an indepen­dent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <u>bare evidence</u> certainly <u>cannot
constitute in any language substantial evidence</u> that would warrant his
disqualification for <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it amply shows that he had <u>long
left</u> his party affiliation of a <u>Liberal</u> which incidentally was <u>not
taking part</u> in the elections since it had <u>boycotted</u> the same as well
as the <u>1978 Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
elections.</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the possible argument that may be raised that these pro­ceedings
have become moot since <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> has already been
proclaimed and assumed office is of no consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>We</u> have already <u>issued</u> a good
num­ber of restraining orders <u>setting aside such assumption office pending
our determination</u> of the cases before us <u>as in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Yason</span> et al</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but in accordance with <u>settled
precedents</u> such as the resolution that we issued on December 10, 1973 in
L-37384, <u>Villegas vs. Salvador</u>, wherein "upon motion of petitioner,
the Court RESOLVED to clarify the writ of preliminary injunction issued on
October 19, 1973, enjoining the respondent judge from enforcing his decision
dated June 15, 1973 in Civil Case No. C-2261 and private respondent Domingo de
Jesus from continuing further in exercising the office as councilor of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to the effect
that said writ of preliminary injunction affirms the right of and authorizes
petitioner Villegas to assume and exercise the office of councilor of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, until further
orders, pursuant to Section 218 of Republic Act No. 6388, otherwise known as
the Election Code of 1971." The Court's authority to uphold its
restraining orders or injunctions so as to <u>restore matters</u> to the <u>status
quo</u> in cases <u>where the adverse party has beaten the injunction or
restraining order</u> has consist­ently been affirmed by us as in <span class="SpellE"><u>Banzon</u></span><u> vs. Cruz</u> (45 SCRA 506), where we
reaffirmed that "<u>the Court</u> does <u>not</u> look with favor upon <u>parties
'racing to beat an injunction or restraining order</u>' which they have reason
to believe might be <u>forthcoming</u> from the Court by virtue of the filing
and <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appropriate petition <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the
restraining or­der or preliminary injunction are found to have been properly
issued, as in the case at bar, <u>mandatory writs</u> shall be issued by the
Court to <u>res­tore matters</u> to the <u>status quo ante</u>."</p>

<p class="NUM">II. <u>Disqualification cases.</u> - All <u>such pre-election cases</u>
seeking to <u>disqualify the winner</u> on the ground of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>
should be <u>dismissed subject</u> to the filing of an appropriate <u>quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span></u> action or election protest against the winner
in the appropriate forum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I believe that
this is the only practical course for the Court to follow (as indicated by
Justice Vicente <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos in his vote) if we are to
<u>get on with the Court's business</u> in the other equally important cases
that confront us and if we are to <u>remove the spectacle</u> where two months
after the elections of January 30th the <u>real winners</u> in some localities
are <u>still <span class="SpellE">unproclaimed</span></u> or have not yet assumed
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The President</u> seems to
share this view, having been reported in the <st1:date year="1980" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1980</st1:date> newspapers to have "<u>ordered the
lawyers of the KBL to withdraw all disqualification charges</u> to allow
already proclaimed opposition candidates involved in such cases to assume
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with the withdrawal of
these cases, the KBL lawyers can still <u>reserve</u> the right to file an <u>election
protest</u>, the President said.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
President noted</u> the <u>numerous <span class="SpellE">disqualifacation</span>
cases filed by the KBL</u> against some <u>winning opposition candidates</u>."
This position is based on a good number of compelling considerations which we
may in the main briefly summarize, as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The <u>people's will</u> and <u>undeniable right to have
officials of their unfettered choice</u> should be <u>respected</u> in the
meantime and <u>innocent voters</u> should <u>not</u> be deprived of their
votes <u>without any fault on their part</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What I said in the <u>Pimentel</u> case applies to all other cases <u>mutatis
mutandis</u>, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As the Court has consistently held in an unbroken line of
cases, <u>'after</u> the termination of the election, <u>public interest</u>
must be made to <u>prevail over that of the defeated candidate</u>' (De Guzman vs.
Board of Canvassers, 48 Phil 211 [1925], citing <span class="SpellE">Lino</span>
Luna vs. Rodriguez, 39 Phil 208 [1918].<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As stressed by the now Chief Justice in <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span> (27 SCRA 121 [1969], 'it is [the peo­ple's]
undeniable right to have officials of their unfettered choice.' Thus, we have
invariably held that <u>the will of the electorate should ever be respected</u>,
<u>not defeated or frustrated</u> by <u>material defects</u> in the winning
candidates certificate of candidacy (including <u>one not</u> being a <u>registered
elector</u> in the <u>very municipality</u> where he was <u>nevertheless
elected</u> president of <span class="SpellE">Meycauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Yra</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Abaño</span>, 52 Phil 380 [1928]),
which while <u>mandatory before</u> the elections (and would therefore render
null and void the certificate of candidacy) were held to be <u>directory only
after</u> the election, as otherwise 'innocent voters we deprived of their
votes without any fault on their part.' (<span class="SpellE"><u>Lino</u></span><u>
Luna</u>, supra; also <span class="SpellE">Canceran</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 107 Phil 607 [1960], <span class="SpellE">Corocoro</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Bascara</span>, 9 SCRA 522 [1963], <span class="SpellE">Pungutan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Abubakar</span>, 43 SCRA 11 [1972]; and <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, Jr. vs. <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>, 72 SCRA
170 [1976]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consistently with the above-cited jurisprudence, and with the
Court's now setting aside the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> summary
resolution of January 28, 1980 disqualifying Pimentel by not giving due course
to his certificate of candidacy for al­leged <span class="SpellE"><u>turncoatism</u></span>
(when he has always been identified with the oppositionist cause and has now
been elected as such but which was restrained in our Order of January 29, 1980,
the <u>summary case</u> in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has now become
<span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>,
with the electorate having been allowed to express <u>their sovereign will and
clear choice</u> of Pimentel at the elections (instead of what would have been
a <u>non-election</u> where the electorate could <u>not even vote yes or no</u>
for his <u>defeated opponent</u> who would have been the <u>remaining unopposed
candidate)</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now that Pimentel has
been over <span class="SpellE">whelmingly</span> elected, the only course left is
to file an election contest under section 189 of the 1978 Election Code."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. Equally important under the <u>prevailing doctrine</u> of <span class="SpellE"><u>Topacio</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span></u>
(23 Phil 238), the <u>repudiated candidate and loser</u> in the election who <u>succeeds
in disqualifying the winner</u> is <u>not entitled</u> to be <u>proclaimed</u>
much less to <u>assume office</u>, since he has <u>not</u> received the
plurality of the votes cast in the elections. If during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of an action for disqualification, no one qualifies for the questioned position
(of mayor in the <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> case), under the law it is
the duly proclaimed and elected vice mayor who assumes the contested office
(section 8, Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
51).</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The <u>winning candidate</u> especially after he has received
the approbation of the electorate is entitled to <u>due process</u> and a <u>full-dress
hearing</u> so that the circumstances relied upon to sustain the charge of
alleged <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> may be duly threshed out <u>with
confrontation and ex­amination of witnesses</u> and his <u>good faith or bad
faith</u>, as the case may be, may be duly determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ticzon</u></span><u>
also has ground to complain</u> as he has in his urgent motion of March 1, 1980
where <u>unlike</u> other candidates <u>in the same situation</u> as his facing
charges of disqualification for <span class="SpellE">turn­coatism</span> such as
Pimentel of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>
City and <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span> in Sta. Rosa, Laguna, <u>these
candidates</u> notwithstanding their previous dis­qualification by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> were <u>nevertheless proclaimed</u> as winning
candidates by order of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> itself.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. There are a number of <u>vital facts</u> that have to be
established and duly taken into consideration in a full-dress hearing, among
them the lack of fair notice and suddenness with which the January 30th
elections were called when as late as November 21, 1979 it was being reported
by the newspapers that local elections have been set for December 7, 1980<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">1</span></span></a>
with the President having been reported on November 22, 1979 as notifying the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> that "local elections will be held either
before the end of next year 1980 or in early 1981<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a>
until <u>suddenly</u> on December 16, 1979 it was reported that the President
asked the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
to set the local elections for January 30th which was so fixed by the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 4, 1980, the deadline for filing
of certificates of candidacy, "the President was reported to 'uphold NP's
right to field candidates' stating that 'the po­licy should be to <u>allow
fair, free and open fight</u> among the aspirants from the gubernatorial to the
<span class="SpellE">sanggunian</span> position' and that 'it is obvious, the
President told newsmen, that in most places, the fight will be between the KBL
and the NP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'That would make the NP the
opposition in the coming elections, ' the President continued."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is important that all the
circumstances and facts be duly brought out because even in the cases of those
who were seeking an official nomination and affiliation as KBL candidates in
the light of the undisputed situation that during this entire period of martial
law - going into the 8th year now - the activities of political parties had
been suspended and there was <u>only one dominant organization</u> serving as
an <u>umbrella organization</u> which is the KBL which <u>admittedly was
organized as a political party only in December 1979 after the calling of the
elections</u> and that all local offi­cials held office at the pleasure of the
President and were exhorted to support the KBL organization and could be
removed even before the elec­tions as in fact a number of them were so removed
as in the case of the <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span> mayor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of <u>fairness and equal protection of the laws</u>
also comes into serious consideration when we take the case of <u>Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Edelmiro</span> <span class="SpellE">Amante</span></u> whose
contention before this Court was that he has always been a <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
and his <u>disqualification</u> by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from
running for the office of governor of his home province of Agustin del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> on the ground that he had been elected as a KBL
assemblyman was <u>set aside</u> by this Court and yet after the elections he
and a number of others who supported or ran as <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
candidates had been accepted back into the KBL ranks in the <span class="SpellE">Batasan</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>.</p>

<p class="NUM">5. Some of the KBL candidates with pending cases of disqualification
against them invoke P.D. 1667 decreed January 26, 1980 amending section 1 of P.
D. 1661 by inserting the proviso "that a person who participated as an
officer in the campaign of a political party, group <span class="SpellE">aggrupation</span>
in the immediately preceding elections shall be deemed a member of such party
as of the date of the political campaign for pur­poses of nomination as
official candidate of such party in succeeding elec­tions. " The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in the cases resolved by it in favor of the KBL
candidates has simply dismissed the petitions of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>
"for lack of sufficient basis" without invoking P. D. 1667.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this P. D. has been assailed for
having been tailored to rescue the KBL candidates from the clear charges of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> against them and for denying equal protection
of the laws and for violating the cited <span class="SpellE">constitetional</span>
in­junction that <u>all "<span class="SpellE">bonafide</span> candidates
shall be free from any form of harassment and discrimination</u>."</p>

<p class="NUM">6. The cited prohibition against change of political party af­filiation
must be so construed so as not to collide with the right gua­ranteed by the
Constitution such as the <u>right of free association</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the Court itself in the Peralta
case, "<u>a narrow_ construction</u> may <u>discourage the robust exercise
of the right of association</u> guaranteed by the Bill of Rights," and
"(I)t is, therefore, necessary at this stage to <u>encourage</u> the
emergence or growth of political parties that will truly reflect the opinions
and aspirations of our people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The right
of individuals to form associations as guaranteed by the fundamental law, to
includes the freedom to associate or refrain from association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In ac­cord with this constitutional precept,
it is-recognized that <u>no man is compelled</u> by law <u>to become a member</u>
of a political party, or, after having become such, to <u>remain</u> a
member."</p>

<p class="NUM">7. The question as to whether P.D. 1661 which partook of the
nature of an implementing legislation and outlawing guest candidacy as
published in the newspapers only on Jan. 5, 1980 after the expira­tion of the
Jan. 4, 1980 deadline for filing of certificates of candidacy, could not be
justly relied upon to disqualify candidates who were not aware of its
provisions since it had not yet been promulgated much less published as of the
time they filed their certificates of candidacy; that the P.D. is
unquestionably <u>penal in nature</u> and imposes penalties for violators and
therefore could not be made to retroact without transgressing the <u>ex post
facto</u> provisions of the Bill of Rights; and those questions of substantive
due process and the application of the constitutional mandate in Art. XII-C,
section 9 (1) that "bona fide candidates for any public office shall be
free from any form of harassment and discrimination" and the <u>question
of real import and meaning of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> </u>such as
whether <u>one who after a gap of 9 years of no contested elections runs as an
oppo­sitionist</u> as <u>against</u> the<u> overwhelming power and resources</u>
of the <u>dominant</u> party or organization <u>can genuinely be denounced as a
turncoat following the spirit and not the mere letter of the Constitution and
of the law,</u> are all issues of great importance and significance that have
to be addressed by this Court only after the affected party shall have been
given in the first instance a <u>full dress hearing</u> by this Court and
resolved only after the fullest deliberations.</p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Court is to be <u>consistent</u> with
its ruling in <u>Pimentel</u> and other cases, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
should in the meantime be duly proclaimed and allowed to assume office as
mayor, with­out prejudice to holding 'a full dress hearing' on his alleged
disqualification, in accordance with the vote of Justice <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>
Santos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See pp. 3-4 of my March 25th
Memorandum.)</blockquote>

be threshed out <u>only 'after a full dress hearing</u> in accordance with <u>due
pro­cess,</u> ' as urged by Justice Antonio in his above vote.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a <u>full dress hearing</u> is necessary
and impera­tive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the
compelling questions of <u>due process</u>, <u>lack of fair notice</u> and <u>suddenness</u>
of the call for the Jan. 30th elections, the equally important <u>constitutional
right of free association</u>, the <u>ex post facto</u> nature of P. D. 1661
published only <u>after</u> the January 4, 1980 deadline (for filing of certi­ficates
of candidacy), it must be borne in mind that the Court has up to now never
squarely addressed the question that the KBL became a political party only in <u>late
December, 1979 after</u> the calling of the Jan. 30th elections.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Before then</u>, <u>by the Court's own pronouncements</u> in the
<u>Peralta</u> and<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Laban</u></span>
cases of 1978, the dominant <u>KBL</u> was <u>not a political party but an
umbrella organization</u> of all pre-martial law political parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the jockeying of prospec­tive candidates
like Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Amante</span> for a place in the KBL ticket
(whom we did <u>not</u> disqualify, unlike <span class="SpellE">Gabatan</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Evasco</span>) could not be deemed as opportunism.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither could their going their own way with
the NP as an opposition party (as expressly recognized by the President) be
termed as <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Assemblyman <span class="SpellE">Amante</span>,
after running as NP candidate is back with the KBL after his defeat.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court must have <u>the full big picture</u>
before it can disqualify any candidate for alleged <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(For example, in the face of the KBL having
become a political party only in late December, 1979, then <span class="SpellE"><u>Dizon</u></span>,
who was <u>elected</u> mayor in 1971 <u>as an NP</u>, should be the one <u>disqualified
for <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span></u> for having joined the KBL.) The
Court's minute resolutions in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Gabatan</u></span> and <span class="SpellE"><u>Evasco</u></span><u> </u>cases upholding their disqualification
on alleged substantial evidence are not precedents, for the facts of the KBL
having become a party only in December, 1979 and the many issues of <u>substantive
due process and fair play</u>, etc. were never dealt with in those cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only fair and just that the Court
remand or turn over all such disqualification cases for a full dress hearing
and that the winners be allowed meanwhile to assume their offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>sovereign will of the electorate</u>
cannot be lightly treated or cavalierly disregarded by the Court.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the final voting on the cases last month, I understood that
even though <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> proclamation would stand, by
virtue of the plurality of seven votes in his favor, <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
would be reserved the right of protest and the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span>
petitions would be without prejudice to his pursuing the pending election
protest against <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> (which he had filed <u>ad <span class="SpellE">cautelam</span></u> with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in
February, 1980, expressly subject to the outcome of the cases at bar),
consistently with the Court's reservation in all other cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plurality deci­sion's action now
upholding <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span> disqualification on the bare pro­nouncement
that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> finding of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span>
against him "is not a whimsical and capricious finding" and "is
binding and con­clusive on this Court" (at pages 12-13, decision), has <span class="SpellE">regretably</span> and wrongfully foreclosed totally and shut out
any right of protest or vindi­cation on <span class="SpellE">Ticzon's</span>
part.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote accordingly to grant the petitions at bar, specifically
(a) to set aside the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>; and (b)
to set aside the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span> and to direct the original canvassing board to
forthwith reconvene and complete the canvass and proclaim <span class="SpellE">Ticzon</span>
as the winning candidate, so that he may assume his rightful of­fice of Mayor
of San Pablo City without further delay; and (c) therewith to declare moot the <span class="SpellE">Armedilla</span> petition (G. R. 53393) to declare <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> disqualified as a turncoat for having changed his
political party affiliation during his term of office. </p>

At the time of the 11th hour issuance of this resolution, the canvassing board

The cited constitutional prohibition reads:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">"SEC. 10. No <u>elective
public officer </u>may <u>change</u> his political party affiliation <u>during
his term of office</u>, and no candidate for any elective public office may
change his political affiliation within six months immediately preceding or
following an election."</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">This Court has held that the term
of office of the elected local officials in 1971 was the <u>same term</u>, (not
a new one) <u>converted beyond</u> the original 4 years to an <u>indefinite
term</u> to be held by the incumbent "until otherwise provided by law or
decreed by the incumbent President" [<span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> <i>vs.</i>
Men <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, '56 SCRA 522] - so there is no question
that the constitutional prohibition against change of political affiliation by
an elective official <u>during his term</u> absolutely applied to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.</p>
