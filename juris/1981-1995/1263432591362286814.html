				<H3>GLOBE-MACKAY CABLE AND RADIO CORPORATION, PETITIONER, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND IMELDA SALAZAR, RESPONDENTS, <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ROMERO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For private respondent Imelda L. Salazar, it would seem that her
close association with Delfin Saldivar would mean the loss of her job.  In May 1982, private respondent was employed
by Globe-Mackay Cable and Radio Corporation (GMCR) as general systems analyst.  Also employed by petitioner as manager for
technical operations’ support was Delfin Saldivar with whom private respondent
was allegedly very close.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1984, petitioner GMCR, prompted by reports that
company equipment and spare parts worth thousands of dollars under the custody
of Saldivar were missing, caused the investigation of the latter's
activities.  The report dated September
25, 1984 prepared by the company's internal auditor, Mr. Agustin Maramara,
indicated that Saldivar had entered into a partnership styled Concave
Commercial and Industrial Company with Richard A. Yambao, owner and manager of
Elecon Engineering Services (Elecon), a supplier of petitioner often
recommended by Saldivar.  The report
also disclosed that Saldivar had taken petitioner's missing Fedders
airconditioning unit for his own personal use without authorization and also
connived with Yambao to defraud petitioner of its property.  The airconditioner was recovered only after
petitioner GMCR filed an action for replevin against Saldivar.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It likewise appeared in the course of Maramara's investigation
that Imelda Salazar violated company regulations by involving herself in
transactions conflicting with the company's interests.  Evidence showed that she signed as a witness
to the articles of partnership between Yambao and Saldivar.  It also appeared that she had full knowledge
of the loss and whereabouts of the Fedders airconditioner but failed to inform
her employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, in a letter dated October 8, 1984, petitioner
company placed private respondent Salazar under preventive suspension for one
(1) month, effective October 9, 1984, thus giving her thirty (30) days within
which to explain her side.  But instead
of submitting an explanation, three (3) days later or on October 12, 1984,
private respondent filed a complaint against petitioner for illegal suspension,
which she subsequently amended to include illegal dismissal, vacation and sick
leave benefits, 13th month pay and damages, after petitioner notified her in writing
that effective November 8, 1984, she was considered dismissed "in view of
(her) inability to refute and disprove these findings."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing, the Labor Arbiter in a decision dated July 16,
1985, ordered petitioner company to reinstate private respondent to her former
or equivalent position and to pay her full backwages and other benefits she
would have received were it not for the illegal dismissal.  Petitioner was also ordered to pay private
respondent moral damages of P50,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, public respondent National Labor Relations Commission
in the questioned resolution dated December 29, 1987 affirmed the aforesaid
decision with respect to the reinstatement of private respondent but limited
the backwages to a period of two (2) years and deleted the award for moral
damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition assailing the Labor Tribunal for having
committed grave abuse of discretion in holding that the suspension and
subsequent dismissal of private respondent were illegal and in ordering her
reinstatement with two (2) years’ backwages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of preventive suspension, we find for petitioner
GMCR.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigative findings of Mr. Maramara, which pointed to
Delfin Saldivar's acts in conflict with his position as technical operations
manager, necessitated immediate and decisive action on any employee closely
associated with Saldivar.  The
suspension of Salazar was further impelled by the discovery of the missing
Fedders airconditioning unit inside the apartment private respondent shared
with Saldivar.  Under such
circumstances, preventive suspension was the proper remedial recourse available
to the company pending Salazar's investigation.  By itself, preventive suspension does not signify that the
company has adjudged the employee guilty of the charges she was asked to answer
and explain.  Such disciplinary measure
is resorted to for the protection of the company's property pending
investigation of any alleged malfeasance or misfeasance committed by the
employee.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it is not correct to conclude that petitioner GMCR had
violated Salazar's right to due process when she was promptly suspended.  If at all, the fault lay with private
respondent when she ignored petitioner's memorandum of October 8, 1984 "giving
her ample opportunity to present (her) side to the Management." Instead,
she went directly to the Labor Department and filed her complaint for illegal
suspension without giving her employer a chance to evaluate her side of the
controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">But while we agree with the propriety of Salazar's preventive
suspension, we hold that her eventual separation from employment was not for
cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is the remedy in law to rectify an unlawful dismissal so as
to "make whole" the victim who has not merely lost her job which,
under settled jurisprudence, is a property right of which a person is not to be
deprived without due process, but also the compensation that should have
accrued to her during the period when she was unemployed?</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 279 of<span style=""> </span>the
Labor Code, as amended, provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"<u>Security of Tenure</u>.  - </span>In cases of regular employment, the
employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except for a just
cause or when authorized by this Title.  <u><span style="">An employee who is unjustly
dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss of
seniority rights and other privileges and to his full backwages</span></u><span style="">, </span>inclusive of allowances, and to his
other benefits or their monetary equivalent computed from the time his
compensation was withheld from him up to the time of his actual
reinstatement."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Corollary thereto are the following provisions of the
Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.  <u>Security
of Tenure</u>.  - In cases of regular
employment, the employer shall not terminate the services of an employee except
for a just cause as provided in the Labor Code or when authorized by existing
laws.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Sec. 3.  <u>Reinstatement</u>, - <u>An employee who
is unjustly dismissed from work shall be entitled to reinstatement without loss
of seniority rights and to backwages</u>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before proceeding any further, it needs must be recalled that the
present Constitution has gone further than the 1973 Charter in guaranteeing
vital social and economic rights to marginalized groups of society, including
labor.  Given the pro-poor orientation
of several articulate Commissioners of the Constitutional Commission of 1986,
it was not surprising that a whole new Article emerged on Social Justice and
Human Rights designed, among other things, to "protect and enhance the
right of all the people to human dignity, reduce social, economic and political
inequalities, and remove cultural inequities by equitably diffusing wealth and
political power for the common good."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Proof of the priority accorded to labor is that it leads the
other areas of concern in the Article on Social Justice, <u>viz</u>., Labor
ranks ahead of such topics as Agrarian and Natural Resources Reform, Urban Land
Reform and Housing, Health, Women, Role and Rights of People's Organizations
and Human Rights.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The opening paragraphs on Labor state:</p>

<blockquote>"The State shall afford <u>full protection to labor</u>, local
and overseas, organized and unorganized, and promote full employment and
equality of employment opportunities for all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It shall guarantee the rights of all workers to self-organization,
collective bargaining and negotiations, and peaceful concerted activities,
including the right to strike in accordance with law.  They shall be entitled to s<u>ecurity of tenure</u>, humane
conditions of work, and a living wage.  They shall also participate in policy and decision-making processes
affecting their rights and benefits as may be provided by law."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring mine)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Compare this with the sole provision on Labor in the 1973
Constitution under the Article on Declaration of Principles and State Policies
that provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 9.  The State
shall afford protection to labor, promote full employment and equality in
employment, ensure equal work opportunities regardless of sex, race, or creed,
and regulate the relations between workers and employers.  The State shall ensure the rights of workers
to self-organization, collective bargaining, security of tenure, and just and
humane conditions of work.  The State
may provide for compulsory arbitration."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, both Charters recognize "security of
tenure" as one of the rights of labor which the State is mandated to
protect.  But there is no gainsaying the
fact that the intent of the framers of the present Constitution was to give
primacy to the rights of labor and afford the sector "full
protection," at least greater protection than heretofore accorded them,
regardless of the geographical location of the workers and whether they are
organized or not.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was then CONCOM Commissioner, now Justice Hilario G. Davide,
Jr., who substantially contributed to the present formulation of the protection
to labor provision and proposed that the same be incorporated in the Article on
Social Justice and not just in the Article on Declaration of Principles and
State Policies "in the light of the special importance that we are giving
now to social justice and the necessity of emphasizing the scope and role of
social justice in national development.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If we have taken pains to delve into the background of the labor
provisions in our Constitution and the Labor Code, it is but to stress that the
right of an employee not to be dismissed from his job except for a just or
authorized cause provided by law has assumed greater importance under the 1987
Constitution with the singular prominence labor enjoys under the article on
Social Justice.  And this transcendent
policy has been translated into law in the Labor Code.  Under its terms, where a case of unlawful or
unauthorized dismissal has been proved by the aggrieved employee, or on the
other hand, the employer whose duty it is to prove the lawfulness or justness
of his act of dismissal has failed to do so, then the remedies provided in
Article 279 should find application.  Consonant with this liberalized stance <u>vis</u>-<u>a</u>-<u>vis</u>
labor, the legislature even went further by enacting Republic Act No. 6715
which took effect on March 2, 1989 that amended said Article to remove any
possible ambiguity that jurisprudence may have generated which watered down the
constitutional intent to grant to labor "full protection."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To go back to the instant case, there being no evidence to show
an authorized, much less a legal, cause for the dismissal of private
respondent, she had every right, not only to be entitled to reinstatement, but
as well, to full backwages.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The intendment of the law in prescribing the twin remedies of
reinstatement and payment of backwages is, in the former, to restore the
dismissed employee to her status before she lost her job, for the dictionary
meaning of the word "reinstate" is "to restore to a state,
condition, position, etc. from which one had been removed"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and in the latter, to give her back the income lost during the period of
unemployment.  Both remedies, looking to
the past, would perforce make her "whole."</p>

<p class="BODY">Sadly, the avowed intent of the law has at times been thwarted
when reinstatement has not been forthcoming and the hapless dismissed employee
finds himself on the outside looking in.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Over time, the following reasons have been advanced by the Court
for denying reinstatement under the facts of the case and the law applicable thereto:  that reinstatement can no longer be effected
in view of the long passage of time (22 years of litigation) or because of the
realities of the situation;<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> or
that it would be "inimical to the employer's interest;"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
or that reinstatement may no longer be feasible;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> or,
that it will not serve the best interests of the parties involved;<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
or that the company would be prejudiced by the workers' continued employment;<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
or that it will not serve any prudent purpose as when supervening facts have
transpired which make execution on that score unjust or inequitable<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
or, to an increasing extent, due to the resultant atmosphere of "antipathy
and antagonism" or "strained relations" or "irretrievable
estrangement" between the employer and the employee.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In lieu of reinstatement, the Court has variously ordered the
payment of backwages and separation pay<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> or
solely separation <span style="">pay.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the law is on the side of private
respondent.  In the first place, the wording
of the Labor Code is clear and unambiguous:  "An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work <u><span style="">shall</span></u><span style=""> </span>be entitled to reinstatement . . . and to his full backwages .
. ."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the principles of statutory construction, if a statute is clear, plain and
free from ambiguity, it must be given its literal meaning and applied without
attempted interpretation.  This
plain-meaning rule or <u><span style="">verba</span></u><span style=""> <u>legis</u> </span>derived from the maxim <u>index</u>
<u>animi</u> <u>sermo</u> <u>est</u> (speech is the index of intention) rests
on the valid presumption that the words employed by the legislature in a
statute correctly express its intent or will and preclude the court from
construing it differently.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> The
legislature is presumed to know the meaning of the words, to have used words
advisedly, and to have expressed its intent by the use of such words as are
found in the statute.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> <u>Verba</u>
<u><span style="">leqis</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>non</u> <u><span style="">est</span></u><span style=""> <u>recedendum</u>,
</span>or from the words of a statute there should be no departure.  Neither does the provision admit of any
qualification.  If in the wisdom of the
Court, there may be a ground or grounds for non-application of the above-cited
provision, this should be by way of exception, such as when the reinstatement
may be inadmissible due to ensuing strained relations between the employer and
the employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">In such cases, it should be proved that the employee concerned
occupies a position where he enjoys the trust and confidence of his employer;
and that it is likely that if reinstated, an atmosphere of antipathy and
antagonism may be generated as to adversely affect the efficiency and
productivity of the employee concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">A few examples will suffice to illustrate the Court's application
of the above principle; where the employee is a Vice-President for Marketing
and as such, enjoys the full trust and confidence of top management;<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
or is the Officer-In-Charge of the extension office of the bank where he works;<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
or is an organizer of a union who was in a position to sabotage the union's
efforts to organize the workers in commercial and industrial establishments;<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
or is a warehouseman of a non-profit organization whose primary purpose is to
facilitate and maximize voluntary gifts by foreign individuals and
organizations to the Philippines;<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a> or
is manager of its Energy Equipment Sales.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the principle of "strained relations" cannot
be applied indiscriminately.  Otherwise,
reinstatement can never be possible simply because some hostility is invariably
engendered between the parties as a result of litigation.  That is human nature.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, no strained relations should arise from a valid and
legal act of asserting one's right; otherwise an employee who shall assert his
right could be easily separated from the service, by merely paying his
separation pay on the pretext that his relationship with his employer had
already become strained.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, it has not been proved that the position of private
respondent as systems analyst is <span style="">one </span>that
may be characterized as a position of trust and confidence such that if
reinstated, it may well lead to strained relations between employer and
employee.  Hence, this does not
constitute an exception to the general rule mandating reinstatement for an
employee who has been unlawfully dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, has she betrayed any confidence reposed in her
by engaging in transactions that may have created conflict of interest
situations?  Petitioner GMCR points out
that as a matter of company policy, it prohibits its employees from involving
themselves with any company that has business dealings with GMCR.  Consequently, when private respondent
Salazar signed as a witness to the partnership papers of Concave (a supplier of
Ultra which in turn is also a supplier of GMCR), she was deemed to have placed
herself in an untenable position as far as petitioner was concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on close scrutiny, we agree with public respondent that
such a circumstance did not create a conflict of interests situation.  As a systems analyst, Salazar was very far
removed from operations involving the procurement of supplies.  Salazar's duties revolved around the
development of systems and analysis of designs on a continuing basis.  In other words, Salazar did not occupy a
position of trust relative to the approval and purchase of supplies and company
assets.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, petitioner has predicated its dismissal of
Salazar on loss of confidence.  As we
have held countless times, while loss of confidence or breach of trust is a
valid ground for termination, it must rest on some basis which must be
convincingly established.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a> An
employee may not be dismissed on mere presumptions and suppositions.  Petitioner's allegation that since Salazar
and Saldivar lived together in the same apartment, it "presumed reasonably
that complainant's sympathy would be with Saldivar" and its averment that
Saldivar's investigation although unverified, was probably true, do not pass
this Court's test.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
While we should not condone the acts of disloyalty of an employee, neither
should we dismiss him on the basis of suspicion derived from speculative
inferences.</p>

<p class="BODY">To rely on the Maramara report as a basis for Salazar's dismissal
would be most inequitous because the bulk of the findings centered principally
on her friend's alleged thievery and anomalous transactions as technical
operations' support manager.  Said
report merely insinuated that in view of Salazar's special relationship with
Saldivar, Salazar might have had direct knowledge of Saldivar's questionable
activities.  Direct evidence implicating
private respondent is wanting from the records.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also worth emphasizing that the Maramara report came out
after Saldivar had already resigned from GMCR on May 31, 1984.  Since Saldivar did not have the opportunity
to refute management's findings, the report remained obviously one-sided.  Since the main evidence obtained by
petitioner dealt principally on the alleged culpability of Saldivar, without
his having had a chance to voice his side in view of his prior resignation,
stringent examination should have been carried out to ascertain whether or not
there existed independent legal grounds to hold Salazar answerable as well and,
thereby, justify her dismissal.  Finding
none, from the records, we find her to have been unlawfully dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b><span style=""> </span>the
