<p class="BODY">This is a Motion for Reconsideration of the decision dated

Court<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> in the above-entitled case, 
asking for the reversal of said decision on the following grounds:</p>
<ol><li>The Decision erred in <em>disregarding </em>the fact that Lot No. 304-B was 
registered in the name of the husband, Juan <span class="SpellE">Pombuena</span>, 
as per OCT No. 0-1160 issued pursuant to the November 22, <em>1938</em> Decision 
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3) of the Cadastral Court in Cadastral Case No. 
12, G.L.R.O. Cad. Rec. No. <span class="GramE">1638,</span> and that petitioner 
had the right to <span style="font-style: italic;">rely</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>on said OCT;<br><br></li><li>The Decision erred in <em>misinterpreting</em><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>the admission in <span>Answer of petitioner 
to the complaint in the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> Case No. 448 
(City Court of <span class="SpellE">Ozamiz</span> City) as his admission that Lot 
304-B is the <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> property of the wife, <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tacalinar</span>;<o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li>The Decision erred in <em>reforming</em> the Contract of Sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) of <span>Lot</span> 304-B from <span class="SpellE">Basilides</span> <span class="SpellE">Tacalinar</span> (mother) to 
the respondent, <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tacalinar</span> <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span> de <span class="SpellE">Pombuena</span>, from a sale to a conveyance of the <em>share</em> 
of the wife <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tacalinar</span> (daughter) in the <em>future</em> hereditary 
estate of her parents;<br><br></li><li>The Decision erred in <em>overlooking</em> that the barter agreement is an 
onerous contract of exchange, whereby private respondents-spouses received 
valuable consideration, concessions and other benefits <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and in concluding that 'the barter agreement has no 
effect';<br><br></li><li>The Decision erred in <em>disregarding</em> the fact that petitioner 
constructed his concrete building on Lot No. 304-B in <em>good faith</em> 
relying OCT No. 0-1160, <span style="font-style: italic;">after</span> the 
dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case and only <em>after 
</em>the execution of said barter agreement;<br><br></li><li>The Decision erred in confusing the <em>conclusion of law</em> that 
petitioner is a builder in bad faith with a <em>finding of fact</em>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The rule is that questions of law are <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> on appeal or by <i>certiorari</i>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Moreover, the rule on finding of fact is subject to well-settled 
<em>exceptions</em><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>(pp. 257-258, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)</li></ol>
<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that the <em>undisputed</em> relevant facts 
indicate:</p>
<blockquote>(1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagalinar</span> <span class="SpellE">Guangco</span> de <span class="SpellE">Pombuena</span> (RESTITUTA, for short) received the questioned lot 
(no. 304-B), of the Cadastre Survey of the Municipality of Centro, <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental, either as a purported donation or by way 
of purchase on (February 11, <em>1927</em>) (with P50.00) as the alleged 
consideration thereof;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> the transaction 
took place during her mother's lifetime, her father having predeceased the 
mother;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> the donation or 
sale was consummated while RESTITUTA was already married to her husband Juan 
<span class="SpellE">Pombuena</span> (JUAN, for short);</blockquote>
<blockquote>(4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> on <st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1935">January 22, 1935</st1:date>, JUAN filed for 
himself and his supposed co-owner RESTITUTA an application for a Torrens Title 
over the land;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that under date of November 22, 1938 a decision 
was promulgated in G. L. R. C. No. 1638 (Cadastral Case No. 12) pronouncing JUAN 
('married to RESTITUTA') as the owner of the land;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> on <st1:date month="9" day="22" year="1949">September 22, 1949</st1:date> a contract of lease 
over the lot was entered into between Pershing Tan <span class="SpellE">Queto</span> (TAN QUETO, for short, the herein petitioner) and 
RESTITUTA (with the consent of her husband JUAN) for a period of ten (10) 
years;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(7)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> on <st1:date month="12" day="27" year="1960">December 27, 1960</st1:date> RESTITUTA sued TAN 
QUETO for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> (the lease contract having 
expired) before the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename> 
<st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ozamis</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(8)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that as a consequence of the cadastral case, an 
Original Certificate of Title (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10) <span>was 
issued in <span class="SpellE">JUAN's</span> name ("married to RESTITUTA") on 
April 23, 1962;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>(9)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case was won by the spouses in the Municipal Court; 
but on appeal in the Court of First Instance, the <span>entire case was 
DISMISSED because of an understanding (barter) whereby TAN QUETO became the 
owner of the disputed lot, and the spouses RESTITUTA and JUAN in turn became the 
owners of a parcel of land (with the house constructed thereon) previously owned 
(that is, before the barter) by TAN QUETO;</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>(10)<span> </span>that after the barter agreement dated October 10, 
1962 between JUAN and TAN QUETO, the latter constructed (See p. 257, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, Vol. II) on the disputed land a concrete 
building, without any objection on the part of RESTITUTA;</blockquote>
<blockquote>(11)<span> </span><span class="GramE">that</span> later, RESTITUTA 
sued both JUAN and TAN QUETO for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the 
title over the registered but disputed lot, for annulment of the barter, and for 
recovery of the land with damages.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The two principal issues are clearly the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="BODY">(1)<span>&nbsp; </span>Is the questioned lot <span class="SpellE"><em>paraphernal</em></span> or <em>conjugal</em>?</p>
<p class="BODY">(2)<span>&nbsp; </span>In having constructed the building on the lot, 
should TAN QUETO be regarded as a builder in <em>good faith</em> (and hence 
entitled to reimbursement) or a builder in <em>bad faith</em> (with no right to 
reimbursement)?</p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The finding by both the Court of First Instance and the Court of 
Appeals that the disputed lot is <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> and that 
TAN QUETO is a builder in bad faith were regarded by <span class="GramE">Us</span> 
in Our assailed decision as findings of facts and thus ordinarily conclusive on 
Us.<span>&nbsp; </span>Assuming they are factual findings, still if they are 
erroneous inferences from certain facts, they cannot bind this Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">A second hard look at the circumstances of the case has 
constrained <span class="GramE">Us</span> to rule as follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">(1) <span>&nbsp;</span>The land is conjugal, not <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>How was ownership transferred, if 
at all, from her mother to RESTITUTA?<span>&nbsp; </span>The <em>oral </em>donation 
of the lot cannot be a valid donation <span class="SpellE"><em>intervivos</em></span> because it was not executed in a public 
instrument (Art. 749, Civil Code), nor as a valid donation<em> mortis causa</em> 
for the formalities of a will were not complied with.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
allegation that the transfer was a conveyance to RESTITUTA of her hereditary 
share in the estate of her mother (or parents) cannot be sustained for the 
contractual transmission of <em>future</em> inheritance is generally 
prohibited.</p>
<p class="BODY">The fact is ownership was acquired by <em>both</em> JUAN and 
RESTITUTA by tradition (delivery) as a consequence of the contract of sale (See 
Art. 712, Civil Code) with P50.00 (then a considerable amount) as the cause or 
consideration of the transaction.<span>&nbsp; </span>The lot is therefore 
<em>conjugal</em>, having been acquired by the spouses thru <em>onerous</em> 
title (the money used being presumably conjugal, there being no proof that 
RESTITUTA had <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span> funds of her own).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The contention that the sale was fictitious or <span>simulated 
</span>(and therefore void) is bankrupt.<span>&nbsp; </span>Firstly, there was a 
valid consideration <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Secondly, 
assuming that there had indeed been a simulation, the parties thereto cannot use 
said simulation to prejudice a stronger to said <span class="SpellE">strategem</span> (like petitioner herein).</p>
<p class="BODY">One nagging question has been posed.<span>&nbsp; </span>But did not TAN 
QUETO admit in his Answer that RESTITUTA was the owner of the lot.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This is not so.<span>&nbsp; </span>He admitted RESTITUTA was "<em>an</em> 
owner" (not <em>the</em> owner) of the lot, and this is true, for she was a 
co-owner (with JUAN, and therefore "<u>an</u> owner".<span>&nbsp; </span>Surely, 
there is no admission of <span class="SpellE">RESTITUTA's</span> exclusive 
ownership.<span>&nbsp; </span>And yet this is the basis of the trial court's 
conclusion that the lot was indeed <span class="SpellE">paraphernal</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">(2) <span>&nbsp;</span>Was Tan <span class="SpellE">Queto</span> a 
possessor and builder in good faith or in bad faith?</p>
<p class="BODY">Even assuming that despite registration of the lot as conjugal, 
Tan <span class="SpellE">Queto</span> nursed the belief that the lot was actually 
<span class="SpellE">RESTITUTA's</span> (making him in bad faith), still <span class="SpellE">RESTITUTA's</span> failure to prohibit him from building despite 
her knowledge that construction was actually being done, makes her also in bad 
faith.<span>&nbsp; </span>The net resultant of mutual bad faith would entitle TAN 
QUETO to the rights of a builder in good faith (Art. <span>448, </span>Civil 
Code), ergo, reimbursement should be given him if RESTITUTA decides to 
appropriate the building for herself (Art. 448, Civil Code).</p>
<p class="BODY">However, as already previously intimated, TAN QUETO having 
bartered his own lot and small house with the questioned lot with JUAN (who has 
been adverted to by a court decision and by the OCT a <em>conjugal owner</em>) 
may be said to be the OWNER-POSSESSOR of the lot.<span>&nbsp; </span>Certainly he is 
not merely a possessor or <span style="font-style: italic;">builder in 
</span><em>good faith</em> (this phrase presupposes ownership in 
<span><em>another</em>); </span>much less is he a builder in <span style="font-style: italic;">bad faith</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>He is a 
builder-possessor <span>(<em>jus possidendi</em></span>) because he is the OWNER 
himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please note that the Chapter on Possession (<em>jus 
possessionis</em>, not <span style="font-style: italic;">jus </span><span class="SpellE"><em>possidendi</em></span><span>) </span>in the Civil Code refers 
to a possessor <em>other</em> than the owner.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please note further 
that the difference between a builder (<span class="GramE">or</span> possessor) in 
good faith and one in bad faith is that the former is NOT AWARE of the defect or 
flaw in his title or mode of acquisition while the latter is AWARE of such 
defect or flaw (Art. 526, Civil Code).<span>&nbsp; </span>But in <span><em>either 
case there is a flaw or defect</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>In the case of TAN 
<span>QUETO </span>there is no such flaw or defect because it is he himself (not 
somebody else) who is the owner of the property.</p>
