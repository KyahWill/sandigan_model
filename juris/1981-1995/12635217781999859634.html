Years back, the Reparations Commission (REPACOM) filed a complaint in 
the Court of First Instance of Manila against Compañia Maritima 
(MARITIMA), Zenith Insurance Corporation and the Customs Arrastre 
Service to recover P160,002.77 representing the value of eight lost 
crates of reparations goods.  The lost crates, which contained machinery
 and equipment for the end-use of San Jose Cement Corporation, were part
 of the shipment of reparations goods from Japan on board MARITIMA's 
vessel, M/V MACTAN, consigned to REPACOM at Manila.
<p>
In its answer, MARITIMA set up a counterclaim against REPACOM for unpaid
 freight not only for the shipment in question but also for reparations 
shipments on board other MARITIMA vessels.
</p><p>
After hearing, the trial court rendered a decision absolving MARITIMA 
upon a finding that the lost cargo had actually been discharged from its
 vessel in good order and turned over to the custody of the Customs 
Arrastre Service in the name of REPACOM.  But the Court declined to rule
 on the counterclaim of MARITIMA, saying:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Notwithstanding the evidence adduced by defendant Compañia 
Maritima on its counterclaim against the plaintiff, the Court does not 
consider it proper to make a ruling on the same in this proceedings; and
 counsel for defendant Compañia Maritima may institute a separate action
 for such claim."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is the refusal of the trial court to decide MARITIMA's counterclaim that is the subject of this appeal.
</p><p>
Ordinarily, we would remand this case to the court a quo for it to 
decide the permissive counterclaim in question.  Such a step, however, 
would further prolong the proceedings which have already been 
protracted.  We have therefore opted to write finis to the case by 
deciding the counterclaim here and now.
</p><p>
The evidence discloses that on various occasions, there were shipped on 
freight-collect basis by Japanese suppliers (as shippers) on board 
MARITIMA's vessels reparations goods from Japan consigned to REPACOM at 
Manila.  Except for a small amount, the freight charges (P357,055.51) 
for all these shipments have not been paid.
</p><p>
REPACOM does not dispute the existence of the unpaid freight but 
disclaims liability therefor by invoking Section 11 of the Reparations 
Act (Rep. Act. No. 1789, as amended), the pertinent portion of which 
reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 11.  Terms of procurement. - x x x The insurance, ocean 
freight and other expenses incident to importation (of reparations 
goods) <em>shall be paid by the end-user</em> in accordance with usual business practices." (Italics supplied) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand, MARITIMA contends that the quoted law applies only as
 between the REPACOM and the end-users, but not when the carrier seeks 
to collect freight from REPACOM as consignee with which MARITIMA has 
privity, unlike the end-user who is a complete stranger to the carrier. 
 MARITIMA invokes the bills of lading and the provisions of the Code of 
Commerce, particularly Article 686 thereof, which both provide that it 
is the consignee who must pay the freight upon delivery to him of the 
cargo.
</p><p>
The issue raised is not new.  In a prior case involving the very same 
parties who are involved in the instant appeal, the question before the 
Court was whether REPACOM, as consignee of reparations goods, was liable
 for freight.  Speaking through the then Associate Justice, now Chief 
Justice, Enrique M. Fernando, this Court absolved the REPACOM, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The rule is that the law forms part of, and is read into, every 
contract, unless clearly excluded therefrom in those cases where such 
exclusion is allowed * * *.  What is the law that forms part of, and is 
to be read into, the contract between plaintiff-appellant and 
defendant-appellee?  It is, to repeat, Section 11 of Republic Act No. 
1789 as amended.  More specifically:  'The insurance, ocean freight and 
other, expenses incident to importation shall be paid by the end-user in
 accordance with usual business practice.' The last sentence is equally 
plain:  'Nothing herein shall be construed as exempting the end-user 
from paying in full all the necessary costs, charges and expenses 
incident to the application for and the procurement, production, 
delivery and acquisition of, the goods concerned.' The above provisions,
 then, form part of and must be read into the shipping contracts between
 plaintiff-appellant and defendant-appellee, unless they could be 
'clearly excluded therefrom', assuming 'such exclusion is allowed.' </p>
  <p> "There is thus no persuasive force to the first error imputed to 
the lower court for their being applied to the contractual relationship 
between the parties.  There is no showing that the shipping contracts 
bet­ween them are clearly excluded from the law, much less that such 
exclusion could be allowed.  The lower court had no choice then.  It 
yielded obedience to the law.  What it did certainly cannot be 
stigmatized as error. </p>
  <p> "It is in that sense that reliance by plaintiff-appellant on the 
force and effect to be given the usual contracts between shipper and 
carriers, while finding support in the applicable provisions both of the
 Civil Code and the Code of Commerce, is far from persuasive.  As was 
pointed out in the equally forceful brief of defendant-appellee, to so 
view the matter is to ignore what has been explicitly set forth in 
Section 11 of the Reparations Act which is controlling."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
