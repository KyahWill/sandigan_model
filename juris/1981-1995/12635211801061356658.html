This is a petition to review the decision of respondent Employees' 
Compensation Commission (ECC) affirming the decision of the Government 
Service Insurance System (GSIS) denying the claim filed by Jose P. 
Mercado, Jr. for total disability benefits.
<p>
Petitioner Jose P. Mercado, Jr. had been employed by the City of Manila 
from October 26, 1945 to March 16, 1979.  His service record (p. 9, 
rec.) covering 34 years, discloses that he was employed by the city 
government of Manila:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (a)     as <em>Laborer</em> of its <em>Manila Health Departmen</em>t from October 26, 1945 up to June 30, 1946;
  </p>
  <p>
    (b)     as <em>Special Laborer</em> thereof from July 1, 1946 to June 30, 1948;
  </p>
  <p>
    (c)     as <em>Watchman</em> from July 1, 1948 to October 18, 1951 of said Department;
  </p>
  <p>
    (d)     as <em>Watchman</em> of its <em>Department</em> <em>of Public Services </em>from October 19, 1951 to December 31, 1952;
  </p>
  <p>
    (e)     as <em>Filer-Helper </em>from January 1, 1955 to November 9, 1964;
  </p>
  <p>
    (f)       as <em>Clerk II </em>from November 10, 1964 up to June 30, 1976; and 
  </p>
  <p>
    (g)     as <em>Clerk II</em> from July 1, 1976, Refuse and Environmental Sanitation Center up to March 16, 1979.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Starting January 31, 1975, however, he began to incur paid leaves of 
absence totalling 110 days of vacation leave and 109½ days of sick leave
 until March 2, 1975 (Annex "A", pp. 12-13, rec.).  On March 16, 1979, 
before he could take his terminal leave, he was forced to retire at the 
age of 60 years, three (3) months and thirteen (13) days due to an 
illness diagnosed as Vertebro-Basilar Insufficiency (R/O Intracranial 
Tumor) or in layman's terms, brain tumor.  He received as retirement pay
 the amount of P22,829.40.
</p><p>
Subsequently, petitioner filed with the GSIS his claim for disability 
benefits.  The GSIS denied his claim in a letter dated September 12, 
1979, and his subsequent request for reconsideration, in a letter dated 
January 17, 1980.  Petitioner appealed to the ECC which rendered 
judgment for the GSIS on October 22, 1981, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "In disapproving claimant's claim, the GSIS, through the Medical 
Evaluation and Underwriting Group stated that vertebro basilar 
insufficiency (intracranial tumor) is a tumor of the brain and/or spinal
 cord.  Statistics show the peak age incidence to be the fifth decade of
 life with a lessening incidence at the extreme ages, infancy and the 
senescent period.  Trauma, viruses, chemical irritation and heredity 
have been sugges­ted as causative agents. </p>
  <p> "In appellant's request for reconsideration of his claim, he 
submitted a report of his brain scan, his X-ray of the cervical spine 
and EEG readings.  All of these findings pointed to the presence of 
suspicious space occupying lesion.  However, the respondent System ruled
 that the disability of the appellant cannot be considered compensable 
under Presidential Decree 626, as amended, because vertebro-basilar 
insufficiency is not an occupational disease as listed under Annex 'A' 
of the implementing rules of Presidential Decree 626, as amended, and 
appellant failed to provide sufficient proofs that his risk of 
contraction of his ailment was increased by his working conditions.  
Hence, appellant now interposes this appeal to this Commission for 
appropriate review of his claim. </p>
  <p> "Intracranial new growth is, in layman's term, tumor of the brain.
  Its etiology is as obscure as that of neoplasm elsewhere in the body. 
 Statistics show the peak age incidence to be the 5th decade of life 
with a lessening incidence at the extreme age, infancy, and the 
senescent period.  The symptoms and signs in patients with cerebral 
neoplasm are chiefly related to the size and location of the tumor.  The
 signs and symptoms may be separated into two groups:  First, those 
which are due to the presence of an expanding mass within the skull, and
 second, those which are due to a local destruction of cerebral tissue 
(Reference:  Harrison, T.R., Principles of Internal Medicine, McGraw 
Hill, Asian edition, 1954, pp. 1618-1659). </p>
  <p> "The mandatory proof of causation, once an ailment upon which a 
claim is based is not considered an occupational disease as defined and 
understood under Presidential Decree 626, as amended, is enforced to 
establish compensability. </p>
  <p> "The evidence submitted by the appellant in support of his claim 
fail to indicate that the cause of his disability is service-connected. 
 The work of appellant did not expose him to carcinogenic chemicals, 
there was no history of trauma and he was not exposed to viruses in his 
employment. </p>
  <p> "Records from the GSIS further disclose that appellant was paid 
benefits under Retirement No. PB 9576 in the amount of P22,829.40.  If 
still living, appellant would be receiving a monthly pension at the rate
 of P380.49 for life, beginning March 16, 1984. </p>
  <p> "FOR ALL THE ABOVE, this Commission has no recourse but to AFFIRM 
the decision of the respondent System and the instant claim is hereby 
dismissed" (Annex "G", pp. 23­-25, rec.). </p>
  <p>
  Hence, this petition.
  </p>
  <p>
  WE find for the petitioner.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Admittedly, vertebro-basilar insufficiency is not included in the list 
of occupational diseases under Annex "A" of the implementing rules of 
Presidential Decree 626, as amended.  Such non-inclusion however, does 
not preclude compensability for one's illness if sufficient proof be 
presented that the risk of contraction of the ailment was increased by 
his working conditions.  Section 1(b) Rule III of the Revised Rules on 
Employees' Compensation thus states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "For the sickness and the resulting disability or death to be 
compensable, the sickness must be the result of an occupational disease 
listed under Annex 'A' of these Rules with the condi­tions set therein 
satisfied; otherwise proof must be shown that the risk of contracting 
the disease is increased by the working conditions."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In denying compensability, the ECG stated that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The evidence submitted by the appellant in support of his claim 
fail to indicate that the cause of his disability is service-connected. 
 The work of appellant did not expose him to carcinogenic chemicals, 
there was no history of trauma and he was not exposed to viruses in his 
employment" (p. 25, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner answers the above, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x as Laborer in the Department of Health of the City of Manila, and then <em>Watchman</em>, <em>Filer-Helper</em> and finally <em>Clerk II</em>
 of the City's Department of Public Service, and the Refuse and 
Environmental Sanitation Center, petitioner undoubtedly, was exposed to 
viruses in his employment, and consequently petitioner's ailment if not 
directly caused, was aggravated by the nature of employment and/or 
greatly increased by the nature of his duties" (p. 10, rec.). </p>
  <p> "x x x the risk of contracting the ailment is remarkable from the 
nature of the employment or working conditions, especially those early 
days of <em>Liberation</em>, as petitioner was initially employed as <em>Laborer</em>, <em>Special Laborer</em> and <em>Watchman</em>, since <em>October 26, 1945</em>,
 when Manila was in ruins, dusty, unsanitary, with destroyed water 
system, and without system of garbage collection, thus, confidently, <em>viruses</em> and <em>chemical irritation</em>
 (suggested causative agents of petitioner's ailment, per respondent 
ECC's findings) assuming to be true, were abundant to which petitioner 
was exposed" (p. 93, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WE agree with the petitioner.
</p><p>
Actual proof of causation is not necessary to justify compensability.  
This Court has consistently declared that to show actual causes or 
factors which lead to an ailment claimed compen­sable, would not be 
consistent with the liberal interpretation of the Labor Code and the 
social justice guarantee embodied in the Constitution in favor of the 
workers (Cabañero vs. ECC, et al., L-50255, Jan. 30, 1982; Cristobal vs.
 ECC, et al., L-49280, April 30, 1980).  This is more so, We believe, in
 the case of brain tumor, where concededly, its etiology is as obscure 
as neoplasms elsewhere in the body.  In addition, We reiterate Our 
ruling in Laron vs. WCC (73 SCRA 84), that in testing evidence or 
relation between the injury or disease and the employment, probability 
and not certainty is the touchstone (p. 47, rec., Comment of the Office 
of the Solicitor General, reiterated in its Memorandum, p. 136, rec.).  
WE find the nature of the work of the petitioner as the probable cause 
of the contraction and/or aggravation of the disabling ailment.
</p><p>
On the matter of the applicable law, i.e., the Workmen's Compensation 
Act or the Employees' Compensation Law under the New Labor Code, We 
agree with respondent GSIS that the latter applies in this case.  In the
 case at bar, the initial manifestation of the ailment (petitioner's 
brain tumor) occurred only on January 31, 1975, at which time the 
Employees' Compensation Act was the law in full force and effect.  
Therefore, and noting that the causes of brain tumor are unknown (Uy vs.
 WCC, 64 SCRA 37, 42) the provisions of the Employees' Compensation Act 
must be applied in the case at bar.
</p><p>
Nonetheless, the application of the Employees' Compensation Act does not negate compensability in this case.
</p><p>
In attempting to steer clear of liability under the Employees' 
Compensation Act, respondent GSIS noted that under said Act the 
presumption of compensability and the rule on aggravation of ill­ness 
caused by the nature of the employment has been abolished as confirmed 
in the case of Sulit vs. ECC (L-48602, June 30, 1980), thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Those radical innovations, the presumption of compensability and 
the rule on aggravation of illness, which favor the employee, paved the 
way for the latitudinarian or expansive application of the Workmen's 
Compensation Law in favor of the employee or worker. </p>
  <p> "It now appears that after the government had experimented for 
more than twenty years with such employee-oriented application of the 
law, the lawmaker found the result to be unsatisfactory because it 
destroyed the parity or balance between the competing interests of 
employer and employee with respect to workmen's compensation.  The 
balance was tilted unduly in favor of the workmen. </p>
  <p> "Hence, to restore a sensible equilibrium between the employer's 
obligation to pay workmen's compensation and the employee's right to 
receive reparation for work-connected death or disability, the old law 
was jettisoned and in its place we have the <em>employees' compensation and state insurance fund</em> in the Labor Code, as amended. </p>
  <p> "As correctly observed by the learned Government Corpo­rate 
Counsel, Manuel M. Lazaro, the Labor Code abolished the presumption of 
compensability and the rule on aggravation of illness caused by the 
nature of the employment.  This Court is powerless to apply those rules 
under the Labor Code [Resolution of March 8, 1978 in L-47008, Ibañez vs.
 Workmen's Compensation Commission]" (pp. 56-57, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To bolster its position, respondent GSIS also stated that the social 
justice policy of our Constitution is not violated by the rejection of a
 claim that is clearly not compensable under the law.  Citing Mitra vs. 
ECC (L-45846, 96 SCRA 284, Feb. 21, 1980), it proposed that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "xx x if the injury or the disease is not labor-connected, but is 
suffered by an employee as a constituent of the general citizenry, he 
deserves no special treatment granted to labor. </p>
  <p> "Further, it is noteworthy that the amended Labor Code, even as a 
social legislation, spells out with more specificity the requirements 
for injuries and diseases which are to be compensable, and has abrogated
 the Workmen's Compensation Act under the aegis of which this Court has 
practically established that most diseases are work-connected or 
work-aggravated and should be compensable. </p>
  <p> "It also bears reiterating that rulings and opinions of 
administrative agencies in areas within their competence are entitled to
 great respect unless they have committed grave abuse of discretion, 
which is not so in this particular case."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Mindful of the above legal and jurisprudential developments, We nonetheless find for petitioner.
</p><p>
There is no congruence between the case at bar and the Sulit case.  In 
the latter, this Court made a definite finding that the ailment for 
which compensation was being claimed "x x was not caused by her 
husband's work as mechanic.  The contracting of such a disease was not 
increased by the working conditions of his job.  Hence, that disease is 
not compensable in this case.  The same observations apply to 
broncho-pneumonia."
</p><p>
It is readily admitted in the present case, however, that the etiology 
of intracranial new growth or brain tumor is as obscure as that of 
neoplasm elsewhere in the body (ECC Case No. 1642, p. 24, rec.).  
Moreover, this Court has, in the case of Uy vs. WCC (64 SCRA 42) 
declared that "apparently, tumor is a disease of such nature that the 
developments of medical science up to now cannot fully explain its 
causes and the factors that may aggravate or alleviate the progress of 
the disease." To require proof of causal connection in this case as a 
condition for compensability therefore is to require, as admitted by 
respondent GSIS counsel, the impossible (p. 122, rec.).  To enforce and 
demand this impossibility is to render nugatory the consti­tutional 
principles of social justice and protection to labor.  Rightly and with 
more reason, it is in this case where the cause of the ailment is not 
determined or determinable that We must hold firm to the constitutional 
commitment that those who have less in life should have more in law.
</p><p>

COMPENSATION COMMISSION IS HEREBY SET ASIDE AND THE GOVERNMENT SERVICE 
INSURANCE SYSTEM (GSIS) IS HEREBY ORDERED
