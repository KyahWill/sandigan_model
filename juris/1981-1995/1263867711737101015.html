<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1976</st1:date>,
the petitioner demanded the return of his stock certificates from respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> who failed to produce them because he had given
them to the other private respondent <span class="SpellE">Jacobo</span>
Feliciano, another officer of Monte <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>, allegedly in
connection with a contemplated joint venture with the group of one <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> replaced the petitioner's Stock
Certificate No. 026 with his own Stock Certificate No. 025 covering 42,578,700
shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner duly acknowledged
the receipt of the said replacement (Exhibit "3").</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1976</st1:date>,
Stock Certificate No. 002 was returned by respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>
to the petitioner as evidenced by the handwritten receipt signed by the latter
(Exhibit "2") who likewise made a handwritten notation stating
"all cleared" at the left hand margin thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 12, 1976, the petitioner filed a complaint for damages
against the private respondents alleging, among others, that at the time he
demanded his Stock Certificate Nos. 002 and 026 <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
56,588,358 shares from respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> the
petitioner had a ready buyer for P0.014 per share for all shares; that due to
the private respondents' failure to return the said stock certificates upon
demand, the petitioner lost P306,115.25 representing the difference between the
amount of P792,237.01 which he would have realized had his stock certificates
been promptly given back and the sum of P486,121.76, the actual net proceeds
from the subsequent sale of 42,550,000 shares at various prices after
respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> delivered his own Stock
Certificate No. 025 in exchange for the petitioner's Stock Certificate No. 026;
that the aforesaid amount of P306,115.25 had long been overdue and unpaid and
despite repeated demands from the private respondents for the payment thereof,
the latter had failed and refused to pay the same to the petitioner's damage
and prejudice; and that due to the private respondents' intentional, deliberate
and malicious acts, moral and exemplary damages could be awarded to the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> counter-alleged,
among others, that he had in turn entrusted Stock Certificate Nos. 002 and 026
of the petitioner to his co-defendant, respondent Feliciano to be shown to a
certain group for the purpose of a joint venture; that respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> had actually made several demands for the return
of the said stock certificates from respondent Feliciano who refused and failed
to do so; that two days after the petitioner made the demand, respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> replaced the petitioner's Stock Certificate No.
026 with his own Stock Certificate No. 025 which covered 149, 925 shares more
than those of the petitioner's Stock Certificate No. 026; that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> returned the petitioner's Stock Certificate No.
002 on May 4, 1976 after he recovered the same from respondent Feliciano; and
that the words "ALL CLEARED" written by the petitioner himself on his
acknowledgment receipt as he received Stock Certificate No. 002 from respondent
<span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> undoubtedly meant to discharge private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> from any responsibility or
liability regarding the petitioner's stock certificates.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1983</st1:date>,
the lower court rendered a judgment favorable to the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also dismissed the complaint and
respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet's</span> cross?claim against
respondent Feliciano and likewise dismissed private respondents’ counter-claims
against the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>, the
Court of Appeals on June 19, 1989, reversed and set aside the trial court's
judgment for lack of merit and supporting proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's complaint as well as the
cross?claims and counter-claims of private respondents were all
dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the petitioner's subsequent motion for reconsideration was
denied on <st1:date year="1989" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1989</st1:date>,
the present petition was filed assigning as errors, <u>to</u> <u>wit</u>:</p>

  COURT</st1:address></st1:street>." (Petition, pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 16-17)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's main argument rests on the oft?repeated
pronouncement that the conclusions and findings of fact by the trial court are
entitled to great weight on appeal and should not be disturbed unless for
strong and cogent reasons because the trial court is in a better position to
examine real evidence as well as observe the demeanor of the witnesses while
testifying citing the case of <u>Chase</u> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Buencamino</u></span>
(136 SCRA 605 [1985]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
faults the respondent court for side-stepping the literal interpretation of the
Acknowledgment Receipt dated February 18, 1972 signed by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> which allegedly serves as a clear proof that Stock
Certificate Nos. 002 and 026 were held by the latter in trust and for
safekeeping only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner further
labels as capricious the respondent court's act of completely ignoring all the
established evidence, <span class="GramE">both documentary</span> and
testimonial, duly admitted and considered by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule that the trial court's findings of fact are accorded due
respect on appeal is not without exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is not applicable where there are strong and cogent reasons as when
the trial court's findings are not supported by the evidence or when the trial
court failed to consider material facts which would have led to a conclusion
different from what was stated in its judgment or when the trial court's
decision was attended by grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A review of the bases for
the trial court's decision shows that the appellate court was justified in
being skeptical as it went over both the facts and the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant case was given due course to enable a more thorough
presentation by the parties and review of the records considering the
petitioner's stress on the disparity between the factual findings of the trial
court which found respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> liable for
actual, moral and exemplary damages and the respondent appellate court which
discharged the said respondent from any liability regarding the petitioner's
Stock Certificate Nos. 002 and 026.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that when the petitioner delivered Stock Certificate
Nos. 002 and 026 to respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> the latter
acknowledged receiving them “in trust and for safekeeping only.” This
acknowledgment, however, cannot outweigh the legal effects of the stock
certificates having been "already indorsed".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no dispute that respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> received the petitioner's certificates in that
condition as evidenced by the same Acknowledgment Receipt dated <st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certificates of stocks are considered as
"quasi-negotiable" instruments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the owner or shareholder of these certificates signs the printed
form of sale or assignment at the back of every stock certificate without
filling in the blanks provided for the name of the transferee as well as for
the name of the attorney-in-fact, the said owner or shareholder, in effect,
confers on another all the indicia of ownership of the said stock
certificates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Campos
and Lopez-Campos, Notes and Selected Cases on Negotiable Instruments Law, 1971
ed., p. 605).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
the petitioner signed the printed form at the back of both Stock Certificate
Nos. 002 and 026 without filling in the blanks at the time the said stock
certificates were delivered to respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the petitioner's acts of <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> and delivery conferred on respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> the right to hold them as though they were his
own.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On account of this apparent
transfer of ownership, it was not irregular on the part of respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> to deliver the stock certificates in question to
respondent Feliciano for consideration in connection with a contemplated tie-up
between two business groups.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, it is worth noting that in view of the
petitioner's concurrent positions as director, Executive Vice-President and
General Manager of Monte <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> at the time of the
incident under consideration, he could not have been unaware of the consequences
of the delivery coupled with the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of his
two stock certificates to respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>,
notwithstanding the tenor of the Acknowledgment Receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is hard to believe that the
petitioner's delivery of the subject stock certificates to respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span> was strictly for safe-keeping purposes only
because if that were his real and only intention, there is neither logic nor
reason for the <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of the said certificates.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful perusal and examination of the records of this
case, we find no legal ground that will constrain us to depart from the rule
that the Court of Appeals’ findings of fact are deemed final, conclusive and
binding on us if supported by substantial evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reiterate our ruling in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Hermo</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,
(155 SCRA 24 [1987]) that:</p>

<blockquote>"At once apparent is that the factual findings of the Court of
Appeals are diametrically at odds with those of the Trial Court, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And basic is the rule that the conclusions of
fact of a trial court are entitled to great weight, and should not generally be
disturbed on appeal, because it is in a better position than the appellate
tribunal to examine the evidence directly, and to observe the demeanor of the
witnesses while testifying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Withal, its
findings of fact, though entitled to great respect, are not conclusive on the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise of its
appellate jurisdiction, the Court of Appeals may affirm, reverse, or modify the
judgment or order appealed from, and may direct a new trial or further
proceeding to be had.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indeed the
duty of that Court chiefly though not exclusively to review a Trial Court's
findings of fact and correct such serious errors affecting them as may have
been properly assigned and as may be established by a re-examination of the
recorded evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>And</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u>
<u>the</u> <u>findings</u> <u>of</u> <u>fact</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Court</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Appeals,</u> <u>not</u> <u>those</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>trial</u>
<u>court,</u> <u>that</u> <u>are</u> <u>as</u> <u>a</u> <u>rule</u> <u>deemed</u>
<u>final,</u> <u>and</u> <u>conclusive</u> <u>even</u> <u>on</u> <u>this</u> <u>Court</u>."
(Underscoring Supplied) (At p. 27)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no reversible error in the respondent Court's holding
that the petitioner failed to support his claim that he suffered the claimed
damages as a result of respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet's</span> failure
to return Stock Certificate Nos. 002 and 026 upon demand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged "unrealized profits"
representing actual and compensatory damages must be supported by substantial
and convincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records are
bereft of such kind of proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mere
allegation that there was a "ready and willing buyer" of all the
petitioner's shares covered by Stock Certificate Nos. 002 and 026 for P0.014
per share at the time the demand for the return of the said certificates was
made cannot suffice to allow the petitioner's claim for unrealized profits to
prosper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such claim is clearly speculative
in nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Actual or<span style="">&nbsp; </span>compensatory
damages are those recoverable because of pecuniary loss in business, trade,
property, profession, job or occupation, and the same must be proved;
otherwise, if the proof is flimsy and non-substantial, no damages will be given
(<span class="SpellE">Danao</span> v. Court of Appeals, 154 SCRA 447 [1987];
Rubio v. Court of Appeals, 141 SCRA 488 [1986]; Perfecto v. Gonzales, 128 SCRA
635 [1984]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Actual and compensatory
damages require evidentiary proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
cannot be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Dee <span class="SpellE">Hua</span> <span class="SpellE">Liong</span> Electrical Equipment
Corporation v. Reyes, 145 SCRA 713 [1986])</p>

<p class="BODY">The good faith of respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>
is shown by the fact that after trying to recover the missing certificates, he
immediately substituted Stock Certificate No. 026 with his own Stock Certificate
No. 025 which covered more shares than the petitioner's replaced
certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's other
Stock Certificate No. 002 was subsequently returned and received by the
petitioner with the notation "All Cleared" on the acknowledgment
receipt duly signed and personally written by him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the respondent court's ruling
that the said notation meant to discharge respondent <span class="SpellE">Macasaet</span>
(together with his co-respondent Feliciano) from any liability with respect to
the stock certificates in question as there can be no other plausible
interpretation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would not have written "all
cleared" if he was unhappy at that time about the substitution of the
higher value certificate for his other certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, considering that in the absence of malice and bad faith,
moral damages cannot be awarded (Philippine National Bank v. Court of Appeals,
159 SCRA 433 [1988]) and that the grant of moral and exemplary damages has no
basis if not predicated upon any of the cases enumerated in the Civil Code (<span class="SpellE">Bagumbayan</span> Corporation v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 132
SCRA 441 [1984]), we hold that the respondent court properly set aside the
award of actual, moral and exemplary damages given by the trial court in favor
of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the petition is
hereby DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The assailed decision

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FELICIANO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result reached by Mr. Justice Hugo E. Gutierrez,
Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I should merely like to render a
brief note in respect of his statement that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"it is hard to believe that petitioners' delivery of the subject
stock certificates <span style="">to </span>respondent
Macasaet was strictly for safekeeping purposes only because if that were his
real and only intention, there is neither logic nor reason for the indorsement
of the said certificates".<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was very probably not unaware of the consequences of
delivering stock certificates which had been indorsed in blank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, awareness of such consequences may
precisely explain why the Acknowledgment Receipt executed by private respondent
Macasaet specifically stated that he had received the stock certificates in
question "<u>for </u><u><span style="">safekeeping
only to be delivered</span></u><span style=""> </span>and/or
surrendered to him x x x <u><span style="">on demand</span></u><span style="">".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>In other words, there was here no unrestricted delivery of the
stock certificates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the
delivery of the stock certificates to private respondent Macasaet was clearly a
limited or qualified delivery, for a specified purpose only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the Acknowledgment Receipt had not been a
restricted receipt, full authority or absolute ownership over the stock
certificates would have been transferred to private respondent Macasaet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restricted Acknowledgment Receipt thus
had a qualifying and countervailing effect upon the indorsement in blank of the
<span style="">stock </span>certificates
involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although indorsed in blank,
the stock certificates are <u>not</u> then intended to be transferred to and <u><span style="">cannot</span></u><span style=""> </span>be disposed of by petitioner-holder.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There </span>are a number
of possible reasons why petitioner should have wanted to indorse the stock
certificates in blank while delivering them to private respondent under a
restricted receipt:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for one thing, the <span style="">petitioner </span>could go out of town <span style="">or out </span>of the country on business or
otherwise; during his trip, he would be in a position to instruct private
respondent to sell the shares already indorsed in blank when it might be
profitable or convenient to do so without need of executing and sending back a
special power of attorney, by the simple expedient of lifting the restriction
found in the Acknowledgment Receipt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indorsement in blank of stock certificates facilitates the ready
transferability of the stock certificates; at the same time, the restricted
Acknowledgment Receipt effectively constituted private respondent a bailee or
trustee vis-a-vis petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
arrangement may be seen to have both a fiduciary quality and a certain
flexibility, a combination of substantial utility in the trading of corporate
securities.</p>
