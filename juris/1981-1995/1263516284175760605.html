				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Rudy Esparraguerra, Rogelio Esparraguerra and Ely Cabiles were charged with Robbery with Homicide before the Regional Trial Court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Branch L, of San Jacinto, Masbate.&nbsp; The Information<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against them, dated October 1, 1991, reads:<br><br><blockquote>"That on or about July 27, 1991, in the evening thereof, at <i>Barangay</i> Sowa, Municipality of San Fernando, Province of Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused confederating together and mutually helping one another with intent of (sic) gain, violence and intimidation upon person, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously demand money from one Violeta Angustia y Mitra, box and then hogtied her, with intent to kill, hack (her) with a bolo hitting her neck, thereby inflicting wound which directly caused her instantaneous death, willfully, unlawfully and feloniously take, steal and rob away cash (in the) amount of One Thousand (P1,000.00) Pesos, belonging to Violeta Angustia y Mitra, to the damage and prejudice of the latter in the amount aforementioned.<br><br>"That apart from the aforementioned aggravating circumstances, the following also concurrently attended in the commission of the crime; that the crime was committed in an uninhabited place; that it was committed with insult or in disregard on account of her sex.<br><br>"CONTRARY TO LAW."</blockquote><br>Only accused Rudy and Rogelio Esparraguerra were arrested.&nbsp; They entered a plea of "not guilty"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and underwent trial.&nbsp; Ely Cabiles, on the other hand, remains at large.<br><br>The victim, Violeta Angustia, was a fish vendor.&nbsp; At the time of the incident, she was a resident of <i>sitio</i> Sowa in San Fernando, Masbate.&nbsp; Her house is about 200 meters away from the <i>poblacion</i> proper of <i>b</i><i>arangay</i> Sowa. Accused Ely Cabiles and Rogelio Esparraguerra (both accused reside in <i>barangay </i>Sowa) were her barriomates.&nbsp; The other accused, Rudy Esparraguerra, younger brother of Rogelio, resides in <i>barangay</i> Talisay (also in San Fernando, Masbate), which is about four (4) kilometers away from Violeta's house in <i>sitio</i> Sowa.<br><br>In essence, the prosecution<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> tried to establish the following facts:<br><br>On July 27, 1991, Violeta visited her daughter, Salvacion Almoguera, at the latter's house in Buenavista, San Fernando, Masbate. Violeta borrowed P1,000.00 cash from her daughter who readily gave the money to her.&nbsp; That same day, Violeta was to return to her house in <i>sitio </i>Sowa. At that time, she was allegedly tipsy. Concerned with her mother's safety, Salvacion decided to accompany her mother to <i>sitio </i>Sowa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Salvacion and Violeta left Buenavista at about 5:00 p.m. and trekked the trail leading towards Sowa. Along the way, they had to occasionally stop because Violeta was getting weak.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Soon after, it became dark.&nbsp; It was, however, a moonlit night.<br><br>The two women passed the <i>poblacion</i> proper of <i>barangay</i> Sowa at approximately 7:30 p.m. Suddenly, accused-appellants Rogelio and Rudy Esparraguerra and their uncle and co-accused Ely Cabiles, appeared from nowhere and blocked the trail leading to <i>sitio</i> Sowa. Salvacion, who was only a few meters behind her mother, recognized the three (3) men.&nbsp; She knew all of them since childhood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Rogelio demanded money from Violeta saying, "Give me the money." Violeta refused.&nbsp; Her response infuriated Rogelio.&nbsp; He forcibly took the money from Violeta and boxed her shoulders.&nbsp; She lurched.&nbsp; Thereafter, Ely Cabiles approached Violeta and twisted her arms towards her back.&nbsp; While she was in that defenseless position, Rudy drew a <i>bolo</i> and hacked Violeta, hitting her neck (just below the chin) in the process.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Salvacion was shocked by what transpired.&nbsp; Initially, she thought that the accused were only joking.&nbsp; During the hacking incident, she stood motionless at a distance of about two (2) meters behind her mother and about five (5) meters away from Rudy.&nbsp; Upon seeing the tragic fate of her mother, she came to her senses and ran back to her house in Buenavista. She immediately informed her husband of the incident.&nbsp; For fear that the three (3) men would harm her, Salvacion and her husband locked the doors and windows of their house.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The news about the death of Violeta spread in <i>barangay</i> Sowa in the early morning of July 28, 1991. Soon after, people started to gather at the crime scene.&nbsp; Among those who came to view the victim's body was Reynaldo Capisnon, a resident of <i>barangay</i> Sowa.<br><br>Apparently, that fateful evening, at around 6:00 p.m., Reynaldo Capisnon encountered Ely Cabiles and the Esparraguerra brothers along the trail leading to <i>barangay</i> Sowa. Reynaldo was on his way home after working in his farm some 150 meters away from the crime scene.&nbsp; At that time, Reynaldo was carrying a <i>bolo</i> which he used in clearing his farm.&nbsp; For no apparent reason, Rogelio grabbed Reynaldo's <i>bolo</i> and attempted to hack him.&nbsp; Fortunately, Reynaldo managed to escape. He immediately went home.&nbsp; He did not inform his wife or the authorities of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The following day (July 28), at around 7:00 a.m., Reynaldo was told by his neighbors that a dead body was recovered within the vicinity of <i>barangay</i> Sowa.&nbsp; Thereafter, Reynaldo and his neighbors proceeded to the crime scene. When they arrived, there was a crowd at the scene.&nbsp; Reynaldo viewed the victim's body.&nbsp; He also saw Salvacion Almoguera.&nbsp; She was holding a <i>bolo</i> stained with blood.&nbsp; Reynaldo immediately recognized the <i>bolo</i> as his because he himself made its handle and put a distinguishing mark thereon.&nbsp; He asked Salvacion to give it to him for safekeeping. She agreed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The victim's body was examined by Dr. Jesus Camposano, Rural Health Physician of Ticao District Hospital, in Masbate, on July 28, 1991.&nbsp; His postmortem examination revealed that the victim sustained, among others, contusion on her left shoulder and a 10-centimeter hacking wound in her neck which caused her death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants proffered the defense of denial and alibi.&nbsp; They claimed they were in their respective houses during the commission of the crime.<br><br>Rogelio Esparraguerra averred that he worked in the farm of Hilario Barruga from 7:00 a.m. until 4:00 p.m. of July 27, 1991.&nbsp; Thereafter, he went home and rested.&nbsp; He and his family had supper at 7:00 p.m.&nbsp; Rogelio claimed he did not see his younger brother Rudy nor his uncle Ely that evening.&nbsp; Rogelio and his wife slept at around 9:00 p.m.<br><br>The following day, at about 7:00 a.m., Rogelio again worked at Hilario's farm.&nbsp; Allegedly, Hilario hired him to work in his farm from July 24, 1991, to July 28, 1991.<br><br>Rosevita Esparraguerra, wife of Rogelio, corroborated her husband's testimony.&nbsp; She claimed, further, that she learned of Violeta's death from her neighbors at around 8:00 a.m. of July 28, 1991.&nbsp; She and her neighbors went to the crime scene which was only about a kilometer from their house.&nbsp; According to Rosevita, she wanted to see Violeta's body because her father and Violeta were cousins.&nbsp; Rosevita denied having seen Salvacion Almoguera and Reynaldo Capisnon at the crime scene.&nbsp; However, she admitted that she stayed thereat only for a brief moment.&nbsp; She went home thereafter.&nbsp; She admitted that, prior to the incident, they never had any misunderstanding with the victim and her family.<br><br>For his part, Rudy Esparraguerra alleged that, during the hacking incident on July 27, 1991, he stayed home with his wife, Milagros, who was then four (4) months pregnant.&nbsp; Allegedly, she had a miscarriage that night.<br><br>Rudy alleged that, on July 27, 1991, at around 3:00 p.m., Milagros felt pain in her stomach.&nbsp; An hour later, she started to bleed.&nbsp; The bleeding became more profuse at 6:00 p.m. She then asked Rudy to fetch a <i>hilot (</i><i>comadrona</i>).&nbsp; He left at once and returned home with the <i>hilot</i>, Adelina Baldeo, at around 6:30 p.m.&nbsp; Adelina attended to the needs of Milagros but failed to save the fetus.<br><br>That same evening, Rudy sought the help of spouses Felixberto Bartolay and Socorro Cabiles whose house is about ten (10) meters away from his house.&nbsp; Socorro is Rudy's mother, while Felixberto is his stepfather. Felixberto and Socorro went to Rudy's house at about 7:00 p.m.<br><br>While Adelina was attending to Milagros, Rudy, Felixberto and Socorro drank liquor.&nbsp; Adelina went home at 10:00 p.m.&nbsp; Felixberto and Socorro left an hour later.<br><br>Milagros&nbsp; Esparraguerra and Felixberto Bartolay corroborated Rudy's testimony.<br><br>To destroy the alibi put up by accused-appellants, the prosecution presented the testimonies of Hilario Barruga and Adelina Baldeo.<br><br>Hilario Barruga denied that Rogelio worked for him from July 24, 1991, until July 28, 1991.&nbsp; According to Hilario, Rogelio worked for him on July 14 and 15, 1991.&nbsp; Hilario allegedly encircled said calendar dates to help him remember the dates when he started planting his crops.<br><br>For her part, Adelina Baldeo confirmed that Milagros had a miscarriage sometime in July, 1991. However, she averred that the miscarriage happened on July 5, 1991, not July 27, 1991.&nbsp; In support of her allegation, Adelina submitted notebook containing the information relative to the child births she had attended to. Her testimony was corroborated by Imelda Almoguera, the supervising midwife of Adelina Baldeo.<br><br>After trial, accused-appellants were found guilty as charged by the court <i>a quo</i>.&nbsp; They were sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and ordered to pay the heirs of the victim, Violeta Angustia, civil indemnity in the amount of P50,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Hence, the appeal. Accused-appellants contend that:<br><br>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT DESPITE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE THEIR GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT.<br><br>We affirm the judgment of conviction.<br><br>Salvacion Almoguera positively identified accused-appellants as the culprits.&nbsp; She testified as follows:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0,

They aver that Salvacion's allegation -- that she was with her mother during the hacking incident -- does not inspire belief because it would be unwise for them as the alleged assailants, to leave her unharmed if, indeed, she had witnessed the incident.&nbsp; Further, accused-appellants fault Salvacion for her failure to report the crime to the authorities or seek help from her neighbors that same

Considering her relationship with the victim she would be more interested in securing the conviction of the guilty, and that would deter her from implicating persons other than the culprits, otherwise, the latter would go free.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>Accused-appellants' defense of alibi is not worthy of belief.&nbsp; We have repeatedly ruled that alibi is a weak defense as it is easy to concoct and fabricate.&nbsp; It becomes weaker in the face of the positive identification of an accused by an eyewitness with no improper motive to falsely testify.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>More.&nbsp; It is not sufficient for an accused to allege that he was away from the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.&nbsp; He must also present clear and convincing proof that it is physically impossible for him to be at the <b><i>locus criminis</i></b> while the crime was in progress.&nbsp; That physical impossibility is not present in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> The records show that Rogelio's residence is about a kilometer away from the crime scene.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> On the other hand, Rudy's house in <i>barangay Talisay</i> is about four (4) kilometers away from the house of the victim in <i>sitio</i> Sowa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> As a fish vendor, Rudy peddled fish not only in Talisay but also in the other nearby <i>barangays</i> of San Fernando, Masbate, such as Buenavista and Sowa.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> Thus, it was not physically impossible for both accused-appellants to be at the crime scene and commit the crime on July 27, 1991.<br><br>Accused-appellants also argue that, as per the testimony of Salvacion Almoguera, the main motive of the assailants was to rob the victim.&nbsp; Thus, they suggest that whoever killed the victim must have had previous knowledge that the victim was carrying cash at the time of the incident.&nbsp; In their case, no such evidence was adduced against them.<br><br>Jurisprudence tells us that the prosecution need not prove motive on the part of the accused when they have been positively identified as the perpetrators of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> In robbery with homicide cases, the prosecution need only to prove these elements:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> (a) the taking of personal property with violence or intimidation against persons; (b) that the property taken belongs to another; (c) the taking be done with <i>animo lucrandi;</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> and (d) on the occasion of the robbery or by reason thereof, homicide (used in its generic sense) was committed.&nbsp; These elements had been established by the prosecution when Salvacion testified in open court that accused-appellants, acting in unison, demanded money from her mother, forcibly took the same against her will and then hacked her to death.<br><br>We now come to the allegation in the information that the aggravating circumstances of disregard of sex and uninhabited place attended the commission of the crime.<br><br>Well settled is the rule that the aggravating circumstance that the crime was committed with insult or in disregard of the respect due the offended party on account of his rank, age or sex,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> may be taken into account only in crimes against persons or honor, when in the commission of the crime, there is some insult or disrespect shown to rank, age or sex.&nbsp; It is not proper to consider this aggravating circumstance in crimes against property.&nbsp; Robbery with homicide is primarily a crime against property and not against persons.
