				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Jesus V. Merritt seeks to disbar lawyer <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span>
H. <span class="SpellE">Cacanindin</span> on the ground of gross misconduct. Merritt
is the president of <span class="SpellE">Merriville</span> Realty and Housing
Corporation, the owner of a parcel of land (TCT No. T-8337) with an area of
more than thirty hectares located at Barrios San Joaquin and San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>, La Union (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="7"><u>July 29, 1969</u></st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Merriville</span> filed in the Court of First Instance of La
Union an injunction suit against <span class="SpellE">Filmag</span> Mining
Corporation to stop its mining operations in its <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span>
property. <span class="SpellE"><u>Cacanindin</u></span><u> was <span class="SpellE">Filmag's</span> lawyer in that litigation</u> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
C).</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime later, or on <u>September 10, 1969,</u> <span class="SpellE">Cacanindin</span> prepared a contract between <span class="SpellE">Filmag</span>
and Andrew V. Merritt, the brother of Jesus V. Merritt, authorizing <span class="SpellE">Filmag</span> to conduct mining operations on a portion of about
26,640 square meters of the said <span class="SpellE">Agoo</span> property (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A). Andrew was misrepresented in the contract as the
land­owner when the truth was that the land was the registered property of <span class="SpellE">Merriville</span> Realty and Housing Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">No copies of said document were filed with the <span class="SpellE">notarial</span> office (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E). <span class="GramE">Neither</span> was it recorded in the mining recorder's office (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">I and J).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1975</st1:date>,
Jesus V. Merritt filed a com­plaint for disbarment against <span class="SpellE">Cacanindin</span>.
He answered the complaint. Merritt filed a reply. The case was referred to the
Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although duly notified, <span class="SpellE">Cacanindin</span> did
not appear in any hearing in the Office of the Solicitor General. He did not
present any evidence. Only the complainant presented his evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the Solicitor General's complaint for suspension,
the respondent pleaded for compassion and understanding. He alleged that Jesus'
full-blood brother, Andrew, and his half-brother, Nestor <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>,
who were not affluent, were the ones who negotiated with <span class="SpellE">Filmag</span>
to conduct mining operations in the questioned area. They derived benefits from
the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that respondent <span class="SpellE">Cacanindin</span>
acted in bad faith in preparing the said contract because he knew that Andrew
was not the owner of the land (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A). Therefore, he
is guilty of gross misconduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view thereof and following the Solicitor General's
recommendation, he is hereby suspended from the prac­tice of law for a period
of three months. He is warned that more drastic disciplinary action will be
imposed if he commits another irregularity. A copy of this decision should be
attached to his record in the office of the Bar Confidant.</p>
