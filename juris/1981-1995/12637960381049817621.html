by the trial court for lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence this appeal with
this lone assignment of error:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The lower court erred in dismissing the complaint on ground
of prescription of action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The main crux on appeal
is whether plaintiff-appellant has lost her right to repurchase the homestead
in question as provided for under Sec. 119 of the Public Land Act as amended
which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Every conveyance of land acquired under the free patent or
homestead provisions, when proper, shall be <span style="">subject to repurchase </span>by the applicant, his widow, or his legal <span style="">heirs, </span><span style="">within a </span><span style="">period of five
years from the date of conveyance."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">It
is appellant's contention that she did not lose her right to repurchase since
the action to repurchase filed on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="9"><span style="">September 19, 1968</span></st1:date><span style=""> against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Octavio</span> <span class="SpellE">Acenas</span>, was well
within the five (5) years period stated in the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She avers that the filing of the original
complaint suspended the running of the pres­criptive period pursuant </span><span style="">to Article </span><span style="">1155 of the New Civil Code and although the
action against defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> NDC &amp; DOLE
was actually brought on December </span>24, 1968, or more than five years after
October 15, 1963, the action is still timely because prescription had ceased to
run on September 19, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> NDC and DOLE contend otherwise alleging that the
Amended Complaint which had <span class="SpellE">im­pleaded</span> them was filed
only on December 24, 1968, and therefore, already beyond the five-year
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> aver that the filing of the Amended Complaint
should be construed as the beginning of</span> a new action as of the date of
filing of the amendment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Plaintiff-appellant
maintains that NDC is subject to the same conditions that the original buyer
had, thus when NDC bought the land from the original buyer it (NDC) was
likewise bound to honor the right of repurchase of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She argues that the right of repurchase
cannot be avoided by the vendee through the simple expe­dient of conveying it
to the Government or any of its branches, units or instrumentalities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right is a part of public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the benevolent intention of the State
to </span><span style="">give </span><span style="">the homesteader every chance to</span><span style=""> </span>preserve for himself and his family
the land that the State granted him as a reward for his labor in clearing <span style="">and cultivating it.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Appellant claims that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
NDC, which succeeded <span class="SpellE">Acenas</span>, cannot be in a better
position than the source of its rights and that the action against <span class="SpellE">Acenas</span> also interrupts the running of the prescription
period against NDC just as well - to maintain otherwise would enable a
succession of vendees to successively put up the defense of prescription to
defeat the right of the vendor, who is not aware of any subsequent sale by the
original purchaser.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In <span class="SpellE">controversion</span>,
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> declare that it is not correct
for appellant to say that she had no knowledge that the lot was already sold to
defendant </span>NDC <span style="">because the sale
on </span><st1:date year="1963" day="23" month="12"><span style="">December 23, 1963</span></st1:date><span style=""> was registered and a Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-13803, T-2078
was </span>issued in favor of the NDC on <st1:date year="1965" day="9" month="7">July
 9, 1965</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and knowledge of such sale is presumed from the registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-appellant therefore had legal or
constructive knowledge that the subject lot was already sold to and owned by
the NDC.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The contentions of
plaintiff-appellant <span class="SpellE">Provido</span> merit <span class="GramE">Our</span>
consideration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Firstly, the original
complaint clearly states a c</span>ause of action against <span class="SpellE">Acenas</span>,
namely, the right given <span style="">by </span>the
law to the appellant <span class="SpellE">Provido</span> to repurchase the
property from the buyer within five (5) years from the <span style="">date of the sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation
in the Answer that the NDC had already purchased the same from <span class="SpellE">Acenas</span> is of no consequence, for it is <u>not</u> the
allegations in the answer, but those in the complaint which determine whether
or not the <u>complaint</u> <u>itself</u> states a cause of action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, even if We concede that the registration of the sale in
favor of the NDC was on July 9, 1965 and that therefore should have been
constructively known by appellant - the fact is - if an original complaint
already states a cause of action in favor of a plaintiff, the subsequent filing
of an amended complaint makes the filing <u>retroact</u> to the time the
original complaint was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation Co. vs. Philippine Farming Co.,
Ltd., 81 Phil. 273) Thus, insofar as the NDC and Dole are concerned, the filing
of the amended com­plaint against them (even if they were not the original
defendants) was legally effectuated upon the filing of the original complaint
(and therefore within the prescribed prescriptive period of five years), they
having merely stepped into the shoes of their predecessor-in-interest, <span class="SpellE">Acenas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Be </span>it noted that
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> NDC and Dole cannot invoke their rights
under their relationship with their predecessor-in-interest (<span class="SpellE">Acenas</span>) and yet disclaim the effects of said relationship
on exactly the same subject matter when it is to their disadvantage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is less than fair, eminently less than
just.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is also averred by <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> that appellant cannot now question the validity
of the title of the NDC because an action to repurchase is inconsistent with a
denial of defendant's title to the subject matter thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not paradoxically so because NDC and
Dole were <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> by plaintiff not necessarily as
an admission of the validity of their titles but because they are indispensable
parties to the final disposition of the lot in question, if during the trial on
the merits, appellant's claim will be proven to be valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
