This case is about the application of <em>res judicata</em> to an action
 to declare void or inexistent an alleged forged sale of registered 
land.  The controversy in­volves 13,472 square meters of Lot No. 378 of 
the Malinta Friar Lands Estate, located at Barrio Lingunan, Valenzuela, 
Bulacan.
<p>
That <em>proindiviso</em> one-sixth portion was supposedly sold by the 
spouses SiLvino San Diego and Eugenia Alcantara to the spouses Eugenio 
Cabral and Sabina Silvestre on <em>August 14, 1948</em> for P4,000.  The San Diegos claim that the sale was fabricated (p. 44, Rollo).
</p><p>
Eugenio Cabral was charged in the Court of First Instance at Baliuag 
with falsification of that sale.  Judge Juan F. Echiverri dismissed the 
charge on the ground of prescription because the information was filed 
only on <em>September 24, 1974</em> (pp. 77-78, Rollo).  The dismissal was upheld by this Court in Cabral vs. Puno, L-41692, April 30, 1976, 70 SCRA 606.
</p><p>
More than a quarter of a century after that alleged sale, or on May 2, 
1974, the San Diego spouses, acting on the theory that the sale was 
falsified, filed in the Court of First Instance, Valenzuela Branch, an 
action to nullify the title which the Cabrals had obtained for that 1/6 
portion and for damages (p. 48, Rollo).
</p><p>
Judge Eduardo P. Caguioa in an order dated January 9, 1978 dismissed the
 action on the ground that the order of dismissal issued by Judge 
Echiverri in the criminal case was <em>res judicata</em> in the civil case (pp. 79-81, Rollo).
</p><p>
The San Diegos assailed the order of dismissal by means of a petition 
for certiorari in the Court of Appeals.  In a resolution dated January 
30, 1979, Justices Porfirio V. Sison, Gancayco, and Gorospe ruled that 
Judge Caguioa erred in applying <em>res judicata</em> and that the San Diegos' action was imprescriptible because it was an action to nullify a document which was void <em>ab initio</em> (p. 260, Rollo).
</p><p>
However, in its decision of <em>March 30,1979</em>, Justices Porfirio V.
 Sison, Gancayco and Geraldez dismissed the petition because certiorari 
is not available to correct erroneous factual or legal conclusions and 
because an action based on a contract prescribes in ten years (pp. 109 
and 261, Rollo).
</p><p>
The San Diegos filed a motion for reconsideration.  The Appellate Court in its resolution of <em>November 29, 1979 set aside its decision</em>.
  It held that, as the action of the San Diegos is for a declaration of 
the forged or fictitious character of the deed of sale, it is 
imprescriptible.  It <em>reversed the lower court's order of dismissal</em>.  In the interest of justice, it ordered a trial on the merits.
</p><p>
The Cabrals appealed to this Court.  They contend that the Appellate Court erred in not applying <em>res judicata</em>
 in holding that the trial court's order of dismissal is bereft of 
factual and legal findings necessary to "apprise the parties of their 
legal standing"; in not holding that the order of Judge Echiverri in the
 criminal case, as affirmed by this Court, constitutes <em>res judicata</em> in the civil case and in not holding that the action had already prescribed.
</p><p>
It is obvious that the order of dismissal in the criminal action for 
falsification, which was based on prescription of the crime, cannot be 
considered <em>res judicata</em> or a bar to the civil action of the San Diegos against the Cabrals.
</p><p>
The civil complaint of the San Diegos does not stress that the deed of sale is void <em>ab initio</em>.
  For that reason, its imprescriptible character is not immediately 
apparent.  But the fact is that the concocted character of the sale and 
the imprescriptibility of the action to declare it inexistent constitute
 the premise on which the civil action is based (See art. 1410, Civil 
Code).
</p><p>
Since the trial court erred in dismissing the com­plaint on the ground of <em>res judicata</em>, the Appellate Court acted correctly in reversing that order.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE,<em> without prejudging the merits of the action of the San Diegos</em>, the resolution of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.

CONCURRING OPINION
</p><p><strong>
ABAD SANTOS, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I concur and wish to add the following comments:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.   Obviously the dismissal of the criminal action for falsification against Cabral did not constitute <em>res judicata</em>
 in respect of the action to nullify the title which the Cabrals had 
obtained.  The two actions are so disparate that it is impossible to 
apply the doctrine of prior judgment.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.   An action (or defense) for the declaration of the inexistence 
of a contract, i.e. void, does not prescribe (Art. 1410, Civil Code.) 
Accordingly, the action to nullify the title of the Cabrals on the 
ground that the sale to them was falsified does not prescribe.
  </p>
  <p>
  3.   Upon the other hand extraordinary acquisitive prescription of 
real property must also be considered.  (Art. 1137, Civil Code.)
  </p>
