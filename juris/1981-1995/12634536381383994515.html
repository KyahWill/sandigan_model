				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
petitioners pray that the portion of the decision of the Court of Appeals
sentencing the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. to pay solidarily the sum of
P5,000.00 as moral damages and sentencing both petitioners to pay respondent
Patrocinio Esguerra the sum of P2,000.00 as attorney's fees, be revoked.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Records show that the
Court of First Instance of Manila rendered a decision in Civil Case No. 53698,
entitled:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Patrocinio Esguerra versus
Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc., Nicasio de los Reyes, Transport Contractors,
Inc. and Modesto Joaquin, the dispositive portion of which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing the
complaint against defendants Transport Contractors, Inc. and Modesto Joaquin
but sentencing defendants Nicasio de los Reyes and Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines,
Inc., jointly and severally, to pay the plaintiff the sum of P25,085.40 as
compensatory damages, P5,000.00 as moral damages, P2,000.00 as attorney's fees
and the costs of suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cross-claim
of defendants Philippine Rabbit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Bus
Lines, Inc. and Transport Contractors, Inc. against each other <span class="GramE">are</span> hereby dismissed."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The Court of Appeals
modified the decision of the lower court as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing it would appear that all the defendants
are solidarily liable; but plaintiffs not having appealed the judgment, no
affirmative relief therefrom which absolved defendants Transport Contractors,
Inc. and Modesto Joaquin from the complaint as to make them co-responsible with
appellants Rabbit Bus and Nicasio de los Reyes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, except the obviously erroneous addition of the items for
compensatory damages which would be P20<span class="GramE">,085.40</span>, not
P25,085.40 as stated in the dispositive part of the appealed decision, the judg­ment
appealed from is in accordance with law and the evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, modified as indicated above, the judgment appealed
from is affirmed in all other respects, with costs against all the
defendants."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Patrocinio Esguerra was a paying passenger of Bus No. 223 of
Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
boarded the said bus at the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> terminal about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">four o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1961" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1961</st1:date>, bound for <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, Pampanga.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He sat at the left-end of the fourth row behind the driver, close to the
window.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the bus approached barrio <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Marcos</st1:place></st1:city>, Calumpit, Bulacan, a freight truck owned and
operated by the Transport Contractors, Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">was</span> coming from the opposite direction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vehicles sideswiped each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The window glass near the driver's seat of
the Rabbit Bus was detached and the left side of its body was damaged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The left forearm of Patrocinio Esguerra was
hit by a hard blunt object, breaking the bones into small fragments while the
soft tissues of the muscles and the skin were mas­cerated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was immediately brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Bulacan</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in Malolos, Bulacan for treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
left arm was amputated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff filed a case against the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines,
Inc. and the Transport Contractors, Inc., together with their respective
drivers, praying that judgment be rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against
the defendants requiring them to pay, jointly and severally damages, actual and
compensa­tory, moral and exemplary, litigation expenses and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found that the two drivers of the two
vehicles were reckless in driving. The two vehicles sideswiped each other at
the middle of the road.</p>

<blockquote>"By and large, it is not denied that plaintiff's arm was so
seriously injured as to need amputation as a result of the collision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">neither
denied that the Transcon truck hit the arm when it came in contact with the
Rabbit Bus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is immaterial which part
of the truck hit it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
carrier failed to exonerate itself from its presumed fault."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, Inc. and Nicasio
de los Reyes contend that the award of P5,000.00 moral damages is contrary to
law and violates the prevailing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">jurisprudence;
that the award of P2,000.00 attorney's fees is bereft of legal and factual
basis; that moral damages are not allowable against the carrier, </span>if <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ex-contracto, except when the mishap results
in death </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">where it is proved that the carrier was
guilty of </span>fraud <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or bad faith

14.0pt">Esguerra did not die and no fraud or bad </span>faith <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">had been imputed, much less proved, against
the </span>carrier, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">they cannot be
adjudged to pay moral damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">petitioners claim that there is no
evidence </span>adduced <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by passenger
Esguerra showing actual proof of expenses for attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
