<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution consisted primarily and most
importantly of the testimony of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span> who
claimed to have personally witnessed the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span>, then 14 years old,
testified that on <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="12">28 December 1983</st1:date>,
he was at his home in <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pio</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>, engaged in casual
conversation with his cousins, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
"Boy" <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonito</span>
Samson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the course of their
conversation, <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> asked Samson whether the latter
would be willing to exchange his (Samson's) pair <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>shoes and a little cash for a goat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Samson readily agreed to the proposed barter
transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
then invited <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span> and Samson to come along with
him to <span class="SpellE">Pigon's</span> house in <span class="SpellE">Catigao-tigawan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cataingan</span> <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> to secure
the goat he would turn over to Samson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The next day, <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="12">29 December 1983</st1:date>,
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, the
three left for <span class="SpellE">Catigao-tigawan</span> on foot as <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> refused to avail of any means of transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The three thus walked on a narrow footpath in
single file, Samson in the lead, followed by <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>,
while <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span> brought up the rear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the three reached <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galutan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cataingan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> suddenly grabbed Samson's right shoulder from behind
and as Samson turned to his right towards the rear, <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
pulled out a fan knife locally known as a "flamingo" and stabbed
Samson in the right breast.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Samson fell
to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
promptly stripped Samson of his shirt, belt and trousers, and wallet and pulled
out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paper </span>bills from such
wallet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
fled with the <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span>, warning the latter not ever
to discuss the incident with anyone otherwise something would happen to
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span>
was detained at <span class="SpellE">Pigon's</span> house for a few days <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and was </span>able to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">leave </span>only after <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
had been arrested by the police on <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="1">7
 January, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span> then immediately r<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Samson's tragic fate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Samson's mother,
after confirming the killing with <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span>, filed
the necessary complaint against <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also presented Dr. <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Monterde</span>, Rural Health Officer of <span class="SpellE">Catigao-tigawan</span>,
who had conducted the autopsy on the body of the victim, <span class="SpellE">Leonito</span>
Samson.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Monterde</span>
testified that the immediate cause of the victim's death was "hemorrhage
secondary to stab wounds;" that the injury sustained by Samson must have
been caused by a sharp, pointed object which could have penetrated his heart;
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that, </span>judging from the location
of the injury, the victim and the assailant were possibly "facing each

at the moment of the stabbing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense offered a different version of the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's principal plea was that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of alibi.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>According to <span class="SpellE">Yanson</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>San

<p class="BODY">The accused <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> testified that on <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="12">28 December 1983</st1:date>, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00
 p.m.</st1:time>, he was in his house in <span class="SpellE">Catigao-tigawan</span>,

accepted the invitation and went with <span class="SpellE">Yanson</span> to <st1:city><st1:place>San

promptly proceeded to assist the household in preparing for the festivities of
the next day and that he spent the night in <span class="SpellE">Yanson's</span>
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next day, <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="12">29 December 1983</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> once more involved himself in the household chores,

approximately 5 kilometers away from <st1:city><st1:place>San Rafael</st1:place></st1:city>,

<p class="BODY">The appellant assails the credibility of the prosecution's
principal witness, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense argues, firstly, that Jaime must
have been motivated by revenge in identifying the appellant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>, Jaime's first cousin, as author of the robbery
and killing here involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> related an alleged incident which had occurred when
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span> was staying in <span class="SpellE">Pigon's</span>
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jaime took <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio’s</span>
bolo and scythe without the latter's permission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the resulting confrontation, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> said, he had out
of anger slapped Jaime in the face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
find this argument unpersuasive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will
be noted that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span> are first cousins; Jaime's mother
is the sister of <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio's</span> father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering this close relationship by blood,
the Court finds it difficult to believe that Jaime would deliberately and
falsely accuse his first cousin of crimes as grievous as homicide and robbery,
for which the law imposes life imprisonment, simply to get even with <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> for the slapping that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
had supposedly administered to him some three (3) years before the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, appellant <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
himself had testified that on the day prior to the killing and robbery, he was
at Jaime's house chatting casually and to all appearances amiably with Jaime,
and that Jaime had willingly gone with <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonito</span> Samson to <span class="SpellE">Catigao-tigawan</span>
the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was, in other words,
no indication that Jaime had all the time been harboring a deep and deadly
resentment against <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also seeks to make capital out of Jaime's failure to
react instantly by manifesting concern for and trying to help the victim, <span class="SpellE">Leonito</span> Samson, as he lay on the ground bleeding and being
despoiled of his personal belongings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The argument, once more, is not persuasive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span>
was passive right then and there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> was relieving the fatally wounded Samson of his
shirt, belt and trousers and money, such passivity is easily ascribed to shock
that must have resulted from the sudden, deadly, turn of events from an amiable
conversation among cousins the day before in <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pio</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Corpuz</span>, to the
unprovoked murderous assault right before his eyes the following day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jaime, a young boy barely into his teens, was
either in a state of shock then and there or must have been frightened almost
out of his wits that appellant <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> would also
turn his homicidal attentions upon him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> also contends that
Jaime's sworn statement on the whole incident should not have been given any
consideration as it had not been prepared by Jaime personally.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be readily conceded that Jaime, who
was unable to read or write, could not have prepared <span class="GramE">his own</span>
affidavit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jaime, however, had placed
his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> on the affidavit which is equivalent to
his signature thereon, and an acknowledgment that the statements there set
forth were his own or at least faithfully reflected statements made by
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be stressed that Jaime's
narration of events during the trial did not vary in any substantial sense from
the statements in his affidavit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense sought to minimize the effect of Jaime's testimony as
an eye-witness, by denigrating his testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>having been coached or rehearsed
and scripted allegedly by the mother of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense claimed that Jaime was in effect
a paid witness, that is, that Jaime had testified against <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> because the victim's mother had paid Jaime to
do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This contention was denied by
Jaime who readily conceded that the mother of the victim had given him transportation
money for going to and from the court during the trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court finds it difficult, once more, to believe that Jaime <span class="SpellE">Deogrades</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">had </span>undertaken
to testify falsely against <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span> simply because the victim’s mother had given him
money for transportation expenses during the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General also pointed out<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
that there was nothing to show that the victim’s mother harbored any ill will
against <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pigon</span>
strong enough to lead her to buy false testimony tying him up with the killing
of her son.</p>
