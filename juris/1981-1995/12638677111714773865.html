				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Assailed in this petition for review is a decision of the respondent
appellate court rendered in AC-G.R. CV No. 61200 which reversed the decision of
the trial court, thereby ordering petitioner to pay private respondent the sum
of P46,590.00 with interest thereon from the time of <span style="">the filing of the complaint below until fully paid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both the trial and respondent appellate courts are in agreement
as to the factual antecedents of the case, thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is a life insurance underwriter or agent and a member
of a group of insurance underwriters known as <span class="SpellE">Bescon</span>
Insurance Agencies, Inc., representing the Manila Bankers Life Insurance
Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in January 1975, petitioner was able to convince private
respondent <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> Trinidad, the Vice-President and
General Manager and principal stockholder of Victory Liner Inc., to take out a
life insurance policy <span style="">with </span>Manila
Bankers Life Insurance Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
<span style="">result of a medical examination
conducted on private respondent showing that he was a diabetic, the insurance
company fixed the annual insurance premium at P93<span class="GramE">,180.00</span>
</span>for a life insurance policy with a face value of P1,000,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In order to persuade private respondent <span style="">to </span><span style="">take out the policy at the computed premium, petitioner offered to
return to him the amount corresponding to her commission out of the first
premium payment, which is equivalent to FIFTY percent (50%) thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon such inducement, private respondent
agreed to take the policy; thus, on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April 30, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, he issued two checks in favor of the </span>insurance
company <span style="">for P46<span class="GramE">,590.00</span>
each or a total of P93,180.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both
checks <span class="GramE">were</span> postdated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="5"><span style="">May 30, 1975</span></st1:date><span style=""> so as to enable petitioner to make
arrangements for the </span><span style="">return </span>to
private respondent of one check corresponding to the amount of her commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner received the sum of P51<span class="GramE">,249.00</span> from <span class="SpellE">Bescon</span> Insurance Agencies, Inc. as her commission out of
the first annual premium paid by private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet, petitioner failed to comply with her <span style="">commitment to pay private respondent P46<span class="GramE">,590.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon after,
private respondent's attorney sent a demand </span>letter <span style="">dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="7">July <span style="">7, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
reply thereto, petitioner, through her counsel, denied that she had entered
into such </span>an <span style="">arrangement with
private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1975</st1:date>,
private respondent instituted an action against petitioner for specific performance
and damages, docketed as Civil Case No. 3653.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In her answer with counterclaim filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1975</st1:date>, petitioner denied that she had made <span style="">a </span>verbal promise to return to private
respondent 50% of his premium.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial <span style="">court, </span>in
a decision dated <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="9">September 15, 1976</st1:date>,
made a categorical finding that petitioner had induced private respondent to
take out a life insurance <span style="">policy with
Manila Bankers Life Insurance Corporation by promising a rebate of 50% of his
first annual premium payment on said policy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, despite such finding, the trial court ordered the dismissal of
private respondent's complaint, holding that it could </span>not <span style="">grant private respondent any relief because
the agreement </span>entered into <span style="">between
the parties was void for being contrary to the provisions of Pres. Decree No.
612 [otherwise known as the Insurance Code] and public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court also dismissed petitioner's
counterclaim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision, petitioner interposed an appeal
with respondent appellate court, docketed as AC–G.R. CV No. 61200.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1983</st1:date>,
respondent appellate court affirmed the factual findings of the trial court and
sustained the dismissal of petitioner's counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in a split, decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>,
respondent appellate court reversed <span style="">the
trial court's judgment in so far as it dismissed the complaint, and instead
ordered petitioner to pay private respondent the sum of P46<span class="GramE">,590.00</span>,
with interest thereon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the filing of the comment, reply, rejoinder, and the
parties' respective briefs, the Court considered the issues joined and the case
submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two issues are presented for resolution, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not respondent appellate court
erred in holding that petitioner violated Section 361 of Pres. Decree No. 961;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not respondent appellate court
erred in ordering petitioner to pay private respondent the sum of P46<span class="GramE">,590.00</span>, with interest thereon.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the first <span style="">issue, </span>the
Court holds that the respondent appellate court committed no reversible error <span style="">in holding that petitioner violated the
provisions Section 361 of the Insurance Code of the Philippines, or Pres.
Decree </span>No. 961.</p>

<p class="BODY">A preponderance of evidence on record supports the findings of
the trial and appellate courts that petitioner had induced private respondent
to take out a life insurance policy from Manila Bankers Life Insurance
Corporation by promising him a rebate equivalent to 50% of the first annual
premium payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These factual findings
are, therefore, final and binding upon the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, however, argues that <span style="">in </span>view of the last paragraph of Article 1358 of the New Civil
Code, which provides that contracts where the amount involved exceeds <span style="">five hundred pesos must appear in writing,
the courts below erred in giving weight and credence to the testimonies of
private respondent and </span><span style="">his </span>witnesses
<span style="">which sought to prove that she had
promised such rebate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is patently erroneous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's reliance on Article 1358 is
misplaced for the apparent reason that this article does not lay down any
evidentiary rule which precludes oral testimony as a means of proving that
parties have entered into a con<span style="">trac</span>t
or agreement involving an amount of more than five hundred pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be gainsaid that petitioner, an insurance agent,
is enjoined by law from inducing prospective clients to take out insurance by
offering rebates from the premiums specified <span style="">in </span>the insurance policies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 361 of Pres. Decree No. 612 states:</p>

<blockquote>No insurance company doing business in the Philippines or any agent
thereof, no insurance broker, and no employee or other representative of any
such insurance company, agent, or broker, shall make, procure or negotiate any
contract of insurance or agreement as to policy contract, other than <span style="">is </span>plainly expressed in the policy or
other written contract issued or to be issued as evidence thereof, or <u>shall</u>
<u>directly</u> <u>or</u> <u>indirectly,</u> <u>by</u> <u>giving</u> <u>or</u> <u>sharing</u>
<u>a</u> <u>commission</u> <u>or</u> <u>in</u> <u>any</u> <u>manner</u> <u>whatsoever,</u>
<u>pay</u> <u>or</u> <u>allow</u> <u>or</u> <u>offer</u> <u>to</u> <u>pay</u> <u>or</u>
<u>allow</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>insured</u> <u>or</u> <u>to</u> <u>any</u>
<u>employee</u> <u>of</u> <u>such</u> <u>insured,</u> <u>either</u> <u>as</u> <u>an</u>
<u>inducement</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>making</u> <u>of</u> <u>such</u> <u>insurance</u>
<u>or</u> <u>after</u> <u>such</u> <u>insurance</u> <u>has</u> <u>been</u> <u>effected,</u>
<u>any</u> <u>rebate</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>premium</u> <u>which</u> <u>is</u>
<u>specified</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>policy,</u> <u>or</u> <u>any</u>
<u>special</u> <u>favor</u> <u>or</u> <u>advantage</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>dividends</u>
<u>or</u> <u>other</u> <u>benefits</u> <u>to</u> <u>accrue</u> <u>thereon,</u> <u>or</u>
<u>shall</u> <u>give</u> <u>or</u> <u>offer</u> <u>to</u> <u>give</u> <u>any</u>
<u>valuable</u> <u>consideration</u> <u>or</u> <u>inducement</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u>
<u>kind,</u> <u>directly</u> <u>or</u> <u>indirectly,</u> <u>which</u> <u>is</u>
<u>not</u> <u>specified</u> <u>in</u> <u>such</u> <u>policy</u> <u>or</u> <u>contract</u>
<u>of</u> <u><span style="">insurance</span></u><span style="">; </span>nor shall any such company, or any
agent thereof, as to any policy or contract of insurance issued, make any
discrimination against any Filipino in the sense that he is given less
advantageous rates, dividends or other policy conditions or privileges than are
accorded to other nationals because of his race [Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Section 363 of Pres. Decree No. 612 provides that
violation of the above section constitutes a ground for the immediate
revocation of the license issued <span style="">to the
erring insurance company, agent or broker and the imposition of a fine not
exceeding five hundred pesos.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is evident that petitioner's promise to pay private respondent
an amount equivalent to 50% of the first premium payment, which would be taken
out of her <span style="">commission on the insurance policy,
is covered squarely </span>by the express provisions of Section 361.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having disposed of the first issue, the Court will now proceed to
tackle the issue pertaining to the enforceability of the rebate agreement
between petitioner <span style="">and private
respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After deliberating on the arguments adduced in the <span style="">a </span>pleadings, the Court finds that
respondent appellate court committed reversible error of law in ordering
petitioner to <span style="">pay private respondent
the promised rebate of P46,590.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, without legal justification, respondent appellate court
contravened a basic rule in appellate procedure.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled in this jurisdiction that whenever an appeal
is taken in a civil case, an <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> who has not
himself appealed may not obtain from the <span style="">appellate
court any affirmative relief other than the ones granted in the decision of the
court below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
can only advance any argument that he may deem necessary to defeat the
appellant's claim or to uphold the decision that is being disputed, and he can
assign errors in his brief if such is required to strengthen the views
expressed by the court a quo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
assigned errors in turn may be considered by the appellate court solely to
maintain the appealed decision on other grounds, but not for the purpose of
reversing or modifying the judgment in the <span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span>
favor and giving him other affirmative <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> [<span class="SpellE">Bunge</span> Corporation v. Elena <span class="SpellE">Camenforte</span>
&amp; Co., 91 Phil. 861 (1952); <span class="SpellE">Andaya</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>, 107 Phil. 1151 (1960); <span class="SpellE">Enecilla</span>
</span>v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Magsaysay</span></span><span style="">, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-21568, </span></span><st1:date year="1966" day="19" month="5"><span class="GramE"><span style="">May 19, 1966</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">, 17 SCRA 125.]</span></span><span style=""> <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, while petitioner interposed her appeal from
the adverse decision rendered by the trial court dismissing her counterclaim,
private respondent inexplicably failed to appeal from the same decision which
dismissed his complaint as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was,
therefore, grave error on the part of respondent appellate court, in <span style="">reversing the trial court's decision, to
grant private respondent affirmative relief other than that found in the
appealed judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, <span class="SpellE">prescending</span> from the earlier
discussion declaring the collateral agreement for rebate between the parties a
prohibited transaction under Section 361 of <span style="">Pres. Decree No. 961, </span>the <span style="">Court
must conclude that respondent appellate court gravely erred in compelling
petitioner to comply with </span>her <span style="">promised
undertaking.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of Article 1409 (7) of the New Civil Code, the rebate
agreement between the petitioner and private respondent is deemed a contract
void <span class="SpellE">ab</span> <span class="SpellE">initio</span>, and
consequently, does not give rise to enforceable rights and obligations as
between the parties thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, respondent appellate court opined that since the
prohibition against rebate agreements under Section 361 of Pres. Decree No.
612, and the penalty imposed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> under Section
363, refer only to insurance <span style="">agents,
brokers or companies, Article 1412 (2) of the New Civil Code provides the </span><span style="">legal </span><span style="">basis for allowing private respondent, the party who is not at fault,
to recover the amount of P46<span class="GramE">,590.00</span> from petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This position is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are indeed instances where the law recognizes the right of
an innocent party to recover what he has paid or delivered under the agreement
[<u>See</u> Articles 1411-1417 of the New Civil Code], but contrary to the
ruling of respondent appellate court, the case at bar does not fall <span style="">under any of the legal exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent appellate </span><span style="">court </span><span style="">erred in citing Article 1412, par.(2) of the New Civil Code as legal </span>basis
<span style="">for compelling petitioner to comply
with her promise to pay private respondent the sum of P46,590.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1412, par<span class="GramE">.(</span>2), states that:</p>

<blockquote>If the act in which the unlawful or forbidden cause consists does
not constitute a criminal offense, the following rules shall be observed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style=""> </span>When only one of the contracting parties <span style="">is </span>at fault, he cannot recover what he
had given by reason of the contract, or ask for the fulfillment of what has
been promised him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other, who is not
at fault, may demand the return of what he has given without any obligation to
comply with his promise.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The article contemplates of a situation where the party who is
not at fault, in the performance of his undertaking with the party who is at
fault, has paid or delivered property to the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not the case between private
respondent and petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The agreement between the parties consists of an undertaking on
the part of private respondent to take out <span style="">a </span>life insurance policy with Manila Bankers Life Insurance
Corporation and, on the part of petitioner, to give private respondent a rebate
on the first premium payment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
no indication on record that petitioner, when she made the promise, had acted
with the knowledge and under the authority of the insurance company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is clear that the premium of P93<span class="GramE">,180.00</span> was actually paid to the insurance company in
consideration of the policy taken out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent's checks were issued for the account of Manila <span style="">Bankers </span>Life Insurance Corporation and
so <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> by the insurance company as the
payee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent thus cannot
"demand the return of what he has given" from petitioner because he
did not, strictly-speaking, pay the amount of P93<span class="GramE">,180.00</span>
to petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public <span style="">policy </span>considerations
serve to underscore further the Court's foregoing ruling that petitioner's
promise of rebate, which is expressly prohibited by law, may not be enforced
for compliance by the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 361 of Pres. Decree No. 612 is similar to the so-called
"anti-discrimination” statutes found other jurisdictions which regulate
the activities in the <span style="">insurance industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of these statutes is the
prevention of unfair discriminatory practices by insurance companies, agents
and brokers in order to ensure that equal terms are fixed for policyholders of
the same insurable </span>class and equal expectation of life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In aid and furtherance of this desirable
policy, the statutes <span style="">prohibit such
practices involving rebates or preferential treatment with respect to the cost
of the policy </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">the benefits allowed for the premium [<u>See</u>
<span class="SpellE">Laun</span> v. Pacific </span>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of
California, 111 NW 660 (1907); <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bernblum</span></span><span style=""> v.
Travelers Ins. Co. of Hartford, Connecticut, 105 SW 2d 941 (1937); <span class="SpellE">Chatz</span> v. Bloom, 54 NE 2d 889 (1944); <span class="SpellE">Mahone</span>
v.</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company, 561 P 2d 142
(1976).]<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that to enforce contracts
</span><span style="">or </span><span style="">agreements directly forbidden under these statutes, thereby allowing
recovery <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, would be subversive of the very
public </span><span style="">policy </span><span style="">which the law was designed and </span>intended
to uphold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, the statutes, like
Sections <span style="">361 and 363 of Pres. Decree
No. 961, in terms, are addressed to the insurance companies, agents and
brokers, and is enacted for the protection of policyholders, but this is for
the general body of policyholders who would suffer by the enforcement of the
prohibited agreements, and not for those </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">have entered into
such agreements and are seeking to profit by its terms [</span><u><span style="">See</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Smathers</span></span><span style=""> v. </span>Bankers' Life Ins. Co., 65 <span style="">SE </span>746 (1909); Richmond v. Conservative
Life Ins. Co., 165 NW 286 (1917); Sovereign Camp v. Waggoner, 173 So. 424 (1937).]<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
