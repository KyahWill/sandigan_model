tons of copra for U.S. $180.00 per ton, the same to be loaded either in April
or May, 1965.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The offer was accepted and
plaintiffs opened two irrevocable letters of Credit in favor of P.T. <span class="SpellE">Karkam</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1965</st1:date>,

noontime on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1965</st1:date>
and that it had left on hire at that time and date under the Uniform
Time-Charter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Charterer</span> was however twice in
default in its payments which were supposed to have been done in advance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first 15-day hire comprising the period
from March 27 to <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1965</st1:date>

follow-ups only on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="4">April

<span class="SpellE">Esso</span> Standard Oil (<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>)
Company supplied the vessel with 400 tons of bunker oil at a cost of US
$6,982.73.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the late payments for the charter of the vessel were
received and acknowledged by <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span> without
comment or protest, said agent notified Matthews, by telex on April 23, 1965
that the <span class="SpellE">shipowners</span> in accordance with Clause 6 of
the Charter Party were withdrawing the vessel from <span class="SpellE">Charterer's</span>
service and holding said <span class="SpellE">Charterer</span> responsible for

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1965</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">shipowners</span> entered into another charter agreement

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the original <span class="SpellE">Charterer</span> again
remitted on <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1965</st1:date>,
the amount corresponding to the 3rd 15-day hire of the vessel PAXOI, but this
time the remittance was refused.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1965, respondents Union Import and Export Corporation
and <span class="SpellE">Philin</span> Traders Corporation filed a complaint with
the Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VIII, against the Unknown Owners
of the Vessel "SS <span class="SpellE">Paxoi</span>", for specific
performance with prayer for preliminary attachment, alleging, among other
things, that the defendants (unknown owners) through their duly authorized
agent in London, the N &amp; J <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span>, Ltd.,
ship brokers, entered into a contract of Uniform Time-Charter with the <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping Company of Manila through the latter's
duly authorized broker, the Overseas Steamship Co., Inc., for the Charter of
the vessel "SS PAXOI" under the terms and conditions appearing
therein x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; that,
immediately thereafter, the <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping
Company sublet the said vessel to the plaintiff Union Import &amp; Export
Corporation which in turn sublet the same to the other plaintiff, the <span class="SpellE">Philin</span> Traders Corporation (Amended Record on Appeal, p.
17).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents as plaintiffs in the
complaint obtained a writ of preliminary attachment of vessel "PAXOI"
which was anchored at <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> on May 5, 1969, upon the
filing of the corresponding bond of P1,663,030.00 (Amended Record on Appeal, p.
27).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the attachment was lifted
on <st1:date year="1969" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1969</st1:date> upon
defendant's motion and filing of a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> for
P1,663,030 (Amended Record on Appeal, p. 62).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1965</st1:date>,
the complaint was amended to identify the defendant as <span class="SpellE">Marimperio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Naviera</span> S.A.,
petitioner herein (Amended Record on Appeal, p. 38).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In answer to the amended complaint, by way of
special defenses defendant (petitioner herein) alleged among others that the
Charter Party covering its vessel "SS (PAXOI) was entered into by
defendant with <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping Co. which is not a
party in the complaint; that defendant has no agreement or relationship
whatsoever with the plaintiffs; that plaintiffs are unknown to defendant; that
the charter party entered into by defendant with the <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Shipping Co. over the vessel "SS PAXOI" does not authorize a
sub-charter of said vessel to other parties; and that at any rate, any such
sub-charter was without the knowledge or consent of defendant or defendant's
agent, and therefore, has no effect and/or is not binding upon defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By way of counterclaim, defendant prayed that
plaintiffs be ordered to pay defendant (1) the sum of Â£5,085.133d or its
equivalent, in Philippine currency of P54,929.60, which the defendant failed to
realize under the substitute charter, from May 3, 1965 to May 16, 1965, while
the vessel was under attachment; (2) the sum of Â£68.7.10 or its equivalent of
P7,132.83, Philippine currency, as premium for defendant's counterbond for the
first year, and such other additional premiums that will have to be paid by
defendant for additional premiums while the case is pending; and (3) a sum of
not less than P200,000.00 for and as attorney's fees and expenses of
litigations (Amended Record on Appeal, p. 64).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1966</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping Corporation filed a
complaint-in-intervention to collect what it claims to be its loss of income by
way of commission and expenses in the amount of P15,000.00 and the sum of
P2,000.00 for attorney's fees (Amended Record on Appeal, p. 87).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its amended answer to the
complaint-in-intervention petitioner, by way of special defenses alleged that
(1) the plaintiff-in-intervention, being the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>,
did not notify the defendant <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>, petitioner,
herein, about any alleged sub-charter of the vessel "SS PAXOI" to the
plaintiffs; consequently, there is no <span class="SpellE">privity</span> of
contract between defendant and plaintiffs and it follows that
plaintiff-in-intervention, as <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, is
responsible for defendant <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> for the proper
performance of the charter party; (2) that the charter party provides that any
dispute arising from the charter party should be referred to arbitration in
London; that <span class="SpellE">Charterer</span> plaintiff-in-intervention has
not complied with this provision of the charter party; consequently its
complaint-in-intervention is pre-mature; and (3) that the alleged commission of
2-1/2% had not become due for the reason, among others, that the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> violated the contract, and the full hiring fee
due the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> was not paid in accordance with the
terms and conditions of the charter party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By way of counterclaim defendant <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
charged the plaintiff-in-intervention attorney's fees and expenses of
litigation in the sum of P10,000.00 (Amended Record on Appeal, p. 123).</p>

severally, the amount of Â£8,011.38 or its equivalent in Philippine currency of
P75,303.40, at the exchange rate of P9.40 to 1 for the unearned charter hire
due to the attachment of the vessel "PAXOI" in <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>,
plus premiums paid on the <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span> as of April 22,
1968 plus the telex and cable charges and the sum of P10,000.00 as attorney's
fees and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
dismissed the complaint-in-intervention, ordering the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>,
on the counterclaim, to pay defendant the sum of P10,000.00 as attorney's fees,

<p class="NUMROMANS">I.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Article 1311 of the Civil Code, a contract takes
effect between the parties who made it, and also their assigns and heirs,
except in cases where the rights and obligations arising from the contract are
not transmissible by their nature, or by stipulation or by provision of
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since a contract may be violated
only by the parties, thereto as against each other, in an action upon that
contract, the real parties in interest, either as plaintiff or as defendant,
must be parties to said contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, a party who has not taken part in it cannot sue or be sued
for performance or for cancellation thereof, unless he shows that he has a real
interest affected thereby (Macias &amp; Co. v. Warner Barnes &amp; Co., 43
Phil. 155 [1922] and <span class="SpellE">and</span> <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>
v. Warner Barnes &amp; Co., Ltd., 88 Phil. 125 [1951]; <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Fieldmen's</span> Insurance Co., Inc., 26 SCRA 178
[1968]).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the charter party, basis of the complaint,
was entered into between petitioner <span class="SpellE">Marimperio</span> <span class="SpellE">Compania</span> <span class="SpellE">Naviera</span>, S.A., through
its duly authorized agent in London, the N &amp; J <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span>,
Ltd., and the <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping Company of Manila
through the latter's duly authorized broker, the Overseas Steamship Co., Inc.,
represented by Matthews, <span class="SpellE">Wrightson</span> <span class="SpellE">Burbridge</span> Ltd., for the Charter of the "SS PAXOI"
(Amended Complaint, Amended Record on Appeal, p. 33; Complaint-in-Intervention,
Amended Record on Appeal, p. 87).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
also alleged in both the Complaint (Amended Record on Appeal, p. 18) and the
Amended Complaint (Amended Record on Appeal, p. 39) that the <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping Company sublet the said vessel to
respondent Union Import and Export Corporation which in turn sublet the same to
respondent <span class="SpellE">Philin</span> Traders Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is admitted by respondents that the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is the <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Shipping Company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even paragraph 3 of
the complaint-in-intervention alleges that respondents were given the use of
the vessel "pursuant to paragraph 20 of the Uniform Time Charter x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" which precisely
provides for the subletting of the vessel by the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 24).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, Article 652 of the Code of Commerce provides that the
charter party shall contain, among others, the name, surname, and domicile of
the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span>, and if he states that he is acting by
commission, that of the person for whose account he makes the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious from the disclosure made in the
charter party by the authorized broker, the Overseas Steamship Co., Inc., that
the real <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> is the <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Shipping Company (which sublet the vessel to Union Import and Export
Corporation which in turn sublet it to <span class="SpellE">Philin</span> Traders
Corporation).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a sublease, there are two leases and two distinct judicial
relations although intimately connected and related to each other, unlike in a
case of assignment of lease, where the lessee transmits absolutely his right,
and his personality disappears; there only remains in the juridical relation
two persons, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the assignee who is
converted into a lessee (Moreno, Philippine Law Dictionary, 2nd ed., p.
594).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, in a contract of
sublease, the personality of the lessee does not disappear; he does not transmit
absolutely his rights and obligations to the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span>;
and the <span class="SpellE">sublessee</span> generally does not have any direct
action against the owner of the premises as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>,
to require the compliance of the obligations contracted with the plaintiff as
lessee, or <u>vice</u> <u>versa </u>(10 <span class="SpellE">Manresa</span>,
Spanish Civil Code, 438).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, there are at least two instances in the Civil Code which
allow the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to bring an action directly (<span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>directa</u></span>)
against the sub-lessee (use and preservation of the premises under Art. 1651,
and rentals under Article 1652).</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. 1651 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Without prejudice to his obligation toward the sub-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, the sub-lessee is bound to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
for all acts which refer to the use and preservation of the thing leased in the
manner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">stipulated between the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the lessee."</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 1652 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The sub-lessee is <span class="SpellE">susidiarily</span>
liable to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> for any rent due from the
lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the sub-lessee shall
not be responsible beyond the amount of rent due from him, in accordance with
the terms of the sub-lease, at the time of the extra-judicial demand by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Payments of rent in advance by the sub-lessee shall be deemed not
to have been made, so far as the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> claim is
concerned, unless said payments were effected in virtue of the custom of the
place."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted however that in said two Articles it is not the
sub-lessee, but the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, who can bring the
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, it is clear
that the sub-lessee as such cannot maintain the suit they filed with the trial
court (See A. <span class="SpellE">Maluenda</span> and Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Enriuez</span>,
46 Phil. 916).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the law of agency "with an undisclosed principal, the
Civil Code in Article 1883 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"If an agent acts in his own name, the principal has no right
of action against the persons with whom the agent has contracted; neither have
such persons against the principal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In such case the agent is the one directly bound in favor of the
person with whom he has contracted, as if the transaction were his own, except
when the contract involves things belonging to the principal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The provisions of this article shall be understood to be without
prejudice to the actions between the principal and agent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While in the instant case, the true <span class="SpellE">charterers</span>
of the vessel were the private respondents herein and they chartered the vessel
through an intermediary which upon instructions from them did <u>not</u>
disclose their names.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1883
cannot help the private respondents, because although they were the actual
principals in the charter of the vessel, the law does not allow them to bring
any action against the adverse party and vice-versa.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer to the question of whether or not the default of <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> in the payment of the charter hire within the
time agreed upon gives petitioner a right to rescind the charter party <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>, is undoubtedly in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clause 6 of the Charter party specifically provides that the
petitioner has the right to withdraw the vessel from the service of the <span class="SpellE">charterers</span>, without noting any protest and without
interference of any court or any formality in the event that the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> defaults in the payment of hire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The payment of hire was to be made every
fifteen (15) days in advance.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that the vessel "SS PAXOI" came on
hire on <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On March 29, <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span>
notified by letter the <span class="SpellE">charterer</span> through Matthews of
that fact, enclosing therein owner's debit note for a 15-day hire payable in
advance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1965</st1:date> the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span>
again notified Matthews that the payment for the first 15-day hire was
overdue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again on April 2 the <span class="SpellE">shipowner</span> telexed Matthews insisting on the payment, but it
was only on April 7 that the amount of US $22,500.00 was remitted to Williams
Deacons Bank, Ltd. through the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Commercial
Banking Corporation for the account of <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span>,
agent of petitioner, corresponding to the first 15-day hire from March 27 to <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1965</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1965</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span> acknowledged receipt of the payment,
again with a debit note for the second 15-day hire and overtime which was due
on <st1:date year="1965" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="4">April
 23, 1965</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span> notified Matthews
by telex that <span class="SpellE">charterers</span> were in default and in
accordance with Clause 6 of the charter party, the vessel was being withdrawn
from <span class="SpellE">charterer's</span> service, holding them responsible
for unpaid hire and all other legal claims of the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents remitted the sum of US $6,000.00
and US $10,000.00 to the bank only on <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="4">April
 26, 1965</st1:date> representing payment for the second 15-day hire from April
12 to <st1:date year="1965" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1965</st1:date>,
received and accepted by the payee, <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span>
without any comment or protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unquestionably, as of <st1:date year="1965" day="23" month="4">April
 23, 1965</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Vlassopulos</span> notified
Matthews of the withdrawal of the vessel from the <span class="SpellE">Charterers</span>'
service, the latter was already in default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, under Clause 6 of the charter party the owners had the
right to withdraw "SS PAXOI" from the service of <span class="SpellE">charterers</span>,
which withdrawal they did.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question that now arises is whether or not petitioner can
rescind the charter party <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answer is also in the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A contract is the law between the contracting
parties, and when there is nothing in it which is contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public policy or public order, the validity of the contract must be
sustained (Consolidated Textile Mills, Inc. v. Reparations Commission, 22 SCRA
674 [1968]; <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> v. Republic Surety &amp; Insurance
Co., Inc., 31 SCRA 329 [1970]; Castro v. Court of Appeals, 99 SCRA 722 [1980]; <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> v. Court of Appeals, 100 SCRA 197 [1980]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A judicial action for the rescission of a
contract is not necessary where the contract provides that it may be revoked
and cancelled for violation of any of its terms and conditions (<span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> v. Court of Appeals, 29 SCRA 504 [1969]; University
of the Philippines v. De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles, 35 SCRA 102
