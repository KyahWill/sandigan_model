				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There are before us two (2) Petitions for Review of the same
Court of Appeals' Resolution dated 17 May 1973, which Resolution dismissed
petitioners' appeals from an Order of the Court of Agrarian Relations
("CAR") dated 15 January 1972, issued in CAR Cases Nos. 2557 and
2558.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="7">14 July 1970</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Emerenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span> and <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span> filed with
the CAR of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
CAR Cases Nos. 2557 and 2558, respectively, seeking the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of respondent Benjamin Salazar from lands owned by petitioners and situated in
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lolomboy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bocaue</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bulacan</span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners’ lands had theretofore been
devoted to the growing of rice, except that during the dry season, portions
thereof were planted to water-melons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent Salazar was the agricultural lessee or tenant of the lands in
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record is silent on the
precise area of the lands involved but the modest extent of such lands is
clearly indicated by the agreed rental amounting to sixteen-and-a-half (16-1/2)
<span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> per
calendar year paid by Salazar to each of the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their complaints, petitioners stated that
they wanted to convert their agricultural lands to commercial or
non-agricultural uses; that they wanted to establish poultry and hog farming
projects in said land; and that the rest of their land would be cultivated by
petitioners personally.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 October 1971, after pre-trial and after commencement of
trial on the merits, respondent Salazar (defendant therein) filed a Motion to
Dismiss both complaints upon the ground that Section 36 of Republic Act No.
3844 had been amended by Section 7 of Republic Act No. 6389, by deleting
personal cultivation by the landowner as a ground for permissible <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of a tenant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent argued that Republic Act No. 6389, which took effect on <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="9">10 September 1971</st1:date>, should be given
retroactive effect as a piece of remedial legislation beneficial to
agricultural tenants like himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
CAR issued an Order dated <st1:date year="1971" day="16" month="11">16 November
 1971</st1:date> holding in abeyance the resolution of the Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> until after the parties shall have completed their
respective presentation of evidence on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, on 15 January 1972, and before completion
of presentation by the parties of their respective cases, the CAR issued a
lengthy Order, which after extensive discussion including reproduction of
excerpts from the debates in the Senate preceding the enactment of Republic Act
No. 6389, <u>granted</u> the Motion to Dismiss <u>partially</u>, that is, with
respect to personal cultivation by the landowner as a ground for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of a tenant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, that Order partially denied the Motion to Dismiss with
respect to the other ground adduced by petitioners, that is, conversion of the
lots into land devoted to commercial and non-agricultural purposes, such as
poultry and hog farming, holding that <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of a
tenant remained legally permissible on such other ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of this Order read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, defendant's urgent motion to dismiss dated <st1:date year="1971" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1971</st1:date> is <u>partly granted
with respect to the cause of action alleged in the </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">complaints</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> in these cases <u>for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the
defendant</u> from the landholdings in question <u>on the ground of personal
cultivation</u>, and as prayed for, <u>the complaints with respect to said
cause of action are hereby dismissed</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same motion to dismiss hereby [is] partly denied with respect to the
cause of action for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the defendant
from the lands in question on the ground of conversion thereof into commercial
and other useful non-agricultural purposes.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Let the records of these cases be returned to Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Onesimo</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Espejo</span> for further
proceedings.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners both appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="5">17
 May 1973</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals rendered a Resolution dismissing
petitioners' appeals upon the ground that the <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="1">15 January 1972</st1:date> order of the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> was an interlocutory order and as such could
not be the subject of an appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Resolution of the Court of Appeals stated in part:</p>

<blockquote>"It should be observed that the order subject of the present
appeal partly grants the motion to dismiss the complaints on the cause of
action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> based on personal cul<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">tivation and partly denied the same motion to
dismiss with respect to the cause of action based on conversion of the land
into commercial or other useful non-agricultural purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Evidently, therefore the said order does
not finally dispose of the pending cases so that nothing more can be done with
them in the agrarian court</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
said order expressly orders the return of the records of the case to the
hearing commissioner for further proceedings, <u>so that trial may continue on
the other cause of action</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘1<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span>
forefront question is whether the disputed orders are final and <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondents Santos <span class="SpellE">Dy-Kia</span> seeks to strike down the
appeal because the orders are interlocutory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And citing Section 1 of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Rule 43
of the Rules of Court, he puts forth the claim that only <u>final</u> orders of
the Agrarian court are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:24.3pt">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The orders of the lower court are aimed at continuing the proceedings
before it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hearing of the case on the
merits is not yet finished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Final
judgment is yet to be rendered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A rule
long standing and frequently cited is that orders which do not finally dispose
of the pending case so that nothing more can be done with it in the trial court
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">are interlocutory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An issue relating thereto must wait until the
trial court writes its final determination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is only then that appeal is proper.’ (<span class="SpellE">Anduina</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Kia</span></span>,
29 SCRA 198, 204)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>In view of the foregoing consideration,
therefore, the appeal in these two cases should be dismissed."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a Motion for Reconsideration, petitioners urged that the Order
of the CAR was not interlocutory considering that one of the substantive
grounds or causes of action pleaded by petitioners for the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
of respondent Salazar would definitely no longer be considered by the CAR in
rendering its decision on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Motion for Reconsideration was unsuccessful.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant Petition for Review, petitioners assail the
correctness of the Court of Appeals holding that the CAR Order of <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="1">15 January 1972</st1:date> was merely an
interlocutory order which could not, therefore, be the subject of an appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Hewald</span>, et al</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court characterized an interlocutory order in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"An order is interlocutory when it does not terminate or
finally dispose of the case, because it leaves something to be done by the
court before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the case is finally
decided on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, an order is
final when it disposes of the case, decides the same on the merits and leaves
nothing to be done therefore, except the execution of the terms of the order of
judgment (Moran, Rules of Court, Vol. I, 1957 ed., pp. 638-39)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Again, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bairan</u></span><u>
vs. Tan <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> Lay</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held, through Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"It is settled that <u>a court order is final in character if
it puts an end to the particular matter resolved</u>, leaving thereafter no
substantial proceeding to be had in connection therewith except <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">its execution; and, contrary wise, that a
given court order is merely of an interlocutory character if it is provisional
and leaves substantial proceeding to be had in connection with its subject in
the court by whom it was issued.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>It will be noted that in connection with the order of <st1:date year="1961" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1961</st1:date>, <u>the court decided</u>,
over petitioner's objection, <u>that the latter must file a surety bond as
prayed by his adversary</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <u>upon
the question of whether or not petitioner should file a bond, there was nothing
left to be done except to have the order aforesaid carried out</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">is
clear, therefore, that <u>said order in final in character</u> and, as such, is
<span class="SpellE">appealable</span> within the period of appeal provided by
law."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Tested by the above standard, the <span class="SpellE">CAR's</span>
Order of 15 January 1972 may be seen to be a strange creation indeed, neither
fish nor fowl, as it were, but bearing the characteristics of both an
interlocutory and a final order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
order may be regarded as an interlocutory order, just as the Court of Appeals
did so regard it, on the basis that further proceedings in the main case were
clearly contemplated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time,
however, those further proceedings would clearly relate only to one of the two
(2) substantive grounds or causes of action raised by the petitioners in their
complaints before the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The CAR purported to have disposed finally of
the question of availability under the law of the ground of personal
cultivation by a landowner of his own land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the CAR in effect held that it would no longer receive nor
consider any evidence and argument concerning the ground of personal
cultivation; insofar as that particular substantive ground was concerned, there
was nothing more that petitioners could have done.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian Court</st1:address></st1:street>
here committed the serious error of rendering a piecemeal judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of partially granting and partially
denying the respondent's Motion to Dismiss, the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> should have held in abeyance the resolution
of that Motion to Dismiss, treated the same as a supplemental answer, continued
with trial until completion thereof on an unrestricted basis, and dealt with
both substantive grounds alleged by petitioners in its decision on the merits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Court of Appeals too erred in
failing to modify and set aside that part of the Order of the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> which purported to dismiss the complaint to
the extent it was based upon the claim of personal cultivation by the
landowner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It remains to point out that the <st1:street><st1:address>Agrarian
  Court</st1:address></st1:street> was also substantively in reversible error
when it held that personal cultivation by the landowner was no longer available
as a ground for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of an agricultural lessee
or tenant in the circumstances of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners’ complaints were filed, as already noted, on <st1:date year="1970" day="14" month="7">14 July 1970</st1:date>; Republic Act No. 6389
was approved by the Congress on <st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="9">10
 September 1971</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> clause, however, of Republic Act No. 6389 did
not invest Section 7 thereof with retroactive effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the general rule established
in Article 4 of the Civil Code that "laws shall have no retroactive
effect, <u>unless the contrary is provided</u>,” must be held applicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The precise issue here at stake has already been resolved by the
Court in <u>Calderon, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Cruz</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"We are not unaware that <u>on </u><st1:date year="1971" day="10" month="9"><u>10 September 1971</u></st1:date><u> R.A. 6389 took effect
and abrogated the right of the landowners to dispossess the tenants or
agricultural lessees on the ground of personal cultivation</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>We have categorically ruled in <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> v. </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Court
of Appeals and Castro v. Castro</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">
[128 SCRA 519 (1984)] <u>and reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Diga</span> v.
Adriano</u> [133 SCRA 421 (1984)] <u>that said law can not be given retroactive
effect in the absence of a statutory provision for retroactivity or a legal
implication of law to that effect</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To hold that landowners can no longer <span class="GramE">effect</span>
their claims because of R.A. No. 6389 would deprive them of their right to
enjoy their property which they had already asserted before the statute was passed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the lawmaking body in providing
personal cultivation as a ground to eject tenants intended to encourage and
attract the small</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">landowners to
go to their respective province and till their lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, this rule would be till thwarting
the policy of encouraging self-reliant and independent small farmers if <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>-lessee relations on tiny parcels of land, as in this
case, are perpetuated even when the owners can and desire to cultivate the land
themselves."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is thus clear that both grounds for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of respondent tenant or lessee raised by
petitioners, i.e., personal cultivation by the landowner and conversion of the
land to commercial and non-agricultural uses, remained available to petitioners
at the time of the filing of their complaints.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners were entitled to prove that respondent lessee or tenant
could be ejected from petitioners' land on either or both grounds under the
provisions of Republic Act No. 6389.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
should, however, add the <u>caveat</u> that our disposition of this case is
without prejudice to the possible application of subsequently enacted laws and
regulations, if any, bearing upon this matter.</p>
