petitioners in the respondent court, since they did not appeal the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since petitioners do not dispute the findings of fact of the
respondent Court, the same shall be quoted verbatim and are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears from the records that Juan Mendoza, father of
herein defendant Olympio Mendoza, is the owner of Farm Lots Nos. 46 and 106,
Block 2, Psd-38453 of the Bahay Pare Estate, Bahay Pare, Candaba, Pampanga,
with an area of 23,000 square meters and 19,000 square meters,
respectively.  Devoted to the production
of palay, the lots were tenanted and cultivated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">by </span>Julian dela Cruz, husband of plaintiff Eufrocina dela
Cruz.  Julian died on September 25,
1979.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In her complaint, Eufrocina alleged that upon the death of Julian,
she succeeded him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span><i>bona fide</i>
tenant of the subject lots; that between <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">July
7 </span>to July 15, 1984, Olympio Mendoza, in conspiracy with the other
defendants, prevented her daughter Violeta and her workers through force,
intimidation, strategy and stealth, from entering and working on the subject
premises; and that until the filing of the instant case, defendants had refused
to vacate and surrender the lots, thus violating her tenancy rights.  Plaintiff therefore prayed for judgment for
the recovery of possession, and damages with a writ of preliminary mandatory
injunction in the meantime.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendants Reyes, Parayao, Aguinaldo and Mananghaya, duly elected
and/or appointed barangay officials of Bahay Pare, Candaba, Pampanga, denied
interference in the tenancy relationship existing between plaintiff and
defendant Mendoza, particularly in the cultivation of the latter's farm
lots.  Claiming that they have always
exercised fairness, equity, reason and impartiality in the discharge of their
official functions, they asked for the dismissal of the case and claimed moral
damages and attorney's fees in the total amount of P165,000.00 (Answer with
Counterclaim, Records, pp. 48-51).</blockquote>

<blockquote>For his part, defendant Mendoza raised abandonment, sublease and
mortgage of the farm lots without his consent and approval, and non-payment of
rentals, irrigation fees and other taxes due the government, as his
defenses.  He also demanded actual and
exemplary damages, as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>attorney's
fees (Answer, pp. 77-78).</blockquote>

<blockquote>During the pendency of the case in the lower court, Mendoza was in
possession of the subject lots and had cultivated the same.  Upon motion of plaintiff, the court directed
its Deputy Sheriff to supervise the harvesting of the palay crops, to cause the
threshing thereof and to deposit the net harvest (after deducting from the
gross harvest the seeds used and the expenses incurred), in a bonded warehouse
of the locality subject to the disposition of the court."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court rendered judgment affirming the appealed
agrarian court's decision with the modification that Lot 106 is not covered by
it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dispositive portion of the appealed decision, which was
modified, states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered, in favor of plaintiff

Farmlot No. 46 from where they were ejected and dispossessed, so much so that

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellate court in its ratiocination, which We
adopt, on why it has to dismiss the appeal.  Said the Court:</p>

<blockquote>"In her Complaint, plaintiff-appellee alleged that she ‘is the
tenant of Farm Lots Nos. 46 and 106, Block 2, Psd-38453 of the Bahay Pare
Estate, Bahay Pare, Candaba, Pampanga, with a total area of 23,969 square
meters, more or less x x x' (Complaint, Records, vol. 1, p. 1).  However, during Violeta's testimony, she
clarified that actually only Lot No. 46 containing an area of 23,000 square
meters is the one involved in the dispute.  Lot No. 106, which contains an area of 19,000 square meters, is not
included in this controversy (T.S.N., August 10, 1989, p. 5; May 8, 1989, p.
12).  This statement was corroborated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>plaintiff's counsel, Atty. Arturo
Rivera, who informed the court that the 19,000 square meter lot is subject of a
pending case before the MTC of Sta. Ana, Pampanga (Ibid., p. 15).  The inconsistency between the averment of
the complaint and the testimony of the witness should not be taken against
appellee not only because there was no showing that she intended to mislead
defendants and even the trial court on the subject matter of the suit.  It would appear that Lot No. 106 had been
included in the complaint since together with Lot 46, it is owned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>Olimpio's father.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We also concur with the trial court's finding on the participation
of the other appellants in the dispossession of appellee.  They not only knew Olimpio personally, some
of them were even asked by Olimpio to help him cultivate the land, thus lending
credence to the allegation that defendant Olimpio, together with his
co-defendants, prevented plaintiff and her workers from entering the land
through 'strong arm methods.' (Decision of RTC, Records, vol. II, p. 564).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finally, we rule that the trial court did not err when it favorably
considered the affidavits of Eufrocina and Efren Tecson (Annexes "B"
and "C") although the affiants were not presented and subjected to
cross-examination.  Section 16 of P.D.
No. 946 provides that the ‘Rules of Court shall not be applicable in agrarian
cases even in a suppletory character.’ The same provision states that 'In the
hearing, investigation and determination of any question or controversy,
affidavits and counter-affidavits may be allowed and are admissible in
evidence.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, in agrarian cases, the quantum of evidence required is no
more than substantial evidence.  This
substantial evidence rule was incorporated in section 18, P.D. No. 946 which
took effect on June 17, 1976 (Castro vs. CA, G.R. No. 34613, January 26,
1989).  In Bagsican vs. Hon. Court of
Appeals, 141 SCRA 226, the Supreme Court defined what substantial evidence is:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Substantial evidence does not necessarily import preponderant
evidence, as is required in an ordinary civil case.  It has been defined to be such relevant evidence as a reasonable
mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion and its absence is not
shown by stressing that there is contrary evidence on record, direct or
circumstantial, for the appellate court cannot substitute its own judgment or
criteria for that of the trial court in determining wherein lies the weight of
evidence or what evidence is entitled to belief.’ "<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The case of Medina <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. Asistio, </span>G.R. No. 75450, 191 SCRA
218, 223-224 (1990) enumerates several instances when findings of fact may be
passed upon and reviewed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span>this
Court, none of which obtain herein:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:22.5pt">"(1) When the conclusion is
a finding grounded entirely on speculation, surmises or conjectures (Joaquin <i>v</i>.
Navarro, 93 Phil. 257 [1953]); (2) When the inference made is manifestly
mistaken, absurd or impossible (Luna <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v</span></i>.
Linatok, 74 Phil. 15 [1942]); (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion
(Buyco <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v</span></i>. People, 95
Phil. 453 [1955]); (4) When the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts
(Cruz <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v</span></i>. Sosing, L-­4875,
Nov. 27, 1953); (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting (Casica <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v</span></i>. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Villaseca, </span>L-9590 Ap. 30, 1957; unrep.); (6) When the Court of
Appeals, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the
same is contrary to the admissions of both appellant and appellee (Evangelista <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v</span></i>. Alto Surety and Insurance Co.,
103 Phil. 401 [1958]); (7) The findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to
those of the trial court (Garcia <i>v</i>. Court of Appeals, 33 SCRA 622
[1970]); Sacay <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">v</span></i>. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sandiganbayan, </span>142 SCRA 593 [1986]);
(8) When the findings of fact are conclusions without citation of specific
evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>which they are based
(<i>Ibid</i>.,); (9) When the facts set forth in the petition as well as in the
petitioners' main and reply briefs are not disputed by the respondents (<i>Ibid</i>.,);
and (10) The findings of fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the
supposed absence of evidence and is contradicted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">by </span>the evidence on record (Salazar <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">v</span></i>. Gutierrez, 33 SCRA 242 [1970])."</p>
