<p class="BODY"><span>This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the 
August 5, 1968 Resolution of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 41582-R<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> which dismissed petitioner's petition for 
<i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary injunction on the ground 
that the allegations made therein are insufficient to justify further 
process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The undisputed facts of this case, as found by the Court of 
Appeals, are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"On <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1960">August 24, 
1960</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Taurino</span> <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, resident of <span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, as paying 
passenger on board bus No. 215 belonging to the Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, 
Inc. sustained multiple serious physical injuries when the said bus crashed 
against an acacia tree at <span class="SpellE">Balaoan</span>, La Union, so he 
brought a complaint for contractual tort (Record 27-31).<span>&nbsp; </span>In its 
answer, defendant <span class="GramE">interposed</span> the defense that the 
collision was due to a fortuitous event (Rec. 42).<span>&nbsp; </span>The case was 
set for trial on <st1:date month="12" day="23" year="1965">December 23, 
1965</st1:date> (45), but upon motion of both counsels, the same was transferred 
to February 3 and 4, 1966 (55).<span>&nbsp; </span>On October 6, 1966, the Court 
noted that no pre-trial has ever been conducted in the case and so both parties 
were ordered to confer with one another for a compromise agreement at the office 
of the Philippine Rabbit at <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, and the trial was postponed to November 14, 1966 
(57), and then transferred again upon petition filed by counsel for Philippine 
Rabbit for January 20, 1967 (58) and then postponed again to April 29, 
1967.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the scheduled trial of <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1967">April 29, 1967</st1:date>, at <st1:time hour="8" minute="40">8:40 
a.m.</st1:time>, only the defendant Philippine Rabbit appeared and upon motion 
of its counsel, the Court dismissed the case for nonappearance of plaintiff 
(59).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"It appears that the order of dismissal of April 29, 1967 alluded to 
was sent to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> Pimentel, counsel for 
plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Taurino</span> <span class="SpellE">Singson</span>, 
at <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, by registered mail on May 3, 1967 and was received by 
Miss May <span class="SpellE">Altuna</span>, addressee's agent, on May 6, 1967 
(70).<span>&nbsp; </span>On July 6, 1967 (61 days from receipt of dismissal), counsel 
for plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Taurino</span> <span class="SpellE">Singson</span> filed a Petition for Relief accompanied by an 
affidavit of said plaintiff alleging that on April 29, 1967 (the date of the 
trial), he went to <span class="SpellE">Vigan</span> for the purpose of attending 
the trial of his case, boarding a passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> at 
<span class="SpellE">Cabugao</span>, his hometown, but when the vehicle reached 
<span class="SpellE">Lapog</span>, it had engine trouble, causing him to reach the 
court 15 minutes late and found thereupon that the court had already dismissed 
the case (60-62).<span>&nbsp; </span>Opposition was filed to the Petition for Relief 
by defendant Philippine Rabbit.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="8" day="16" year="1967">August 16, 1967</st1:date>, the lower court granted plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Taurino</span> <span class="SpellE">Singson's</span> Petition for 
Relief (66).<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="9" day="14" year="1967">September 
14, 1967</st1:date>, counsel for Philippine Rabbit filed a motion for 
reconsideration of the order granting the petition for Relief (67-69).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>In an order dated November 28, 1967, the lower <span>court denied the 
motion for reconsideration of the Philippine Rabbit on the ground that 
'considering the particular nature and circumstances of the case at bar and also 
the fact that petition for relief under Rule 38 is premised on <em>equity</em> 
and is allowed on exceptional circumstances, and that as far as possible failure 
of justice should be avoided; and that, further, in the absence of a clear lack 
of intention to delay, a case should not be allowed to go off on procedural 
points to the end that technicalities should not override the merits of the 
case, this court believes that justice is best served if in this particular case 
the plaintiff will be given his day in court' (71-72)."<span>&nbsp; </span>(pp.

<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date month="7" day="9" year="1968"><span>July 
9, 1968</span></st1:date><span>, herein petitioner Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines, 
Inc. filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and <i>Mandamus</i> with Preliminary 
Injunction in the Court of Appeals, docketed therein as CA-G.R. No. 
41582-R.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In a Resolution dated August 5, 1968, the Court of Appeals 
denied the petition on the ground that the allegations made therein are 
insufficient to justify its </span><span>giving </span><span>it due 
course.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved for <span class="GramE">a 
reconsideration</span>, but in a Resolution dated </span><st1:date month="10" day="1" year="1968"><span>October 1, 1968</span></st1:date><span>, the Court of 
Appeals denied the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant petition (Record, pp. 
4-20).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In a Resolution dated </span><st1:date month="11" day="15" year="1968"><span>November 15, 1968</span></st1:date><span> (<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 
47), this Court gave due course to the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1969"><span>January 23, 1969</span></st1:date><span>, petitioner filed its 
Brief (<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 56), and on </span><st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1969"><span>February 19, 1969</span></st1:date><span>, private respondent 
filed his Brief (<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 63).<span>&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="3" day="29" year="1969"><span>March 29, 1969</span></st1:date><span>, 
petitioner filed its Reply Brief (<em>Ibid.</em>, p. 67).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In its brief, petitioner raised the following assignment of 
errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN<i> </i>NOT HOLDING THAT THE 60-DAY 
PERIOD PROVIDED IN SEC. 38 OF THE RULES OF COURT IS MANDATORY AND 
NON-EXTENDIBLE.<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN APPLYING THE RULE OF EQUITY IN THE 
CASE AT BAR.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
<p class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT <i>CERTIORARI</i> DOES 
NOT LIE IN THE INSTANT CASE.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The petition is impressed with merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Sec. 3 of Rule 38 of the Rules of Court clearly states that 
"A petition provided for in either of the preceding sections of this rule must 
be verified, filed within sixty (60) days after the petitioner learns of the 
judgment, order or other proceeding to be set aside, and not more than six (6) 
months after such judgment or order was entered or said proceeding was 
taken."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is undisputed that the Petition for Relief 
</span><span>in </span><span>this case was filed 61 days from receipt of the 
notice of dismissal or one day late.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, the records show 
that counsel for private respondent learned of the dismissal on the same day, 
</span><st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1967"><span>April 29, 
1967</span></st1:date><span>, when he arrived late for the hearing so that the 
Petition for Relief was at least eight (8) days late.<span>&nbsp; </span>The records 
further show that counsel for private respondent did not move for 
reconsideration of the Order of dismissal, <span class="GramE">nor</span> for new 
trial.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither did he appeal, thereby allowing the decision to 
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>As 
</span><span>a last resort, he could have availed of the sixty day period 
provided for by Rule 38 to file a Petition for Relief from judgment but again he 
allowed this opportunity to lapse.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, to him is applicable, 
the well known maxim that "equity aids the vigilant, not those who slumber on 
their rights." (<em>Henson v. Director of Lands</em>, 55 Phil. 
586).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Turqueza</em></span><em> v. Hernando</em> (97 SCRA 488 
</span><i><span style="font-size: 11pt;">[</span></i><span style="font-size: 11pt;">1</span><span>980<i>]</i>) the Supreme Court in 
disallowing the reopening of the case which has become final, ruled that there 
is no justification in law and in fact, for respondent judge's void act of 
ordering the reopening of the case which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Thus, the Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span>"The Court has said time and again that the doctrine of 
finality of judgments is groun</span>ded on fundamental considerations of public 
policy and sound practice that at the risk of occasional error the judgments of 
courts must become final at some definite date fixed by law.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
law gives an exception or 'last chance’ of a <span style="font-style: italic;">timely</span> petition for relief from judgment 
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period (within<span> 60 days 
from knowledge and 6 months from entry of judgment) under Rule 38 
<em>supra</em>, but such grace period must be taken as 'absolutely <em>fixed, 
inextendible, never interrupted and cannot</em></span> <span>be subject to any 
condition or contin</span>gency.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because the period fixed is 
itself devised to meet a condition or contingency (fraud, accident, mistake or 
excusable neglect), the equitable remedy is an act of <span style="font-style: italic;">grace</span><span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span>, </span>as it were, designed to give 
the aggrieved party another and <span style="font-style: italic;">last 
</span><em>chance</em>' "and failure to avail of such <em>last chance</em> 
within the grace period fixed by the statute or Rules of Court is 
<em>fatal</em>." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Turqueza</em></span><em> v. Hernando, 
supra</em>).</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">In expressly reiterating the above-quoted decision the Supreme 
Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Arcilla</em></span><em> v. Arcilla</em> (138 
SCRA 56 [1985]), held that the Rule is that, for a petition for relief under 
Rule 38 to be entertained by the court, the petitioner must satisfactorily show 
that he has faithfully and strictly complied with the provisions of said 
Rule.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is incumbent upon the petitioner to show 
that the said petition was filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period specified in Sec. 3, of the same, 
otherwise on this ground alone, the petition should be dismissed.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>For the foregoing reasons, neither can private respondent 
invoke equity as a ground for the reopening of the case "there being an express 
provision of law under which the remedy can be invoked.” <span class="GramE">(<em>Barrios v.</em></span> <span class="GramE"><em>Go Thong &amp; 
Co.</em>, 7 Phil. 542 [1963]).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The rule is, "equity follows 
</span><span>the law" </span><span>and as discussed in Pomeroy's Equity 
Jurisprudence Vol. 2 pp. 188-189 (as cited in Appellant's Brief p. 20), the 
meaning of the principle is stated as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"There are instances, indeed, in which a court of equity gives a 
remedy, where the law gives none; but where a particular remedy is given by the 
law, and that remedy is bounded and circumscribed by particular rules, it would 
be very improper for the court to take it up where the law leaves it and to 
extend it further than the law allows."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the same manner, the issue as to whether or not 
<i>certiorari</i> is proper in the instant case, has been laid to rest in the 
case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Turqueza</em></span><em> vs. Hernando</em>, 
(<em>supra</em>) where a petition for <i>certiorari</i> directly filed with the 
Supreme Court was granted and the Court set </span>aside the questioned order 
issued by respondent judge to reopen the case below for reception of 
respondent-defendant's evidence notwithstanding the lapse of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period within which respondent could file a 
petition for relief from judgment.</p>
