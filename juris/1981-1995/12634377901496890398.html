<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In its session of July 6, 1993, the
COMELEC en banc resolved to deny the petition for local initiative on the
ground that its subject is "merely a resolution (pambayang kapasyahan) and
not an ordinance."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> On
July 13, 1993, the COMELEC en banc further resolved to direct Provincial
Election Supervisor, Atty. Benjamin <span style="">N. </span>Casiano, to hold action on the
authentication of signatures being gathered by petitioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These COMELEC resolutions are sought to be set aside in the
petition at bench.  The petition makes the
following submissions:</p>

<blockquote>"5.<span style=""> </span>This
is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">5.01<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For <i>certiorari,</i>
conformably to Sec. 7, Art. IX of the Constitution, to set aside Comelec
Resolution Nos. 93-1676 and 93-1623 (Annexes "E" and "H") insofar
as it disallowed the initiation of a local initiative to annul PAMBAYANG
KAPASYAHAN BLG. 10, SERYE 1993 including the gathering and authentication of
the required number of signatures in support thereof.</p>

<p class="2Q">5.01.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As an
administrative agency, respondent Comelec is bound to observe due process in
the conduct of its proceedings.  Here,
the subject resolutions, Annexes "E" and "H", were issued <b>ex
parte </b>and without affording petitioners and the other proponents of the
initiative the opportunity to be heard thereon.  More importantly, these resolutions and/or directives were issued
with grave abuse of discretion.  A
Sangguniang Bayan resolution being an act of the aforementioned local
legislative assembly <span style="">is u</span>ndoubtedly
a proper <span style="">subject of initiative.  (Sec. 32, Art. VI, Constitution)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">5.02<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For <i>mandamus</i>,
pursuant to Sec. 3, Rule 65, Rules of Court, to command the respondent Comelec
to schedule forthwith the continuation of the signing of the petition, and
should the required number of signatures be obtained, set a date for the
initiative within forty-five (45) days thereof.</p>

<p class="2Q">5.02.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Comelec's authority in the matter of local initiative is merely
ministerial.  It is duty-bound to
supervise he gathering of signatures in support of the petition and to set the
date of the initiative once the required number of signatures are obtained.</p>

<p class="3Q">‘If the required number of signatures is obtained, the Comelec
shall then set a date for the initiative during which the proposition shall be
submitted to the registered voters in the local government unit concerned for
their approval within sixty (60) days from the date of certification by the
Comelec, as provided in subsection (g) hereof, in case of provinces and cities,
forty-five (45) days in case of municipalities, and thirty (30) days in case of
barangays.  The initiative shall then be
held on the date set, after which the results thereof shall be certified and
proclaimed by the Comelec.  (Sec. 22,
par. (h) R.A. 7160.'"</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Respondent COMELEC opposed the
petition.  Through the Solicitor
General, it contends that under the Local Government Code of 1991, a resolution
cannot be the subject of a local initiative.  The same stance is assumed by the respondent Sangguniang Bayan of
Morong.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We grant the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bench is of transcendental significance because it
involves an issue of first impression -delineating the extent of the all
important original power of the people to legislate.  Father Bernas explains that "in republican systems, there
are generally two kinds of <span style="">legislative
power, original and derivative.  Original legislative power is possessed by the sovereign people.  Derivative legislative power is that which
has been delegated by the sovereign people to legislative bodies and is
subordinate to the original power of the people."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Our constitutional odyssey shows that up until 1987, our people
have not directly exercised legislative power, both the constituent power to
amend or revise the Constitution or the power to enact ordinary laws.  Section 1, Article VI of the 1935
Constitution delegated legislative power to Congress, thus "the
legislative power shall be vested in a Congress of the Philippines, which shall
consist of a Senate and a House of Representatives." Similarly, section 1,
Article VIII of the 1973 Constitution, as amended, provided that "the
Legislative power shall be vested in a Batasang Pambansa."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in the set up was the trust of the people in Congress to
enact laws for<sup> </sup>their benefit.  So total was their trust that the people did not reserve for themselves
the same power to make or repeal laws.  The omission was to prove unfortunate.  In the 70's and until the EDSA revolution, the legislature failed the
expectations of the people especially when former President Marcos wielded
lawmaking powers under Amendment No. 6 of the 1973 Constitution.  Laws which could have bridled the nation's
downslide from democracy to authoritarianism to anarchy never saw the light of
day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In February 1986, the people took a direct hand in the
determination of their destiny.  They
toppled down the government of former President Marcos in a historic bloodless
revolution.  The Constitution was
rewritten to embody the lessons of their sad experience.  One of the lessons is the folly of
completely surrendering the power to make laws to the legislature.  The result, in the perceptive words of
Father Bernas, is that the new Constitution became "less trusting of
public officials than the American Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">For the first time in
1987, the system of people's initiative was thus installed in our fundamental
law.  To </span>be sure, it was a late
awakening.  As early as 1898, the state
of South Dakota has adopted <span style="">initiative
and </span>referendum <span style="">in </span>its
constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

In any event, the framers of our 1987 Constitution realized the value of
initiative and referendum as an ultimate weapon of the people to negate
government malfeasance and misfeasance and they put in place an overarching
system.  Thus, thru an initiative, the
people <span style="">were </span>given
the power to amend the Constitution itself.  Sec. 2 of Art. XVII provides:  "Amendments to this Constitution may likewise be directly proposed
by the people through initiative upon a petition of at least twelve per centum
of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district
must be represented by at least three per centum of the registered voters
therein." Likewise, thru an initiative, the people were also endowed with
the power to enact or reject <b style=""><i style=""><span style="">any
act </span></i></b><b style=""><i style=""><span style="">or </span></i></b><b style=""><i style=""><span style="">law</span></i></b><span style=""> </span>by
congress or local legislative body.  Sections 1 and 32 of Article VI provide:</p>

<blockquote><u><span style="">"Section
1</span></u><span style="">.  </span>The legislative power shall be vested in the Congress of
the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House of <span style="">Representatives </span><b style=""><i style=""><span style="">except to </span>the </i></b><b style=""><i style=""><span style="">extent </span>reserved to the people by the
provision on initiative and referendum.</i></b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u><span style="">Section</span>
32</u>.  The Congress shall, as early as

every legislative district must be represented by at least three per centum of
the registered voters thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The COMELEC was also empowered to enforce
and administer all laws and regulations relative to the conduct of <span style="">an </span>initiative
and referendum.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

Congress or local legislative body.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, Congress responded to the mandate of the
Constitution.  It enacted laws to put
into operation the constitutionalized concept of initiative and
referendum.  On August 4, 1989, it
approved Republic Act No. 6735 entitled "An Act Providing for a System of
Initiative and Referendum and Appropriating Funds Therefor.” Liberally borrowed
from American laws,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> R.A.

procedure of initiative and referendum;<sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;">18</span></sup> and their limitations.<sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;">19</span></sup>
Then came Republic Act No. 7160, otherwise known as The Local Government Code
of 1991.  Chapter 2, Title XI, Book I of
the Code governed the conduct of local initiative and referendum.</p>

<p class="BODY">In light of this legal backdrop, the essential issue to be
resolved in the case at bench is whether Pambayang Kapasyahan Blg. 10, serye
1993 of the Sangguniang Bayan of Morong, Bataan is the proper subject of an
initiative.  Respondents take the
negative stance as they contend that under the Local Government Code of 1991
only an ordinance can be the subject of initiative.  They rely on section 120, Chapter 2, Title XI, Book I of the
Local Government Code of 1991 which provides: "Local Initiative Defined. -  Local initiative <span style="">is </span>the legal process whereby the registered voters of a local
government unit may directly propose, enact, or amend any ordinance."</p>

<p class="BODY">We reject respondents’ narrow and literal reading of the above
provision for it will collide with the Constitution and will subvert the intent
of the lawmakers in enacting the provisions of the Local Government Code of
1991 on initiative and referendum.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution clearly includes not only ordinances but
resolutions as appropriate subjects of a local initiative.  Section 32 of Article VI provides in luminous
language:  "The Congress shall, <span style="">as </span>early as
possible, provide for a system of initiative and referendum, and the exceptions
therefrom, whereby the people can directly propose and enact laws or approve or

<p class="BODY">The constitutional command to include <b><i style="">acts</i></b><span style=""> (i.e., </span>resolutions)
as appropriate subjects of initiative was implemented by Congress when it
enacted Republic Act No. 6735 entitled "An Act Providing for a System of
Initiative and Referendum and Appropriating Funds Therefor." Thus, its
section 3(a) expressly includes resolutions as subjects of initiatives on local
legislations, <b><i style="">viz:</i></b></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3.  Definition of
Terms - For purposes of this Act, the following terms shall mean:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">(a) <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"Initiative"
is the power of the people to propose amendments to the Constitution or to
propose and enact legislations through an election called for the purpose.</p>

<p class="2Q">There are three (3) systems of initiative, namely:</p>

<p class="2Q">a.1  Initiative on the
Constitution which refers to a petition proposing amendments to the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="2Q">a.2  Initiative on statutes
which refers to a petition proposing to enact a national legislation; and</p>

<p class="2Q">a.3  Initiative on local
legislation which refers to a petition proposing to enact a regional,
provincial, city, municipal, or barangay law, <b><i><span style="">resolution</span></i></b><span style=""> </span>or
ordinance." (Emphasis ours)</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, its section 16 states:  "Limitations Upon Local Legislative Bodies - Any proposition
on ordinance or <b style=""><i style="">resolution</i></b><span style=""> </span>approved through the system of initiative and referendum as
herein provided shall not be repealed, modified or amended, by the local
legislative body concerned within six (6) months from the date therefrom x <span style="">x </span>x." On January 16, 1991, the
COMELEC also promulgated its Resolution No. 2300 entitled "In Re Rules and
Regulations Governing the Conduct of Initiative on the Constitution, and
Initiative and Referendum, on National and Local Laws." It likewise recognized
resolutions as proper subjects of initiatives.  Section 5, Article I of its Rules states:  "Scope of power of initiative - The power of initiative may
be exercised to amend the Constitution, or to enact a national legislation, a
regional, provincial, city, municipal or barangay law, <b style=""><i style="">resolution</i></b><span style=""> </span>or
ordinance."</p>

<p class="BODY">There can hardly be any doubt that when Congress enacted Republic
Act No. 6735 it intended resolutions to be proper subjects of local
initiatives.  The debates confirm this
intent.  We quote some of the
interpellations when the Conference Committee Report on the disagreeing
provisions between Senate Bill No. 17 and House Bill No. 21505 were being
considered in the House of Representatives, <i>viz</i>:</p>

<blockquote>"THE SPEAKER PRO
TEMPORE.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Gentleman from Camarines
Sur is recognized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ROCO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the Conference Committee Report on
the disagreeing provisions between Senate Bill No. 17 and the consolidated
House <span style="">Bill No. 21505 which refers to
the system providing for the initiative ad referendum, fundamentally, Mr. Speaker,
we consolidated the Senate and the House versions, so both versions are totally
intact in the bill.  The </span>Senators
<span style="">ironically provided for </span>local
initiative and referendum and the House of Representatives correctly provided
for initiative and referendum on the Constitution and on national legislation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I move that we approve the consolidated <span style="">bill.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ALBANO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr Speaker.</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What is the pleasure of the Minority
Floor Leader?</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ALBANO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will the distinguished sponsor answer just a few questions?</blockquote>

<blockquote>THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What does the sponsor say?</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ALBANO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">I </span>heard
the sponsor say that the only difference in the two bills was that in <span style="">the Senate version there was </span>a <span style="">provision for local initiative and
referendum, whereas the House version has none.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>MR.
ROCO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In fact, the Senate version
provided purely for local initiative and referendum, whereas in the House
version, we <span style="">provided purely for
national and constitutional legislation.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ROCO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, Mr.
Speaker.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ALBANO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So that we
will now have a <b><i style="">complete </i></b>initiative
and referendum both in the <span style="">constitutional
amendment and national legislation.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ROCO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is
correct.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

consonance with the provision of the Constitution whereby it mandates this
Congress to enact the enabling law, so that we shall have a system which can be
done every five years.  Is it five years
in the provision of the Constitution?</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. ROCO.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That is
correct, Mr. Speaker.  For
constitutional amendments to the 1987 Constitution, it is every five
years."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">23</span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the submission of the respondents, the subsequent
enactment of the Local Government Code of 1991 which also dealt with local
initiative did not change the scope of its coverage.  More specifically, the Code did not limit the coverage of local
initiatives to ordinances alone.  Section
120, Chapter 2, Title IX Book I of the Code cited by respondents merely defines
the concept of local initiative <span style="">as </span>the legal process whereby the registered
voters of a local government unit may directly propose, enact, or amend any <b style=""><i style="">ordinance</i></b><span style="">.  </span>It does not, however, deal with the
subjects or matters that can be taken up in a local initiative.  It is section 124 of the same Code which
does.  It states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 124.  Limitations
on Local Initiatives.  (a) The power of
local initiative shall not be exercised more than once a year.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><b><i>Initiative
</i></b><b><i><span style="">shall extend only to </span>subjects
</i></b><b><i><span style="">or matters which are
within the legal </span>powers of the </i></b><b><i><span style="">Sanggunians to enact.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This provision clearly does not limit the
application of local initiatives to ordinances, but to all "subjects or
matters which are within the legal powers of the Sanggunians to enact,"
which undoubtedly includes resolutions.  This interpretation is supported by section 125 of the same Code which
provides:  "Limitations upon
Sanggunians.  - Any <b style=""><i style="">proposition</i></b><span style=""> </span>or
ordinance approved <span style="">through the system
of initiative and referendum as herein provided shall not be repealed, modified
or amended by the sanggunian concerned within six (6) months from the date of
the approval thereof x x x." Certainly, the inclusion of the word </span><b style=""><i style="">proposition</i></b><span style=""> </span><span style="">is inconsistent with respondents' thesis that
only ordinances can be the subject of local initiatives.  The principal author of the Local Government
Code of 1991, former Senator Aquilino Pimentel, espouses </span>the same
view.  In his commentaries on the said
law, he wrote, <b><i>viz</i></b>:<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">24</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subject Matter Of
Initiative.  All sorts of measures may
be the subject of direct initiative for as long as these are within the
competence of the Sanggunian to enact.  In California, for example, direct initiatives were proposed to enact a
fishing control bill, to regulate the practice of chiropractors, to levy a
special tax to secure a new library, to grant a franchise to a railroad
company, and to prevent discrimination in the sale of housing and similar
bills.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Direct initiative on the local level may, therefore, cover all
kinds of measures provided that these are within the power of the local
Sanggunians to enact, subject of course to the other requisites enumerated in
the section.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Form of
Initiative.  Regarding the form of the
measure, the section speaks only of "ordinance," although the measure
may be contained in a resolution.  If
the registered voters can propose ordinances, why are they not allowed to
propose resolutions too?  Moreover, the
wording of Sec. 125, below, which deals not only with ordinances but with
"any proposition" implies the inclusion of resolutions.  The discussion hereunder will also show
support for the conclusion that resolutions may indeed be the subject of local
initiative."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We note that respondents do not give any reason why resolutions
should not be the subject of a local initiative.  In truth, the reason lies in the well known distinction between a
resolution and an ordinance - i.e., that a resolution is used whenever the
legislature wishes to express an opinion which is to have only a temporary
effect while an ordinance is intended to permanently direct and control matters
applying to persons or things in general.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">25</span></span></a> Thus,
resolutions are not normally subject to referendum for it may destroy the
efficiency necessary to the successful administration of the business affairs
of a city.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">26</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, however, it can not be argued that the
subject matter of the resolution of the municipality of Morong merely
temporarily affects the people of Morong for it directs a permanent rule of
conduct or government.  The inclusion of
Morong <span style="">as </span>part
of the Subic Special Economic Zone has far reaching implications in the
governance of its people.  This is
apparent from <span style="">a
</span>reading of section 12 of Republic Act No. 7227 entitled "An Act
Accelerating the Conversion of Military Reservations Into Other Productive
Uses, Creating the Bases Conversion and Development Authority For This Purpose,
Providing Funds Therefor and For Other Purposes." to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 12.  <b style=""><i style="">Subic

Morong and Hermosa, there is hereby created a Special Economic and Free-port
Zone consisting of the City of Olongapo and the Municipality of Subic, Province
of Zambales, the lands occupied by the Subic Naval Base and its contiguous
extensions as embraced, covered, and defined by the 1947 Military Bases
Agreement between the Philippines and the United States of America as amended,
and within the territorial jurisdiction of the Municipalities of Morong and
Hermosa, Province of Bataan, hereinafter referred to as the Subic Special
Economic Zone whose metes and bounds shall be delineated in a proclamation to
be issued by the President of the Philippines.  Within thirty (30) days after the approval of this Act, each local
government unit shall submit its resolution of concurrence to join the Subic
Special Economic Zone to the Office of the President.  Thereafter, the President of the Philippines shall issue a
proclamation defining the metes and bounds of the zone as provided herein.</blockquote>

and subject to the mandate and limitations of the Constitution and the pertinent
provisions of the Local Government Code, the Subic Special Economic Zone shall

and to attract and promote productive foreign investments;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Subic Special

tax and duty-free importations of raw material, capital and equipment.  However, exportations or removal of goods
from the territory of the Subic Special Economic Zone to the other parts of the
Philippine territory shall be subject to customs duties and taxes under the
Customs and Tariff Code and other relevant tax laws of the Philippines;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provision of

percent (3%) of the gross income earned by all businesses and enterprises
within the Subic Special Economic Zone shall be remitted to the National
Government, one percent (1%) each to the local government units affected by the
declaration of the zone in proportion to their population area, and other
factors.  In addition, there is hereby
established a development fund of one percent (1%) of the gross income earned
by all businesses and enterprises within the Subic Special Economic Zone to be
utilized for the development of <span style="">municipalities
outside the City of Olongapo and the Municipality of Subic, and other
municipalities contiguous to the base areas.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In case of conflict between national and local laws with respect to
tax exemption privileges in the Subic Special Economic Zone, the same shall be
resolved in favor of the latter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No exchange control
policy shall be applied and free markets for foreign exchange, gold, securities
and futures shall be allowed and maintained in the Subic Special Economic Zone;</blockquote>

through the Monetary Board, shall supervise and regulate the operations of
banks and other financial institutions within the Subic Special Economic Zone;</blockquote>

thousand dollars ($250,000), his/her spouse and dependent children under
twenty-one (21) years of age, shall be granted permanent resident status within
the Subic Special Economic Zone.  They
shall have freedom of ingress and egress to and from the Subic Special Economic
Zone without any need of special authorization from the Bureau of Immigration
and Deportation.  The Subic Bay
Metropolitan Authority referred to in Section 13 of this Act may also issue
working visas renewable every two (2) years to foreign executives and other
aliens possessing highly-technical skills which no Filipino within the Subic
Special Economic Zone possesses, as certified by the Department of Labor and Employment.  The names of aliens granted permanent
residence status and working visas by the Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority
shall be reported to the Bureau of Immigration and Deportation within thirty
(30) days after issuance thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(h)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defense of the

7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In relation thereto, section 14 of the same law provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Sec. 14.  </span><b><i>Relationship with the

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In case of conflict
between the Subic Authority and the local government units concerned on matters

decision of the Subic Authority shall prevail."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Considering the lasting changes that will
be wrought in the social, political, and economic existence of the people of
Morong by the inclusion of their municipality in the Subic Special Economic
Zone, it is but logical to hear their voice on the matter via an
initiative.  It is not material that the
decision of the municipality of Morong for the inclusion came in the form of a
resolution for what matters is its enduring effect on the welfare of the people
of Morong.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it cannot be gainsaid that petitioners were denied due
process.  They were not furnished a copy
of the letter-petition of Vice Mayor Edilberto M. de Leon to the respondent
COMELEC praying for denial of their petition for a local initiative on
Pambayang Kapasyahan Blg. 10, Serye 1993.  Worse, respondent COMELEC granted the petition without affording
petitioners any fair opportunity to oppose it.  This procedural lapse <span style="">is </span>fatal for at stake is not an ordinary right but the sanctity
of the sovereignty of the people, their original power to legislate through the
process of initiative.  Ours is the duty
to listen and the obligation to obey the voice of the people.  It could well be the only force that could
foil the mushrooming abuses in government.</p>
