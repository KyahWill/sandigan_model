				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a Petition to Review by <i>Certiorari</i> the decision of
the Employees' Compensation Commission af­firming the findings of the
Government Service Insurance System that petitioner's ailments are not
work-connected and hence not compensable as required by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of the case are briefly summarized by
respondent Government Service Insurance Sys­tem in its Comment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner was born on <st1:date year="1920" day="22" month="2">February 22, 1920</st1:date> in <span class="SpellE">Baleno</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Effective January 1, 1981, after 24.36347 years of creditable government
service and at the age of 60 years, 10 months and 8 days, he retired as
Postmaster I, Bureau of Posts, Region V, with station at <span class="SpellE">Baleno</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
service in the govern­ment, which started on <st1:date year="1949" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1949</st1:date> as a public school teacher and later on as a
municipal councilor, was interrupted twice as reflected in his service record,
first from <st1:date year="1952" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1952</st1:date> up
to <st1:date year="1955" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1955</st1:date> and
second, from <st1:date year="1956" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1956</st1:date>
up to <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1960</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioner Chavez applied for retirement benefits under the provisions of PD
No. 1146.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has already received a
gross 5-year lump sum annuity of P24<span class="GramE">,598.80</span> and will
receive a monthly pension of P409.98 starting in 1986.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Petitioner Chavez alleges that he first complained of frequent
urination <span class="GramE">and</span> irregular bowel movement sometime in
October 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1974, he underwent
surgery for removal of renal stones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
1976, he experienced <span class="SpellE">hypochandriac</span> pains because of
kidney stones.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, in July 1982, or one
year and a half (1 1/2) after his retirement, he submitted himself to surgery
for removal of a right urethral stone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Thereafter, on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="1">January 4,
 1982</st1:date>, he filed the present claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1982</st1:date>,
the GSIS denied it on the ground that petitio­ner's ailments are not
work-connected, as required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
GSIS also evaluated petitioner's claim under the provisions of PD No. 1146 for
possible <u><span style="">non-work connected</span></u><span style=""> </span>benefits, particularly the sickness
income benefit, but the same could not be granted because he was enjoying sick
leave with pay at the time (Sec. 20, <span class="SpellE">P.d</span>. No. 1146).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">GSIS
reiterated its decision on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="5"><span style="">May 3, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="9"><span style="">September 2, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent ECC affirmed the action by the
GSIS (ECC Case No. 1985)." (pp. 74-75, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, this Petition for
Review, claimant assigning several errors which can be narrowed down into the
determinative issue of whether petitioner's compensation claim for ailments
contracted by him prior to the <span class="SpellE">effect­ivity</span> of the
New Labor Code on November 1, 1974 but filed </span>after <span style="">said date should be adjudicated under the old
</span><span style="">Workmen's Compensation </span>Law
(Act <span style="">No. 3428 </span>as amended) <span style="">or under the </span><span style="">New </span><span style="">Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule that the Labor <span style="">Code as </span>amended applies, for what is
important is when compensation is sought.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The petition is patently
meritorious and must be granted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner is found to
have chronic <span class="SpellE">pyelonephritis</span>, <span class="SpellE">ureterolithiasis</span>
and <span class="SpellE">ascariasis</span>, which were defined by respondents as
follows:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Chronic <span class="SpellE">pyelonephritis</span>
is a slowly progressive infection</u> of a renal pelvis and <span class="SpellE">prenchyma</span>,

(Letter-denial-decision, dated February 10, <span style="">1982, paragraphs 3, 4, 5, underscoring supplied for emphasis, p. 33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is petitioner's
contention that his ailments are compensable under the provisions of the New
Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Under Art.</span>
1167 paragraph 1 of P.D. 626 as amended a compensable sickness is defined as
(1) any illness definitely accepted as an occupational disease listed by the
Commission or (2) any illness caused by employment, subject to proof that the
risk of contracting the same is increased by the working conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner's ailments are not listed as
occupational diseases, petitioner must perforce present proofs and evidence
that these ailments were work-related and that the risk of contracting the same
was aggravated by the working conditions of his employment as postmaster and/or
mail carrier.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There is no question that
petitioner was presumably in good health when he started working as
postmaster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To substantiate his claim,
herein petitioner recalls the stress and rigors he allegedly encountered as a
mail carrier wherein </span>he had<span style=""> to
walk the whole day to deliver all kinds of mail matters under inclement weather
or intense heat; that in order to carry out said duties effectively, he had to
sail on an open motor boat which passes through shallow coastal barrios and
flooded rivers or rivulets and then had to walk to several adjacent in-land
barrios which resulted often in his acquiring bodily ailments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In September of 1961, upon his assignment as
a postmaster in <span class="SpellE">Baleno</span>, </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Masbate</span></span></st1:place><span style="">, he had to perform the additional task of
cleaning the said post office, because that was a one-man post office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So for some nineteen (19) years, he held the
unenviable job of a postmaster, letter-carrier and janitor all at the same
time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to negotiate a distance of
40 miles while sailing on an open boat, which fact often hampered relief of his
personal necessities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further
narrates the following facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in 1972,
while petitioner was already undergoing treatment for a kidney ailment,
diagnosed medically as '<span class="SpellE">pyelonephritis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uretorolithiasis</span>' he was unmindful of the ill-effects of
his work to his ailment, such that he went on performing the very same
functions he had done for the last twelve (12) or so years then, with the same
zeal and enthu­siasm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was in fact,
admitted at the <st1:place><st1:placename>UST</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in October 1972 on complaint of fre­quent urination and irregular bowel
movement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Decision of respondent ECC,
on page 1, parag<span style="">raph 2, Annex
"C" hereof) Despite that however, upon his discharge from the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">UST</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, he continued on with his usual duties,
sailing on in an open motor boat and walking great distances thus encountering
the very same elements of nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had
remitted postal funds during his tenure of office as he did in the years 1973
and 1974 and until 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, in 1974, he underwent surgery for the removal of renal stones at the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Masbate</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Provincial</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, during his confinement and recuperation, he was unable to perform
his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But immediately after his
discharge from the said hospital, he re­sumed performing his regular duties
until in 1976 he developed intermittent right <span class="SpellE">hypochrondriac</span>
pain and during the ensuing examina­tion at the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Nicanor</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Reyes</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placename><span style="">Memorial</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> the presence of stones in his right kidney
was discovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Pls. see Decision,
supra on page 1) But, he went on with his regular duties and in order not to
prejudice his duties and responsibilities he merely took '<span class="SpellE">Uretricin</span>
0-P' and other drugs which temporarily relieved him of pains enabling him to go
on with his work.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“15<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because</span>
of his said ailments, herein petitioner frequently went on leave of absence to
be able to submit himself to medication.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In one of his several visits to the <st1:place><st1:placename>UST</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospi­tal</st1:placetype></st1:place>, his attending physician
had advised him to retire from his employment for the reason that his health
would no longer warrant a prolonged performance of the said work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He, therefore, wishing to stay alive a little
more eventually was forced to retire effective January 1, 1981 at the early age
of only 61 years after having rendered a continuous and dedicated public
service for twenty (20) years.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“16<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But</span>,
even after his forced retire­ment in January 1981, he submitted himself for
sustained treatment of the aforesaid ailments which he had contracted in the
course of his employment as such postmaster with varied duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He finally was operated on for the removal of
a right <span class="SpellE">uretheral</span> stone by <span class="SpellE">cystoscopy</span>
and was discharged <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> last July 7, 1982.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“17<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Retired</span>
due to a disabling disease and knowing that his ailments had been due to his
employment he contracted during his tenure with the Bureau of Posts as such
post­master at <span class="SpellE">Baleno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>,
he filed the instant complaint for disability compensation benefits under
Presidential Decree 626, as amended, which had been rejected by the respondent
System and which decision had been affirmed by the respondent Commission.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"18.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the present
petition, to reite­rate, for review on certiorari, of the said adverse
decisions of the respondents including his claim for reimbursement of medical
expenses in the amount of P11,850.80 duly supported by official receipts OR
Nos. 38382, 39815 and 50091, herein marked and attached as Annex "D"
and also made part hereof.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was attended
by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Pasion</span> last June 24, 1981 and by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span> on June 27, 1981 of the St. Luke's Hospital and copy
of the examination - results is hereto marked and attached as Annexes
"E" and "F", respect­ively and likewise further made
integral part <span style="">hereof." </span><span style="">(pp. 15</span><span style="">-</span><span style="">17, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This Court takes judicial
notice of the strenuous nature of the work of a letter-carrier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot disregard the fact that
petitioner's employment brought him to places not common to the ordinary public
<span class="GramE">nor</span> to a clerical employee in an air-conditioned office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner in the execution of his duties had
</span><span style="">to go
to far-</span><span style="">flung</span><span style=""> barrios </span><span style="">braving or indifferent to all kinds of weather.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had to walk or cross flooded places, and
in the course of his travel, he had to partake of food bought or taken from
unsanitary places where he found himself situated, be it in the barrio, the
town or the market sites.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His nature of
work made him thirsty most of the time forcing him or leaving him no choice
except to drink water from sources unknown and uncertain as to its cleanliness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In remote barrios and villages, the common
source of potable water would be the ordinary artesian well or if there is
none, from the rivers and places which city folks and employees would not even
dare to consider.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a situation,
it would not be difficult </span><span style="">to
conclude that </span><span style="">petitioner
contracted his ailments more particularly <span class="SpellE">ascariasis</span>
since this disease is transmitted from contaminated food and/or water.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner also invites <span class="GramE">Our</span> attention to the fact that his ailments could also be
due to slowly progressing infections which take time to attack the human
body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed that petitioner
in the course of his </span>employment had constant exposure to the elements
such as the heat of the sun, sudden rain, wind, floods, and similar conditions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The discomfort attendant to the inconvenient
relief of personal necessities, the long hours of travel on land and sea - all
these contributed to his ailments, resulting in his incapacity to continue <span style="">working.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Undoubtedly, therefore petitioner's ailments are work-connected,
work-aggravated and hence compensable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondents argue that
petitioner's action </span>has <span style="">already
prescribed as it was filed beyond the 3-year prescriptive period provided for
under Art. <span class="GramE">292 of the New Labor Code.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the record shows that petitioner
filed this case on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="1"><span style="">January 4, 1982</span></st1:date><span style=""> for disability benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was afflicted with the disease in
1972 or 1974, yet he continued to go on with his regular work as
postmaster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1976, when he was opera­ted
on for removal of kidney stones, </span>he <span style="">was just on </span>sick leave with pay.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately after his discharge from the hospital, he continued to work
as postmaster.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was thus not disabled
yet to discharge his work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
incapacity to work began when his doctors advised him to quit working to be
able to live longer, and this was in January 1981 when he filed his forced
retirement papers at the age of 61 years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The determining point of the accrual of the cause of action is the time
the complainant-employee becomes disabled or incapacitated to do his regular
work because that is the time when the benevolent mantle of the Law commences
to cover <span style="">and protect </span>him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Thus
when petitioner filed his com­plaint on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="1"><span style="">January 4, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">, the 3-year prescriptive period had not yet
lapsed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, We find merit in respondent GSIS' conten­tion that under
the "exclusivity of benefit" doctrine provided for under the
provisions of P.D. 626 as amended by P.D. 1641 (New Labor Code) and CA 186 as
amended by P.D. 1146 (GSIS Act), petitioner, since he already availed himself
of his sick leave with pay benefits and retirement benefits, is entitled only
to benefits, the formula for the computation of which shall be that provided
for under CA 186 (as amended by P.D. 1146) plus 20% thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that petitioner has already
received his gross 5-year lump sum annuity retirement of P24<span class="GramE">,598.80</span>
and a monthly pension of P409.<span style="">98
starting 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is therefore entitled
only to </span>20% of P24<span class="GramE">,598.80</span> as disability
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is likewise
entitled to the reimbursement of his medical and hospital expenses duly
supported by proper receipts, it appearing that his operation in 1982, one year
after his retirement, was for the removal of a right urethral stone.</p>

<p class="BODY">Noteworthy at this juncture is the contention of respondent GSIS
that if petitioner is found to be entitled to benefits, the employer Bureau of
Posts of peti­tioner should ultimately pay, not the State Insurance Fund which
is administered by the GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State
Insu­rance Fund is composed of funds coming from employers' contributions under
the New Labor Code which took effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="11">November
 1, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner retired
in January <span style="">1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After payment by the GSIS, it can seek
reimburse</span>ment from the Bureau of Posts which shall be heard there­on
pursuant to the requirement of due process.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Additio­nally, it appearing that herein petitioner had availed himself
of the services of a lawyer, petitioner is enti<span style="">tled to recover attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">, </span>the <span style="">assailed </span>decision of respondent Employees' Compensation Commission
is hereby SET ASIDE and a new one is hereby rendered, ordering the Govern­ment
