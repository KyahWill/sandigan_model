<p class="BODY">We shall deal with the first and third assignment of errors
jointly because they are interrelated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner states in its petition that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) It has already actually reinstated six of
the dismissed faculty members, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Professors <span class="SpellE">Alamis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Hilario</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barranco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Brondial</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cura</span>; b) As to
Professors <span class="SpellE">Agalabia</span> and Guerrero, whose teaching
assignments were partially taken over by new faculty members, they were given
back their remaining teaching loads (not taken over by new faculty members) but
were likewise given substantially equivalent academic assignments corresponding
to their teaching loads already taken over by new faculty members; c) The
remaining seven faculty members, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Professors Asuncion, Marino, Jr., <span class="SpellE">Matias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Redoblado</span>, Burgos, Nino and <span class="SpellE">Guico</span>,
were given substantially equivalent academic assignments in lieu of actual
teaching loads because all of their teaching loads originally assigned to them
at the start of the first semester of school year 1989-1990 were already taken
over by new faculty members; d) One dismissed faculty member, Rene <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, had been "absent without official leave"
or AWOL as early as the start of the first semester.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 11-12)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner advances the argument that its grant of
substantially equivalent academic assignments to some of the dismissed faculty
members, instead of actual reinstatement, is well supported by just and valid
reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It alleges that actual
reinstatement of the dismissed faculty members whose teaching assignments were
previously taken over by new faculty members is <span class="GramE">not feasible
nor</span> practicable since this would compel the petitioner university to
violate and terminate its contracts with the faculty members who were assigned
to and had actually taken over the courses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner submits that it was never the intention of the Secretary
of Labor to force it to break employment contracts considering that those
ordered temporarily reinstated could very well be accommodated with
substantially equivalent academic assignments without loss in rank, pay or
privilege.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, it claims that to
change the faculty member when the semester is about to end would seriously
impair and prejudice the welfare and interest of the students because
dislocation, confusion and loss in momentum, if not demoralization, will surely
ensue once the change in faculty is effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 13-14)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also avers that the faculty members who were given
substantially equivalent academic assignments were told by their respective
deans to report to the Office of Academic Affairs and Research for their
academic assignments but the said faculty members failed to comply with these
instructions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 118)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the petitioner postulates,
mere payroll reinstatement which would give rise to the obligation of the
University to pay these faculty members, even if the latter are not working,
would squarely run counter to the principle of "No Work, No Pay".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>. p. 15)</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent UST Faculty Union, on the other hand, decries that
the petitioner is using the supposed substantially equivalent academic
assignments as a vehicle to embarrass and degrade the union leaders and that
the refusal of the petitioner to comply with the return-to-work order is
calculated to deter, impede and discourage the union leaders from pursuing
their union activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 246, 254)</p>

<p class="BODY">It also claims that the dismissed faculty members were hired to
perform teaching functions and, indeed, they have rendered dedicated teaching
service to the University students for periods ranging from <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12</st1:time> to 39 years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, they maintain, their qualifications are fitted for classroom
activities and the assignment to them of non-teaching duties, such as (a) book
analysis; (b) syllabi-making or revising; (c) test questions construction; (d)
writing of monographs and modules for studentsâ€™ use in learning "hard to
understand" topics on the lectures; (e) designing modules, transparencies,
charts, diagrams for studentsâ€™ use as learning aids; and (f) other related
assignments, is oppressive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 243-244)</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving the contentions of both parties, this Court refers
to Article 263 (g), first paragraph, of the Labor Code, as amended by Section
27 of Republic Act No. 6715, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>(g)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When, <u>in</u> <u>his</u>
<u>opinion,</u> <u>there</u> <u>exists</u> <u>a</u> <u>labor</u> <u>dispute</u>
<u>causing</u> <u>or</u> <u>likely</u> <u>to</u> <u>cause</u> <u>a</u> <u>strike</u>
<u>or</u> <u>lockout</u> <u>in</u> <u>an</u> <u>industry</u> <u>indispensable</u>
<u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>national</u> <u>interest</u>, the Secretary of Labor
and Employment may assume jurisdiction over the dispute and decide it or
certify the same to the Commission for compulsory arbitration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such assumption or certification shall have
the effect of automatically enjoining the intended or impending strike or
lockout as specified in the assumption or certification order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If one has already taken place at the time of
assumption or certification, all striking or locked out employees shall
immediately return to work and the <u>employer</u> <u>shall</u> <u>immediately</u>
<u>resume</u> <u>operations</u> <u>and</u> <u>readmit</u> <u>all</u> <u>workers</u>
<u>under</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>terms</u> <u>and</u> <u>conditions</u> <u>prevailing</u>
<u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>strike</u> or lockout.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Secretary of Labor and Employment or the
Commission may seek the assistance of law enforcement agencies to ensure
compliance with this provision as well as with such orders as he may issue to
enforce the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Underlining
ours.)</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was in compliance with the above provision that Secretary <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span> issued his <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="7">July
 18, 1989</st1:date> order to "readmit all its faculty members, including
the sixteen (16) union officials, under the same terms and conditions
prevailing prior to the present dispute." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 81) And rightly so, since the labor controversy which brought about a
temporary stoppage of classes in a university populated by approximately 40,000
students affected national interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the petitioner filed a motion for clarification which,
however, was subsequently withdrawn, Secretary <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>
issued another order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="7">July 27,
 1989</st1:date> affirming his July 18 order and directing the NLRC to
immediately call the parties and "<u>ensure</u> <u>the</u> <u>implementation</u>
<u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>order</u>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 103)</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC was thereby charged with the task of implementing a
valid return-to-work order of the Secretary of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the implementing body, its authority did
not include the power to amend the Secretary's order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the Secretary's July 18 order
specifically provided that the dismissed faculty members shall be readmitted
under the same terms and conditions prevailing prior to the present dispute,
the NLRC should have directed the actual reinstatement of the concerned faculty
members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It therefore erred in granting
the alternative remedy of payroll reinstatement which, as it turned, only
resulted in confusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remedy of
payroll reinstatement is nowhere to be found in the orders of the Secretary of
Labor and hence it should not have been imposed by the public respondent
NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that the facts
called for this type of alternative remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the same reason, we rule that the grant of substantially
equivalent academic assignments can not be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the giving of substantially
equivalent academic assignments, without actual teaching loads, cannot be
considered a reinstatement under the same terms and conditions prevailing
before the strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Within the context of
Article 263(g), the phrase "under the same terms and conditions"
contemplates actual reinstatement or the return of actual teaching loads to the
dismissed faculty members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are
academic assignments such as the research and writing of treatises for
publication or full-time laboratory work leading to exciting discoveries which
professors yearn for as badges of honor and achievement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assignments given to the reinstated faculty
members do not fall under such desirable categories.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 263(g) was devised to maintain the status quo between the
workers and management in a labor dispute causing or likely to cause a strike
or lockout in an industry indispensable to the national interest, <u>pending</u>
<u>adjudication</u> of the controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is precisely why the Secretary of Labor, in his <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1989</st1:date> order, stated that
"Pending resolution, the parties are directed to cease and desist from
committing any and all acts that might exacerbate the situation." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 54) And in his order of July 18, he decreed that
â€œThe directive to the parties to cease and desist from committing any act that
will aggravate the situation is hereby reiterated." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 81)</p>

<p class="BODY">The grant of substantially equivalent academic assignments of the
nature assigned by the petitioner would evidently alter the existing status quo
since the temporarily reinstated teachers will not be given their usual
teaching loads.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the grant
thereof aggravated the present dispute since the teachers who were assigned
substantially equivalent academic assignments refused to accept and handle what
they felt were degrading or unbecoming assignments, in turn prompting the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">petitioner</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to withhold their salaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 109)</p>

<p class="BODY">We therefore hold that the public respondent NLRC did not commit
grave abuse of discretion when it ruled that the petitioner should "cease
and desist from offering the aforementioned faculty members substantially
equivalent academic assignments as this is not compliance in good faith with
the order of the Secretary of Labor and Employment".</p>

<p class="BODY">It was error for the NLRC to order the alternative remedies of
payroll reinstatement or actual reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the order did not amount to grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such error is merely an error of judgment
which is not correctible by a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC was only trying its best to work out
a satisfactory ad hoc solution to a festering and serious problem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the light of our rulings on the
impropriety of the substantially equivalent academic assignments and the need
to defer the changes of teachers until the end of the first semester, the
payroll reinstatements will actually minimize the petitioner's problems in the
payment of full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second assignment of error, the petitioner contends
that the NLRC committed grave abuse of discretion in awarding <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from July 13, 1989, the date the faculty members
presented themselves for work, up to the date of actual reinstatement, arguing
that the motion for reconsideration seasonably filed by the petitioner had
effectively stayed the Secretary's order dated July 11, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitionerâ€™s stand is unmeritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A return-to-work order is immediately
effective and executory despite the filing of a motion for reconsideration by
the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by the
Court in <u>Philippine</u> <u>Air</u> <u>Lines</u> <u>Employees</u> <u>Association</u>
(<u>PALEA</u>) <u>v.</u> <u>Philippine</u> <u>Air</u> <u>Lines</u>, <u>Inc</u>.
(38 SCRA 372 [1971]):</p>

<blockquote>"The very nature of a return-to-work
order issued in a certified case lends itself to no other construction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The certification attests to the urgency of
the matter affecting as it does an industry indispensable to the national
interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order is issued in the
exercise of the court's compulsory power of arbitration, and therefore must be
obeyed until set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To say that its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> must wait <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
in a motion for reconsideration is not only to emasculate it but indeed to
defeat its import, for by then the deadline fixed for the return-to-work would,
in the ordinary course, have already passed and hence can no longer be affirmed
insofar as the time element is concerned."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, although the Secretary's order of July 11 was
modified by the July 18 order, the return-to-work portion of the earlier order
which states that "the faculty members should be admitted under the same
terms and conditions prevailing prior to the dispute" was affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise affirm the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> finding
that the dismissed teachers presented themselves for reinstatement on <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1989</st1:date> since the factual
findings of quasi-judicial agencies like the NLRC are generally accorded not
only respect but even finality if such findings are supported by substantial
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Mamerto</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, 118 SCRA 265
[1982]; Baby Bus, Inc. v. Minister of Labor, 158 SCRA 221 [1988]; Packaging
Products Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, 152 SCRA 210
[1987]; <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span> Employeesâ€™ and Laborers Association
(TELA) v. Court of Industrial Relations, 143 SCRA 213 [1986]).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that such substantial
evidence is not present.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, however, stresses that since the faculty members
who were given substantially equivalent academic assignments did not perform
their assigned tasks, <span class="GramE">then</span> they are not entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 19) The petitioner is wrong.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reinstated faculty membersâ€™ refusal to
assume their substantially equivalent academic assignments does not contravene
the Secretary's return-to-work order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were merely insisting on being given actual teaching loads, on the
return-to-work order being followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
find their persistence justified as they are rightfully and legally entitled to
actual reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">petitioner</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>
failed to comply with the Secretary's order of actual reinstatement, we adjudge
that the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
until actual reinstatement is correct.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the fourth assignment of error, the petitioner
expostulates that as employer, it has the sole and exclusive right and
prerogative to determine the nature and kind of work of its employees and to
control and manage its own operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, it objects to the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> act of
substituting its judgment for that of the petitioner in the conduct of its
affairs and operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 23-24)</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, we cannot sustain the petitioner's contention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The hiring, firing, transfer, demotion and
promotion of employees are traditionally identified as management
prerogatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, these are not
absolute prerogatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are subject
to limitations found in law, a collective bargaining agreement, or general
principles of fair play and justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Abbott Laboratories [Phil.] Inc. v. NLRC, 154 SCRA 713 [1987])</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 263(g) is one such limitation provided by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the extent that Art. 263(g) calls for the
admission of all workers under the same terms and conditions prevailing before
the strike, the petitioner University is restricted from exercising its
generally unbounded right to transfer or reassign its employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The public respondent NLRC is not
substituting its own judgment for that of the petitioner in the conduct of its
own affairs and operations; it is merely complying with the mandate of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner manifests the fear that if the temporarily
reinstated faculty members will be allowed to handle actual teaching
assignments in the classroom, the latter would take advantage of the situation
by making the classroom the forum not for the purpose of imparting knowledge to
the students but for the purpose of assailing and lambasting the
administration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 330) There may be a basis for such a fear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We can even state that such concern is <span class="GramE">not entirely
unfounded nor</span> farfetched.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, such a fear is speculative and does not warrant a deviation
from the principle that the dismissed faculty members must be actually
reinstated pending resolution of the labor dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unpleasant situations are sometimes
aftermaths of bitter labor disputes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is the function of Government to fairly apply the law and thereby minimize the
dispute's harmful effects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in this
light that the return to work order should be viewed and obeyed.</p>

<p class="BODY">One thing has not escaped this Court's attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Professors <span class="SpellE">Alamis</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cura</span>, <span class="SpellE">Collantes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barranco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Brondial</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> were already reinstated by the petitioner in
compliance with the Secretary's return-to-work order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Knowing this to be a fact,
the NLRC, in its assailed resolution, dealt only with the fate of the remaining
faculty members who were given substantially equivalent academic assignments.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The names of the aforementioned faculty
members appear nowhere in the disputed NLRC order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as these faculty members actually
reinstated were not covered by the NLRC resolution, then it follows that they
were likewise not covered by the Court's temporary restraining order enjoining
respondents from enforcing or executing the NLRC resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The effects of the temporary restraining
order did not extend to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, after
the Court issued the temporary restraining order, the petitioner lost no time
in recalling their actual teaching assignments and giving them, together with
the rest of the dismissed faculty members, substantially equivalent academic
assignments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's dogmatic insistence in issuing substantially
equivalent academic assignments stems from the fact that the teaching loads of
the dismissed professors have already been assigned to other faculty
members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It wants us to accept this
remedy as one resorted to in good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And yet, the petitioner's employment of the temporary restraining order
as a pretext to enable it to substitute substantially equivalent academic
assignments <u>even</u> <u>for</u> <u>those</u> <u>who</u> <u>were</u> <u>earlier</u>
<u>already</u> <u>reinstated</u> <u>to</u> <u>their</u> <u>actual</u> <u>teaching</u>
<u>loads</u> runs counter to the dictates of fair play.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the private respondent's allegation of
union-busting by the petitioner, we do not at this time pass upon this
issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its determination falls within
the competence of the NLRC, as compulsory arbitrator, before whom the labor
dispute is under consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are
merely called upon to decide the propriety of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">petitioner</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>'s
grant of substantially equivalent academic assignments pending resolution of
the complaint for unfair labor practice and illegal dismissal filed by the
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although we pronounce that the dismissed faculty members must be
actually reinstated while the labor dispute is being resolved, we have to take
into account the fact that at this time, the first semester for <span class="SpellE">schoolyear</span> 1990-1991 is about to end.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To change the faculty members around the time
of final examinations would adversely affect and prejudice the students whose
welfare and interest we consider to be of primordial importance and for whom
both the University and the faculty union must subordinate their claims and
desires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court therefore resolves
that the actual reinstatement of the non-reinstated faculty members, pending
resolution of the labor controversy before the NLRC, may take effect at the
start of the second semester of the <span class="SpellE">schoolyear</span> 1990-1991
but not later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With this arrangement,
the petitioner's reasoning that it will be violating contracts with the faculty
members who took over the dismissed professorsâ€™ teaching loads becomes moot
considering that, as it alleges in its petition, it operates on a <span class="SpellE">semestral</span> basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the principle that no appointments can be made to fill
items which are not yet lawfully vacant, the contracts of new professors cannot
prevail over the right to reinstatement of the dismissed personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, we apply equitable principles for
the sake of the students and order actual reinstatement at the start of the
second semester.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>the
petition is hereby DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
the NLRC resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="9">September 6,
 1989</st1:date> is MODIFIED and the petitioner <st1:place><st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype>
