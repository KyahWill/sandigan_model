<p class="BODY">In 1912, the <span class="SpellE">Tribuna</span> del <span class="SpellE">Registro</span> de la <span class="SpellE">Propiedad</span> (Court
of Land Registration) of <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>, through Judge

(340,820 </span><span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1936, a portion consisting of ten thousand
<span style="">four hundred square meters (10,400 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>.) of Parcel No. 2 was sold to the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">Province</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zambales</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In 1985, respondent
Republic of the Philippines, through the Solicitor General, filed with </span>the
<span style="">Court of Appeals a complaint for the
annulment of the decree in LRC No. 6431, OCT No. 48 (issued to De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>), TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-1369 (issued to De </span></span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Valencia</span></span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE"><span style="">) and TCT No.</span></span><span style=""> T-7696 (issued to <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent alleged that the decree in LRC No.
6431 was null and void for lack of jurisdiction because the land </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">inside the U.S. naval reservation and that it was still within the
forest zone in 1912, having been released <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
only in 1961, and hence cannot be the subject of disposition or alienation as
private property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Named defendants were
De </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Valencia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> and her husband, <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>
and his wife and the Register of Deeds </span>of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Zambales</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as
CA-G.R. SP No. 06259.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">Baloy</span>
spouses filed their answer to the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With leave of court,
petitioner intervened and filed an answer-in-intervention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, petitioner filed its first motion for
preliminary hearing on the affirmative defense of </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">res</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>, </span><span style="">which the Court of Appeals denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner did not seek reconsideration
thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Trial on the merits
ensued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Republic offered its
evidence, consisting of a land classification map prepared by the Director of
Forestry in 1961 to prove that the land became alienable and disposable </span>only
<span style="">in 1961, and rested its case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then proceeded to present its
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was, however, cut short
when the Republic moved to amend </span>its <span style="">complaint to include as party defendants all the other transferees of
the land and, thereafter, filed its amended complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner again moved for </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">preliminary
hearing on its affirmative defense of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">in
an effort to shorten the proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals,
holding that <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>j</u><u><span style="">udicata</span></u></span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">cannot
be invoked as a bar to an action for annulment of judgment on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction, denied the motion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was also denied, hence this
petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">After the comment </span><span style="">and reply </span><span style="">were filed, the Court gave due course to the petition and, as required,
the parties filed their respective memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date month="4" day="2" year="1990"><span style="">April 2,

the case for hearing on </span><st1:date month="5" day="7" year="1990"><span style="">May 7, 1990</span></st1:date><span style=""> because, as stated in the resolution:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The parties were heard in
oral argument and thereafter they were required to submit their memoranda in
amplification of their arguments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The question presented

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As iterated in a long
line of cases, the following requisites must concur for a prior judgment to
constitute a </span>bar to a subsequent case:<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In contending that the
judgment in LRC No. 6431 should be annulled because the land registration court
had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the case, the respondent
Republic puts in issue the presence of the </span>second requisite.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the ultimate issue before the
Court is whether or not the land registration <span style="">court </span>had <span style="">jurisdiction
over the two (2) parcels of land claimed by De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>,
the predecessor-in-interest of the petitioner herein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Necessarily, the
resolution of this issue requires an inquiry into the nature of the subject
parcels of land </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">light of the laws prevailing at the time the
judgment in the land registration case was rendered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's primary
argument, as summarized in its memorandum, was as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must, therefore, be presumed that in LRC
Case No. 6431, the court found from the evidence adduced by the parties that
(1) the two parcels of land in question were agricultural lands as the phrase
is used in Act No. 926, (2) <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Perio</span> had been in the open, continuous, exclusive and
notorious possession thereof for at least 10 years before July 26, 1912, and
(3) his possession of the said parcels of land was in the concept of owner; and
thus the court confirmed <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> de <span class="SpellE">Perio's</span>
title thereto and ordered their registration <span style="">in </span>his name.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
Attorney General, the Director of Forestry, the Director of Lands and the
Director of Public Works opposed the application, then it must be presumed that
the court declared the said two parcels of land to be agricultural lands over
their opposition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If they did not
oppose, then it must be presumed that they agreed with the court that the said
lands were really agricultural lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be pointed out that the question as to whether the two parcels of land in
question are agricultural lands and not timber lands is a question of fact and
the finding of Judge <span class="SpellE">Ostrand</span> that they are
agricultural can not be reviewed by this Honorable Court at this point in time
[Petitioner's Memorandum, pp. 8-9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
211-212.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Additionally, petitioner
argued that the boundaries of the two parcels of land, as described in Decree
No. 9328, debunk the contention that they are forest lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parcels of land were bounded by privately
owned property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, they were
described in the notice published in the March 1912 issue of the Official
Gazette, pp. 766-767 as "lying within the Civil Reservation, town </span>site
of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, situated in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Zambales</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, P.I." [Annex
"A" of Petitioner's Memorandum; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
222-223.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the public respondent, through the Office of
the Solicitor General, contended:</p>

<blockquote>Records disclose that by virtue of Proclamation dated November 11,
1908, then Governor-General James F. Smith reserved for naval purposes certain lands
of the public domain in <span class="SpellE">Subic</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span>
which included the parcels of land embraced under Original Certificate of Title
(OCT) No. 48 secured by De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span> in 1912.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in 1961 that such Proclamation
was revoked by a subsequent issuance, Proclamation No. 731, issued by then
President Garcia on <st1:date month="2" day="2" year="1961">February 2, 1961</st1:date>
and such portions already classified as alienable and disposable and not needed
for government purposes were declared open for disposition under R.A. No. 274,
in relation to C.A. 141 and Act No. 3038.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This means that the lands, subject matter of the case, were portions of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> naval
reservation and were declared open for disposition only on <st1:date month="2" day="2" year="1961">February 2, 1961</st1:date> [Public Respondent's
Memorandum, p. 3; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 230.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Public respondent then reiterated
that "[a]t the time Original Certificate of Title No. 48 was issued on
December 9, 1912, the parcel of land covered by the title was still within the
forest zone and it was not until January 31, 1961 that said land was released
by the Bureau of Forest Development as alienable and disposable under Land
Classification Map No. 2427" </span>[<u>Ibid.</u>]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It also added that
"Land Classification Map No. 665 dated June 7, 1927 . . . shows that the
parcels of land covered by OCT No. 48 were still part of the unclassified
public forest at the time of the registration" [Public Respondent's
Memorandum, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 231.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Weighing the arguments
raised by the parties, we find that the Republic has failed to make out a
convincing case for the annulment of the decree in Land Registration Case No.
6431.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been established that the
land registration court had jurisdiction over the two (2) parcels of land, and
that OCT No. 48 and the Transfer Certificates of Title (TCT) derived from OCT
No. 48 are valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Act No. 926, known as the
Public Land Act, which was enacted into law on </span><st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1903"><span style="">October 7, 1903</span></st1:date><span style=""> but which took effect on </span><st1:date month="7" day="26" year="1904"><span style="">July 26,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The land registration
court confirmed De <span class="SpellE">Perio's</span> title to the two (2)
parcels of land after due notice and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>From this, the following conclusions may be derived:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span>
the two (2) parcels of land are agricultural as defined by law, i.e., that they

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span> had been in open, continuous, exclusive and notorious
possession and occupation of the two (2) parcels of land for at least ten (10)

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span>
his possession and occupancy was under <span style="">a
</span>bona fide claim of ownership; and</p>

<p class="NUM">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span>
under the law De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span> had title to the land as of
1904, although it was confirmed only later in 1912.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These conclusions serve </span>as
<span style="">premises to arrive at other conclusions
determinative of the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If the land is agricultural as defined by law, and as confirmed
by Judge <span class="SpellE">Ostrand</span>, it could not have been forest land
as claimed by public respondent, the subsequent land classification map
notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This conclusion is
supported by the fact that the two (2) parcels of land were <u>in</u> <u>the</u>

<p class="BODY">If De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span> had title to the land in

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Public respondent has
also failed to explain the Republic's sudden interest in the annulment of the
decree and the certificate of title issued to De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>
and the subsequent titles issued to his successors after some seventy–three
(73) years of inaction and after a portion of the land has been developed by
petitioner into a subdivision and hundreds of residences have been built­ thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this point in time, that portion of land
developed into a subdivision cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be
conceived as forest land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, the
area wherein the two (2) parcels of land are found, were released from the
unclassified </span><span style="">public </span><span style="">forest and the territory comprising the <span class="SpellE">Subic</span> naval reservation way back in 1961.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, it is </span><span style="">now </span><span style="">almost thirty (30) years since the land </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">released in
1961.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a few more months, the
possessors of the land would acquire title to the portions they adversely
possess through acquisitive prescription, without need of title or of good
faith, pursuant to the Civil Code [Art. <span class="GramE">1137.].</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Finally, we find the need
to emphasize that in an action to annul a judgment, the burden of proving the j</span>udgment's
nullity rests upon the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner must establish by clear and convincing evidence that the judgment is
fatally defective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the proceedings
were originally filed by the Republic before the Court of Appeals, the
petitioner contended that when the decree in favor of De <span class="SpellE">Perio</span>
was issued by Judge <span class="SpellE">Ostrand</span> in 1912 the parcels of
land were still part of the inalienable public forests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, petitioner's case rested solely on
land classification maps drawn several years after the issuance of the decree
in 1912.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These maps fail to conclusively
establish the actual classification of the land in 1912 and the years prior to
that.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before this Court, petitioner
reiterates said contention and refers, for the first time, to a 1908
proclamation reserving the land in <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> as a
naval reservation and alleging that the subject parcels of land are parts
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These, for reasons discussed
earlier, are insufficient to overcome the legal presumption in favor of the
decree's regularity, more so when <span style="">we </span>consider
that notice of the application for registration and the date of hearing
thereof, addressed to the Attorney General, the Director of Lands, the Director
of Public Works and the Director of Forestry, among others, was published in
the Official Gazette and that Governor <span style="">General
Smith's Proclamation of 1908 itself recognizes private rights.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is <span style="">granted and </span>the <span style="">Court of
Appeals is ordered to </span>DISMISS CA-G.R. SP No. 06259.</p>
