<p class="BODY">After the death of Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Revilleza</span>,
an Extra?judicial Partition dated March 19, 1915, was executed among <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>, Lorenzo, <span class="SpellE">Sinforosa</span> and

</span>The portion of the land allegedly sold to Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>
Cruz has an area of 1,611 square meters, 435 square meters of which were expropriated
by the National Power Corporation sometime in July, 1941 (pp. 27-28, TSN,
August 3, 1979; see also <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"6-a;"

1948, Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Salva</span> Cruz had declared the remainder
of said land for taxation purposes (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"8," "8-a," "8-b," and
"8-c"-Salva Cruz; pp. 32-35, Vol. III, Records).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He paid realty taxes on the land from 1966 to

</span>When Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Revilleza</span> died on May 15, 1928,
his son, Emilio <span class="SpellE">Revilleza</span>, filed with the then Court
of First Instance of Laguna an application for registration of the second half
of the land in question docketed as Case No. 1469, G.L.R.O. Record No. 32505 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"3"-de Vega).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As </span>a

covered a piece of land located at <span class="SpellE">Batong</span> <span class="SpellE">Malake</span>, Los <span class="SpellE">Baños</span>, Laguna, with
an area of 6,594 square meters (see <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"2" - de Vega).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1950" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1950</st1:date>,
in view of the death of her other co-owners, Maria R. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.
<span class="GramE">de</span> Vega executed an Affidavit of Adjudication (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"S") which, in effect,
adjudicated the land covered by OCT No.</span> RO-1100 (No. 9423) in her favor
(see pp. 5-7, Vol. III, Records), and which resulted in the issuance of
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 3911 in her name (p. 224, Vol. III, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1964</st1:date>,
private respondents were issued a certification from the Bureau of Records
Management that the records in the Archives failed to reveal the existence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>Deed of Sale ("<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>") alleged to have been executed by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

the Provincial Fiscal, Sta. Cruz, Laguna (pp. 38-39, TSN, <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="6">June 8, 1976</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The said criminal complaint, however, was not pursued to its conclusion
because Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> got sick and died on November
2, 1966 (pp. 53-54, TSN, June 8, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On July 20, 1973, private respondents filed a complaint for annulment of
documents, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> and damages against
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On October 14, 1974, an
amended complaint was filed, this time only for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
and damages (see pp. 1, 153, 187, Vol. I, Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The heirs of Maria R. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> Vega filed their
answer on January 28, 1975 whereas the heirs of Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>
Cruz filed their answer on July 1, 1975 (p. 219, Vol. I, Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On February 4, 1976, a complaint-in-­intervention
was filed by the heirs of Maura <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> (p. 226, Vol.
I, Records).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The motion for reconsideration was denied
(pp.164-169, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span><u>)</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the present
petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Mainly, petitioners allege that private respondents were not able
to identify the property they are trying to recover.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of action of private respondents is
for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> which has already prescribed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners have acquired their properties by
extraordinary prescription which does not require good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that good faith is still necessary
for petitioners to acquire ownership by acquisitive prescription, still their
possession was really in good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
deed of sale dated October 8<span class="GramE">,1921</span> is a genuine and
authentic document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no implied
trust between Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Revilleza</span>, assuming that there was, prescription will still
set in favor of petitioners who repudiated the trust.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in dismissing the complaint and
complaint-in-intervention, took into consideration the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the evidence submitted by private
respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> to establish the identity
of the land they were claiming from petitioners was inadequate insofar as Maria
R. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Vega was concerned because Exhibits
"E-1," F-1" and "G-1," which were sketches prepared by
Geodetic Engineer <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span>
purportedly showing the location of the land in question, can hardly be
considered sufficient to prove its identity:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>a) Engineer <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span> prepared the sketches based
on verbal information given to him by <span class="SpellE">Dorotea</span> T.
Gonzales (daughter of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>) who was not
even born yet at the time the property was inherited by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>, b) as admitted by Engineer <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span>,
he did not actually go to the location of the land in question to conduct a
physical survey but relied on the documents furnished him by <span class="SpellE">Dorotea</span> T. Gonzales, c) the documents on which Engineer <span class="SpellE">Coquia</span> based the sketches were never presented and shown to
be properly authenticated; 2) from May 20, 1929, when OCT RO-1100 (9423) was
issued to July 20, 1973, when the original complaint was filed, Maria R. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Vega has been in public, peaceful and continuous
possession of the land in question and has, therefore, become the owner thereof
by acquisitive prescription, citing Article 1137 of the Civil Code;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
3) the complaint and the complaint-in-intervention were barred by prescription,
citing Article 1141 of the Civil Code;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
4) private respondents and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> failed to show
any document to prove the existence of the alleged trust between Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> and Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Revilleza</span>; 5)
there was no sufficient evidence to prove that the signature of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> in the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de
<span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>" was a
forgery; 6) the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>," being a
notarized document, the presumption that the official duty of the notary public
was regularly performed must be maintained since no evidence was presented to
show the contrary; and 7) under both ordinary and extraordinary prescription,
Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Salva</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Cruz
</span>must be considered the owner of the land in question, citing Articles
1134<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and 1137 (<u>supra</u>) of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court viewed the controversy differently by making
the following findings:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) petitioners,
in resisting the action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, claimed
that the land in question has been acquired by them through the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>" thus, the conclusion is unwarranted that
private respondents were not able to identify the land sought to be recovered;
2) the thrust of private respondents' action is to declare the inexistence or
nullity of the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>" which does not prescribe, citing
Article 1410 of the Civil Code,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and their prayer for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> and damages is
merely a necessary consequence thereof; 3) in order for acquisitive
prescription to take place, it is necessary that possession must be in good
faith, and it cannot be said that petitioners’ possession was in good faith
because:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>" was defectively executed since it did not
conform with the mandatory formal requirements prescribed by Section 127 of the
Land Registration Act,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
b) the document cannot be classified as an ancient writing that would exempt it
from proof of authenticity and due execution because it failed to comply with
the provisions of said Section 127 and Maura <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>
was wrongly placed as Marta <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> in the document,
c) a certification was issued by the Division of Archives of the Bureau of
Records Management that the Archives failed to reveal the existence of the
"<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>;" 4) Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>
could not have been able to execute and sign the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>" on
October 8, 1921 as he was then abroad serving the U.S. Navy; and 5) the
Philippine National Police Academy has made a conclusive finding that the
questioned signature of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> appearing on
the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>" and his sample signatures were not
written by one and the same person.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find it unnecessary to belabor the lengthy disquisition of
respondent court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We can confine Our
discussion on only two (2) basic issues:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) whether or not the land in question was identified by private
respondents; and (2) whether or not private respondents' action before the
trial court was mainly for annulment of document (with <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
as a necessary consequence), which is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>,
or for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>, which is subject to
prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the first issue, <span class="GramE">We</span> adopt the
ruling of respondent court that (p. 127, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the land in question has been acquired by them (defendants?appellants)
(sic) through a Deed of Sale ("<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>") allegedly
executed by Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> and Maura <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> (the predecessors-in-interest of herein
plaintiffs-appellants and <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
respectively).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand,
plaintiffs-appellants maintain that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>
and Maura <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> did not actually sign the said
document ("<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>")<span class="GramE">,</span> hence,
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> could not have acquired the properties
described therein through the aforesaid document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is thus crystal clear from the foregoing
facts that what plaintiffs?appellants are seeking to recover are the very
parcels of land which are, more particularly described in the Deed of Sale ("<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>") in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the conclusion is not warranted that
said plaintiffs-appellants were not able to identify the property which they
are now seeking to recover."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It should be clarified, however, that in
the case of petitioners heirs of Maria R. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> Vega, their title to the land in question did not
originate from the "<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>." The parties
therein were only Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> and Maura <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span>, as vendors and Sebastian <span class="SpellE">Salva</span>
Cruz, as vendee (pp. 48-49, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, there is no gainsaying that the
property sought to be recovered by private respondents from them was likewise
identified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In Maria
R. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> de Vega's answer to the complaint of
private respondents, she averred that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, for the truth is that her property at said place is WELL
DEFINED by metes and bounds, for it had been brought under the operation of the
Land Registration Law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"
(p. 18, Vol. I, Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, she
knew that what private respondents were seeking to recover was the parcel of
land possessed by her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the second issue, the "exhaustive" analysis
of the case could have been spared had respondent court not resorted to a
strained application of Article 1410 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The action filed by private respondents
before the trial court was undoubtedly, only for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
with damages based on an implied or constructive trust (pp. 62-70, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
"<span class="SpellE">Escritura</span> de <span class="SpellE">Venta</span> <span class="SpellE">Absoluta</span>" was never mentioned in their complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it was their allegation therein that
petitioners, "in bad faith, fraud and in violation of trust appropriate or
is appropriating for themselves the said parcel of land by exercising unlawful
acts of ownership" (p. 65, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, private respondents prayed that
petitioners be ordered to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> ownership and
possession and to pay damages to them (<u>ibid</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Rone</span>, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Claro</span>, et al., 91 Phil. 250, We held that the purpose of an
action or suit and the law to govern it, including the period of prescription,
is to be determined not by the claim of the party filing the action, made in
his argument or brief, but rather by the complaint itself, its allegations and
the prayer for relief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, after
numerous illuminating decisions by this Court, nobody can successfully claim
ignorance of the rule that an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
based on an implied or constructive trust prescribes in ten (10) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">With respect to petitioners
heirs of Maria R. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span>
Vega, the action against them should have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">been

demand of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Tamisin</span> for the return of the land
in question (p. 73, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>), conformably with
