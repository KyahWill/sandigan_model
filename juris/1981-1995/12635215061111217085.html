This is a petition for review on <em>certiorari </em>to set aside the 
decision of respondent Employees' Compensation Commission dated October 
1, 1981 (Annex "A", pp. 21-26, rec.) in ECC Case No. 1799, affirming the
 decision of the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS) denying the 
claim for death benefits under P.D. 626, as amended, to claimant 
Rosalinda Godizano, wife of the deceased Enrique Godizano.
<p>
The late Enrique B. Godizano, husband of the herein petitioner, was a 
Philippine Navy officer with the rank of Petty Officer I.  His service 
history is as follows: "'SUN' from June to July 15, 1962; 'NS2' from 
July 16, 1962 to February 8, 1966; 'SN1' from February 9, 1966 to 
November 1969; 'P03' from December 1969 to December 14, 1972; 'P02' from
 December 15, 1972 to November 1975 and 'P01' from December 1975 up to 
the time of his death on August 19, 1978" (Annex "A-1", p. 22, rec.).
</p><p>
His record of assignment in the Philippine Navy is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  Naval Training Command -- January 12, 1962 to May 19, 1965;
  </p>
  <p> 2.  Underwater Operation Unit -- ­May 20, 1965 to August 1, 1966; </p>
  <p>
    3.  PHILCAG PA -- Aug. 2, 1966 to Sept. 22, 1968;
  </p>
  <p> 4.  Underwater Operations Unit -­- Sept. 23, 1968 to Dec. 4, 1969; </p>
  <p> 5.  Mission to South Vietnam -- ­Dec. 5, 1969 to Aug. 24, 1970; and </p>
  <p> 6.  Underwater Operations Unit with Special Duty PHILNAVCON (Malacañang) -- Aug. 25, 1970 to Aug. 19, 1978. </p>
  <p> (Annex "B", pp. 27-28, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The duties of the late Enrique B. Godizano included the following:  
diving operations which involved retrieving of drowned persons, 
lifeguard duties, salvage operations, sea chest cleaning and inspection 
of Philippine Navy vessels, pro­peller changing of small craft and 
propeller inspection of Philippine Navy vessels, chief gunner's mate, 
team leader of underwater demo­lition, team leader of explosive ordnance
 dis­posal, hydrographic reconnaissance, search and rescue operation, 
team leader of SEAL (Combat) operations, escort duties, ship to shore 
movement operations and such other duties as may be directed (Annex "B",
 pp. 27-28, rec.).
</p><p>
On March 10, 1978, Enrique B. Godizano sought consultation at the Naval 
Station Hospital in Cavite City for pain associated with vomitting of 
previously taken food.  Three days after, he noted bipedal edema.  On 
March 31, 1978, his condition not having improved, he was brought to the
 Armed Forces of the Philippines Medical Center in Quezon City.  In the 
brief clinical abstract (Annex "D", p. 30, rec.), it was recorded that 
he had a past history as a known hypertensive but the duration was not 
noted.  In the course of his confinement, he was found to be afflicted 
with a kidney malady known as acute renal failure secondary to chronic 
glomerulonephritis.  His condition failed to improve.
</p><p>
On August 19, 1978, at the age of 39, Enrique Godizano succumbed to 
pulmonary edema and uremia secondary to chronic glomerulonephritis while
 confined in a hospital.  The cause of his death was diagnosed as 
confluent bronchopneumonia (Annex "C", p. 29, rec.).
</p><p>
On February 1, 1979, petitioner Rosalinda Godizano, in her behalf and in
 behalf of their two minor children, filed with respondent GSIS a claim 
seeking death benefits under P.D. 442, as amended by P.D. 626, as 
amended.
</p><p>
On January 29, 1980, the respondent System denied the petitioner’s claim stating that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "After a careful study and appraisal of the supporting documents 
submitted by you, the above-named claim cannot be favorably considered 
for the reason that the injury/sickness that caused his death is not due
 to circumstances of the employment or in the performance of the duties 
and responsibilities of the said employment. </p>
  <p> "The Medical Evaluation undertaken shows that -- </p>
  <p> 'UREMIA -- is a toxic clinical condition with renal insufficiency 
and retention in the blood of urinary waste products.  In the case of 
your late husband, it was due to pyelo­nephritis which is almost always 
con­comitantly present.  Stones cause obstruc­tion of urine from and 
predisposed to infection of the kid­ney (pyelonephritis) with subsequent
 renal failure'" (p. 13, ECC rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On May 13, 1980, petitioner requested for a reconsideration of the 
denial of her claim by respondent System alleging that the "decedent's 
ailments could have developed as a result of his duties for there were 
times when he had to make a dip at sea to perform underwater operation, 
aside from being exposed to the elements.  (She) also alleged that the 
deceased was in clean bill of health when he entered the service" (Annex
 "A-2", p. 23, rec.).
</p><p>
On May 14, 1980, LTJG Abundio Baybay, Morale and Discipline Officer, 
NDF-PN, recommended that the request for reconsideration by Rosalinda 
Godi­zano be given due course since:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "There is nothing to indicate that when the deceased entered the 
Service in 1962, he was already suffering from Uremia, otherwise he 
would have been disqualified or found unfit for military service 
considering the rigid and strict physical examination he had undergone 
prior to his enlistment. </p>
  <p> "It goes without saying that it was during his employment where he
 developed his ailment; and that his employment had contributed even in a
 small degree, to the development or acceleration of the sickness" (p. 
12, ECC rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On November 11, 1980, the petitioner requested for a restudy of her 
case.  She was required by the respondent System to submit her husband's
 chest x-ray films prior to his death and an official post-mortem 
histopath report to which the petitioner complied.
</p><p>
On February 4, 1981, the petitioner was granted permanent partial 
disability benefit for four months (from March 31, 1978 to April 30, 
1978 and May 1, 1978 to July 30, 1978) amounting to P1,394.31 (p. 28, 
ECC rec.) because of his hypertension which was recognized as a 
work-connected ailment.  The respondent System concluded that since 
hypertension merely caused the deceased's disability and not his death, 
the amount awarded was merely for his disability from employment.
</p><p>
On March 25, 1981, the petitioner brought her case to the respondent Commission for review.
</p><p>
On October 1, 1981, the respondent Commission affirmed the decision of 
the respondent System rul­ing that "the decedent's main ailment, 
glomerulo­nephritis, not being service-connected, appellants claim for 
death benefits under the provision of P.D. No. 626, as amended, has to 
fail" (Annex "A-5", p. 26, rec.).
</p><p>
On December 2, 1982, the petitioner, with the assistance of her counsel,
 filed the instant petition.  The sole issue to be resolved is whether 
or not the death of Philippine Navy Officer Enrique B. Godizano due to 
pulmonary edema and uremia secon­dary to chronic glomerulonephritis is 
compensable under P.D. 626, as amended.
</p><p align="center"><em>
I
</em>
</p><p align="left">
Article 167(m) of P.D. 626, as amended, defines death as "loss of life resulting from injury or sickness." And <em>sickness</em> is defined as "any illness definitely accepted as an occupational disease listed by the Commission, or <em>any
 illness caused by employment, subject to proof by the employee that the
 risk of contract­ing the same is increased by working conditions</em>" (italics supplied).
</p><p>
The sickness which resulted to the death of Enrique Godizano was 
diagnosed as pulmonary edema and uremia secondary to chronic 
glomerulonephritis.  Glomerulonephritis, as found by the respondent 
Commission, is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "xx xx a disease char­acterized pathologically by diffuse 
inflammatory changes in the glomeruli of the kidney, lesser lesions in 
other small arteries throughout the body and an increase in the 
permeability of the systemic capillary bed; and clinically by edema; 
albuminaria, hematuria and hypertension.  Etiology: <em> Acute glomerulonephritis usually follows some form of infection</em>.  In about 85% of cases, this is an <em>infection of the upper respiratory tract</em>
 with certain nephrotic strains of Group AB hemolytic streptococci x x" 
(ECC decision dated Oct. 1, 1981 citing Lyght, E.C., Merck Manual of 
Diagnosis and Therapy, MSD, 11th ed., p. 245; p. 24, rec.; underscoring 
supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The deceased was a Philippine Navy officer.  His assignments and/or 
duties from the moment he entered the service on January 12, 1962 to the
 moment of his death on August 19, 1978, included underwater operations.
  These operations consisted of retrieving drowned persons, lifeguard 
duties, salvage duties, bottom hull scraping of Philippine Navy vessels,
 propeller inspection of Philippine Navy vessels, propeller changing of 
small craft and underwater demolition.  Every time the deceased herein 
came into contact with the water in the performance of his duties, there
 was present the risk of infection, more so if We consider the place of 
performance of said duties.
</p><p>
Dockyards like the Naval Base in Cavite City where the deceased was 
assigned and those of Poro Point, San Fernando, La Union and that of 
U.S. Naval Base, Olongapo City where the deceased had undergone 
training, are known for their polluted waters.  In these waters, there 
is increased possibility of contracting infection.
</p><p>
WE also appreciate the fact that the deceased was not only exposed to 
the waters of the Naval Base, Cavite City; Poro Point, San Fernando, La 
Union; and U.S. Naval Base, Olongapo City; but he was likewise exposed 
to those of South Vietnam where he was assigned from December 5, 1969 to
 August 24, 1970 and those of the Pasig River from August 25, 1975 to 
March 31, 1978.
</p><p>
Moreover, the transition from staying in the water to staying out of it 
and vice-versa including the change from being under the sun to being 
submerged in cold water and vice-versa, predisposed the deceased to 
colds, not to mention other respiratory tract infections which have been
 found to cause glomerulonephritis (Lyght, C.E., Merck Manual of 
Diagnosis and Therapy, supra, and Harrison's Internal Medicine, G.W. 
Thorn, et al., 8th ed., p. 1442).
</p><p>
The exposure then of the deceased to all of these, increased the risk of
 contracting the infection-associated glomerulonephritis.
</p><p>
With the glomerulonephritis, the deceased developed hypertension.  This 
is most likely related to fluid overload (Harrison's Principles of 
Internal Medicine, G.W. Thorn, supra, p. 1443).  It can also be related 
to the unusual stress and strain, excessive fatigue or physical stress 
to which the deceased was subjected, not only here in the Philippines 
while in the performance of his duties, but also when he was in South 
Vietnam where his duties included those of a chief gunner's mate, 
explosive ordnance disposal, underwater demo­lition, SEAL combat 
operations, as well as search and rescue operation.
</p><p>
With the increasing difficulty on the part of the deceased's heart to 
supply the necessary oxygen needed due to the failure of the deceased's 
kidneys' filter system, he developed cardiomegaly (Annex "E", p. 32, 
rec.).  And with the retention of fluids, bipedal edema resulted.
</p><p>
A malfunctioning renal system, when it further deteriorates, results in 
the weakening and failure of all other vital systems of the body.  This 
is due to the accumulation of toxic substances which the kidney's filter
 system cannot get rid of.  From here, the condition of Enrique Godizano
 deteriorated into pulmonary edema and uremia which ultimately led to 
his death.
</p><p>
Considering the foregoing, there is no merit in the argument of 
respondents that pulmonary edema is distinct and separate from chronic 
glomerulonephritis and that the former is not "a complication of 
glomerulonephritis." It is.
</p><p>
As already pointed out, with the deterioration of the kidneys, there 
ensues complications involving all the vital systems of the body.  One 
of such complications is pulmonary edema and the ultimate consequence 
before death is uremia.
</p><p>
Having already established that the risk of contracting the ailment of 
glomerulonephritis was increased by the working conditions of the herein
 petitioner's deceased husband, and in the light of the theory of 
increased risk as enunciated in the cases of Neri vs. ECC and GSIS 
(L-60642, Feb. 20, 1984); Jarillo vs. ECC (L-52058, Feb. 25, 1982, 112 
SCRA 264); and Cristobal vs. ECC (L-49280, Feb. 26, 1981, 103 SCRA 336),
 the petitioner is entitled to death benefits pursuant to P.D. 626, as 
amended by P.D. 1368, as amended by P.D. 1692.
</p><p align="center"><em>
II
</em>
</p><p align="left">
The respondent GSIS was clearly in error when it granted permanent partial disability benefits instead of death benefits.
</p><p align="left">
It must be remembered that the petitioner herein was not claiming for 
permanent partial disability benefits, but for death benefits.  Her 
husband, the deceased Enrique Godizano, was already dead when she filed 
her claim for death benefits.
</p><p>
Furthermore, in the computation for monthly income benefits, 
notwithstanding that the ailment of Enrique Godizano had its inception 
before March 31, 1978, which is prior to the effectivity of P.D. 1368 on
 May 1, 1978, it should be the death of the petitioner's husband on 
August 19, 1978, which should be considered for such contingency 
occurred after the effectivity of P.D. 1368 (Sec. 4, Rule XIII, Amended 
Rules on Employees' Compensation, effective May 1, 1978).  Hence, 
pursuant to Section 8(b) of the Amended Rules on Employees' 
Compensation, P.D. No. 1146 is herein applied.
</p><p>
Applying the New Income Benefit in P.D. No. 1146, the computation should be as follows:
