				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Pursuant to the policy of streamlining and trimming the
bureaucracy, Republic Act No. 6683 was approved on 2 December 1988 providing
for benefits for early retirement and voluntary separation from the government
service as well as for involuntary separation due to reorganization.  Deemed qualified to avail of its benefits
are those enumerated in Sec. 2 of the Act, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2. Coverage. - This Act shall cover all appointive
officials and employees of the National Government, including government-owned
or controlled corporations with original charters, as well as the personnel of
all local government units.  The
benefits authorized under this Act shall apply to all regular, temporary,
casual and emergency employees, regardless of age, who have rendered at least a
total of two (2) consecutive years of government service as of the date of
separation.  Uniformed personnel of the
Armed Forces of the Philippines including those of the PC-INP are excluded from
the coverage of this Act."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Lydia Chua believing that she is qualified to avail of
the benefits of the program, filed an applica­tion on 30 January 1989 with
respondent National Irrigation Administration (NIA) which, however, denied the
same; instead, she was offered separation benefits equivalent to one half (1/2)
month basic pay for every year of service commencing from 1980.  A recourse by petitioner to the Civil
Service Commission yielded negative results.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Her
letter for reconsideration dated 25 April 1989 pleaded thus:</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With due respect, I think the interpretation of the Honorable
Commissioner of RA 6683 does not conform with the beneficent purpose of the
law.  The law merely requires that a
government employee whether regular, temporary, emergency, or casual, should
have two consecutive years of government service in order to be entitled to its
benefits.  I more than meet the
requirement.  Persons who are not
entitled are consultants, experts and contrac­tual(s).  As to the budget needed, the law provides
that the Department of Budget and Management will shoulder a certain portion of
the benefits to be allotted to government corporations.  Moreover, personnel of these NIA special
projects are entitled to the regular benefits, such (sic) leaves, compulsory
retirement and the like.  There is no
reason why we should not be entitled to RA 6683.</blockquote>

separation/retirement but further requires said applicant to be on a casual,
emergency, temporary or regular employment status as of December 2, 1988, the
date of enactment of R.A. 6683.  The law
does not contemplate contractual employees in the coverage.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of such denial, petitioner is before this Court by way of
a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>, insisting that she is entitled to
the benefits granted under Republic Act No. 6683.  Her arguments:</p>

<blockquote>"It is submitted that R.A. 6683, as well as Section 3.1 of the
Joint DBM-CSC Circular Letter No. 89-1 requires an applicant to be on a casual,

<p class="2Q">'2.3 Excluded from the benefits under R.A. No. 6683 are the
following:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">a)  Experts and Consultants hired by agencies
for a limited period to perform specific activities or services with a definite
expected output:  i.e. membership in
Task Force, Part-Time, Consultant/Employees.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">b)  Uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines including those of the Philippine Constabulary and Integrated
National Police (PC--INP).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">c)  Appointive officials and employees who
retire or elect to be separated from the service for optional retirement with
gratuity under R.A. No. 1616, 4968 or with pension under R.A. No. 186, as
amended by R.A. No. 6680 or P.D. No. 1146, as amended, or vice-versa.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">d)  Officials and employees who retired
voluntarily prior to the enactment of this law and have received the
corresponding benefits of that retirement/separation.</p>

employees apply in writing within the prescriptive period for the availment of
the benefits herein authorized, shall be allowed only if acquitted or cleared
of all charges and their application accepted and approved by the head of
office concerned.'</p>

<blockquote>Based on the above exclusions, herein petitioner does not belong to
any one of them.  Ms. Chua is as full
time employee of NIA entitled to all the regular benefits provided for by the
Civil Service Commission.  She held a
permanent status as Personnel Assistant A, a position which belongs to the
Administrative Service.  x x x If casuals
and emergency employees were given the benefit of R.A. 6683 with more reason
that this petitioner who was holding a permanent status as Personnel Assistant
A and has rendered almost 15 years of faithful, continuous service in the
government should be similarly rewarded by the beneficent (sic) purpose of the
law."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NIA and the Civil Service Commission reiterate in their
comment petitioner's exclusion from the benefits of Republic Act No. 6683,
because:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. Petitioner's employment is co-terminous with the project per
appointment papers kept by the Administrative Service in the head office of NIA
(the service record was issued by the Watershed Management and Erosion Control
Project (WMECP), Pantabangan, Nueva Ecija).  The project, funded by the World Bank, was completed as of 31 December
1988, after which petitioner's position became <u>functus</u> <u>officio</u>.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Petitioner is not a regular and career employee of NIA – her
position is not included in its regular plantilla.  She belongs to the non-career service (Sec. 6, P.D. No. 807)
which is inherently short-lived, temporary and transient; on the other hand,
retirement presupposes employment for a long period.  The most that a non-career personnel can expect upon the expiration
of his employment is financial assistance.  Petitioner is not even qualified to retire under the GSIS law.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. Assuming <u>arguendo</u> that petitioner's appointment is
permanent, security of tenure is available only for the term of office (i.e.
duration of project).</p>

<p class="NUM">4. The objective of Republic Act No. 6683 <span style="">is </span>not really to grant separation or retirement benefits but
reorganization<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
to streamline government functions.  The
application of the law must be made consistent with the purpose for which it
was enacted.  Thus, as the expressed
purpose of the law is to reorganize the government, it will not have any
application to special projects such as the WMECP which exists only for a short
and definite period.  This being the
nature of special projects, there <span style="">is </span>no
necessity for offering <span style="">its </span>personnel
early retirement benefits just to induce voluntary separation as a step to
reorganiza­tion.  In fact, there is even
no need of reorganizing the WMECP considering its short and limited life-span.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">5. The law applies only to employees of the national government,
government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters and local
government units.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the impossibility of reconciling the conflicting
interpretations of the parties, the Court is called upon to define the
different classes of employees in the public sector (i.e. government civil
servants).</p>

<p class="BODY">Who are <u>regular</u> <u>employees</u>?  The Labor Code in Art. 280 (P.D. No. 492, as
amended) deems an employment regular where the employee has been engaged to
perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual
business or trade of the employer.  No
equivalent definition can be found in P.D. No. 807 (promulgated on 6 October
1975, which superseded the Civil Service Act of 1965 - R.A. No. 2260) or in the
Administrative Code of 1987 (Executive Order No. 292 Promulgated on 25 July
1987).  The Early Retirement Law itself
(Rep. Act No. 6683) merely includes such class of employees (regular employees)
in its coverage, unmindful that no such specie is employed in the public
sector.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appointment status of government employees in the <u>career</u>
<u>service</u> is classified as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. permanent - one issued to a person who has met the requirements
of the position to which appointment is made, <span style="">in </span>accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Act and

<p class="NUM">2. temporary - In the absence of appropriate eligibles and it
becomes necessary in the public interest to fill a vacancy, a temporary
appointment shall be issued to a person who meets all the requirements for the
position to which he is being appointed except the appropriate civil service
eligibility:  Provided, That such
temporary appoint­ment shall not exceed twelve months, but the appointee may be
replaced sooner if a qualified civil service eligible becomes available.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

submission that the benefits of said law are to be denied a class of government
employees who are similarly situated as those covered by said law.  The maxim of <u>Expressio</u> <u>unius</u> <u>est</u>
<u>exclusio</u> <u>alterius</u> should not be the applicable maxim in this case
but the doctrine of <u>necessary</u> <u>implication</u> which holds that:</p>

<blockquote>"No statute can be enacted that can provide all the details
involved in its application.  There is
always an omission that may not meet a particular situation.  What is thought, at the time of enactment,
to be an all-embracing legislation may be inadequate to provide for the
unfolding events of the future.  So-called
gaps in the law develop as the law is enforced.  One of the rules of statutory construction used to fill in the
gap is the doctrine of necessary implication.  The doctrine states that what is implied in a statute is <span style="">as </span>much a part thereof as that which
is expressed.  Every statute is
understood, by implication, to contain all such provisions as may be necessary
to effectuate its object and purpose, or to make effective rights, powers,
privileges or jurisdiction which it grants, including all such collateral and
subsidiary consequences as may be fairly and logically inferred from its
terms.  Ex necessitate legis.  And every statutory grant of power, right or
privilege is deemed to include all incidental power, right or privilege.  This is so because the greater includes the
lesser, expressed in the maxim, in eo plus sit, simper inest et minus."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">During the sponsorship speech of Congressman Dragon (re:  Early Retirement Law), in response to
Congressman Dimaporo's interpellation on coverage of <u>state</u> <u>university</u>
<u>employees</u> who are extended appointments for one (1) year, renewable for
two (2) or three (3) years,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> he
explained:</p>

<blockquote>"This Bill covers only those who would like to go on early
retirement and voluntary separation.  It
is irrespective of the actual status or nature of the appointment one received,
but if he opts to retire under this, then he is covered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that, presently pending in Congress, is House
Bill No. 33399 (a proposal to extend the scope of the Early Retirement
Law).  Its wording supports the
submission that Rep. Act No. 6683 indeed overlooked a qualified group of civil
servants, Sec. 3 of said House bill, on coverage of early retirement, would
provide:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 3. Coverage. - It will cover all employees of the
national government, including government-owned or controlled corporations, as
well as the personnel of all local government units.  The benefits authorized under this Act shall apply to all <u>regular</u>,
<u>temporary</u>, <u>casual</u>, <u>emergency</u> and <u>contractual employees</u>,
regardless of age, who have rendered at least a total of two (2) consecutive
years government service as of the date of separation.  The term 'contractual employees' as used in
this Act does not include experts and consultants hired by agencies for a
limited period to perform specific activities or services with definite
expected output.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces of the Philippines,
including those of the PC-INP are excluded from the coverage of this Act."
(emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The objective of the Early Retirement or Voluntary Separation Law
is to trim the bureaucracy, hence, vacated positions are deemed abolished upon
early/voluntary retirement of their occupants.  Will the inclusion of <u>co-terminous</u> <u>personnel</u> (like the
petitioner) defeat such objective?  In
their case, upon termination of the project and separation of the project
personnel from the service, the term of employment is considered expired, the
office <u>functus</u> <u>officio</u>.  Casual, temporary and contractual personnel serve for shorter periods,
and yet, they only have to establish two (2) years of continuous service to
qualify.  This, incidentally, negates
the OSG's argument that co-terminous or project employment is inherently short?lived,
temporary and transient, whereas, retirement presupposes employment for a long
period.  Here, violation of the equal
protection clause of the Constitution becomes glaring because casuals are not
even in the plantilla, and yet, they are entitled to the benefits of early
retirement.  How can the objective of
the Early Retirement Law of trimming the bureaucracy be achieved by granting
early retirement benefits to a group of employees (casuals) without plantilla
positions?  There would, in such a case,
be no abolition of permanent positions or streamlining of functions; it would
merely be a removal of excess personnel; but the positions remain, and future
appointments can be made thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">Co-terminous or project personnel, on the other hand, who have
rendered years of continuous service should be included <span style="">in </span>the coverage of the Early Retirement Law, as long as they
file their application prior to the expiration of their term, and as long as
they comply with CSC regula­tions promulgated for such purpose.  In this connection, Memorandum Circular No.
14, Series of 1990 (5 March 1990) implementing Rep. Act No. 6850,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
requires, as a condition to qualify for the grant of eligibility, an aggregate
or total of seven (7) years of government service which need not be continuous,
in the career or non-career service, whether <u>appointive</u>, <u>elective</u>,
<u>casual</u>, <u>emergency</u>, <u>seasonal</u>, <u>contractual</u> or <u>co</u>-<u>terminous</u>,
including military and police service, as evaluated and confirmed by the Civil
Service Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> A
similar regulation should be promulgated for the inclusion in Rep. Act No. 6683
of <u>co-terminous</u> <u>personnel</u> who survive the test of time.  This would be in keeping with the coverage
of "all social legislations enacted to promote the physical and mental
well-being of public servants."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
After all, <u>co-terminous</u> <u>personnel</u> are also obligated to the
government for GSIS contributions, medicare and income tax payments, with the
general disadvantage of transience.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, the Court believes, and so holds, that the denial by the
respondents NIA and CSC of petitioner’s application for early retirement
benefits under Rep. Act No. 6683 is unreasonable, unjustified, and oppressive,
as petitioner had filed an application for voluntary retirement within a
reasonable period and she is entitled to the benefits of said law.  While the application was filed after
expiration of her term, we can give allowance for the fact that she originally
filed the application on her own without the assistance of counsel.  In the interest of substantial justice, her
application must be granted; after all she served the government not only for
two (2) years - the minimum requirement under the law but for almost fifteen
(15) years in four (4) successive governmental projects.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let this case be remanded to the CSC-NIA for a favor­able
disposition of petitioners application for early retirement benefits under Rep.
Act No. 6683, in accordance with the pronouncements in this decision.</p>
