				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review under Rule 44 of the Revised Rules
of Court filed by the Commissioner of Customs to set aside the consolidated
Decision dated September 30, 1969 of the Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">Tax </span>Appeals in C.T.A. Cases Nos. 1836, 1837 and 1839, modifying
his decision by ordering only the payment of a fine, in lieu of the forfeiture
of private respondents' vessels used in the smuggling of foreign-made
cigarettes and other goods.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents Manila Star Ferry, Inc. and the United
Navigation &amp; Transport Corporation are domestic corporations engaged in the
lighterage business and are the owners and operators, respectively, of the
tugboat Orestes and the barge-lighter UN-L-106.  Private respondent Ceaba Shipping Agency, Inc. (Ceaba) is the
local shipping agent of the Chiat Lee Navigation Trading Co. of Hongkong, the
registered owner and operator of the S/S Argo, an ocean ­going vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 12, 1966, the S/S Argo, the Orestes and the UN-L-106, as
well as two wooden bancas of unknown ownership, were apprehended for smuggling
by a patrol boat of the Philippine Navy along the Explosives Anchorage Area of
Manila Bay.  The patrol boat caught the
crew of the S/S Argo in the act of unloading foreign-made goods onto the UN-L­106,
which was towed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">by </span>the Orestes
and escorted by the two wooden bancas.  The goods consisted of 330 cases of foreign-made cigarettes, assorted
ladies’ wear, clothing material and plastic bags, all of which were not
manifested and declared by the vessel for discharge in Manila.  No proper notice of arrival of the S/S Argo
was given to the local customs authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, seizure and forfeiture proceedings were separately
instituted before the Collector of Customs for the Port of Manila against the
S/S Argo (Seizure Identification Case No. 10009, Manila) and its cargo (S.I.
No.10009-C, Manila), the Orestes (S.I. No. 10009-A, Manila), the UN-L-106 (S.I.
No.10009-B, Manila) and the two bancas (S.I. No.10009-D, Manila), charging them
with violations of Section 2530 (a), (b) and (c) of the Tariff and Customs
Code.  Criminal charges were likewise
filed against the officers and crew of said vessels and watercraft.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the seizure and forfeiture proceedings, the Collector of
Customs rendered a consolidated decision dated December 27, 1966, declaring the
forfeiture of said vessels and watercraft in favor of the Philippine government
by virtue of Section 2530 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(a) </span>and
(b) of the Tariff and Customs Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">All respondents therein, except the owner of the two wooden
bancas, separately appealed the consolidated decision of the Collector of
Customs for the Port of Manila to the Commissioner of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Customs.  </span>In his Decision
dated February 1, 1967, the Acting Commissioner of Customs found the
Collector's decision to be in order and affirmed the same accordingly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same respondents separately elevated the matter to the Court
of Tax Appeals (C.T.A. Cases Nos. 1836, 1837 and 1839), which in a consolidated
decision dated September 30, 1989, substantially modified the decision of the
Commissioner of Customs, stating thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the Manila Star Ferry, Inc.,
petitioner in C.T.A. Case No. 1836, and the United Navigation &amp; Transport
Corporation, petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>C.T.A.
Case No. 1837, are each hereby ordered to pay a fine of five thousand pesos
(P5,000.00) and Ceaba Shipping Agency, Inc., petitioner in C.T.A. Case No.
1839, a fine of ten thousand pesos (P10,000.00), within thirty days from the
date this decision becomes final" (Rollo, p. 100).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is this decision of the Court of Tax Appeals that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>being questioned by the Commissioner
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Customs </span>before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 7, 1978, petitioner filed a Motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>Allow Sale of the Vessel (S/S <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Argo), </span>informing this Court that the
said vessel was deteriorating and depreciating in value, and was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">congesting </span>the Cavite Naval Base where
it was berthed.  Petitioner prayed that
it be allowed to sell the S/S Argo at the best possible price.  The Court granted petitioner's motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">An Urgent Motion for Modification was filed by respondent Ceaba,
praying that it, instead of petitioner, be allowed to sell the S/S Argo through
a negotiated sale and not a public sale.  In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a resolution </span>dated May
12, 1978, this Court granted respondent Ceaba's motion, ordering <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">it, however, </span>to first pay the fine of P10,000.00
stated in the decision of the Commissioner of Customs and then "deposit
the proceeds of the sale with a reputable commercial bank in an
interest-bearing account in trust for whosoever will prevail in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cases </span>at bar" (Rollo, p.
317).  A manager's check in the amount
of P10,000.00 was made payable to the Commissioner of Customs and was delivered
by respondent Ceaba to the Cashier of the Supreme Court.  In the Resolution of July 9, 1978, this
payment was accepted, subject to the Court's decision in the Case (Rollo, p.
327).  The S/S Argo was sold, with this
Court's approval, for P125,000.00 to one Severino Caperlac.  The proceeds were subjected to a charging
lien of respondent Ceaba's attorneys in the amount of P315,000.00 (Rollo, p.
402).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for review posits the theory that the subject
vessels and watercraft were engaged in smuggling, and that the S/S Argo should
be forfeited under Section 2530 (a), while the barge UN-L-106 and tugboat
Orestes should be forfeited under Section 2530(c) of the Tariff and Customs
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2530(a) and (c) of said law reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2530.  Property
Subject to Forfeiture under Tariff and Customs Laws.  - Any vessel or aircraft, cargo, articles and other objects
shall, under the following conditions, be subject to forfeiture:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(a)  </span>Any vessel or aircraft, including
cargo, which shall be used unlawfully in the importation or exportation of
articles into or from any Philippine port or place except a port of entry; and
any vessel which, being of less than thirty tons capacity shall be used in the
importation of articles into any Philippine port or place except into a port of
the Sulu sea where importation in such vessel may be authorized by the
Commissioner, with the approval of the department head.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(c)  Any vessel or aircraft into which shall be
transferred cargo unladen contrary to </span>law prior to the arrival of the
importing vessel or aircraft at her port of destination."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The penalty of forfeiture is imposed on any vessel, engaged in
smuggling if the conditions enumerated in Section 2530 (a) are compresent.</p>

<p class="BODY">These conditions are:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)  The vessel is
"used unlawfully in the importation or exportation of articles into or
from" the Philippines;</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)  The articles are
imported or exported into or from "any Philippine port or place, except a
port <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>entry;" or</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)  If the vessel has a
capacity of less than 30 tons and is "used in the importation of articles
into any Philippine port or place other than a port of the Sulu Sea, where importation
in such vessel may be authorized by the Commissioner, with the approval of the
department head."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the vessel S/S Argo was apprehended
while unloading goods of foreign origin onto the barge <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">UN-L-106 </span>and the tugboat Orestes, without the necessary papers
showing that the goods were entered lawfully through a port of entry and that
taxes and duties on said goods had been paid.  The claim that the S/S Argo made an emergency call at the Port of Manila
for replacement of crew members and had to stop at the Explosives Anchorage
Area because it was carrying nitric acid, a dangerous cargo, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cannot </span>be upheld much less given
credence by this Court.  The facts found
by the Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Tax </span>Appeals are
in consonance with the findings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the
Collector of Customs, and the Commissioner of Customs.  Absent a showing of any irregularity or
arbitrariness, the findings of fact of quasi-judicial and administrative bodies
are entitled to great weight and are conclusive and binding on this Court.  (Feeder International Line, Pte., Ltd v.
Court of Appeals, 197 SCRA 842 [1991]; Jaculina v. National Police Commission,
200 SCRA 489 [1991]).  Moreover, the Collector
of Customs in S.I. No. 10009-C, Manila, ordered on July 28, 1966 the forfeiture
of the subject cargo after finding that they were, in truth and in fact,
smuggled articles (Rollo, p. 7).  Respondent Ceaba did not appeal from said order and the same has become
final.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the Court of Tax Appeals held that while the S/S
Argo was caught unloading smuggled goods in Manila Bay, the said vessel and the
goods cannot be forfeited in favor of the government because the Port of Manila
is a port of entry (R.A. 1937, Sec. 701).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Customs argues that the phrase "except a
port of entry" should mean "except a port of destination," and
inasmuch as there is no showing that the Port of Manila was the port of
destination of the S/S Argo, its forfeiture was in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2530(a) in unmistakable terms provides that a vessel
engaged in smuggling "in a port of entry" cannot be forfeited.  This is the clear and plain meaning of the
law.  It is not within the province of
the Court to inquire into the wisdom of the law, for indeed, we are bound by
the words of the statute.  Neither can
we put words in the mouths of the lawmakers.  <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A verba legis non est
recedendum</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that the Revised Administrative Code of 1917
from which the Tariff and Customs Code is based, contained in Section 1363(a)
thereof almost exactly the same provision in Section 2530(a) of the Tariff and
Customs Code, including the phrase "except a port of entry." If the
lawmakers intended the term "port of entry" to mean "port of
destination," they could have expressed facilely such intention when they
adopted the Tariff and Customs Code in 1957.  Instead of amending the law, Congress reenacted <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">verbatim</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>the provision of Section 1363 (a) of the Revised Administrative
Code of 1917.  Congress, in the very
same Article 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code, used the term "port of
destination" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span>subsections
(c) and (d) thereof.  This is a clear
indication that Congress is aware of the distinction between the two wordings.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was only in 1972, after this case was instituted, when the
questioned exception ("except a port of entry") <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in </span>Section 2530(a) of the Tariff and
Customs Code was deleted by P.D. No. 74.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, although the vessel cannot be forfeited, it is
subject to a fine of not more than P10,000.00 for failure to supply the requisite
manifest for the unloaded cargo under Section 2521 of Code, which reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2521.  Failure to
Supply Requisite Manifests.  - If any
vessel or aircraft enters or departs from a port of entry without submitting
the proper manifest to the customs authorities, or shall enter or depart
conveying unmanifested cargo other than as stated in the next preceding section
hereof, such vessel or aircraft shall be fined in a sum not exceeding ten
thousand pesos."</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:
3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x
x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The barge-lighter UN-L-106 and the tugboat Orestes, on the other
hand, are subject to forfeiture under paragraph (c) of Section 2530 of the
Tariff and Customs Code.  The
barge-lighter and tugboat fall under the term "vessel" which includes
every sort of boat, craft or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of
being used, as a means of transportation on water (R.A. No. 1937, Sec.
3514).  Said section 2530(c) prescribes
the forfeiture of any vessel or aircraft into which shall be transferred cargo
unladen contrary to law before the arrival of the vessel or aircraft at her
port of destination.  Manila was not the
port of destination, much less a port of call of the S/S Argo, the importing
vessel.  The S/S Argo left Hongkong and
was bound for Jesselton, North Borneo, Djakarta and Surabaja, Indonesia; and
yet it stopped at the Port of Manila to unload the smuggled goods onto the
UN-L-106 and the Orestes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forfeiture proceedings are proceedings <u>in rem</u> (Commissioner
of Customs v. Court of Tax Appeals, 138 SCRA 581 [1985] citing Vierneza v.
Commissioner of Customs, 24 SCRA 394 [1968]) and are directed against the <u>res</u>.  It is no defense that the owner, of the
vessel sought to be forfeited had no actual knowledge that his property was
used illegally.  The absence or lack of
actual knowledge of such use is a defense personal to the owner himself which
cannot in any way absolve the vessel from the liability of forfeiture
(Commissioner of Customs v. Court of Appeals, <u>supra</u>; U.S. v. Steamship
"Rubi", 32 Phil. 228, 239 [1915]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the consolidated Decision dated September 30,
1969 of respondent Court of Tax Appeals in C.T.A. Cases Nos. 1836, 1837 and
1839 is MODIFIED as follows:  (1) that
the S/S Argo through respondent Ceaba Shipping Agency, Inc. is ordered to pay a
fine of P10,000.00, to be satisfied from the deposit of the same amount by
respondent Ceaba to the Cashier of this Court per Resolution of July 9, 1978;
(2) that the Cashier of this Court is ordered to release the said amount for
payment to the Commissioner of Customs, within thirty (30) days from the date
this decision becomes final; and (3) the tugboat Orestes and the barge-lighter
UN-L-106 of respondents Manila Star Ferry, Inc. and the United Navigation &amp;
Transport Corporation respectively, are ordered forfeited in favor of the
Philippine Government.</p>
