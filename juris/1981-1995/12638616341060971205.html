				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Two brothers and two sisters are involved in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">this </span>interesting drama, and the least important
of them in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>story is,
curiously enough, the accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yet he is the one who is in prison and has been confined without bail
since his arrest in 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge,
for which he has already been convicted, is that he and his brother, conspiring
with each other, kidnaped and detained one of the sisters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His life sentence is now on appeal before us.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The problem arose with his brother Roberto Caccam, who is still
at large.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gil Caccam has been left
holding the bag, so to speak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant
has no relationship whatsoever with either of the sisters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is his brother who has - or had - with
both of them in fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Roberto was
engaged to be married to Olivia Quibin, who was already with child by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the day of their wedding, he left her for
her younger sister, Honilyn, with whom he stayed for 44 days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now neither of the sisters can locate him;
even the law is looking for him.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the day of reckoning came, it was Gil Caccam who was made to
face the music.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well might he have said,
echoing the Biblical disclaimer, "Am I my brother's keeper?" But he
was not being asked to answer for his brother's misdeeds or omissions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gil was being made to account for his own
acts, as co-principal with Roberto in the kidnaping and illegal detention of
Honilyn.</p>

<p class="BODY">As alleged by the prosecution, Gil and his brother Roberto
together forced Honilyn to go with them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">on
</span>that afternoon of June 28, 1983, in Naguilian, La Union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incident was narrated by an 8-year old
boy, Diosdado Quibin, who was a cousin of the girls and a neighbor of the
brothers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This witness testified that
from a distance of about 25 to 35 meters, he saw Gil pulling and Roberto
pushing Honilyn, who was resisting and crying "I don't like." He
immediately reported the matter to her mother, who forthwith, accompanied by
two other persons, went out to help Honilyn.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
But the girl was gone.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her own testimony, Honilyn corroborated Diosdado and added
that it took the brothers about an hour before they could force her to go with
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Roberto was pointing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>knife at her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said that she was struggling and shouting
"Help me!" but nobody did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, she was taken to the nearby forest, then to an open field,
from there to Camp Uno, then to Bacnotan, La Union, where she was deflowered
without her knowledge or consent after being drugged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, she was detained for 19 days in the
house of Atty. Abelardo Dumaguing in Baguio City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said she was made to take three tablets
regularly that increased her libido and made her want to have sexual
intercourse with Roberto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While in that
house, she was under constant watch by Roberto and the lawyer and four other
persons, making it difficult for her to escape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was only on August 12, 1983, that he was returned to the custody of
her parents by Atty. Dumaguing, who, incredibly, especially for a lawyer,
demanded a receipt for her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Honilyn admitted that she and Roberto had
been sweethearts for two years even before his affair with her sister
Olivia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also acknowledged the
Valentine card and four letters she had sent him in which she had affirmed her
love for him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In one of these letters, she had also asked him to stay away from her sister
and even warned him that something bad might happen if he did not do so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Remarkably, the focus of her testimony both on direct and
cross-examination was on the events that happened after she had allegedly been
forced by Roberto and Gil Caccam to go with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant seems to have vanished
into thin air following his supposed participation with Roberto in her
kidnaping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rest of her narration
dealt with the conduct toward her of Roberto and also of the lawyer, who
appears to have had a more active role than Gil in detaining her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Gil himself was not identified as among the
persons who stayed with her in the house of Atty. Dumaguing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thrust of the defense is that Honilyn <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was not </span>kidnaped by Roberto but in fact willingly eloped with
him to prevent him from marrying her sister Olivia.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contention is that there was no
kidnaping, and no illegal detention either, because Roberto and Honilyn were
sweethearts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They had voluntarily left
together to consummate their love for each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The elopement was timed to avoid Roberto's
impending marriage to Olivia that same afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes that the only evidence directly linking Gil
Caccam to the supposed abduction of Honilyn is the testimony of the 8-year old
Diosdado as affirmed by Honilyn herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This evidence looks to us too flimsy, like a makeshift structure on
shifting sands, to sustain the accused-appellant's conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their narrations must fail because of their
inherent defects, especially in the light of the evidence for the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Diosdado testified that the girl was shouting while she was being
forced by the brothers but nobody seems to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">
</span>have heard her even if the incident took place about only 30 to 40
meters from the nearest house and at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">one
 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
He also said that he immediately reported the matter to his aunt, but when she
rushed out to help Honilyn, the girl <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
already gone </span>despite her positive statement that she was struggling with
the two brothers for about <u style="text-underline:words">an</u> <u style="text-underline:words">hour</u> before they finally succeeded in
abducting<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Conceivably, her mother</span> could
have succored the girl on time within that hour; and even if Diosdado saw the
incident <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">onl</span>y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>during the last few minutes of that
hour, they could still have seen the girl and the two brothers walking the
distance to the forest for this was about 130 meters away.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
As<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>for the knife Honilyn said
Roberto <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>threatening her
with, Diosdado never spoke of it at all.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Although he could not have failed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">see
</span>it if there was<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>really
one, he merely said that one brother was pulling the girl while <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>other was pushing her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was not even a suggestion that either
of them was armed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On top of all this, there
are the love letters, which cast serious doubt on Honilyn's claim that she was
abducted by Roberto Caccam with the assistance of his </span>brother Gil.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These clearly reveal the real sentiments of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the girl as she poured out her endearments,
syntax and all, to her "Sweet Roberto":<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the prosecution in this case against the
accused-appellant, particularly as it affects the credibility of Honilyn,
becomes difficult to accept when viewed against her letters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Given her effusive protestations of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">love for </span>Roberto, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">we </span>find ourselves hard put to believe
that she had not traipsed out with him in a romantic spree but, as she now
insists, was taken against her will by the two brothers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Beyond merely<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>conjecturing
that the girl did not have to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">forced
because</span> Roberto was her sweetheart, the defense might have centered its
arguments on the significant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">fact </span>that
Gil's supposed participation occurred, if <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">at
</span>all, only for a brief moment as reported by Diosdado and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>at most only for one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">hour </span>as narrated by Honilyn herself<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It
has already been remarked that both their declarations are suspect because they
do not even jibe with each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
more importantly, even as his alleged role <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">in </span>the actual abduction is doubtful, Gil apparently had also no participation
at all in the supposed detention of the girl in Bacnotan and later in <st1:place><st1:placename>Baguio</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Honilyn herself made no more mention of Gil when she narrated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>events that transpired after her
claimed abduction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> rest - </span>and bulk - of her testimony dealt
with her captivity by Roberto and even the lawyer and the other persons <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not name the accused-appellant as<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>one of her captors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, at one point in her testimony, she
categorically declared that Gil had not come along with them to La Union and <st1:place><st1:placename>Baguio</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The position of the prosecution is that the accused-appellant
should be equally responsi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">bl</span>e
with<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>Roberto for all of the
events occurring subsequent to the time when the brothers forced Honilyn to go
with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its theory is that the
brothers were conspirators and as such are equally responsible for each other's
acts up to the time Honilyn was returned to her parents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this argument is flawed because the
conspiracy itself has not been sufficiently established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence of such combination
consists of the inconsistent testimonies of Diosdado and Honilyn whom we have
both found to be unreliable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence they offer can hardly be the basis for making Gil also responsible for
the offense, if any, of his brother and for condemning him to prison for the
rest of his life.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a proud principle of the republican system that the
prisoner on the dock shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is
proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This enlightened rule of all
democratic societies is intended to afford protection to the accused who is
pitted against the full panoply of the awesome authority of the State itself
with all the resources at its command.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To correct this disparity, the Constitution imposes upon the prosecution
the obligation to prove beyond reasonable doubt - on the strength of its own
evidence and not the weakness of the defense - the guilt of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the prosecution fails, the charge must
be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">So it must be in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We make no finding here on the accountability of Roberto Caccam
who is yet to be judged on the basis of the evidence to be presented at his own
trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even if he might later be
found guilty of abducting and illegally detaining Honilyn, his crime will not
and should not taint his brother. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Gil's
part in the alleged offense not having been established and proof of conspiracy
being wanting, we hold that the accused-appellant should be absolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that in the brief he submitted on <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="4">April 24, 1989</st1:date>, the Solicitor General
has joined the defense in asking for the exoneration of Gil Caccam on the
ground of reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
circumstance all the more bolsters the verdict we must reach today.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">, </span>the appealed judgment is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">REVERSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
