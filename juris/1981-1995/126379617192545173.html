				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> the petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Gelmart</span> Industries (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.),
Inc. (GELMART) seeks a reversal of the order of public respondent Director
Francisco L. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> of the Regional Office No. 4,
Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE), dated June 15, 1979 requiring the
immediate reinstatement of Jenny <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> to her
former position with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> reckoned from
August 8, 1977 to the date of actual reinstatement without loss of seniority
rights as affirmed by Deputy Minister Vicente <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>,
Jr. who dismissed petitioner's appeal and motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following antecedent facts are undisputed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>GELMART is a labor-intensive, export-oriented
entity registered and operating under Philippine law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It had a collective bargaining agreement with
the National Union of Garment, Textile Cordage and Allied Workers of the
Philippines (GATCORD) for the period <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="1">January
 25, 1976</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="1">January 27,
 1979</st1:date> covering petitioner's 8,000 rank-and-file workers among <span class="GramE">whom</span> is the private respondent <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1977" day="1" month="8">August
 1, 1977</st1:date> GATCORD went on strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After two <span class="GramE">return</span> to work orders were issued by
the Ministry of Labor, the second one on <st1:date year="1977" day="2" month="8">August
 2, 1977</st1:date> giving a 48-hour deadline "or face the danger of
losing employment status," all workers complied except 334.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> was not
among those who reported back to work within the period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>GELMART gave these workers notice and applied
for clearance to terminate their employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Public respondent Vicente <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>, Jr.,
Deputy Minister of Labor and Employment by order of October 5, 1977 sustained
the preventive suspension imposed by GELMART but certified the case for
compulsory arbitration on the issue of termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC docketed the case as "National
Union of Garment, Textile, Cordage and Allied Workers of the Philippines
(GATCORD) v. GELMART Industries, Philippines, Inc., NLRC RB-IV-13275-77."
It took eleven months before the labor arbiter issued a decision dated <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1978</st1:date> granting clearance
for dismissal, but with specific provision to exclude those who did not
participate in the strike because they were absent before and during the same
for justifiable causes such as illness or "validated absences." [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 26].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the decision was a list of those ordered to be <span class="GramE">reinstated.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> was not in
the list.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> filed a complaint for illegal
dismissal on <st1:date year="1979" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1979</st1:date>
docketed as Case No. R4-STF-2-1189-79 alleging that she was employed by GELMART
for the last seven (7) years as sewer with a daily wage of P12.40, excluding
allowance and other fringe benefits, that on July 31, 1977 through a letter
sent to the respondent company, she applied for vacation leave effective August
1, 1977 to August 7, 1977; that she went home to Laguna to take care of her
child who was then sick and stayed till August 7, 1977; that when she reported
back for work on August 8, 1977 she was refused admittance and was served a copy
of preventive suspension for alleged participation in the mass walk-out by
workers of the company on August 1, 1977; that while a substantial number of
workers who had participated in the mass walk-out had already been reinstated,
despite repeated representations the company refused to reinstate her; and that
her dismissal in the guise of preventive suspension was without just cause and
prior clearance from the Ministry of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant prayed for reinstatement with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
for damages in the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000</span> and attorneys
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent, traversing <span class="SpellE">Juanillo's</span>
complaint, asserted that the subject of the complaint was barred by prior
judgment citing the decision of <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="9">September
 13, 1978</st1:date>, and the list in said decision of 63 workers who were
excluded from the clearance to terminate, <span class="SpellE">Juanillo's</span>
name not appearing in said list.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 15, 1979, the public respondent Francisco L. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span>, then Regional Director of the Ministry of Labor
and Employment (MOLE) Region No. IV issued an order finding for petitioner <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>We find respondent's contentions untenable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Firstly, at the time when the strike was staged by the workers of
respondent, complainant was already in the province.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, before she went to the province, she
even notified respondent and applied for vacation leave of absence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, respondent could not deny that
she was on vacation and in the province and, therefore, could not possibly join
the strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it appears that
complainant was dismissed without the required clearance in violation of the
mandatory provision of Art. <span class="GramE">278 (b) of the Labor Code, as
amended.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For these reasons
therefore, we find and so hold that the dismissal of complainant is illegal and
without just cause.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondent is hereby ordered to
immediately reinstate complainant to her former position with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>Â­ reckoned from <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1977</st1:date> up to the date of actual reinstatement
without loss of seniority rights [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 40].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This order was affirmed on <st1:date year="1982" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1982</st1:date> by respondent <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span>
as Deputy Minister of MOLE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's
motion for reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="3">March
 11, 1985</st1:date> having been denied, the present petition was filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1985</st1:date>, assigning on the part
of public respondents the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>IN GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION, FAULTED GELMART
FOR THE ABSENCE OF RESPONDENTS' CLEARANCE IN DISMISSING MS. JUANILLO, WHEN

JUSTICE, EQUITY AND MORALITY: THAT THEY UNDULY PROCRASTINATED IN RESOLVING THE
CASE TO GELMART'S PREJUDICE AGGRAVATES THEIR ABUSE OF DISCRETION.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 13-14].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first three assigned errors charging the public respondents
of having disregarded the clearance obtained by GELMART to dismiss workers who
had staged a mass walk-out and disobeyed the return to work order and the decision
in the NLRC Case No. RR-IV-13275-77 upholding the dismissals <span class="GramE">are</span>
well taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The strike was staged by
GATCORD members, the return to work orders were directed to them and the
decision on the illegal strike is binding on them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, the application for
clearance with preventive suspension and compulsory arbitration on the issue of
termination involved GATCORD members who had not returned to work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of these there were 334 and <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> was among them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, she has taken the position <span class="GramE">that since at the
time of the illegal mass walk-out she was already in the province on leave, she
was not covered by NLRC Case No.</span> <span class="GramE">RB-IV-13275-77.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The compulsory arbitration precisely covered
her case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All she needed to do was prove
"validated absences," during the proceeding and she would have been
in the list of those to be reinstated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But she did not choose to present her proof in the arbitration
proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, she waited seven
months after the decision became final before bringing a separate case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If every member of a striking union not
satisfied with a decision in an arbitration case resolving the issues involved
in a labor dispute arising from the strike were to be accorded the right to
bring a separate individual action on an issue covered by that decision, there
can be no end or solution to the controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> was an incident of
the GATCORD strike against GELMART.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her
action is not distinct from the issues dealt with in the compulsory arbitration
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if the Court were to grant that she could bring this
separate action, <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> would have to prove her
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only basis of her action is
the alleged leave of absence she had filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The public respondents decided in her favor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Was there substantial evidence presented to
support the decision under review?</p>

<p class="BODY">The public respondents found as a fact that <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span>
had not participated in the mass walk-out because at the time it took place she
was in the province taking care of a sick child; that before she left she had
by letter filed a leave of absence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner GELMART denied having received any letter from <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span>
requesting leave and assailed the letter offered as self-serving evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Public respondents, however, found that leave
was obtained, that GELMART failed to prove that <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span>
was among the workers who staged the mass walk-out and that therefore her
dismissal without previous clearance was illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court will not ordinarily disturb findings of fact of
administrative agencies like the public respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic that in their exercise of
adjudicative functions they are not bound by strict rules of evidence and of
procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When confronted with conflicting
versions of factual matters, it is for them in the exercise of discretion to
determine which party deserves credence on the basis of evidence received.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">[<span class="SpellE">Halili</span>

<p class="BODY">However, as the landmark case of <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> v. Court of Industrial Relations [69 Phil. 635
(1940)] has pointed out there are "cardinal primary rights which must be
respected" in such proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not
the least among them <span class="GramE">are</span> those which refer to the
evidence required to support a decision:</p>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>"While the duty
to deliberate does not impose the obligation to decide right, it does imply a
necessity which cannot be disregarded, namely, that of having something to
support the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A decision with
absolutely nothing to support it is a nullity, at least, when directly
attacked." . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not only must there be
some evidence to support a finding or conclusion, but evidence must be
"substantial." "Substantial evidence is more than a mere
scintilla.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It means such relevant
evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a
conclusion." . . .<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 642].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds merit in the <span class="GramE">respondents</span>
fourth assignment of error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A careful
review of the basis on which the decision of the labor arbiter as affirmed by
the respondent <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span> as deputy minister of MOLE
reveals that not only is there no substantial evidence to support <span class="SpellE">Juanillo's</span> claim but also that the respondents evidence to
the contrary contravenes it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> asserts that at the time of
the strike she was on leave, to prove which she presented a letter purportedly
requesting leave dated <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="7">Sunday, July
 31, 1977</st1:date>, the day before the illegal strike began.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no proof that it was filed with or
received by the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She asserts
that she was denied admission upon her return on <st1:date year="1977" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1977</st1:date> and was served notice of "Termination
with Preventive Suspension" on <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="8">August
 10, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case
between GELMART and GATCORD of which she is a member, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Leogardo</span> sustained the preventive suspension of those who
failed to return to work but referred this case for compulsory arbitration on
the issue of termination on <st1:date year="1977" day="5" month="10">October 5,
 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arbitral
proceedings lasted eleven months, the decision became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> on <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="9">September
 13, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the decision,
specific provision was made to exclude from termination:</p>

<blockquote>. . . those who did not participate in the strike, who among others
were absent before and during the same for justifiable causes, as for example,
illness or validated absences, are herewith ordered reinstated to their former
positions without back wages. . . .</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> had received notice of
the termination in August 1977 and as she claims she had made repeated
representation and demands for reinstatement, it is passing strange that her
claim was not ventilated in the compulsory arbitration proceeding conducted
precisely on the issue of termination of GATCORD members who had not complied
with the return to work order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All that
was needed was to show that she had indeed not participated in the strike by
presenting her letter asking for leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Instead she filed her case seven months after the decision had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By way of evidence all she presented was a self-serving uncorroborated
letter purportedly asking for leave, receipt of which was not proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This quantum of evidence fails the
substantiality of evidence test to support a decision, a basic requirement in
administrative adjudication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">[<span class="SpellE">Ang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibay</span> v.
