<p>The instant case presents an issue of first impression, the respondent court 
having decided a question of substance not heretofore determined by this Court.&nbsp; 
The matter is now before us in this petition for review praying for the reversal 
of the decision below escheating a parcel of land in favor of the City of 
Zamboanga.<br><br>The property in dispute was among the lands taken over by the 
United States Government under the Philippine Property Act of 1946 enacted by 
the American Congress.&nbsp; It was registered in 1930 under Transfer Certificate of 
Title No. 9509 of the Register of Deeds of Zamboanga in the name of Kantiro 
Koyama, a Japanese national, who has not been heard from since the end of World 
War II.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Under the said Act, the land 
was supposed to be transferred to the Republic of the Philippines, pursuant to 
its Section 3 reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"All property vested in or transferred to the President of the 
United States, the Alien Property Custodian, or any such officer or agency as 
the President of the United States may designate under the Trading with the 
Enemy Act, as amended, which was located in the Philippines at the time of such 
vesting, or the proceeds thereof, and which shall remain after the satisfaction 
of any claim payable under the Trading with the Enemy Act, costs and expenses of 
administration as may by law be charged against such property or proceeds, shall 
be transferred by the President of the United States to the Republic of the 
Philippines."
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>The transfer was never made, however, and the property remained registered in 
the name of Koyama.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the lot has since 1978 been covered by Tax 
Declaration No. 42644 in the name of the Republic of the Philippines with the 
Board of Liquidators as administrator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Earlier, in 1976, the Republic of 
the Philippines had filed escheat proceedings against the said property, 
claiming that the registered owner of the land "had been absent for the past ten 
years or more and he, therefore, may be presumed dead for the purpose of 
appointing his successor." It also alleged that since he left no heirs or 
persons entitled to the aforementioned property, the State should inherit the 
same in accordance with Rule 91 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>After the required publications, 
hearing was held at which the City of Zamboanga did not appear and no claim or 
opposition was filed by any party.&nbsp; The Solicitor General allowed the appearance 
of the Board of Liquidators as administrator of the disputed land and the City 
Fiscal of Zamboanga City did not object.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Finally, the trial court declared the 
property —</p>
<blockquote>"x x x escheated to the State in favor of the City of Zamboanga 
where the property is located for the benefit of public schools and public 
charitable institutions and centers in the City of Zamboanga." 
<p></p></blockquote>
<p>Not satisfied with the decision, the petitioner elevated the same to the 
Intermediate Appellate Court, where it was affirmed.&nbsp; The respondent court held 
that the City of Zamboanga — which had later intervened with leave of court - 
was entitled to the property in question under the provision of Section 3, Rule 
91 of the Rules of Court, providing that —</p>
<blockquote>"Sec. 3 <em>Hearing and judgment</em>.&nbsp; — Upon satisfactory proof in 
open court on the date fixed in the order that such order has been published as 
directed and that the person died intestate, seized of real or personal property 
in the Philippines, leaving no heir or person entitled to the same, and no 
sufficient cause being shown to the contrary, the court shall adjudge that the 
estate of the deceased in the Philippines, after the payment of just debts and 
charges, shall escheat; and shall, pursuant to law, assign the personal estate 
to the municipality or city where he last resided in the Philippines, and the 
real estate to the municipalities or cities, respectively, in which the same is 
situated.&nbsp; If the deceased never resided in the Philippines, the whole estate 
may be assigned to the respective municipalities or cities where the same is 
located.&nbsp; Such estate shall be for the benefit of public schools, and public 
charitable institutions and centers in said municipalities or cities. "The 
court, at the instance of an interested party, or on its own motion, may order 
the establishment of a permanent trust, so that only the income from the 
property shall be used."
<p></p></blockquote>In so ruling, the respondent court rejected the position 
taken by the petitioner which it asks us now to consider as its justification 
for the reversal of the appealed decision.&nbsp; That position, simply stated, is 
that there was a mere oversight on the part of the American government which 
prevented the formality of a transfer of the property to the Philippine 
government.&nbsp; That neglect should not divest the Republic of the property which 
under the spirit and intendment of the Philippine Property Act of 1946 should 
belong to it as successor-in-interest of the United States.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Oversight or not, says the 
respondent court, the fact is that the property was not transferred as required 
by the said law.&nbsp; Hence, it was properly escheated to the City of Zamboanga, on 
the unrebutted presumption that the registered owner was already dead, and there 
being no heirs or other claimants to the land in question.&nbsp; Moreover, the Board 
of Liquidators had no personality to claim the land because it had the authority 
to administer only those properties that had been tranferred by the U.S. Alien 
Property Custodian to the Republic of the Philippines.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>We reverse.&nbsp; We rule for the 
petitioner.<br><br>It is clear, and the respondent City of Zamboanga does not 
deny it, that there was mere inadvertence on the part of the American government 
in omitting to tranfer the disputed land to the Republic of the Philippines.&nbsp; 
The obvious purpose of the Act was to turn over to the Philippine government all 
enemy properties situated in its territory that had been seized and were being 
held for the time being by the United States, which was then exercising 
sovereignty over the Philippines.&nbsp; The transfer of such enemy properties to the 
Philippine Republic was one of the acts by which the United States acknowledged 
the elevation of this country to the status of a sovereign state on July 4, 
1946.<br><br>While it is true that there are no records of such transfer, we may 
presume that such transfer was made.&nbsp; The lack of such records does not mean 
that it was not made as this would run counter to the mandate of the Philippine 
Property Act of 1946, which, to repeat, intended to vest title in the 
Philippines enemy properties found in its territory.&nbsp; It would be more 
reasonable to suppose that the President of the United States, or the person 
acting under his authority, complied with rather than neglected (and so 
violated) this requirement of Section 3 of the said Act, if only on the basis of 
the presumption of the regularity of official functions.&nbsp; In the extreme, we can 
even say that this section legally effected the transfer, to be evidenced later 
by the formality of the corresponding deed, and that the lack of such deed does 
not mean that no transfer was made.&nbsp; Otherwise, we would have to face the 
dubious conclusion that the said property is still owned and so still subject to 
disposition by the United States.<br><br>In support of its position, the City of 
Zamboanga argues, without much spirit, that anyway the land in question has an 
area of only 4,533 square meters and that for all practical purposes it can be 
better administered and used by the city authorities.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Perhaps so; but surely that is not the 
point.&nbsp; We are dealing here not with the pragmatic question of who can benefit 
more from the disputed property but with the legal question of who is its legal 
owner.&nbsp; That is the point.<br><br>We hold that where it comes to ordinary real 
properties the owners of which may be presumed dead and left no heirs, the same 
may be escheated, conformably to Rule 91 of the Rules of Court, in favor of the 
political subdivisions in which they are located.&nbsp; The said Rule, however, does 
not cover properties taken from enemy nationals as a result of World War II and 
required to be transferred to the Republic of the Philippines by the United 
States in accordance with its own enactment commonly known as the Philippine 
Property Act of 1946.&nbsp; Such properties, including the land in dispute, belong to 
the Philippine government not by virtue of the escheat proceedings but on the 
strength of the transfer authorized and required by the said Act.<br><br>It may 
really be that, for practical reasons, the disputed property should be entrusted 
to the City of Zamboanga, for the purposes indicated in the Rules of Court.&nbsp; 
That may still be effected.&nbsp; But this will require a transfer of the land to the 
city by the Republic of the Philippines, to which it belongs and which has the 
power to dispose of it.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the appealed decision 
is reversed and another one is hereby entered declaring the Republic of the 
Philippines to be the legal owner of the land subject of the instant petition.&nbsp; 
No costs.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
