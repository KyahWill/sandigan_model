<p class="BODY">For having allegedly extorted four packs of "Philip Morris" 
cigarettes from <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, a 
police officer in <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, was charged with robbery 
under <span class="GramE">an information</span> reading as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"** That on or about the 13<sup>th</sup> day of October, 1974, in the 
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of the 
Honorable Court, the above-named accused, being a member of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Force then in uniform and taking advantage of 
his position, with intent of gain, and by means of threats and intimidation, did 
then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously demand and extort from one 
<span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> four (4) 
packages of Philip Morris cigarettes valued at P10.00, to the damage and 
prejudice of the said <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> in the aforementioned amount of P10.00.</p>
<p>Contrary to law."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> pleaded not guilty on 
arraignment, the prosecution filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the 
complainant (<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>) had executed an affidavit of 
desistance substantially to the effect that the evidence at his disposal was not 
sufficient to establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The motion was denied.<span>&nbsp; </span>Trial 
ensued, after which the <st1:street><st1:address>Lower 
Court</st1:address></st1:street> rendered judgment finding <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> guilty of the crime of light coercion, sentencing 
him to suffer imprisonment of eleven (11) days of <span class="SpellE"><em>arresto</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>menor</em></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> appealed to the Court of 
Appeals.<span>&nbsp; </span>In that Court, the case had to be referred to a Special 
Division of Five Justices because the members of the Fourth Division, to which 
the appeal was initially assigned, could not agree on <span>a verdict.<span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>The Special Division eventually promulgated judgment, its 
conclusions having been reached by a vote of <st1:time minute="57" hour="13">3 
to 2</st1:time>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Justice Cuevas, with <span class="GramE">whom</span> concurred Justices <span class="SpellE">Griño-Aquino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Zosa</span>, adjudged 
<span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> guilty of robbery, not merely of light 
coercion.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Justices <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> and <span class="SpellE">Villasor</span>, in separate 
dissenting opinions, voted to acquit <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the majority 
decision reads:</p>
<blockquote>"*** IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, accused-appellant's 
conviction is affirmed but for the Crime of ROBBERY (not for Unjust Vexation) as 
charged in the information, defined and penalized under Art. 294, par. <span>5 
</span>of the Revised Penal Code and there being no mitigating nor any 
aggravating circumstance affecting his criminal liability thus subjecting him to 
the imposition of the penalty <span>in </span>its medium period, he is, 
therefore, hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of four (4) years, two 
(2) months and one (1) day as the maximum, to eight (8) years and one (1) day of 
<span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><em> mayor</em> as the maximum; to 
return to the offended party the four (4) packs of Philip Morris Cigarettes he 
extorted from the latter and in case of inability to do so to indemnify 
appellant in the amount of Ten Pesos (P10.00) representing the value thereof; 
and to pay costs.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The case is now before this Court on <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>’ petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, to which 
due course has been given, and in which the following issues are raised, <span class="SpellE"><em>viz</em></span>:</p>
<blockquote>"1. Whether or not the Court of Appeals gravely abused its 
discretion in considering the uncorroborated testimony of the lone prosecution 
witness as basis for the conviction of petitioner when such evidence is 
insufficient to overcome the constitutional presumption of 
innocence;</blockquote>
<blockquote>2. Whether or not the Court of Appeals correctly applied the 
provisions of the Indeterminate Sentence Law and imposed on petitioner the 
correct and proper penalty; and</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">3. Whether or not the instant appeal by 
<i>certiorari</i> was filed on time."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Basically, the petitioner would have this Court review and reverse 
the conclusions of fact of the majority decision of the Special Division of the 
Court of Appeals.<span>&nbsp; </span>This is a function that this Court does not as a 
rule undertake.<span>&nbsp; </span>The established principle is that the factual 
findings of the Court of Appeals are final and may not be reviewed on appeal to 
this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> There are, however, 
certain exceptions to the rule, which the Court has recognized and accepted at 
one time or another,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> these 
being:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) when the conclusion is grounded entirely on 
speculation, surmises and conjectures; (2) when the inference is manifestly 
mistaken, absurd and impossible; (3) where there is grave abuse of discretion; 
(4) when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts; (5) when the 
Court, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the case, and the same 
are contrary to the admissions of both the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>; (6) when the findings of the Appellate Court are 
contrary to those of the trial court; (7) when the findings are without citation 
of specific evidence on which they are based.</p>
<p class="BODY">It is petitioner's submittal that his case falls within one of the 
recognized exceptions to the rule, more particularly, that the respondent 
Court's findings are manifestly mistaken or absurd.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Cuevas (majority) Opinion considered as a "decisive" factor 
against the appellant the fact that the complainant had signed and submitted to 
the Trial Court an affidavit of desistance which the former had himself 
personally or through another drawn up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It is difficult to perceive the logic of 
such a conclusion.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact is that there is no indication 
whatever in the record that the affidavit of desistance was other than a 
voluntary and intelligent act of the complainant.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, its 
submission to the Court by the fiscal himself, indicates that in the latter's 
view the affidavit was not in any way flawed.<span>&nbsp; </span>And whether it was 
prepared by the appellant himself or by another at his instance, as is the 
admitted fact, is in the premises a circumstance of no moment, and cannot 
detract from what appears on the record to be an essentially voluntary act on 
the complainant's part of signing the same and consenting to its presentation to 
the Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">The case turns upon the testimony of a single witness (the 
complainant himself).<span>&nbsp; </span>There is, to be sure, nothing extraordinary 
about a judgment of conviction being made to rest solely on the sworn 
declarations of one witness, so long as those declarations are otherwise 
credible and convincing.<span>&nbsp; </span>Except in treason <span class="GramE">cases, no requirement exists</span> that corroboration of the 
testimony of a single witness is necessary for conviction.<span>&nbsp; </span>But in 
this case the complainant's testimony cannot, upon analysis, in any sense be 
deemed credible and convincing.<span>&nbsp; </span>His testimony is not only 
contra<span>dicted by the evidence of the defense, it is also tainted by 
unlikely and unusual contradictions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Whereas his memory was avowedly quite strong at the time of giving 
his sworn statement on October <span>15, 1974 </span>specifically as regards the 
individual identities of the three other police officers whom he implicated in 
the offense,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> it was surprisingly 
faulty only ten months later, when he testified before the Lower Court on August 
<span>8, 1975, </span>at which time he declared that he could remember only the 
name of <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, but not those of the other 
three.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">In his sworn statement of <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="10">October <span>15, 1974</span></st1:date><span>, </span>he declared 
that it was Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Tadeo</span></span><span class="GramE"> who had approached him to inquire as to who had granted him a 
permit for beer to be drunk in his store.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>However, when he 
took the witness stand, he stated that it was Pat. <span class="SpellE">Umali</span> (not <span class="SpellE">Tadeo</span>), who had 
approached him to make the inquiry.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p>
<p class="BODY">Again, in his sworn statement of <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="10">October <span>15, 1974</span></st1:date><span>, </span>he declared 
that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tadeo</span> had called three (3) policemen to his 
(complainant's) store.<span>&nbsp; </span>But on the witness stand on <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="8">August <span>8, 1975</span></st1:date><span>, 
</span>he said that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tadeo</span> had called only the 
accused <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, and the two (2) other uniformed 
patrolmen had joined them later.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">In the same sworn statement he said that when called by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Tadeo</span>, the three (3) uniformed police officers were in the 
restaurant drinking beer, but his testimony in Court on August <span>8, 1975 
</span>was that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> (the accused) was in the 
market when he was called by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Umali</span> (not <span class="SpellE">Tadeo</span>), and that the two (2) other policemen were not with 
<span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, but were just strolling around the 
vicinity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Why there should be these many inconsistencies with respect to 
what are otherwise non-controversial, prosaic details of the complainant's 
narrative not unreasonably engenders doubt as to the narrative's 
veracity.<span>&nbsp; </span>Taken singly, these inconsistencies may not justify 
rejection of the complainant's testimony as undeserving of credit.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Considered conjointly, however, they cogently conduce towards eschewal of 
credence to his declarations.</p>
<p class="BODY">Apart from these unaccountable contradictions, the record 
discloses the complainant's obvious bias against the accused?appellant.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>His testimony was that he would know <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> 
anywhere, even if "you turn out his skin", because <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> was arrogant and was "making (the cause of) many 
cases."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In fact, his <span style="font-style: italic;">animus</span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 
</span>against <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> did not escape the notice of 
defense counsel who at one point remarked that he was "*** trying to avoid 
mentioning ***" (the other) policemen whom he had implicated in his 
complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, no such infirmities are discernible in the 
testimonial proofs of the defense.<span>&nbsp; </span>Appellant <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>’ assertion on the witness stand, that the four 
<span>(4) </span>packs of cigarettes subject of the case had not been extorted 
from the complainant, but had in truth been freely given to him and his 
companions by a certain <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> is 
adequately corroborated by the testimony of Pat. Sergio Cruz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> It is also in measure confirmed by the 
complainant himself, who deposed that <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, his <span class="SpellE"><em>compadre</em></span><span>, </span>had indeed been drinking 
beer with appellant <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> and his companions on 
that occasion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> The same <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> was mentioned by 
complainant as an alleged witness to the robbery-extortion incident.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, it does not appear that any serious effort was made by 
complainant to procure <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian's</span> appearance to 
corroborate said claim or to rebut <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>’ assertion 
that it was he (<span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>) who gave the 
cigarettes.</p>
<p class="BODY">As it now turns out, the complainant and the fiscal were correct 
in moving for the dismissal of the case shortly after arraignment on the basis 
of their assessment that the evidence at their disposal was not sufficient to 
establish the guilt of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> 
The state of the evidence impels concurrence with that assessment, and a 
pronouncement that the findings of fact in the decision appealed from are 
manifestly mistaken.<span>&nbsp; </span>The conclusion here reached and declared 
makes unnecessary consideration and resolution of the other errors imputed by 
the petitioner to the Appellate Court.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is reversed, and the 
petitioner, Jaime <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, is, on reasonable doubt, 
acquitted of the crime charged.<span>&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
