				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The law looks with disfavor upon quitclaims and releases by
employees who are inveigled or pressured into signing them by unscrupulous
employers seeking to evade their legal responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, there are legitimate
waivers that represent a voluntary settlement of laborer's claims that should
be respected by the courts as the law between the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case <span style="">at bar, </span>the
petitioners claim that they were forced to sign their respective releases in
favor of their employer, the herein private respondent, by reason of their dire
necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter, for its part,
insists that the petitioner entered into the compromise agreement freely and
with open eyes and should not now be permitted to reject their solemn
commitments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy began when the petitioners, along with several
co-employees, filed a complaint against the private respondent for unfair labor
practices, underpayment, and non-payment of overtime, holiday, and other
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was decided <span style="">in </span>favor of the complainants on <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion for reconsideration, which was
treated as an appeal, was dismissed in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1988</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the instant appeal is hereby DISMISSED and the
questioned Order affirmed with the modification that the monetary awards <span style="">to <span class="SpellE">Jeric</span> <span class="SpellE">Dequito</span>, <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ganuhay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Mori and Rogelio
<span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> are hereby deleted for being settled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let execution push through with respect to
the awards to Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> and <span class="SpellE">Edito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Liguaton</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1988</st1:date>,
the private respondent filed a motion for reconsideration and <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> of the amount awarded to the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1988</st1:date>, while the motion was pending,
petitioner Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, through his wife Connie,
signed a Quitclaim and Release for and in consideration of P25,000.00,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and on the same day his counsel, Atty. <span style="">Gaga </span>Mauna, manifested "Satisfaction of
Judgment" by receipt of the said sum by <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
For his part, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Liguaton</span> filed <span style="">a </span>motion to
dismiss dated <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1988</st1:date>,
based on a Release and Quitclaim dated <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="7">July
 19, 1988</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">for </span>and in consideration of the
sum of P20,000.00 he acknowledged to have received from the private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">These releases were later impugned by the petitioners <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1988</st1:date>, on the ground that they were
constrained to sign the documents because of their "extreme
necessity." In an Order dated <st1:date year="1988" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1988</st1:date>, the Undersecretary of Labor rejected their contention and
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>IN VIEW THEREOF, complainants Motion to Declare Quitclaim Null and
Void is hereby denied for lack of merit and the compromise
agreements/settlements dated <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="4">April 15,
 1988</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1988</st1:date>
are hereby approved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Respondents' motion for reconsideration is
hereby denied for being moot and academic.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration of the order having been denied on <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1989</st1:date>, the petitioners have <span style="">come </span>to this Court on <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>They
ask that the quitclaims they have signed be annulled and that writs of
execution be issued for the sum of P21,267.92 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>
and the sum of P26,267.92 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Liguaton</span> in settlement
of their claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their petition is based primarily on <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>
Sugar Development Co., Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>while rights may be waived, the same must
not be contrary to law, public order, public policy, morals or good customs or
prejudicial to a third person with a right recognized by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Art. 6, New Civil Code) <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>The above-quoted provision renders the
quitclaim agreements void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>in their entirety since they
obligated the workers concerned to forego their benefits, while at the same
time, exempted the petitioner from any liability that it may choose to
reject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This runs counter to Art. 22 of
the new Civil Code which provides that no one shall be unjustly enriched at the
expense of another.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court <span style="">has </span>deliberated
on the issues and the arguments of the parties and finds that the petition must
fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception and not the rule
shall be applied in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case cited is <span style="">not </span>apropos
because the quitclaims therein invoked were secured by the employer after it
had already lost <span style="">in </span>the lower
court and were subsequently rejected by this Court when the employer invoked it
in a petition for <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>By
contrast, the quitclaims in the case before us were signed by the petitioners
while the motion for reconsideration was still pending in the DOLE, which
finally denied it on <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the quitclaims in the cited case
were entered into without leave of the lower court whereas <span style="">in </span>the case <span style="">at </span>bar the quitclaims were made with the knowledge and approval
of the DOLE, which declared in its order of December 16, 1988, that "the
compromise agreement/settlements dated April 15, 1988 and July 19, 1988 <span style="">are </span>hereby approved."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also noteworthy that the quitclaims were voluntarily and
knowingly made by both petitioners even if they may now deny this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>,
the quitclaim he had signed carried the notation that the sum stated therein
had been paid to him in the presence of Atty. Gaga Mauna, his counsel, and the
document was attested by Atty. Ferdinand <span class="SpellE">Magabilin</span>,
Chief of the Industrial Relations Division of the National Capitol Region of
the DOLE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Liguaton</span>, his quitclaim was made with the assistance of his
counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span> <span class="SpellE">Balguma</span>,
who also notarized it and later confirmed it with the filing of the motion to
dismiss <span class="SpellE">Liguaton's</span> complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same Atty. <span class="SpellE">Balguma</span> is the
petitioners' counsel in this proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Curiously, he is now challenging the very same quitclaim of <span class="SpellE">Liguaton</span> that he himself notarized and invoked as the basis
of <span class="SpellE">Liguaton's</span> motion to dismiss, but this time for a
different reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereas he had earlier
argued for <span class="SpellE">Liguaton</span> that the latter's signature was a
forgery, he has abandoned that contention and now claims that the quitclaim had
been executed because of the petitioners' "dire necessity."</p>

<p class="BODY">"Dire necessity" is not an acceptable ground for
annulling the releases, especially since it has not been shown that the
employees had been forced to execute them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It has not <span style="">even </span>been
proven that the considerations for the quitclaims were unconscionably low and
that the petitioners had been tricked into accepting them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the writ of execution
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1987</st1:date>,
called for the collection of the amount of P46,267.92 each <span style="">for </span><span style="">the petitioners, </span>that amount was still subject <span style="">to </span><span class="SpellE">recomputation</span>
and modification as the private respondent's motion for reconsideration was
still pending before the DOLE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact
that the petitioners accepted the lower amounts would suggest that the original
award was exorbitant and they were apprehensive that it would be adjusted and
reduced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, no deception has
been established on the part of the private respondent that would justify the
annulment of the petitioners' quitclaims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The applicable law is Article 227 of the Labor Code providing
clearly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 227.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Compromise
agreements</u>. - Any compromise settlement, including those involving labor
standard laws, voluntarily agreed upon by the parties with the assistance of
the Bureau <span style="">or </span>the regional
office of the Department of Labor, shall be final and binding upon the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National Labor Relations
Commission or any court shall not assume jurisdiction over issues involved
therein except in case of non-compliance thereof or if there is <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>
evidence that the <span style="">settlement was
obtained through fraud, misrepresentation or coercion.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners cannot renege on their <span style="">agreement </span>simply because they may now feel they made a mistake
in not awaiting the resolution of the private respondent's motion for
reconsideration and <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The possibility that the original award might
have been affirmed does not justify the invalidation of the perfectly valid
compromise agreements they had <span style="">entered
into in </span>good faith and with full <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In General Rubber and Footwear Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
we "made clear that the Court is not saying that accrued money claims can
never be effectively waived by workers and employees." As we later
declared in <span class="SpellE">Periquet</span> v. NLRC:<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>Not all waivers and quitclaims are invalid <span style="">as </span>against public policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the agreement was voluntarily entered into
and represents <span style="">a
</span>reasonable settlement, it is<span style="">
binding </span>on <span style="">the parties and may
not later be disowned simply because of a change of mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only where there is clear proof that
the waiver was wangled from an unsuspecting or gullible person, or the terms of
settlement </span><span style="">are </span><span style="">unconscionable on
its face, that the law will step in to annul the questionable transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But where it is shown that the person making
the waiver </span><span style="">did </span><span style="">so voluntarily, with full understanding of
what he was doing, and the consideration for the quitclaim is credible and
reasonable, the transaction must be recognized as a valid and binding
undertaking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>find that the questioned quitclaims were voluntarily and knowingly
executed and that the petitioners should not be relieved of their waivers on
the ground that they now<span style=""> </span>feel
they were improvident in agreeing to the compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What they call their "dire <span style="">necessity" </span>then is no warrant to
nullify their solemn undertaking, <span style="">which
</span>cannot be any less binding on them simply because they are laborers and
deserve the protection of the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Constitution protects the just, and it is not the petitioners in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED, with <span style="">costs </span>against the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>
