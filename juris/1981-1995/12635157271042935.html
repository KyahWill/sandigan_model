				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>Liability for published statements demonstrably false or
misleading, and derogatory of the courts and individual judges, is what is
involved in the proceeding at bar -- than which, upon its facts, there is
perhaps no more appropriate setting for an inquiry into the limits of press
freedom as it relates to public comment about the courts and their workings
within a constitutional order.</p>

<p class=BODY><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>1.</i> <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class=BODY>To resolve the issue raised by those facts, application of fairly
elementary and self-evident postulates is all that is needed, these being:</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>1) that the utterance
or publication by a person of falsehoods or half-truths, or of slanted or
distorted versions of facts -- or accusations which he made no <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bona fide</i> effort previously to verify,
and which he does not or disdains to prove -- cannot be justified as a
legitimate exercise of the freedom of speech and of the press guaranteed by the
Constitution, and cannot be deemed an activity shielded from sanction by that
constitutional guaranty;</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>2) that such utterance
or publication is also <span class=SpellE>violative</span> of &quot;The
Philippine Journalist's Code of Ethics&quot; which <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>inter <span class=SpellE>alia</span></i> commands the journalist to <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;scrupulously report and interpret the
news, taking care not to suppress essential facts nor to distort the truth by
improper omission or emphasis,&quot;</i> and makes it his duty <i

substantive errors promptly;&quot;</i><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1'

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>3) that such an
utterance or publication, when it is offensive to the dignity and reputation of
a Court or of the judge presiding over it, or degrades or tends to place the
courts in disrepute and disgrace or otherwise to debase the administration of
justice, constitutes contempt of court and is punishable as such after due
proceedings; and</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>4) that <span
class=SpellE>prescinding</span> from the obvious proposition that any aggrieved
party may file a complaint to declare the <span class=SpellE>utterer</span> or
writer in contempt, the initiation of appropriate contempt proceedings against
the latter by the court is not only its prerogative but indeed its duty,
imposed by the overmastering need to preserve and protect its authority and the
integrity, independence and dignity of the nation's judicial system.</p>

<p class=BODY>This proceeding treats of <span class=SpellE>Emiliano</span> P. <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span>, a journalist who writes in a newspaper of general
circulation, the &quot;Manila Standard.&quot; He describes himself as a
columnist, who &quot;incidentally happens to be a lawyer,&quot; remarking that
while he values his membership in the law profession, &quot;such membership is
neither a critical nor indispensable adjunct in the exercise of his occupation
as a newspaperman.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> had been writing about alleged
improprieties and irregularities in the judiciary over several months (from
about October, 1992 to March, 1993). Other journalists had also been making
reports or comments on the same subject. At the same time, anonymous
communications were being extensively circulated, by hand and through the mail,
about alleged venality and corruption in the courts. And all these were being
repeatedly and insistently adverted to by certain sectors of society.</p>

<p class=BODY>In light of these abnormal developments, the Chief Justice took
an extraordinary step. He issued Administrative Order No. 11-93 dated January
25, 1993, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;Creating an <u>Ad Hoc</u>
Committee to Investigate Reports of Corruption in the Judiciary,&quot;</i><a

reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHEREAS, the Court's attention has been drawn to the many and
persistent rumors and unverified reports respecting corruption in the
judiciary, said rumors and reports not only <span class=SpellE>having<span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>been</span></span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:

been adverted to by certain government officials and civic leaders,</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, by authority of the Court, an <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

otherwise, such persons as may appear to it to have some knowledge of the
matter and who may be appealed to share that knowledge with the Court, and
otherwise gather such evidence as may be available. The Committee is hereby
authorized to use such facilities and personnel of the court as may be
necessary or convenient in the fulfillment of its assigned mission, and shall
submit its report to the Court within thirty (30) days.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Material to the present inquiry are <span class=SpellE>Jurado's</span>
published statements from late 1992 to the middle of February, 1993.</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>1. In his column of <st1:date
Year="1992" Day="21" Month="10">October 21, 1992</st1:date>, he wrote of
&quot;(j)<span class=SpellE>udges</span> in a number of regional trial courts
in Metro Manila (who) have become so notorious in their dealings with litigants
and lawyers that they are now called the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>'Magnificent
Seven.'</i> &quot;He stated that &quot;(<span class=SpellE>i</span>)t has come
to a point where lawyers and litigants try their <span class=SpellE>darndest</span>
to stay away from these judges. The answer, of course, is obvious.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>2. In his February 3,
1993 column, he adverted to another group, also named &quot;Magnificent
Seven,&quot; which, he said, should be distinguished from the first. He wrote:
&quot;When lawyers speak of the 'Magnificent Seven' one has to make sure which
group they are referring to. <span class=SpellE>Makati's</span> 'Magnificent
Seven' are a bunch of <span class=SpellE>Makati</span> regional trial court
judges who fix drug-related cases. The 'Magnificent Seven' in the Supreme Court
consists of a group of justices who vote as one.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>3. Aside from the
&quot;Magnificent Seven,&quot; he also wrote about a group which he dubbed the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;Dirty Dozen.&quot;</i> In his column of
October 21, 1992 he said that there are &quot;** 12 judges who have acquired
such reputation for graft and corruption that they are collectively known as
the dirty dozen.' These judges, I am told, are not satisfied with accepting
bribes; they actually sell their decisions to the litigants that offer the
larger bribe. Each of these judges reportedly has go-betweens who approach the
litigants and 'solicit' their bids for what is clearly an auction for the
judge's decision.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>According to him, the
most corrupt judges now are <span class=SpellE>Makati's</span> &quot;Dirty
Dozen&quot; judges, supplanting some of those from <span class=SpellE>Pasay</span>,
<span class=SpellE>Pasig</span> and <span class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City;
corruption in lower Courts had been admitted by an Executive Judge in a Metro
Manila Regional Trial Court (column of November 9, 1992); and because the
&quot;Dirty Dozen&quot; had given <span class=SpellE>Makati</span> the
reputation of having the most corrupt RTC in the country, multi-nationals and
financing institutions explicitly stipulate in their agreements that litigation
in connection with these contracts may be held anywhere in Metro Manila except
in <span class=SpellE>Makati</span>; and lawyers confirm that <span
class=SpellE>Makati</span> Judges, including some persons in the sheriffs
office, are the most corrupt, where before, <span class=SpellE>Pasay</span> and
<span class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City had that dubious distinction (column of
December 1, 1992).</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>4. In his November 9,
1992 column, he wrote about &quot;a former appellate justice (who) 'holds
office at a restaurant near the Court of Appeals building. He is known as the
contact man of five CA divisions. Lawyers say that this former jurist really
delivers.&quot; In his column of <st1:date Year="1993" Day="29" Month="1">January
 29, 1993</st1:date>, he adverted to the same unnamed former Justice as being
&quot;known for fixing cases for five CA divisions (that is what he tells
lawyers and litigants) for a fee. And if the price is right, the lawyer of the
litigant paying can even write his own decision using a CA justice as <span
class=SpellE>ponente</span>. This ex-justice holds court at the mezzanine of a
restaurant owned by the wife of a former Marcos cabinet member and which has
become a meeting place for judges, CA justices, <span class=SpellE>practising</span>
lawyers, prosecutors and even Supreme Court justices. The former CA justice
also has his own Chinese contact. After I exposed this last year, the <span
class=SpellE>habitues</span> became scarce. But they are back again, and the
ex-justice is still doing brisk business.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>5. In his column of <st1:date
Year="1993" Day="24" Month="3">March 24, 1993</st1:date>, he made the claim
that one can &quot;get a temporary restraining order from a regional trial
court in Metro-Manila by paying the judge anywhere between P30,000.00 and
P50,000.00.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Other columns of <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> refer to:</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>a) a police report from
the South Capital Command ** (to the effect) that 8 <span class=SpellE>Makati</span>
judges were paid for decisions favoring drug-traffickers and other big-time
criminals, naming the judges and giving detailed accounts of the bribery
(January 30, 1993);</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>b) a bank, later
identified by him as the Equitable Banking Corporation (<span class=SpellE>Ermita</span>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>c) the lady secretary
of an RTC Judge in <span class=SpellE>Makati</span> who allegedly makes sure,
for a fee of P10,000.00 or more, depending on how much money is at stake, that
a case is raffled off to a Judge who will be &quot;extremely sympathetic,&quot;
and can arrange to have the Court issue attachments or injunctions for a
service fee of 1% over and above the regular premium of the attachment or
injunction bond; a Chinese-Filipino businessman who paid this &quot;miracle
worker&quot; P300,000.00 on top of the regular premium on the
attachment/injunction bond (October 27, 1992);</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>d) Executive Judge de
la Rosa, who &quot;has unilaterally decided to discard the rule that cases
seeking provisional remedies should be raffled off to the judges,&quot; thus
violating the rule that no case may be assigned in multi-<span class=SpellE>sola</span>
courts without a raffle (January 28, 1993);</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>e) the Secretary of the
Judicial and Bar Council (JBC), who had supposedly gotten that body to nominate

<p class=BODY>and</p>

<p class=BODY style='margin-left:.3in;text-indent:.2in'>f) what he denominates
&quot;a major determinant of promotion,&quot; i.e., having a relative in the
JBC or the Supreme Court, or having a powerful politician as sponsor, citing
specifically, the following nominees to the Court of Appeals -- <span
class=SpellE>Conrado</span> Vasquez, Jr., son and namesake of the Ombudsman and
brother of the head of the Presidential Management Staff; <span class=SpellE>Rosalio</span>
de la Rosa, &quot;nephew of Justice <span class=SpellE>Relova</span> and cousin
of Chief Justice <span class=SpellE>Narvasa</span>;&quot; and the fact that
nomination of some worthy individuals was blocked because they &quot;incurred
the ire of the powers that be,&quot; e.g., Judge <span class=SpellE>Maximiano</span>
Asuncion, <span class=SpellE>Quezon</span> City RTC, and Raul <span

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>to the Proceeding at Bar<o:p></o:p></u></i></p>

<p class=BODY>What may be called the seed of the proceeding at bar was sown by
the decision promulgated by this Court on August 27, 1992, in the so-called
&quot;controversial case&quot; of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Company v. Eastern Telephone Philippines, Inc.
(ETPI),&quot;</i> G.R. No. 94374. In that decision the Court was sharply
divided; the vote was 9 to 4, in favor of the petitioner PLDT. Mr. Justice Hugo
E. Gutierrez, Jr. wrote the opinion for the majority.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
A motion for reconsideration of the decision was filed in respondent's behalf
on September 16, 1992, which has recently been resolved.</p>

<p class=BODY>In connection with this case, G.R. No. 94374, the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;Philippine Daily Inquirer&quot;</i>
and one or two other newspapers published, on January 28, 1993, a report of the
purported affidavit of a Mr. David Miles <span class=SpellE>Yerkes</span>, an
alleged expert in linguistics. This gentleman, it appears, had been
commissioned by one of the parties in the case, Eastern Telephone Philippines,
Inc. (ETPI), to examine and analyze the decision of Justice Gutierrez in
relation to a few of his prior <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>ponencias</i></span> and the writings of one of the lawyers of PLDT,
Mr. <span class=SpellE>Eliseo</span> <span class=SpellE>Alampay</span>, to
ascertain if the decision had been written, in whole or in part, by the latter.
<span class=SpellE>Yerkes</span> proffered the conclusion that the Gutierrez
decision &quot;looks, reads and sounds like the writing of the PLDT's
counsel.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>As might be expected, the <span class=SpellE>Yerkes</span>
&quot;revelations&quot; spawned more public discussion and comment about the
judiciary and the Supreme Court itself, much of it unfavorable. There were
calls for impeachment of the justices, for resignation of judges. There were
insistent and more widespread reiterations of denunciations of incompetence and
corruption in the judiciary. Another derogatory epithet for judges was coined
and quickly gained currency: &quot;Hoodlums in Robes.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>It was at about this time and under these circumstances
--particularly the furor caused by the <span class=SpellE>Yerkes</span> opinion
that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>PLDT</i> decision was authored
by a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>PLDT</i> lawyer -- that <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> wrote in his column on February 8, 1993, an item
entitled, &quot;Who will judge the Justices?&quot; referring among other things
to &quot; ** (a) report that six justices, their spouses, children and
grandchildren (a total of 36 persons) spent a vacation in Hong Kong some time
last year – and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that luxurious hotel
accommodations and all their other expenses were paid by a <u>public utility
firm</u> ** and that the trip ** was arranged by the travel agency patronized
by this public utility firm.’”</i><a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8"

<p class=BODY>This was the event that directly gave rise to the proceeding at
bar.</p>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a.<span style='mso-tab-count:

<p class=BODY>For shortly afterwards, on February 10, 1993, Mr. Vicente R.
Samson, First Vice President of the PLDT (Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company), addressed a letter to the Chief Justice, submitting his sworn
statement in confutation of “the item in the column of Mr. Emil P. <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> of the Manila Standard on a vacation trip supposedly
taken by six Justices with their families last year,” and requesting that the
Court <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>“take such action as may be
appropriate.”</i> In his affidavit, Samson made the following averments:<a

<blockquote>While the name of the public utility which supposedly financed the
alleged vacation of the Justices in <span class=SpellE>HongKong</span> has not
been disclosed in the <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> column, the publication

the decision of the Supreme Court, penned by Mr. Justice Hugo E. Gutierrez,
Jr., in the pending case involving the PLDT and Eastern Telecommunications <span
class=SpellE>Phils</span>., Inc. was supposedly ghost written by a lawyer of
PLDT, gives rise to the innuendo or unfair inference that Emil <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> is alluding to PLDT in the said column; and, this in
fact was the impression or perception of those who talked to me and the other
officers of the PLDT after having read the <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>

<blockquote>4. In as much as the PLDT case against Eastern Telecommunications
Philippines is still sub-<span class=SpellE>judice</span>, since the motions

Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. and NTC are still pending before the
Court, we have tried to refrain from making any public comments on these
matters, lest any statement we make be interpreted to be an attempt on our part
to unduly influence the final decision of the Supreme Court in the above
described case. However in the interest of truth and justice, PLDT is compelled
to emphatically and categorically declare that it is not the public utility
firm referred to in the <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> column and that
specifically, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>it has never paid for any
such trip, hotel or other accommodations for any justice of the Supreme Court

<p class=BODY>The Samson affidavit was followed by another submitted to the
Court by Atty. William Veto, the &quot;in-house counsel of Equitable Banking
Corporation since 1958,&quot; subscribed and sworn to on February 10, 1993, in
relation to another article of <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>.<a

Veto deposed that on Tuesday, January 5, 1993 he had &quot;hosted a lunch party
at the Officers' Lounge, 7th Floor of the Equitable Banking Corporation
Building, <span class=SpellE>Ermita</span> Branch ** upon prior permission **
obtained;&quot; that the &quot;expenses for said party were exclusively from my
personal funds and the food was prepared in my house by my wife and served by
my house help ,** and four (4) waiters ** hired from the nearby Barrio Fiesta
Restaurant;&quot; that among the invited guests &quot;were members of the
Supreme Court and Court of Appeals who ** were my friends of forty years since
our days in law school;&quot; and that the party was held in the lounge of the
bank instead of in &quot;my residence&quot; &quot;unlike in former years **
because my birthday happened to fall on a working day and my friends from the Equitable
Banking Corporation ** suggested that I hold it there (at the lounge) for their
convenience because my residence is far from down town.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>However, this birthday luncheon of Atty. Veto was reported in <span
class=SpellE>Jurado's</span> column (in the Manila Standard issues of January
12 and 28, 1993) as having been <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;hosted
(by the Equitable Bank) at its penthouse mainly for some justices, judges,
prosecutors and law practitioners ** .&quot;</i> And upon this premise, <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> indulged in the following pontification: &quot;When
those in the judiciary fraternize this way, what chances before the courts do
other lawyers, who are not <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>'<span

fraternity? In the case of prosecutors and fiscals, what chances do opposing
counsels have against those in the fraternity?&quot; (column of <st1:date

be best positioned to assist the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc</i>
Committee in its function of obtaining evidence, or leads, on the matter. You
have, I believe, expressed more than once the laudable desire that the
judiciary rid itself of the incompetents and the misfits in its ranks, and we
believe you will want to help the Court do precisely that, by furnishing the

simply a fact-finding body. Its function is evidence-gathering. Although
possessed of the authority to maintain and enforce order in its proceedings,
and to compel obedience to its processes, it is not an adjudicative body in the
sense that it will pronounce persons guilty or innocent, or impose sanctions,
on the basis of such proofs as may be presented to it. That function is
reserved to the Supreme Court itself, in which it is lodged by the Constitution
and the laws. Thus, at the conclusion of its evidence-gathering mission, the <i

appropriate.</blockquote>

fact his desire to cooperate in any investigation on corruption in the

invitation of the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc</i> Committee
was routed to his desk at the Manila Standard office on the day of the hearing
itself, when it was already impossible to cancel previous professional and
business appointments; and the second invitation, &quot;if it was ever

it.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span

If the impression had been created that he had indeed &quot;snubbed&quot; the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc</i> Committee, he &quot;sincerely
apologizes.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>He averred that his columns are self-explanatory and reflect his
beliefs, and there was no need to elaborate further on what he had written. He
expressed his firm belief that justice can be administered only by a judicial
system that is itself just and incorruptible, and the hope that this Court
would view his response in this light.</p>

<p class=BODY>He also made the following specific observations:</p>

<blockquote>1. The affidavit of Antonio Samson of the PLDT dated February 9,
1993 was an assertion of the affiant's belief and opinion and he (<span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span>) would not comment on it except to say that while
Mr. Samson is entitled to his beliefs and opinions, these &quot;bind only him
and the PLDT.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. Atty. William [Veto's affidavit substantially corroborated what
he had written in vital details; hence, further substantiation would be <span
class=SpellE>surplusage</span>. In fact, the Supreme Court had confirmed the
story in its press statement quoted by him (<span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>)
in his January 30, 1993 column. His column about the Veto party constitutes
fair comment on the public conduct of public officers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The column about Executive Judge <span class=SpellE>Rosalio</span>
de la Rosa merely summarized the position of Judge <span class=SpellE>Teresita</span>
<span class=SpellE>Dy-Liaco</span> Flores on the actuations of Judge de la Rosa
and called the attention of the Court thereto, Judge Flores' complaint, a copy
of which had been sent to the Court Administrator, being one meriting its
attention.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. The &quot;factual and evidentiary basis&quot; of his column of
January 30, 1993 was the police report on seven (7) <span class=SpellE>Makati</span>
judges authored by Chief Inspector <span class=SpellE>Laciste</span> Jr., of
the Narcotics Branch of the RPIU, South CAPCOM, PNP, addressed to
Vice-President Joseph E. Estrada, a copy of which he had received in the
newsroom of the Manila Standard. The existence of the report had been affirmed
by a reporter of the Manila Standard, Jun Burgos, when he appeared at the
hearing of the Ad Hoc Committee on January 11, 1993.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In response, <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> filed a pleading

clarification on two points -- as to the capacity in which he is being cited in
these administrative proceedings -- whether &quot;as full time journalist or as
a member of the bar,&quot; and why he is being singled out, from all his other
colleagues in media who had also written about wrongdoings in the judiciary,

of the press or over his work as a journalist.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2. The present administrative matter is not a citation for (a)
direct contempt as there is no pending case or proceeding out of which a direct
contempt charge against him may arise, or (b) indirect contempt as no formal
charge for the same has been laid before the court in accordance with Section 3

style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> v. Gonzalez</i> (166 SCRA 316 [1988]), the
Court underscored the importance both of the constitutional guarantee of free
speech and the reality that there are fundamental and equally important public
interests which need on occasion to be balanced against and accommodated with
one and the other. There, the Court stressed the importance of the public
interest in the maintenance of the integrity and orderly functioning of the
administration of justice. The Court said:<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13'

<blockquote>&quot;The principal defense of respondent Gonzalez is that he was
merely exercising his constitutional right of free speech. He also invokes the
related doctrines of qualified privileged communications and fair criticism in
the public interest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent Gonzalez is entitled to the constitutional guarantee of
free speech. No one seeks to deny him that right, least of all this Court. What
respondent seems unaware of is that freedom of speech and of expression, like
all constitutional freedoms, is not absolute and that freedom of expression
needs on occasion to be adjusted to and accommodated with the requirements of
equally important public interests. One of these fundamental public interests
is the maintenance of the integrity and orderly functioning of the
administration of justice. There is no antinomy between free expression and the
integrity of the system of administering justice. For the protection and
maintenance of freedom of expression itself can be secured only within the
context of a functioning and orderly system of dispensing justice, within the
context, in other words, of viable independent institutions for delivery of
justice which are accepted by the general community. As Mr. Justice Frankfurter
put it:</blockquote>

<p class=2Q>'* * * A free press is not to be preferred to an independent
judiciary, nor an independent judiciary to a free press. Neither has primacy
over the other; both are indispensable to a free society.</p>

<p class=2Q>The freedom of the press in itself presupposes an independent
judiciary through which that freedom may, if necessary, be vindicated. And one
of the potent means for assuring judges their independence is a free press.'
(Concurring in <span class=SpellE>Pennekamp</span> v. Florida, 328 U.S. 331 at
354-356 [1946]).</p>

<blockquote>Mr. Justice Malcolm of this Court expressed the same thought in the
following terms:</blockquote>

<p class=2Q>'The Organic Act wisely guarantees freedom of speech and press.
This constitutional right must be protected in its fullest extent. The Court
has heretofore given evidence its tolerant regard for charges under the Libel
Law which come dangerously close to its violation. We shall continue in this
chosen path. The liberty of the citizens must be preserved in all of its
completeness. But license or abuse of liberty of the press and of the citizens
should not be confused with liberty in its true sense. As important as is the
maintenance of an <span class=SpellE>unmuzzled</span> press and the free
exercise of the rights of the citizens is the maintenance of the independence
of the Judiciary. Respect for the Judiciary cannot be had if persons are
privileged to scorn a resolution of the court adopted for good purposes, and if
such persons are to be permitted by subterranean means to diffuse inaccurate
accounts of confidential proceedings to the embarrassment of the <span

<p class=BODY>The Civil Code, in its Article 19 lays down the norm for the proper
exercise of any right, constitutional or otherwise, viz.:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;ART. 19. Every person must, in the exercise of his rights and
in the performance of his duties, act with justice, give everyone his due, and
observe honesty and good faith.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The provision is reflective of the universally accepted precept
of &quot;abuse of rights,&quot; &quot;one of the most dominant principles which
must be deemed always implied in any system of law.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:

It parallels too &quot;the supreme norms of justice which the law
develops&quot; and which are expressed in three familiar Latin maxims: <span
class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>honeste</i></span><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> <span class=SpellE>vivere</span>, <span

honorably, not to injure others, and to render to every man his due).<a

<p class=BODY>Freedom of expression, the right of speech and of the press is,
to be sure, among the most zealously protected rights in the Constitution. But
every person exercising it is, as the Civil Code stresses, obliged &quot;to act
with justice, give everyone his due, and observe honesty and good faith.&quot;
The constitutional fight of freedom of expression may not be availed of to
broadcast lies or half-truths --this would not be &quot;to observe honesty and
good faith;&quot; it may not be used to insult others, destroy their name or
reputation or bring them into disrepute. -- this would not be &quot;to act with
justice&quot; or &quot;give everyone his due.&quot;</p>

Reputation<o:p></o:p></u></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In the present proceeding, there is also involved an acknowledged
and important interest of individual persons: the right to private reputation.
Judges, by becoming such, are commonly and rightly regarded as voluntarily
subjecting themselves to norms of conduct which embody more stringent standards
of honesty, integrity, and competence than are commonly required from private
persons.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn17' href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, persons who seek or accept appointment to the Judiciary cannot
reasonably be regarded as having thereby forfeited any right whatsoever to
private honor and reputation. For so to rule will be simply, in the generality
of cases, to discourage all save those who feel no need to maintain their
self-respect as a human being in society, from becoming judges, with obviously
grievous consequences for the quality of our judges and the quality of the
justice that they will dispense. Thus, the protection of the right of
individual persons to private reputations is also a matter of public interest
and must be reckoned with as a factor in identifying and laying down the norms
concerning the exercise of press freedom and free speech.</p>

<p class=BODY>Clearly, the public interest involved in freedom of speech and
the individual interest of judges (and for that matter, all other public
officials) in the maintenance of private honor and reputation need to be
accommodated one to the other. And the point of adjustment or accommodation
between these two legitimate interests is precisely found in the norm which
requires those who, invoking freedom of speech, publish statements which are
clearly defamatory to identifiable judges or other public officials to exercise
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bona fide</i> care in ascertaining the
truth of the statements they publish. The norm does not require that a
journalist guarantee the truth of what he says or publishes. But the norm does
prohibit the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>reckless</i> disregard of
private reputation by publishing or circulating defamatory statements without
any <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bona fide</i> effort to ascertain the
truth thereof. That this norm represents the generally accepted point of
balance or adjustment between the two interests involved is clear from a consideration
of both the pertinent civil law norms and the Code of Ethics adopted by the
journalism profession in the Philippines.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn18'

<p class=BODY>Now, <span class=SpellE>Jurado's</span> allegation in his column
of February 8, 1993 --&quot;that six justices, their spouses, children and
grandchildren (a total of 36 persons) spent a vacation in Hong Kong some time
last year -- and <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>that luxurious hotel
accommodations and all their other expenses were paid by a public utility firm
and that the trip reportedly was arranged by the travel agency patronized by
this public utility firm,&quot; supra, is</i> -- in the context of the facts
under which it was made --easily and quickly perceived as a transparent
accusation that the PLDT had bribed or &quot;rewarded&quot; six (6) justices
for their votes in its favor in the case of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Company v. Eastern Telephone Philippines, Inc.

style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
by not only paying all their expenses -- i.e., hotel accommodations and all
other expenses for the trip -- but also by having one of its own travel
agencies arrange for such a trip.</p>

<p class=BODY>As already stated, that allegation was condemned as a lie, an
outright fabrication, by the PLDT itself, through one of its responsible
officers, Mr. Vicente Samson, as well as by the heads of the two (2) travel
agencies &quot;patronized by it,&quot; <span class=SpellE>Ermin</span> Garcia,
Jr. and Marissa de la Paz, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>supra</i>.</p>

<p class=BODY>That categorical denial logically and justly placed on <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> the burden of proving the truth of his grave
accusation, or showing that it had been made through some honest mistake or
error committed despite good faith efforts to arrive at the truth, or if unable
to do either of these things, to offer to atone for the harm caused.</p>

<p class=BODY>But the record discloses that <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>
did none of these things. He exerted no effort whatever to contest or qualify
in any manner whatever the emphatic declaration of PLDT Vice-President Samson
that --</p>

<blockquote>While the name of the public, utility which supposedly financed the
alleged vacation of the Justices in <span class=SpellE>HongKong</span> has not
been disclosed in the <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> column, the publication
thereof, taken in relation to the spate of recent newspaper reports alleging
that the decision of the Supreme Court, penned by Mr. Justice Hugo E.
Gutierrez, Jr., in the pending case involving the PLDT and Eastern
Telecommunications <span class=SpellE>Phils</span>., Inc. was supposedly ghost
written by a lawyer of PLDT, gives rise to the innuendo or unfair inference
that Emil <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> is alluding to PLDT in the said
column; and, this in fact was the impression or perception of those who talked
to me and the other officers of the PLDT after having read the <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> column.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The record shows that he made no effort whatsoever to impugn,
modify, clarify or explain Samson's positive assertion that:</p>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot; ** (the PLDT) has
never paid for any such trip, hotel or other accommodations for any justice of
the Supreme Court or his family during their vacation, if any, in <span
class=SpellE>Hongkong</span> last year. It is not even aware that any of the
justices or their families have made the trip referred to in the <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> column:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>** neither Atty. Emil P. <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> nor any one in his behalf has ever spoken to me or
any other responsible officer of PLDT about the matter ** ** ;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>** PLDT ** ** (never) talked
to or made arrangements with any travel agency or any person or entity in
connection with any such alleged trip of the Justices and their families to <span
class=SpellE>Hongkong</span>, much less paid anything <span class=SpellE>therefor</span>
to such agencies, fully or in part, in the year 1992 as referred to in Par. 2
hereinabove;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>What appears from the record is that without first having made an
effort to talk to any one from the PLDT or the Supreme Court to ascertain the
veracity of his serious accusation, <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> went ahead
and published it.</p>

<p class=BODY>His explanation for having aired the accusation consists simply
of a declaration that Samson's affidavit, as well as the affidavits of the
heads of the two travel agencies regularly patronized by it, were just
assertions of the affiants' belief and opinion; and that he (<span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span>) would not comment on them except to say that while
they are entitled to their beliefs and opinions, these were binding on them
only. This is upon its face evasion of duty of the most cavalier kind;
sophistry of the most arrant sort. What is made plain is that <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> is in truth unable to challenge any of the averments
in the affidavits of PLDT and its travel agencies, or otherwise substantiate
his accusation, and that his is a mere resort to semantics to justify the
unjustifiable. What is made plain is that his accusation is false, and
possesses not even the saving grace of honest error.</p>

<p class=BODY>If relying on second-hand sources of information is, as the
Journalists' Code states, irresponsible, supra, then indulging in pure
speculation or gossip is even more so; and a failure to &quot;present the other
side&quot; is equally reprehensible, being what in law amounts to a denial of
due process.</p>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>b.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>       </span><u>Re Equitable Bank Party</u><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> is also shown by the record to
have so slanted his report of the birthday luncheon given by Atty. William Veto
(the &quot;in-house counsel of Equitable Banking Corporation since 1958&quot;)
as to project a completely false depiction of it. His description of that
affair (in the Manila Standard issues of January 12 and 28, 1993) as having
been hosted by the Equitable Bank <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;at
its penthouse mainly for some justices, judges, prosecutors and law
practitioners **,&quot;</i> carries the sanctimonious postscript already
quoted, putting the rhetorical question about how such fraternization affects
the chances in court of lawyers outside that charmed circle.</p>

<p class=BODY>When confronted with Veto's affidavit to the effect that the
party was given by him at his (Veto's) own expense, the food having been
prepared by his wife in his house, and served by his house help and waiters
privately hired by him; that he had invited many persons including friends of
long standing, among them justices of the Supreme Court and the Court of
Appeals; and that the party had been held in the Officers' Lounge of Equitable
Bank, instead of his home, as in years past, to suit the convenience of his
guests because his birthday fell on a working day, <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>
could not, or would not deign to, contradict any of those statements. He merely
stated that Veto's affidavit substantially corroborated what he had written in
vital details, which is obviously far from correct.</p>

<p class=BODY>Most importantly, the record does not show that before he
published that story, <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> ever got in touch with
Veto or anyone in Equitable Bank, <span class=SpellE>Ermita</span> Branch, to
determine the accuracy of what he would later report. If he did, he would
quickly have learned that his sources, whoever or whatever they were, were not
to be relied upon. If he did not, he was gravely at fault -- at the very least
for disregarding the Journalist's Code of Ethics -- in failing to exert <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bona fide</i> efforts to verify the accuracy
of his information.</p>

<p class=BODY>In either case, his publication of the slanted, therefore
misleading and false, report of the affair is censurable. His proffered
explanation: that the justices having confirmed their presence at the luncheon,
thus corroborating what he had written in vital details and making further
substantiation unnecessary, and that his report constituted fair comment on the
public conduct of public officers, obviously does not at all explain why a
party given by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Atty. Veto</i> was reported
by him as one tendered by <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Equitable Bank</i>.
The only conclusion that may rationally be drawn from these circumstances is
that <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>, unable to advance any plausible reason
for the conspicuous divergence between what in fact transpired and what he reported,
again resorts to semantics and sophistry to attempt an explanation of the
unexplainable. Paraphrasing the Code of Ethics, he failed to scrupulously
report and interpret the news; on the contrary, his failure or refusal to
verify such essential facts as who really hosted and tendered the luncheon and
spent for it, and his playing up of the Bank's supposed role as such host have
resulted in an improper suppression of those facts and a gross distortion of
the truth about them.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> disregarded the truth again, and

February 3, 1993 already adverted to,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn20'

<blockquote>&quot;When lawyers speak of the 'Magnificent Seven' one has to make
sure which group they are referring to. <span class=SpellE>Makati's</span>
'Magnificent Seven' are a bunch of <span class=SpellE>Makati</span> regional
trial court judges who fix drug-related cases. <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>The 'Magnificent Seven' in the Supreme Court consists of a group of
justices who vote as one.&quot;</i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>About the last (italicized) statement there is, as in other
accusations of <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>, not a shred of proof; and the
volumes of the Supreme Court Reports Annotated (SCRA) in which are reported the
decisions of the Supreme Court En Banc for the year 1992 (January to December)
and for January 1993, divulge not a single non-unanimous decision or resolution
where seven (7) justices voted &quot;as one,&quot; nor any group of decisions
or resolutions where the recorded votes would even suggest the existence of
such a cabal.</p>

<p class=BODY>This is yet another accusation which <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>
is unable to substantiate otherwise than, as also already pointed out, by
invoking unnamed and confidential sources which he claims he considers highly
credible and reliable and which would be <span class=SpellE>imperilled</span>
by elaborating on the information furnished by them. He would justify reliance
on those sources on grounds of necessity, custom and usage and claim the
protection of Republic Act No. 53, as amended by Republic Act No. 1477 from
forced revelation of confidential- news sources except when demanded by the
security of the state.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn21' href="#_ftn21"

<p class=BODY>Surely it cannot be postulated that the law protects a journalist
who deliberately prints lies or distorts the truth; or that a newsman may
escape liability who publishes derogatory or defamatory allegations against a
person or entity, but recognizes no obligation <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>bona fide</i> to establish beforehand the factual basis of such
imputations and refuses to submit proof thereof when challenged to do so. It
outrages all notions of fair play and due process, and reduces to uselessness
all the injunctions of the Journalists' Code of Ethics to allow a newsman, with
all the potential of his profession to influence popular belief and shape
public opinion, to make shameful and offensive charges destructive of personal
or institutional honor and repute, and when called upon to justify the same,
cavalierly beg off by claiming that to do so would compromise his sources and
demanding acceptance of his word for the reliability of those sources.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jurado's</span> other writings already
detailed here are of the same sort. While it might be tedious to recount what
has already been stated about the nature and content of those writings, it is
necessary to do so briefly in order not only to stress the gravity of the
charges he makes, but also to demonstrate that his response to the call for
their substantiation has been one of unvarying intransigence: an advertence to
confidential sources with whose reliability he professes satisfaction and whom
fuller disclosure would supposedly compromise.</p>

<p class=BODY>There can be no doubt of the serious and degrading character --
not only to the Court of Appeals, but also to the judiciary in general -- of
his columns of November 9, 1992 and January 29, 1993 concerning an unnamed
former justice of the Court of Appeals who had allegedly turned
&quot;fixer&quot; for five of the Court's divisions and who, for the right
price, could guarantee that a party's lawyer could write his own decision for
and in the name of the <span class=SpellE><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>ponente</i></span>;
and of his column of March 24, 1993 to the effect that anywhere from P30,000 to

<blockquote>&quot;Contempt, by reason of publications relating to court and to
court proceedings, are of two kinds. A publication which tends to impede,
obstruct, embarrass or influence the courts in administering justice in a
pending suit or proceeding, constitutes criminal contempt which is summarily
punishable by courts. This is the rule announced in the cases relied upon by
the majority. A publication which tends to degrade the courts and to destroy
public confidence in them or that which tends to bring them in any way into
disrepute, constitutes likewise criminal contempt, and is equally punishable by
courts. In the language of the majority, what is sought, in the first kind of
contempt, to be shielded against the influence of newspaper comments, is the
all-important duty of the courts to administer justice in the decision of a
pending case. In the second kind of contempt, the punitive hand of justice is
extended to vindicate the courts from any act or conduct calculated to bring
them into disfavor or to destroy public confidence in them. In the first, there
is no contempt where there is no action pending, as there is no decision which
might in any be influenced by the newspaper publication. In the second, the
contempt exists, with or without a pending case, as what is sought to be
protected is the court itself and its dignity. (12 Am. <span class=SpellE>Jur</span>:
pp. 416-417.) Courts would lose their utility if public confidence in them is
destroyed. &quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The foregoing disposes of <span class=SpellE>Jurados</span> other
contention that the present administrative matter is not a citation for direct
contempt, there being no pending case or proceeding out of which a charge of
direct contempt against him may arise; this, even without regard to the fact
that the statements made by him about sojourn in <span class=SpellE>Hongkong</span>
of six Justices of the Supreme Court were clearly in relation to a case
involving two (2) public utility companies, then pending in this Court.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn27' href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span

<p class=BODY>His theory that there is no formal charge against him is
specious. His published statements about that alleged trip are branded as false
in no uncertain terms by the sworn statement and letter of Vice-President
Vicente R. Samson of the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company which:</p>

<blockquote>(a) &quot;emphatically and categorically&quot; deny that PLDT had
made any arrangements with any travel agency, or with the two travel agencies
it patronized or retained, or paid anything, on account of such alleged trip;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) positively affirm (<span class=SpellE>i</span>) that PLDT was
&quot;not even aware that any of the justices or their <span class=SpellE>familes</span>
* * (had) made the trip referred to in the <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>
column,&quot; and (ii) that neither Atty. Emil P. <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>
nor anyone in his behalf has ever spoken to * * (said Mr. Samson) or any other
responsible officer of PLDT about the matter * *;&quot; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c) beseech the Court to &quot;take such action (on the matter) as
may be appropriate.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>As already stated, the Court, in its Resolution of February 16,
1993: (a) ordered the subject of Samson's letter and affidavit docketed as an
official Court proceeding to determine the truth of <span class=SpellE>Jurado's</span>
allegations about it; and (b) directed also that <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>
be furnished copies of Atty. William Veto's affidavit on the luncheon party
hosted by him (which <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> reported as one given by
Equitable Bank) and that <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> file comment on said
affidavits as well as allegations in specified columns of his. <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> was also furnished copies of the affidavits later
submitted by the two travel agencies mentioned in Samson's statement, and was
required to comment thereon.</p>

<p class=BODY>It was thus made clear to him that he was being called to account
for his published statements about the matters referred to, and that action
would be taken thereon against him as &quot;may be appropriate.&quot; That <span
class=SpellE>that</span> was in fact how he understood it is evident from his
submitted defenses, denying or <span class=SpellE>negativing</span> liability
for contempt, direct or indirect. Indeed, as a journalist of no little
experience and a lawyer to boot, he cannot credibly claim an inability to
understand the nature and import of the present proceedings.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> would also claim that the Court
has no administrative supervision over him as a member of the press or over his
work as a journalist, and asks why he is being singled out, and, by being
required to submit to a separate administrative proceeding&quot; treated
differently than his other colleagues in media who were only asked to explain
their reports and comments about wrongdoing in the judiciary to the Ad Hoc
Committee. The answer is that upon all that has so far been said, the Court may
hold anyone to answer for utterances offensive to its dignity, honor or
reputation, which tend to put it in disrepute, obstruct the administration of
justice, or interfere with the disposition of its business or the performance
of its functions in an orderly manner. <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> has not
been singled out. What has happened is that there have been brought before the
Court, formally and in due course, sworn statements branding his reports as
lies and thus imposing upon him the alternatives of substantiating those reports
or assuming responsibility for their publication.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> would have the Court clarify in
what capacity -- whether as a journalist, or as a member of the bar -- he has
been cited in these proceedings. Thereby he resurrects the issue he once raised
in a similar earlier proceeding: that he is being called to account as a lawyer
for his statements as a journalist.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn28'
href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
This is not the case at all. Upon the doctrines and principles already inquired
into and cited, he is open to sanctions as journalist who has misused and
abused press freedom to put the judiciary in clear and present danger of
disrepute and of public odium and opprobrium, to the detriment and prejudice of
the administration of justice. That he is at the same time a member of the bar
has nothing to do with the setting in of those sanctions, although it may
aggravate liability. At any rate, what was said about the matter in that
earlier case is equally cogent here:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;Respondent expresses perplexity at being called to account
for the publications in question in his capacity as a member of the bar, not as
a journalist. The distinction is meaningless, since as the matter stands, he
has failed to justify his actuations in either capacity, and there is no
question, of the Courts authority to call him to task either as a newsman or as
a lawyer. What respondent proposes is that in considering his actions, the
Court judge them only as those of a member of the press and disregard the fact
that he is also a lawyer. But his actions cannot be put into such neat compartments.
In the natural order of things, a person's acts are determined by, and reflect,
the sum total of his knowledge, training and experience. In the case of
respondent in particular, the Court will take judicial notice of the frequent
appearance in his regular columns of comments and observations utilizing legal
language and argument, bearing witness to the fact that in pursuing his craft
as a journalist he calls upon his knowledge as a lawyer to help inform and
influence his readers and enhance his credibility. Even absent this
circumstance, respondent cannot honestly assert that in exercising his
profession as a journalist he does not somehow, consciously or unconsciously,
draw upon his legal knowledge and training. It is thus not realistic, nor perhaps
even possible, to come to any fair, informed and intelligent judgment of
respondent's actuations by divorcing from consideration the fact that he is a
lawyer as well as a newspaperman, even supposing, which is not the case -- that
he may thereby be found without accountability in this matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To repeat, respondent cannot claim absolution even were the Court
to lend ear to his plea that his actions be judged solely as those of a
newspaperman unburdened by the duties and responsibilities peculiar to the law
profession of which he is also a member.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The eloquent, well-crafted dissents of Messrs. Justices <span
class=SpellE>Puno</span> and <span class=SpellE>Melo</span> that would invoke
freedom of the press to purge <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> s conduct of any

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>of
Antecedents and Issue</u><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Regrettably, there appears to be some misapprehension not only
about the antecedents directly leading to the proceedings at bar but also the
basic issues involved.</p>

<p class=BODY>The dissents appear to be of the view, for instance, that it was
chiefly <span class=SpellE>Jurado's</span> failure to appear before the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc</i> Committee in response to two (2)
letters of invitation issued to him, that compelled the Court to order the
matter to be docketed on <st1:date Year="1993" Day="16" Month="2">February 16,
 1993</st1:date> and to require respondent <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> to
file his Comment. This is not the case at all. As is made clear in Sub-Heads 3
and 4 of this opinion, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>supra</i>, the
direct cause of these proceedings was <u>not</u> <span class=SpellE>Jurado's</span>
refusal to appear and give evidence before the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ad Hoc</i> Committee. The direct cause was the letters of PLDT and
Atty. William Veto, supported by affidavits, denouncing certain of his stories
as false,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn29' href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
with the former <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>praying that the Court
take such action as may be appropriate.</i> And it was precisely &quot;the
matter dealt with in the letter and affidavit of the PLDT&quot; that this Court
ordered to &quot;be duly DOCKETED, and hereafter considered and acted upon as
an official Court proceeding,&quot; this, by Resolution dated February 16,
1993; the Court also requiring, in the same Resolution, &quot;that the Clerk of
Court SEND COPIES of the PLDT letter and affidavit, and of the affidavit of
Atty. William Veto to Atty. Emil <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> ** ,&quot;
and that <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> should comment thereon &quot;as well
as (on) the allegations made by him in his columns, herein <u>specified</u>&quot;
-- because of explicit claims, and indications of the falsity or inaccuracy
thereof .</p>

<p class=BODY>There thus also appears to be some misapprehension of the basic
issues, at least two of which are framed in this wise: (1) the right of newsmen
to refuse subpoenas, summons, or 'invitations' to appear in administrative
investigations,&quot; and (2) their right &quot;not to reveal confidential
sources of information under R.A. No. 53, as amended&quot; -- which are not
really involved here -- in respect of which it is theorized that the majority
opinion will have an inhibiting effect on newsmen's confidential sources of
information, and thereby abridges the freedom of the press.</p>

<blockquote><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>Ever Issued to <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span><o:p></o:p></u></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The fact is that no summons or subpoena was ever issued to <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> by the Ad Hoc Committee; nor was the issuance of any
such or similar processes, or any punitive measures for disobedience thereto,
intended or even contemplated. Like most witnesses who gave evidence before the
Committee, <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> was merely <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>invited</i> to appear before it to give information in aid of its
assigned task of ascertaining the truth concerning persistent rumors and
reports about corruption in the judiciary. When he declined to accept the
invitations, the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc</i> Committee took
no action save to inform the Court thereof; and the Court itself also took no
action. There is thus absolutely no occasion to ascribe to that investigation
and the invitation to appear thereat a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on the by
and large &quot;hard-boiled&quot; and self-assured members of the media
fraternity. If at all, the patience and forbearance of the Court, despite the
indifference of some of its invitees and projected witnesses, appear to have
generated an attitude on their part bordering on defiant insolence.</p>

<p class=BODY>Even assuming that the facts were as represented in the separate

had in fact been issued to and served on <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>, his

at all as required by a <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subpoena</i> on
the bare plea that under R.A. No 53, he may not be compelled to disclose the
source of his information. For until he knows what questions will be put to him
as witness -- for which his presence has been compelled -- the relevance of
R.A. No. 53 cannot be ascertained. His duty is clear. He must obey the <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>subpoena</i>. He must appear at the
appointed place, date and hour, ready to answer questions, and he may invoke
the protection of the statute only at the appropriate time.</p>

<p class=BODY>The issue therefore had nothing to do with any failure of <span

to him, and the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc</i> Committee
having <span class=SpellE>foreborne</span> to take any action at all as regards
his failure to accept its <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>invitations</i>.
The issue, as set out in the opening sentence of this opinion, essentially
concerns <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>&quot;(l)<span class=SpellE>iability</span>
for published statements demonstrably false or misleading, and derogatory of
the courts and individual judges.&quot;</i></p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> is not being called to account
for declining to identify the sources of his news stories, or for refusing to
appear and give testimony before the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad
Hoc</i> Committee. He is not being compelled to guarantee the truth of what he
publishes, but to exercise honest and reasonable efforts to determine the truth
of defamatory statements before publishing them. He is being meted the
punishment appropriate to the publication of stories shown to be false and
defamatory of the judiciary -- stories that he made no effort whatsoever to
verify and which, after being denounced as lies, he has refused, or is unable,
to substantiate.</p>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>c.<span

Liability<o:p></o:p></u></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>for
False or Defamatory Publications</u><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>This opinion neither negates nor seeks to enervate the
proposition that a newsman has a right to keep his sources confidential; that
he cannot be compelled by the courts to disclose them, as provided by R.A. 53,
unless the security of the State demands such revelation. But it does hold that
he cannot invoke such right as a shield against liability for printing stories
that are untrue and derogatory of the courts, or others. The ruling, in other
words, is that when called to account for publications denounced as inaccurate
and misleading, the journalist has the option (a) to demonstrate their
truthfulness or accuracy even if in the process he disclose his sources, or (b)
to refuse, on the ground that to do so would require such disclosure. In the
latter event, however, he must be ready to accept the consequences of
publishing untruthful or misleading stories the truth and accuracy of which he
is unwilling or made no <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>bona fide</i>
effort to prove; for R.A. 53, as amended, is quite unequivocal that the right
of refusal to disclose sources is &quot;without prejudice to ** liability under
civil and criminal laws.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>RA No. 53 thus confers no immunity from prosecution for libel or
for other sanction under law. It does not declare that the publication of any
news report or information which was &quot;related in confidence&quot; to the
journalist is not actionable; such circumstance (of confidentiality) does not
purge the publication of its character as defamatory, if indeed it be such, and
actionable on that ground. All it does is give the journalist the right to
refuse (or not to be compelled) to reveal the source of any news report
published by him which was revealed to him in confidence.</p>

<p class=BODY>A journalist cannot say, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>e.g.:
a person of whose veracity I have no doubt told me in confidence</i> that
Justices X and Y received a bribe of P1M each for their votes in such and such
a case, or that a certain Judge maintains a mistress, and when called to
account for such statements, absolve himself by claiming immunity under R.A.
53, or invoking press freedom.</p>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>d.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>       </span><u>A Word about &quot;Group Libel&quot;</u><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>There is hardly need to belabor the familiar doctrine about group
libel and how it has become the familiar resort of unscrupulous newsmen who can
malign any number of anonymous members of a common profession, calling or
persuasion, thereby putting an entire institution -- like the judiciary in this
case -- in peril of public contumely and mistrust without serious risk of being
sued for defamation. The preceding discussions have revealed <span
class=SpellE>Jurado's</span> predilection for, if not his normal practice of,
refusing to specifically identify or render identifiable the persons he
maligns. Thus, he speaks of the &quot;Magnificent Seven,&quot; by merely
referring to undisclosed regional trial court judges in <span class=SpellE>Makati</span>;
the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot; in the Supreme Court, as some undesignated
justices who supposedly vote as one; the &quot;Dirty Dozen,&quot; as
unidentified trial judges in <span class=SpellE>Makati</span> and three other
cities. He adverts to an anonymous group of justices and judges for whom a bank
allegedly hosted a party; and six unnamed justices of this Court who reportedly
spent a prepaid vacation in Hong Kong with their families. This resort to
generalities and ambiguities is an old and familiar but reprehensible expedient
of newsmongers to avoid criminal sanctions since the American doctrine of group
libel is of restricted application in this jurisdiction. For want of a
definitely identified or satisfactorily identifiable victim, there is generally
no actionable libel, but such a craven publication inevitably succeeds in
putting all the members of the judiciary thus all together referred to under a
cloud of suspicion. A veteran journalist and lawyer of long standing that he
is, <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> could not have been unaware of the foregoing
realities and consequences.</p>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>e</i>.<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>Substantiation
of News Report<o:p></o:p></u></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>Not
Inconsistent with RA 53</u></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>It is argued that compelling a journalist to substantiate the
news report or information confidentially revealed to him would necessarily
negate or dilute his right to refuse disclosure of its source. The argument
will not stand scrutiny.</p>

<p class=BODY>A journalist's &quot;source&quot; either exists or is fictitious.
If the latter, plainly, the journalist is entitled to no protection or immunity
whatsoever.</p>

<p class=BODY>If the &quot;source&quot; actually exists, the information
furnished is either capable of independent substantiation, or it is not. If
the. first, the journalist's duty is clear: ascertain, if not obtain, the
evidence by which the information may be <u>verified</u> before publishing the
same; and if thereafter called to account <span class=SpellE>therefor</span>,
present such evidence and in the process afford the party adversely affected
thereby opportunity to dispute the information or show it to be false.</p>

<p class=BODY>If the information is not verifiable, and it is derogatory of any
third party, then it ought not to be published for obvious reasons. It would be
unfair to the subject of the report, who would be without means of refuting the
imputations against him. And it would afford an unscrupulous journalist a ready
device by which to smear third parties without the obligation to substantiate
his imputations by merely claiming that the information had been given to him
&quot;in confidence&quot;.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is suggested that there is another face to the privileged
character of a journalist's Source of information than merely the protection of
the journalist, and that it is intended to protect also the source itself. What
clearly is implied is that journalist may not reveal his source without the
latter's clearance or consent. This totally overlooks the fact that the object
of a derogatory publication has at least an equal right to know the source
thereof and, if indeed traduced, to the opportunity of obtaining just
satisfaction from the traducer.</p>

<p class=BODY><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>9.</i><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'><u>Need
for Guidelines</u></i></p>

<p class=BODY>Advertences to lofty principle, however eloquent and
enlightening, hardly address the mundane, but immediate and very pertinent,
question of whether a journalist may put in print unverified information
derogatory of the courts and judges and yet remain immune from liability for
contempt for refusing, when called upon, to demonstrate their truth on the
ground of press freedom or by simply claiming that he need not do so since (or
if) it would compel him to disclose the identity of his source or sources.</p>

<p class=BODY>The question, too, is whether or not we are prepared to say that
a journalist's obligation to protect his sources of information transcends, and
is greater Khan, his duty to the truth; and that, accordingly, he has no
obligation whatsoever to verify, or exercise <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>bona fide</i> efforts to verify, the information he is given or obtain
the side of the party adversely affected before he publishes the same</p>

<p class=BODY>True, the pre-eminent role of a free press in keeping freedom
alive and democracy in full bloom cannot be overemphasized. But it is debatable
if that role is well and truly filled by a press let loose to print what it
will, without reasonable restraints designed to assure the truth and accuracy
of what is published. The value of information to a free society is in direct
proportion to the truth it contains. That value reduces to little or nothing
when it is no longer possible for the public to distinguish between truth and
falsehood in news reports, and the courts are denied the mechanisms by which to
make reasonably sure that only the truth reaches print.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is worth stressing that false reports about a public official

has never countenanced the publication of falsehoods, specially the persistent

correction not on the conscience of judges and juries but on the competition of
other ideas&quot; (citing a passage from the first Inaugural Address of Thomas
Jefferson), nonetheless made the firm pronouncement that &quot;there is no
constitutional value in false statements of fact,&quot; and &quot;the erroneous
statement of fact is not worthy of constitutional protection (although) **
nevertheless inevitable in free debate.&quot; &quot;Neither the intentional lie
nor the careless error,&quot; it said, &quot;materially advances society's
interest in ‘<span class=SpellE>unhibited</span>, robust, and wide-open' debate
on public issues. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 <st1:country-region><st1:place>US</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
at 270, 11 L Ed 2d 686, 95 ALR2d 1412. They belong to that category of
utterances which 'are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of
such slight social value as a step to the truth that any benefit that may be
derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and
morality.' <span class=SpellE>Chaplinsky</span> v. new Hampshire, 315 US 568,
572, 86 L Ed 1031, 62 S Ct 766 (1942).&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>&quot;The use of calculated falsehood,&quot; it was observed in

&quot;would put a different cast on the constitutional question. Although
honest utterances, even if inaccurate, may further the fruitful exercise of the
right of free speech, it does not follow that the lie, knowingly and
deliberately published about a public official, should enjoy a like immunity.
** ** (T)he knowingly false statement and the false statement made with
reckless disregard of the truth, do not enjoy constitutional protection.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Similarly, in a 1969 case concerning a patently false accusation
made against a public employee avowedly in <span class=SpellE>fulfilment</span>
of a &quot;legal, moral, or social duty,&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn32'
href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, through the late Chief Justice Roberto <span class=SpellE>Concepcion</span>,
ruled that the guaranty of free speech cannot be considered as according
protection to the disclosure of lies, gossip or rumor, viz.:</p>

<blockquote>&quot; ** Defendant's civil duty was to help the Government clean house
and weed out dishonest, unfit or disloyal officers and employees thereof, <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>where there is reasonable ground</i> to
believe that they fall under this category. He had no legal right, much less
duty, to <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>gossip</i>, or <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>foster the circulation of rumors,</i> or
jump at conclusions and more so if they are gratuitous or groundless.
Otherwise, the freedom of speech, which is guaranteed with a view to
strengthening our democratic institutions and promoting the general welfare,
would be a convenient excuse to engage in the vituperation of individuals, for
the attainment of private, selfish and vindictive ends, thereby hampering the
operation of the Government with administrative investigations of charges
preferred without any color or appearance of truth and with no other probable
effect than the harassment of the officer or employee concerned to the
detriment of public service and public order.&quot;</blockquote>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>b.<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>       </span><u>No &quot;Chilling Effect&quot;</u><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The fear expressed, and earlier adverted to, that the principles
here affirmed would have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on media professionals,
seems largely unfounded and should be inconsequential to the greater number of
journalists in this country who, by and large, out of considerations of truth,
accuracy, and fair play, have commendably refrained from ventilating what would
otherwise be &quot;sensational&quot; or &quot;high-visibility&quot; stories. In
merely seeking to infuse and perpetuate the same attitude and sense of
responsibility in all journalists, i.e., that there is a need to check out the
truth and correctness of information before publishing it, or that, on the
other hand, recklessness and crass sensationalism should be eschewed, this
decision, surely, cannot have such &quot;chilling effect,&quot; and no
apprehension that it would deter the determination of truth or the public
exposure of wrong can reasonably be entertained.</p>

<p class=BODY>The people's right to discover the truth is not advanced by
unbridled license in reportage that would find favor only with extremist
liberalism. If it has done nothing else, this case has made clear the
compelling necessity of the guidelines and parameters elsewhere herein laid
down. They are eminently reasonable, and no responsible journalist should have
cause to complain of difficulty in their observance.</p>

<blockquote>&quot;It may be said that respect to courts cannot be compelled and
that public confidence should be a tribute to judicial worth, virtue and

courts the power to vindicate themselves when outraged is another. I know of no
principle of law that authorizes with impunity a discontented citizen to
unleash, by newspaper publications, the avalanche of his wrath and venom upon
courts and judges. If he believes that a judge is corrupt and that justice has

judge as a private individual but to the judge as such or to the court as an
organ of the administration of justice. In the second place, public interests
will gravely suffer where the judge, as such, will, from time to time, be
pulled down and disrobed of his judicial authority to face his assailant on
equal grounds and prosecute cases in his behalf as a private individual. The
same reasons of public policy which exempt a judge from civil liability in the
exercise of his judicial functions, most fundamental of which is the policy to
confine his time exclusively to the discharge of his public duties, applies
here with equal, if not superior, force (Hamilton v. Williams, 26 Ala. 529; <span

<p class=OTHERHEADING>DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class=DISSENTINGCONCURRING>MELO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class=BODY>In making a choice between the preservation of liberties and
freedom on one hand, and the attainment of a better - ordered society, on the
other, men have not stopped debating.  The
balance, the point of the weighing scale, has moved hither and thither
depending on the needs of the times and on the kind of government
involved.  But in democratic
governments, there must at all times be due regard for the preservation of
constitutional rights even to the extent, at times, of seemingly sacrificing,
as in the case at hand, accurate and truthful media comment.</p>

<p class=BODY>To be sure, fair, accurate, truthful reporting by the press is
the hallmark and badge of a healthy and self-assured society.  But such ideal must not be purchased or
achieved at the cost of press freedom itself, but rather by caring for and
nurturing, cultivating, and promoting the growth of sad freedom, impressing
upon its practitioners due regard for the truth and the entitlement of the
public they serve to accurate reporting instead of the publication or airing of
private biases and jaundiced views.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is thus even as I am personally disturbed by fallacious,
specious, and at times downright false and deceitful reporting and comments,
meant only to promote private and selfish interests, I must extend my
concurrence to the well&#8209;written opinion of Justice Puno.  For, as was said of old, when one rows
through a sea of conflict between restraint and freedom, one should hold both
oars steadily, but always with the oar of freedom in the stronger hand, lest an
errant course be laid.</p>

<p class=OTHERHEADING>DISSENTING OPINION<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=DISSENTINGCONCURRING>PUNO, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>J.:</i></p>

<p class=BODY>The case at bench resolves several issues of critical importance to
freedom of speech and of the press, thus: (1) the right of newsmen to refuse subpoenas,
summons, or &quot;invitations&quot; to appear in administrative investigations;
(2) the right of newsmen not to reveal confidential sources of information under
R.A. No. 53, as amended; and (3) the test to be followed before a false or slanted
report by a journalist can be adjudged as constitutive of contempt of court. It
is my humble submission that the majority opinion, even while heavily laden with
wisdom, has too much of an inhibiting effect on our newsmen's pen as to abridge
their freedom of speech and of the press. I, therefore, dissent.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>The facts are amply stated in the majority opinion. In 1992-93, unsavory
news and commentaries about malpractices in the judiciary, some of them <span
class=SpellE>outrightly</span> vicious, appeared in the print and broadcast media.
In reaction, Chief Justice Andres R. <span class=SpellE>Narvasa</span> issued Administrative
Order No.' 11-93, dated January 25, 1993, &quot;Creating an Ad Hoc Committee to
Investigate Reports of Corruption in the Judiciary,&quot; Its text reads:<o:p></o:p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHEREAS, the Court's attention has been drawn to the many and
persistent rumors and unverified reports respecting corruption in the judiciary,
said rumors and reports not only having been mentioned by media and in anonymous
communications, but having also been adverted to by certain government officials
and civic-leaders.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>NOW, THEREFORE, by authority of the Court, an ad hoc committee is hereby
Constituted composed of Chief Justice Andres R. <span class=SpellE>Narvasa</span>,
as Chairman, and former Justices of the Court, Hon. Lorenzo <span class=SpellE>Relova</span>
and Hon. <span class=SpellE>Ameurfina</span> A. <span class=SpellE>Melencio</span>-Herrera,
as Members, which shall, seek to ascertain the truth respecting said reports and
statements, and to this end, forthwith interview at closed-door sessions or otherwise,
such &quot;persons as may appear to it to have some knowledge of the matter and
<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>who
may he appealed to share knowledge with the Court</i></b>, and otherwise gather
such evidence as may be available. The Committee is hereby authorized to use such
facilities and personnel of the Court as may be necessary or; convenient in the
fulfillment of its assigned mission, and shall submit its report to the Court within
thirty (30) days.&quot; (Italics supplied)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>The membership of the Committee was immediately
constituted.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
From February 2, 1993 to April 16, 1993, the Committee held twenty-four (24) closed-door
sessions and interviewed seventy-one (71) witnesses who appeared to have some knowledge
of the subject of inquiry.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>Among the persons invited by the Committee to appear was respondent
<span class=SpellE>Jurado</span>. His first invitation was to appear on February
4, 1993 &quot;to give the Committee information that will assist it in its task,
i.e., to definitely and accurately determine the facts as regards the published
rumors and reports of corruption in the judiciary.&quot;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> failed to honor the invitation.
On February 5, 1993, the Committee reiterated its invitation, couched in the following
language:<o:p></o:p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;x <span class=SpellE>x</span> <span
class=SpellE>x</span><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>                                                 </span>x
<span class=SpellE>x</span> <span class=SpellE>x</span><span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>                                                                 </span>x <span
class=SpellE>x</span> <span class=SpellE>x</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;It is regretted that you failed to respond to the invitation of
the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc Committee</i> to appear at its
session of February 4, 1993. All indications are that you are the person with the
most knowledge about corruption in the judiciary and hence, appear to be best positioned
to assist the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc Committee</i> in Its
function of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>obtaining evidence, or leads,
on the matter</i>. You have, I believe, expressed more than once the laudable desire
that the judiciary rid itself of the incompetents and the misfits in its ranks,
and we believe you will want to help the Court to do precisely that, by furnishing
the Committee with competent evidence, testimonial or otherwise. Clearly, the purging
process cannot be accomplished without proof, testimonial or otherwise, as you must
no doubt realize, being yourself a lawyer.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>We would like you to know that the <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ad Hoc Committee</i> created by Administrative Order Mo. 11-93 is simply
<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>a fact-finding body</i>. Its function is evidence-gathering.
Although possessed of the authority to maintain and enforce order in its proceedings,
and to compel obedience to its processes, it is not an adjudicative body in the
sense that it will pronounce persons guilty or innocent, or impose sanctions, on
the basis of such proofs as may be presented to it. That function is reserved to
the Supreme Court itself, in which it is lodged by the Constitution and the laws.
Thus, at the conclusion of its evidence-gathering mission, the Ad Hoc Committee
will submit its report and recommendations to the Court which will then take such
action as it deems appropriate.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc Committee</i> has scheduled
hearings on the 11th and 12th of February, 1993. Mr. Justice <span
class=SpellE>Hilario</span> G. <span class=SpellE>Davide</span>, Jr., will preside
as Chairman at these hearings since I will be unable to do so in view of earlier
commitments. We reiterate our invitation that you come before the Committee, and
you may opt to appear either on the 11th or 12th of February, 1993, at 2 o'clock
in the afternoon.&quot; (Italics supplied)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Again, respondent <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> did not appear
in the scheduled investigations. The Court ordered the matter to be docketed on
February 16, 1993 and respondent was asked to file his Comment on the PLDT letter
and affidavit of Mr. Vicente Samson and the affidavit of Atty. William Veto, the
contents of which are related in the majority opinion.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent <span class=SpellE>Jurado</span> submitted his Comment
on March 1, 1993. By then, the Court has also received the affidavits of Mr. <span
class=SpellE>Ermin</span> Garcia of the City World Travel Mart Corporation and of
Mrs. Marissa de la Paz of <span class=SpellE>Philway</span> Travel Corporation traversing
the column of February 8, 1993, of the respondent. On Orders of the Court, the respondent
then submitted a Supplemental Comment with Request for Clarification on March 15,
1993. Among other defenses, respondent invoked R.A. No. 53,<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn3' href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
as amended by R.A. No. 1477, which reads:<o:p></o:p></p>

<blockquote>&quot;AN ACT AMENDING
SECTION ONE OF REPUBLIC ACT NUMBERED FIFTY-THREE, ENTITLED 'AN ACT TO EXEMPT THE
PUBLISHER, EDITOR, COLUMNIST OR REPORTER OF ANY PUBLICATION FROM REVEALING THE SOURCE
OF PUBLISHED NEWS OR INFORMATION OBTAINED IN CONFIDENCE'<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Be if enacted by the Senate
and House of Representatives of the Philippines in Congress assembled:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class=2Q>SECTION 1. Section one of Republic Act Numbered Fifty-three is amended
to read as follows:<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>SECTION 1.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>       </span>Without prejudice
to his liability under the civil and criminal laws, the publisher, editor, columnist
or duly accredited reporter of any newspaper, magazine or periodical of general
circulation cannot be compelled to reveal the source of any news-report of information
appearing in said publication which was related in confidence to such publisher,
editor or reporter unless the Court or House or committee of Congress finds that
such revelation is demanded by the security of the State.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=2Q>SECTION 2.<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>      </span>This act shall
take effect upon its approval.</p>

<p class=2Q>Approved, June 15, 1956.” (Italics supplied)</p>

<p class=BODY>Upon these facts, the majority would hold respondent guilty of contempt
of court.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>In adjudging respondent, in contempt of court, the majority attempted
to establish an equilibrium between the importance of a free press and the need
to maintain the integrity and orderly functioning of the administration of justice,
the civil law duty to &quot;act with justice, give everyone his due, and observe
honesty and good faith,&quot; and the right to private honor and reputation. The
majority tilted the balance against freedom of the press and respondent <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> after finding that some of his columns were either false
or slanted as he made no effort to verify them before their publication.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>How to strike a balance that will accommodate equally compelling yet
competing State interests has divided men stratospheric intellect. Until the
last decibel of time, and while man continues to be bereft of infallibility,
the best of minds will continue their search for the elusive variables that
will correctly tilt the balance between press freedom and other freedoms. Thus,
with high respect to my learned colleagues in the majority, I beg to differ with
their conclusion on where to fix the elusive balance in the case at bench.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY>A brief revisit of the history of the struggle to protect freedom
of the press ought to be enlightening. It will remind us that freedom of speech
and freedom of the press<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
are <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'>preferred rights</b><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn5' href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></b></span></a>
for they are indispensable preconditions for the exercise of other freedoms.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn6' href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Their status as the cornerstone of our liberties followed the shift of sovereignty
from monarchs to the masses - the people.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7'
href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
For the people to be truly sovereign, they must be capable of rendering enlightened
judgments and they cannot acquire this capability unless they have an unclogged
access to information, the main pipeline of which is the press. Early enough, Madison
had the prescience to warn that &quot;a popular government without popular information
or the means of acquiring it is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy or perhaps
both.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>The history of press freedom will also reveal that while its
importance has been given lip service, its <span class=SpellE>unabridge</span>
exercise was not won without a costly struggle. Ironically, the attempts to
restrict the newsmen’s pen came from government itself. The attempts were
disguised in different insidious form<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn9'
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>.
They came as sedition laws which sent newsmen behind bars. They came as tax
laws which impoverished newspaper publishers. Through long, difficult years,
the press survived these assaults.</p>

<p class=BODY>Nonetheless, the struggle to preserve press freedom is distinct
for it is story with a first but without, a final chapter. In the decade of the
60's and onwards, a new weapon against press freedom was unsheathed by
government. It was the sword of subpoena. In Congress as in the courts, it was
wielded to pry open newsmen's secret sources of information often derogatory to
government. The unbridled use of the subpoena had its silencing effects on the
exercise of press freedom. Common law denied newsmen the right to refuse to
testify concerning information received in confidence.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn10' href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The press has to go to the legislature for protection. The protection came to
be known as shield <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>statutes</i></b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>and their
scope varied. In the United States, they were of two (2) types: (1) laws that
shield the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>identities</i></b> of newsmen's informants from disclosure;<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) laws that shield not only the identities of news sources but also the
content of the communication against disclosure.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn12'
href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Test cases were also filed in courts seeking a ruling that a newsman's right to
gather news is constitutionally protected, and hence, cannot be impaired by
subpoenas forcing disclosure of the identities of their sources of information.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn13' href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
To date, the American case law on the matter has yet to jell.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the Philippines, the shield law is provided by Republic Act
No. 1477 approved on June 15, 1956 which prohibits revelation of the “source of
any news-report or information ... related in confidence … unless the court or
a House or committee of Congress finds that such revelation is demanded by the
security of the State.” R.A. No. 1477 amended R.A. No. 53 by changing the
phrase “<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>interest of the State</i></b>” to “<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>security of the State</i></b>.” The change
limited the right of the State to share with newsmen their confidential sources
of information.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=SpellE>Prescinding</span> from these premise, let me
now slide to the constitutional balancing made by the majority. I
wholeheartedly agree that except for a more overriding consideration, the Court
should uphold the importance of an orderly administration of justice. It
appears that respondent’s reliance on his constitutional right to freedom of
speech and of the press failed to impress the majority as an overriding
consideration. Among the reasons that obviously swayed the majority in
submerging the significance of freedom of speech and of the press below that,
of an orderly administration of justice were: failure of respondent to obey the
invitation to appear made by the Ad Hoc Committee, his refusal to reveal the
sources of his information, and the falsity and slants of his columns. In
registering this dissent, I wish to address these reasons and I respectfully
posit the following postulates:</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>First</i></b>. It should foe stressed that respondent <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> was initially invited to appear before the Ad Hoc Committee
tasked to <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>investigate</i></b> Reports of Corruption in the Judiciary. The <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad
Hoc Committee</i></b> is only a <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>fact-finding body</i></b>- as its ordained
duty is &quot;to ascertain the truth&quot; respecting reports on corruption in
the judiciary. As an administrative fact-finding body, its power to compel
newsmen to appear and disclose their secret sources of information is <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>less</i></b>
compared with the same power of Congress while making laws or the power of
courts when litigating actual controversies. Jurisprudence holds that the power
to compel testimony inheres in the power to legislate for &quot;a legislative
body cannot legislate wisely or effectively in the absence of information
respecting the conditions which the legislation is intended to affect or
change.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn14' href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Case law similarly holds that courts can compel newsmen to testify where it is
necessary to avoid miscarriage of justice.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn15'
href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The majority should not take to task the respondent for his failure to appear
before the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Ad Hoc Committee</i></b>. His failure to honor its invitation had only
a slight adverse effect on the work of the Committee. It does not justify
imposing on respondent the severe order of contempt of court.</p>

<p class=BODY>The majority, however, holds that the respondent was not cited
for contempt for his non-appearance before the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc Committee</i></b> where he
did not explain his other writings in the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Manila Standar</i></b>d but for his <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>false</i></b>
report on the alleged <span class=SpellE>Hongkong</span> trip of some justices
and his <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

some appellate justices.</p>

<p class=BODY>A close look at the flow and totality, of the proceedings against
respondent will, however, belie the stance of the majority*, In his March 1,
1993 Comment, respondent explained the bases of <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>all</i></b> his reports regarding
corruption inthe judiciary, which among others, assailed Judge <span
class=SpellE>Rosalio</span> de la Rosa, Executive Judge of Manila, <span
class=SpellE>Makati's</span> Magnificent Seven, the Magnificent Seven in the
Supreme Court, the JBC, etc. The majority did not consider this explanation as
immaterial on the ground that a he was not being asked to account for said
reports. On the contrary, the explanation of the respondent was minutely
dissected in the majority opinion, and thereafter, it was condemned as a
&quot;litany of falsehoods.&quot; Indeed, no less than four (4) pages- of the
majority opinion written in single space were devoted to the discussion of
these writings of the respondent.</p>

<p class=BODY>Neither does it materially matter that no summons or subpoena was
issued to the respondent by the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc Committee.</i></b> According to the
majority; only an &quot;invitation&quot; to appear was extended to the
respondent. This thin <span class=SpellE>semantical</span> distinction,
however, cannot deflate the fact that an &quot;invitation&quot; from a
Committee of this Court carries as much compulsion as a summons or a subpoena.
The February 5, 1993 letter of the Chairman of the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Ad Hoc Committee</i></b> to the
respondent tells it all when it stated that said Committee has &quot;...
authority to maintain and enforce order in its proceedings, and to compel
obedience to its processes.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Second</i></b>. The letters of invitation to respondent <span
class=SpellE>misappreciated</span> the proper function of the press. The first
letter, dated February 1, 1993, ordered respondent &quot;to give the Committee
information that will assist it in its task, <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>i.e</i>., to definitely and accurately determine the facts as regards
the ^published rumors and reports of corruption in the judiciary.&quot; The
second letter, dated February 5, 1993, stated, <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>inter <span class=SpellE>alia</span></i></b>
&quot;... we believe you will want to help the Court x <span class=SpellE>x</span>
<span class=SpellE>x</span> by furnishing the Committee with competent
evidence, testimonial or otherwise. Clearly, the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>purging process</i></b> cannot be
accomplished without proof, testimonial or otherwise, as you must no doubt
realize, being yourself a lawyer.&quot; I submit that the press is net an <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>adjunct</i></b>
of the judiciary, any more than is it an <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>annex</i></b> of the two (2) other branches
of government. As the press is <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>not an</i></b> <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>extension of the judiciary</i></b>,
it cannot be used as an investigatory instrument to purge courts of misfits,
especially when the use of the press will compel it to compromise its role as
critic of government. Again, it should be stressed that the judiciary is not without
resources to investigate and reform itself. It can purge its ranks without
compelling the involvement of the press.</p>

where the Court adjudged, newsman <span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Parazo</i></b></span> in contempt
of court for refusing to divulge the source of his story regarding leakage of

class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Parazo</i></b></span> that under R.A. No. 53, he could only be compelled

by the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>interest of the State</i></b>.&quot; <span class=SpellE>Parazo</span>
argued that &quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>interest of the State</i></b>&quot; meant &quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Security of State</i></b>.&quot;
The Court rejected <span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Parazo’s</i></b></span> argument as it held
that the two (2 5 terms are not synonymous^ the first being broader than the
second. It then ruled that the maintenance of high standard of the legal
profession qualifies as an &quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>interest of the State</i></b>&quot; the
promotion of which is a good ground to compel newsmen to break the
confidentiality of their sources of news- The Court ruling did not sit well
with Congress. On June 15, 1956, Congress enacted R.A. No. 1477 which amended
R.A. 53 by changing the phrase &quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>interest of the State</i></b>&quot; to
&quot;<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>security of State</i></b>.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Respondent invoked R.A. No. 53, as amended, as an additional
defense in his favor. The majority opinion, however, shunted aside respondent's
submission as it held that said law does not protect &quot;a journalist who
deliberately prints lies or distorts the truth.&quot; There is no disagreement
that R.A. No. 53, as amended, does not provide immunity against a blatant
falsehood just as the Constitution does not protect a vicious lie. Precisely,
section 1 of the law starts with the categorical caveat &quot;<b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>without
prejudice to his liability under the civil and criminal laws</i></b>, the
publisher, editor, columnist ... cannot be Compelled to reveal the source of
any newspaper report or information ... .&quot;But well to note, the case at
bench is not a libel or a damage suit where we can properly decide, among
others, the kind of falsehood and the proper stage of the proceedings when the
Court could compel a newsman to reveal the source of his information without
violating his freedom of speech and of the press. To my mind, the case at bench
should be and can be resolved by simply determining whether respondent's
columns, given their falsity .and slant, posed a clear and present danger to
our |administration of justice. My humble submission is that the evidence on
record failed to prove this clear and present danger, and hence, there is no
need to task respondent to reveal the sources of his information in order to
prove that his reports about judicial corruption are not patent falsehoods. The
Court should always adopt an approach that is less destructive of freedom of
speech and of the press. I reserve my full view on the <span class=SpellE>longtitude</span>
and latitude of a newsman's right not to reveal the sources of his information
in a more appropriate case.;</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Fourth</i></b>. The majority stubbornly stresses that it gave
respondent an &quot;option&quot; and did not compel him to reveal the sources
of his information. Indeed, he was not compelled but he paid a high price for
not revealing the sources of his information. It was held that he failed to
disprove the falsity and slant of his column, hence, was liable for contempt.</p>

<p class=BODY>My thesis is that the affidavits on the PLDT affair and Atty.
Veto's party may have proved the falsity or slant of respondent's columns. But
mere proof of falsity or slant is not proof that the falsehood or slant was
made knowingly or with reckless disregard of truth, to use <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>the New York Times</i></b> test.
Likewise, proof that respondent did not verify his facts from the PLDT and
travel agency officials and from Atty. Veto is not proof that he did no
verification at all. Indeed, the evidence does not show that Messrs. Samson,
Garcia, and Veto and Mrs. de la Paz wrote to respondent to give him an opportunity
to correct his errors. In the absence of such an opportunity, it is difficult
to impute malice against respondent. Without proof that respondent knowingly or
recklessly disregarded truth, he should not have even been called upon to
disprove the falsity or slant of his columns. He need not have been given the
so-called “option” to reveal or not to reveal the source of his information.</p>

<p class=BODY>There is another aspect of freedom of the press which the
majority failed to consider. The sanctity of a newsman’s source of information
is not only intended to protect a newsman <b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>but also the source of his information</i></b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>. </i>When a person transmits confidential information to a newsman, he
is exercising his freedom of speech on <b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>condition
of anonymity</i></b>. In <b>Talley v. California</b>,<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn17' href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>17</span></span></a> an ordinance which penalized the distribution of
any handbill which did not identify its author was struck down as unconstitutional.
It was held that “<b><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>identification</i></b><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'> </i>and fear of reprisal might deter
perfectly peaceful discussions of public matters of importance.”<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn18' href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>18</span></span></a> It is thus arguable that a newsman by <i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>himself </i>does not have the option to
reveal or not to reveal the identity of his source of information. His source
may have an independent right to the protection of his anonymity in the
exercise of freedom of speech. This issue, however, need not to be resolved in
the case at bench but in a more appropriate setting. Be that as it may, I
bewail the precipitate majority ruling that a newsman has an <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>unqualified
option</i></b> to reveal the confidential source of his information for its
inevitable effect is to discourage people from giving confidential information to
the press. Again, the impairment of the flow of information to the public will
suffer an irreparable harm.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Fifth.</i></b> The majority punishes respondent for publishing “stories
shown to be false x <span class=SpellE>x</span> <span class=SpellE>x</span>
stories that he made no effort whatsoever to verify and which, after being
denounced as lies, he has refused, or is unable to substantiate.” The undue
weight given to the falsity alone of respondent’s columns is unsettling. For
after finding respondent's columns as false, the majority did not go any
further to determine whether these falsehoods constitute a clear and present
danger to the administration of justice. This libertarian test was originally
espoused by Mr. Justice Holmes in <span class=SpellE><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class=BODY>In the case at bench, I cannot perceive how the respondent's
column on the alleged <span class=SpellE>Hongkong</span> trip of some justices
could have brought about the substantive evil of &quot;subverting our orderly
administration of justice. The affidavits of Mr. Samson, First Vice President
of PLDT, of Mr. <span class=SpellE>Ermin</span> Garcia, Jr., President of <span
class=SpellE>Citi</span>-World Travel Mart Corporation, and of Mrs. Marissa de
la Paz, General Manager, of <span class=SpellE>Philway</span> Travel
Corporation merely established the falsity of respondent's report. There is
nothing in the record, however, showing the degree how respondent's false
report degraded the administration of justice. The evidence from which this conclusion
can be deduced is nil. The standing of respondent as a journalist is not shown.
The extent of readership of respondent is not known. His credibility has not
been proved. Indeed, nothing in the record shows that any person lost faith in
our system of justice because of his said report. Even the losing party in G.R.
No. 94374, Eastern Telephone Philippines, Inc., (ETPI) does not appear to have
given any credence to the said false report. I submit that it is not every
falsehood that should incur the Court's ire, lest it runs out of righteous
indignation. Indeed, gross falsehoods, vicious lies, and prevarications of paid
hacks cannot deceive the public any more than can they cause this Court to
crumble. If we adopt the dangerous rule that we should curtail speech to stop
every falsehood we might as well abolish freedom of speech for there is yet to
come a man whose tongue tells only the truth. In any event, we should take
comfort in the thought that falsehoods cannot destroy - only truth does but
only to set us free.</p>

<p class=BODY>In a similar vein, I reject the conclusion that respondent's
report about the birthday party of Atty. Veto attended by some justices and
judges seriously eroded our administration of justice. Again, there is not an
iota of empirical evidence on record to sustain this irrational fear. There is
less reason to punish respondent for contempt for his report on Atty. Veto's
party. Unlike respondent's report about the justices' <span class=SpellE>Hongkong</span>
trip, his report on Atty. Veto's party is not false but only <b><i>slanted</i></b>,
to use the own description of the majority opinion. Also, unlike respondent's
report about the justices' <span class=SpellE>Hongkong</span> trip which was
made while the Court has yet to resolve Eastern Telephone's Motion for Reconsideration
in G.R. No. 94374, his report on Atty. Veto's party does not concern any
pending litigation in this Court. Given these material differences, there is no
way to conclude that respondent's report on Atty. Veto's party degraded our administration
of justice. In citing respondent in contempt for slanting his report on Atty. Veto's
party, the majority betrays its flaccid respect for freedom of, speech and of
the press. Respondent is a columnist and he does not only write straight news
reports but interprets events from his own distinct prism of perception. As a
columnist and like any other columnist, he has his own predilections and
prejudices and he bends his views in accord with his own slant of faith. I see
no reason to penalize respondent for the slants in his views, however,
unpleasant and irreverent they may, be to the court. When we start punishing a
columnist for slants in his views, we shall soon be seeking slits to look for
witches among them.</p>

<p class=BODY>Ironically, the majority cites in support of its non-too-liberal
stance the cases of <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:

exercise of freedom of speech and of the&quot; press. To be entitled to
damages, the public official concerned was imposed a very difficult, if not impossible,
burden of proof. He was required to prove that the defamatory statement was not
only false but was made with actual malice.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn26'
href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garisson</i></b></span>
did not only reiterate but even extended the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New York Times</i></b> rule to
apply to criminal cases. Mr. Garrison, a District Attorney of Orleans Parish
Louisiana was convicted of <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>criminal defamation</i></b> under the
Louisiana Criminal Defamation Statute. In a press conference, he assailed eight
(8) judges for their inefficiency, laziness, excessive vacations, and for refusing
to authorize disbursements to cover the expenses of undercover investigations
of vice in New Orleans. Impugning their <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>motives</i></b> he said: &quot;... This raises
interesting questions about the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>racketeer influences</i></b> on our eight
vacation-minded judges.” The Louisiana State-courts rejected <span
class=SpellE>Garisson's</span> defense anchored on freedom of speech. In
reversing the Supreme Court of Louisiana, the United States Federal Supreme
Court, thru Mr. Justice Brennan, held that the “<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New York Times</i></b> rule under
which the constitutional guaranty of free speech limits state power in a <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>civil
action</i></b> brought by a public official for criticism of his official
conduct, to an award of damages for a <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>false statement</i></b> made with actual
malice, that is, with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of
whether it was false or not, likewise limits state power to impose <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>criminal
sanctions</i></b> for criticism of the official conduct of public
officials.&quot; It struck down as unconstitutional the Louisiana -statute'
which permitted punishment of <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>false statements</i></b> made with ill will,
<b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>even
though they are not made with knowledge of their falsity or in reckless disregard
of whether they are true or not</i></b>. It further held that lack of
reasonable belief in the truth of the statements is not the equivalent of
reckless disregard of truth. To quote exactly the ruling: &quot;... Even where
the utterance is <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>false</i></b>, the great principles of the Constitution which secure
freedom of expression in this area preclude attaching adverse consequences to
any except the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>knowing or reckless falsehood</i></b> ... . The public official rule
protects the paramount public interest in a free flow of information to the
people concerning public-officials, their servants. To this end, anything which
might touch on* an official's fitness for office is relevant. Few personal
attributes are more germane to fitness for office than dishonesty, malfeasance,
or improper motivation . . . .&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>The majority opinion in the case at bench certainly did not
follow the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>New York Times </i></b>rule which was reiterated and even expanded in <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Garrison</i></b>.
The majority halted after finding that the respondent's columns are false or
slanted. As <span class=SpellE>aforestated</span>, the affidavits of Messrs.
Samson, Garcia, Jr., and Veto and Mrs. de la Paz merely condemned as false
respondent's report but did not prove that respondent wrote his report with
knowing or reckless disregard of truth. Yet, the majority was satisfied that
this was enough evidence to punish respondent for contempt. It ruled:
&quot;That categorical denial logically and justly placed on <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> the burden of proving the truth of his grave
accusation, or showing that it had been made through some honest mistake or
error committed despite good faith efforts to arrive at the truth, or if unable
to do either of these things, to offer to atone for the harm caused.&quot; The
shift in the burden of proving reckless disregard of truth to respondent <span
class=SpellE>Jurado</span> patently violates the <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>New York Times</i></b> rule. <b
style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>The
New York Times</i></b> rule fixed this burden of proof on complainants against
newsmen. If the New York Times rule has any value to freedom of speech and of
the press, it is because it made the burden of proof in this kind of cases
extremely difficult to discharge on the part of a complainant against a
newsman. In contrast, the majority opinion made it too easy in favor of a
complainant.</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Sixth</i></b>. The majority opinion also failed to consider that the
columns of respondent dealt with the sensitive subject of corruption in courts.
It cannot be gainsaid that corruption in government is a matter of highest
concern to our citizenry. Yet it is a problem that defies solution primarily
because it is a subject where people in the know maintain the countenance of a
clam. Thus, the prosecution of corruption in government has not hit a high note
and what now appeals as the most effective restraint against corruption in
government is the fear of the light of print. If the light of print continues
to be a strong deterrent against government misdeeds, it is mainly because
newsmen have an unimpeded access to information. On many an occasion, these
confidential sources of information are the only leads to government
malfeasance. To fashion a rule derogatory of the confidentiality of newsmen's
sources will result in tremendous loss in the flow of this rare and valuable
information to the press and will prejudice the State's policy to eliminate corruption
in government. In the absence of clear and convincing evidence that respondent
knowingly foisted a falsehood to degrade our administration of justice, we
should be slow in citing him for contempt. The <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal'>New York Times</b> rule correctly warned us that occasional erroneous statements
are “inevitable in free debate ... and must be protected if the freedoms of
expression are to have the ‘breathing space’ that they ‘need to survive.’ ”</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Seventh</i></b>. I appreciate the genuine concern of the majority
against certain abuses committed by some members of the press. Be that as it may,
the abuses of some newsmen cannot justify an overarching rule eroding the
freedom of all of them. Indeed, the framers of the Constitution knew that these
abuses will be committed by some newsmen but still, they explicitly crafted
section 4, Article III of the Constitution to read: “[N]o law shall be passed
abridging the freedom of speech, of expression, or of the press .… ”Madison
stressed that “some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of
everything, and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press.”<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn28' href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>28</span></span></a> There is an appropriate remedy against abusive
newsmen. I submit, however, that the remedy is not to be too quick in wielding
the power of contempt for that will certainly chain the hands of many newsmen.
Abusive newsmen are bad but laundered news is worse.</p>

<p class=BODY><b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>Eighth</i></b>. Again, with due respect, I submit that the majority <span
class=SpellE>misappreciates</span> the role of the press as a critic of
government in a democratic society. The Constitution did not conceive the press
to act as a critic of government in a democratic society. The Constitution did
not conceive the press to act as the cheer leader of government, including the
judiciary. Rather, the press is the agent<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn29'
href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>29</span></span></a> of the
people when it gathers news, especially news derogatory to those who hold the reins
of government. The agency is necessary because the people must have all
available information before they exercise their sovereign judgment. As well
observed: &quot;The newspapers, magazines, and other journals of the country,
it is safe to say, have shed and continue to shed, more light, on the public
and business affairs of the nation than any other instrument of publicity; and
since informed public opinion is the most potent of all restraints upon misgovernment
the suppression or abridgement of the publicity afforded by a free press cannot
be regarded otherwise than with grave concern.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn30' href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>30</span></span></a> As <b style='mso-bidi-font-weight:normal'><i
style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>agent of the people</i></b>, the most
important function of the press in a free society is to inform and it cannot
inform if it is uninformed. We should be wary when the independent sources
of<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>information of the press dry up, for
then the press will end up printing &quot;praise&quot; releases and that is no
way for the people to know the truth.</p>

<p class=BODY>In sum, I submit that the equation chosen by the majority has the
pernicious effects of hobbling the writing hand of newsmen and of chilling the
sources of information of the press. The majority can snicker against &quot;bleeding
heart&quot; liberalism but this is a vain attempt to use a fig leaf to conceal
its niggardly regard for freedom of speech and of the press. In. a large measure,
I fear that the majority opinion will weaken the press as an informed and
informative source of information of the sovereign people. In so doing, if will
unwittingly erode the people's right to discover the truth. The protection we give
to the sanctity of the sources of information of the press is for the benefit
of the people. It is designed to benefit all of us, to keep us above the cloud
of ignorance. Democracy cannot bloom where sovereignty is rooted on the top
soil of an ignorant mass.</p>
