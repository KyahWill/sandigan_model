				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which set
aside the Labor Arbiter's decision dismissing the complaint and instead entered
a new decision ordering the complainant's reinstatement with full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> from the date of his termination until his actual
reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts as found by the Labor Arbiter and reiterated
in the NLRC decision are undisputed:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Complainant <span class="SpellE">Bobadilla</span> started his
employment with respondent company sometime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">in </span>May 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
undergoing training, in September, 1982, complainant was designated
professional medical representative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(PMR)
</span>and was assigned to cover the sales territory comprising of Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span> and a part of <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span>, of the Metro Manila district.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In connection with the respondent company's
marketing and sales operations, it has been its policy and established practice
of undertaking employment movements and/or reassignments from one territorial
area to another as the exigencies of its operations require and to hire only
applicant salesmen, including professional medical representatives (<span class="SpellE">PMRs</span>) who are willing to take provincial assignments, at
least insofar as male applicants were concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, respondent company had made
reassignments or transfers of sales personnel, which included <span class="SpellE">PMRs</span>, from one territorial area of responsibility to
another on a more or less regular basis.</p>

<p class="2Q">"In complainant's application for employment with respondent
company, he agreed to the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1)
that if employed, he will accept assignment in the provinces and/or cities
anywhere in the Philippines; 2) he is willing and can move into and live in the
territory assigned to him; and 3) that should any answer or statement in his
application for employment be found false or incorrect, he will be subject to
immediate dismissal, if then employed.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="7">22 July 1983</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Victa</span> called complainant to his office and
informed the latter that he was being transferred effective <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="8">1 August 1983</st1:date> to the newly opened <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> territory comprising the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The transfer order was made formal in a memorandum
dated <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="7">29 July 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among the reasons given for complainant's
selection as PMR for the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> <span class="GramE">territory
were</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>â€˜The territory required a
veteran and seasoned PMR who can operate immediately with minimum training and
supervision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Likewise,
a PMR who can immediately exploit the vast business potential of the area.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">"In a letter dated 1 August 1983, which was received by Abbott
on 4 August 1983, complainant, thru his lawyer, objected to the transfer on the
grounds that it was not only a demotion but also personal and punitive in
nature without basis legally and factually.</p>

<p class="2Q">"On <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="8">8 August 1983</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Victa</span> issued another inter-office correspondence to
complainant, giving the latter up to <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="8">15
 August 1983</st1:date> within which to comply with the transfer order,
otherwise his name would be dropped from the payroll for having abandoned his
job.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When complainant failed to report
to his new assignment, Abbott assigned thereat <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>
Antonio T. <span class="SpellE">Tibi</span>, another PED PMR who was <span class="SpellE">priorly</span> covering the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Meanwhile, complainant filed applications for vacation leave
from 2 to <st1:date year="1983" day="9" month="8">9 August 1983</st1:date>, and
then from 10 to <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="8">13 August 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="8">18 August 1983</st1:date>, he filed the present complaint.</p>

<p class="2Q">"After due consideration of the evidence adduced by the
parties, the Arbiter below ruled for the respondent on the ground that the
complainant is guilty of gross insubordination." (pp. 17-19, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>; pp. 1-3, NLRC decision)</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the respondent National Labor Relations Commission
reversed the Arbiter's decision and held that herein petitioners had no <span class="GramE">valid</span> and justifiable reason to dismiss the
complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The National Labor
Relations Commission ordered the latter's reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration subsequently filed by the
petitioners was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1986</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed their second motion for reconsideration which was not
favorably acted upon by respondent National Labor Relations Commission as the
record of the case had already been transmitted to the labor arbiter for the
execution of its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1986</st1:date>,
the petitioners and the private respondent agreed before the labor arbiter that
the former would bring the case before this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners assigned as errors the following:</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>[R]<span class="SpellE">espondent</span> NLRC
acted in excess of jurisdiction and/or grave abuse of discretion in that --</p>

<p class="2Q">a] <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Respondent NLRC

private respondent's prior consent was necessary for the validity of his
transfer, rendering his consequent dismissal for insubordination illegal.</p>

<span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that prior consent of an employee is
required for the validity of his transfer to another territory, private
respondent had explicitly given such prior consent as a condition for his
hiring and continued employment by petitioner Abbott.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">c] <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Respondent</span>
NLRC abused its discretion when it declared private respondent's dismissal
illegal despite his clear and <span class="SpellE">wilfull</span>
insubordination." <span class="GramE">(pp. 7, 10 and 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">When asked to comment on the petition as counsel for NLRC, the
Solicitor General, assisted by Assistant Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Zoilo</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Andin</span> and Trial Attorney Alexander Q. <span class="SpellE">Gesmundo</span>, agreed with the petitioners' stand that the
dismissal of the private respondent from his employment was for valid reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not Albert <span class="SpellE">Bobadilla</span> could be validly dismissed from his employment on
the ground of insubordination for refusing to accept his new assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are constrained to answer in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">The hiring, firing, transfer, demotion, and promotion of employees
has been traditionally identified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as a </span>management
prerogative subject to limitations found in law, a collective bargaining
agreement, or general principles of fair play and justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a function associated with the
employer's inherent right to control and manage effectively its
enterprise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even as the law is
solicitous of the welfare of employees, it must also protect the right of an
employer to exercise what are clearly management prerogatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The free will of management <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>conduct its own business affairs to
achieve its purpose cannot be denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(See <span class="SpellE">Dangan</span> v. National Labor Relations
Commission, 127 SCRA 706).</p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, the right to transfer or reassign an employee
is recognized as an employer's exclusive right and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the </span>prerogative of management.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Labor Arbiter's conclusions that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Settled is the rule in this regard that an employer, except
when limited by special laws, has the right to regulate, according to his own
discretion and judgment, all aspects of employment, which includes, among
others, hiring, work assignments, place and manner of work, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">working</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <u>regulations</u> <u>and</u> <u>transfer</u> </span><u>of</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">employees</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>in accordance with his operational demands and
requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This right flows from
ownership and from the established rule that labor law does not authorize the
substitution of judgment of the employer in the conduct of his business, unless
it is shown to be contrary to law, morals or public policy (NLU v. Insular-<span class="SpellE">Yebana</span> Tobacco Corp., 2 SCRA 924, 931; and Republic Savings
Bank v. Court of Industrial Relations, 21 SCRA 226, 235).</p>

<p class="2Q">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Abbott, in accordance with the demands and requirements of its marketing and
sales operations, adopted a policy to hire only sales applicants who are
willing to accept assignments in the provinces anywhere in the Philippines, and
to move into and live in the territory assigned to them.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The existence and implementation of this policy are clearly
discernible from the questions appearing in the application form under the
heading:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'TO BE FILLED BY SALES
APPLICANTS ONLY,' and the fact that Abbott, depending upon the needs of its
marketing and sales operations, periodically made transfers or reassignments of
its sales people.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Complainant was precisely hired because he manifested at the
outset as a job applicant his willingness to follow the conditions of his
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In line with the policy, as
practiced, Abbot, thru Jaime <span class="SpellE">Victa</span>, issued an
inter-office correspondence transfer<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">ri</span>ng
complainant to a newly opened sales territory - the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
Region, comprising the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According
to respondents, complainant was selected as PMR for the region primarily
because he was a veteran and seasoned PMR who can operate immediately with
minimum training and supervision.</p>

<p class="2Q">"That complainant is a veteran and seasoned PMR is
admitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it is even conceded
by respondents that complainant was the leader of his peers in PED, as
indicated in the letter dated <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="12">20
 December 1982</st1:date> of Jaime <span class="SpellE">Victa</span> to
complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> Region is relatively inaccessible cannot be <span class="GramE">debated<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That</span> the
territory needed a responsible PMR who could work under the least supervision
is a judgment of respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And that
this judgment was arrived at upon consultations among the PED Marketing Manager
Jaime <span class="SpellE">Victa</span>, the Director for Administration
Francisco Lim, and the General Manager A. C. Bout, has been proven by
respondents.</p>

<p class="2Q">"It appearing, therefore, that the order to transfer
complainant is based upon a judgment of his employer Abbott, which judgment to
transfer is in line with a company practice which is not contrary to law,
morals or public policy, hence, beyond the competence of this office to question,
the refusal of complainant to obey the lawful order of Abbott is gross insubordination
- a valid cause for dismissal.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Complainant asserted that the true reason for his transfer
was the personal ill motives on the part of respondent <span class="SpellE">Victa</span>
who resented the derogatory remarks attributed to him, as purportedly shown in <span class="SpellE">Victa's</span> memoranda dated <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="12">20 December 1982</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="4">26 April 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, a cursory reading of said memoranda in question will show that
the same were legitimately issued by <span class="SpellE">Victa</span> in the
exercise of his functions as PED Manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the fact that complainant never lifted a finger <span class="GramE">to</span>
formally question said memoranda is a mute admission on his part that the
allegations therein are true.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Complainant also alleged that his transfer was a
demotion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, no explanation was
given much less any evidence presented in support of the allegation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is clear that there was
no change in complainant's position and salary, privileges and benefits he was
receiving while in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the sales commission, Abbott
claimed that had complainant accepted the assignment, he could have earned more
because the sales prospects in the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Territory</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
which comprises <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> and <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Province</span></st1:placetype></st1:place>
were much higher than the territory assigned to him in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the assignment offered an important
avenue for future promotion, respondent concluded." <span class="GramE">(pp.
6-9, Labor Arbiter's decision).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, <span class="SpellE">Bobadilla</span> had no valid
reason to disobey the order of transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had tacitly given his consent thereto when he acceded to the
petitioners' policy of hiring sales staff who are willing to be assigned
anywhere in the Philippines which is demanded by the petitioners' business.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the very nature of his employment, a drug salesman or medical
representative is expected to travel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
should anticipate reassignment according to the demands of their business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be a poor drug corporation which
cannot even assign its representatives or detail men to new markets calling for
opening or expansion or to areas where the need for pushing its products is great.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">More so if such
reassignments are part of the employment contract.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The questioned decision of the National Labor
Relations Commission <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">is </span>SET
ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Labor Arbiter
