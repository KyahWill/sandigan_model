imprecise statement of relevant principle insofar as concerns this Court's

alleged shortage for which <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> was tried and
convicted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The record discloses
compelling documentary and other evidence that no shortage was ever incurred by
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> in his accounts as acting postmaster and that
instead, the imputed shortage was a fiction grown out </span>of an auditor's
error in the conduct of the initial audit of September 22, 1958; a fiction,
moreover, thereafter perpetuated by <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>' bumbling
but well-meaning attempts to "erase" said "shortage" by
making equally fictitious entries in his books and covering the alleged short
amount with borrowed funds.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Roxas</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> testified that he lacked not only experience
but also knowledge of accounting procedures, both necessary for the job, and
that he also had to contend with a very heavy work load; that, as acting
postmaster, he had to perform such disparate and multifarious tasks as
janitorial work, receiving and releasing mail, selling stamps, <span class="SpellE">encashing</span> money orders </span>and telegraphic transfers,
among others, without anyone to assist him (and these, it must be remembered,
in an office serving a population of 4,000); that working under such conditions
confused his mind and caused him to lapse into errors and inaccuracies in
making entries in his books; that after having been found with
"excess" cash of more than P400.00 in the audit of September 22,
1958, and having followed the advice or instructions of the examining auditor
to enter the amount as proceeds from sales of stamps which he (<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>) had speculated to be the source of said amount, his
accounts would no longer balance, showing a discrepancy of more than P400.00;
that in his confused state of mind, he tried to cover the missing amount by
putting in his safe an equivalent sum which he borrowed from a cousin; that he
discovered the discrepancy had been due to those false entries when <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>verification of his records of
collections and payments by the office of the Chief Accountant of the Bureau of
Posts showed an overage of P446.40 <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>of
September 30, 1958; that he collected his salaries for the period January to
April, 1959 by drawing from his collections and issuing reimbursement expense
receipts <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>; and that when he received treasury
warrants to cover his salaries for the same period, instead of redeeming the
reimbursement expense receipts with the proceeds thereof, he used said proceeds
to pay off the loan with which he had sought to balance his accounts and erase
the discrepancy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">resulting from the
entries of fictitious stamp </span>sales.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Unstated, but implicit, in this testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>' </span>conviction that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>doing nothing illegal or criminal
in thus using the proceeds of those treasury warrants because he had in his
possession at the time cash, for which he was not accountable to the Government
since it represented private funds borrowed to cover <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
20.0pt">a </span>non-existent shortage, sufficient to redeem the reimbursement
expense receipts he had issued.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Beyond what may be
inferred from the contents and tenor of such documents as the examination

aforesaid </span>testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are,
on the other hand, strong and persuasive proofs supportive of his version of
the case thus advanced and, particularly, of his claim that there had never
been a shortage in his accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of
these is the finding of the Chief Accountant of the Bureau of Posts already
referred to, contained in said official's letter of October 23, 1958 to the
Post Office Inspector,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
that <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>' accounts as of September 30, 1958 showed
an overage of P446.20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is assumed,
as it must be, that said official in making that finding had examined and taken
into account the cash book<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
and its contents, which at that time already carried the entries of fictitious
stamp sales allegedly made on the advice of the auditor Vicente <span class="SpellE">Moncada</span>, then the effect of such evidence is to discredit
the audit conducted by the latter who supposedly found excess cash in the
keeping of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Had there be any such excess, it would have been accounted for by the
false entries, and the Chief Accountant would have found that <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>' accounts balanced instead of showing an overage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And clearly, <span class="SpellE">Moncada</span>,
the auditor had too hastily accepted <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>'
explanation for the alleged excess cash.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For while he disclaimed having instructed <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
to record stamp sales to cover such excess in just the manner recounted by the
latter, he did declare 'that he told <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

it "*** (a)s stamp sales *** in the record of collections;" and he

unsold balance of P8,880.52; but he had actually turned over to <span class="SpellE">Ilogon</span> stamps worth P9,464.17, or</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P583.65'
worth of stamps more than he was accountable for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From such fact the decision makes the logical
conclusion that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"*** This overage (of P583.65) cannot be explained except that
it represents the fictitious sales of stamps which respondent posted in his
books <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>requested by the audit

irregularity could be traced to the previous posting by respondent of
fictitious stamp sales to account for the 'overage' which the audit examiners
allegedly found in his accounts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the correct picture came out, there was in fact no overage, and so the
fictitious stamp sales which respondent posted to account for the 'overage'
caused his books of account to reflect a 'shortage' representing the fictitious
amount posted </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">stamp sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a result the government gained and the respondent, in his bid to

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Said finding - that when
he was relieved of his post after the audit of May 20, 1959, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> turned over to his successor stamps worth P583.65
more than he was accountable for - has not been <span class="SpellE">disproven</span>
or shown to be false.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since, therefore,
it merits </span>acceptance as the truth, it is fatal to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">prosecution's claim of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">shortage, posing as it does, the unanswerable question of how an official
</span>who turns in P583.65 more than he has to account for can still be
charged with a shortage of the much lesser amount of P451.20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also confirmative of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>' explanation of how it happened that a probably
erroneous tally of "excess" cash in the audit of <st1:date year="1958" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1958</st1:date> became transformed into a
shortage in the examination of <st1:date year="1959" day="30" month="5">May 30,
 1959</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:24.0pt">If </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the auditor who had confronted <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> with the supposed shortage in that final audit had
had the patience to hear him out and examine for himself the latter's Official
Cash Book,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> he could not have failed to notice that the
alleged false entries of stamp sales are indeed conspicuously incongruous and
unusual when compared with the other entries whose genuineness is not in
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the alleged false </span>entries,
the figures recorded for the dates of September 22, 23, 24, 25 and 26, 1958
read, respectively, P104.00, P100.00, P80.00, P50.94 and P146.00, for a total
of P480.94<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
That 5-day total is considerably more than the P308.50 representing total sales
for the rest of the 21 working days of the same month and during which daily
stamp sales averaged less than P14.70.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, an examination of the record of all the other stamp sales
during the entire tenure of <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> from June 11, 1958
to May 30, 1959 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">shows that daily stamp
sales were, for the most part, in the range of from P15.00 to P35.00, with very
few beyond that range.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The single
largest entry for one </span>day's sales is P95.00<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
and the smallest is P5.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Against such
a background, a group of entries which shows sales of more than P100.00 daily
for three days within a space of five consecutive days and P80.00 and P50.74
for the remaining two days sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot but invite suspicion that it is, as
the defense claims, a spurious record made up to account for an auditor's
unverified finding of excess cash the source of which could not at the time be
clearly explained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As the Court sees it, the
foregoing is persuasive evidence which cuts the ground from under the case for
the prosecution, considering that said case must, at a minimum, postulate and
prove the existence of a shortage in the funds or property for which petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> had to give account to the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where there is evidence the clear intendment
of which negates such a shortage, it will simply not suffice to rely on the
statutory prescription that the failure of an accountable public officer to
have duly forthcoming public funds or property with which he is chargeable </span>upon
demand of a duly authorized officer is <u>prima</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

existence of a shortage; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">if </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">none </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">exists, </span>it
does not operate, and if there is evidence against the existence of an alleged
shortage, it must be met and refuted, shown to be unreliable or untrustworthy,
before the presumption may be invoked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This the prosecution has not done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has not impugned the intrinsic worth and credibility of the findings
of the Commissioner of Civil Service in deciding the administrative case filed
against <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, although it correctly asserted that
said decision did not operate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

consideration altogether not affecting the merits of the findings therein as

stamps of a value of P583.65 more than he was accountable for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution has offered nothing to offset
the proof implicit in the entries in <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>' official
cash book supporting and confirming said petitioner's claim that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
