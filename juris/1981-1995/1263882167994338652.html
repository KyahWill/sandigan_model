				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">On appeal is the decision of the Regional Trial Court, Third Judicial Region, Branch 12, Malolos, Bulacan finding the accused Fernando Miscala y Magtanong, Jr., <i>alias</i> "Boy Gapo" guilty of the crime of rape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>The dispositive portion of the decision is quoted as follows:<br><blockquote>WHEREFORE, finding herein accused guilty of the crime of rape as charged in the information beyond reasonable doubt, there being no circumstances attending the commission thereof that should mitigate the penalty provided for by law, the Court sen­tences him to suffer the afflictive penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and to indemnify the complainant or offended party and her family in the amount of Twenty Thousand Pesos (P20,000.00) by way of moral damages caused them by reason of the crime, upon which amount the filing fees for such civil action shall constitute a first lien as provided in Section 1, Rule III of the Rules of Court.<br><br>In the service of his sentence the accused shall be credited with the full time during which he has undergone preventive imprisonment which began on October 24, 1988, as shown from his written voluntary agreement to abide by the same disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted person, attached to the records, pursuant to Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code.<br><br>Let the accused, his counsel, the complainant or her natural guardian and the Asst. Provincial Prosecutor be furnished with copies of this decision upon its promulgation.<br><br>Costs <i>de oficio.</i><br><br>SO ORDERED.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></blockquote>This case commenced with an information filed by Asst. Provincial Fiscal Edsel M. Rutor based on a complaint filed by the offended party, Visitacion E. Pineda, accompanied by her "<i>tiyahin</i>" Lilibeth S. Escuto, in which Fernando Miscala y Magtanong, Jr., <i>alias</i> "Boy Gapo," was accused of the crime of rape, penalized under the provisions of Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, committed as follows:<br><blockquote>That on or about the 21<sup>st</sup> day of October 1988, in the municipality of San Jose del Monte, province of Bulacan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously, by means of force and intimidation, with lewd designs, have carnal knowledge of the offended party Visitacion E. Pineda, a 10 year old girl, against her will and without her consent.<br><br>Contrary to law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></blockquote>Arraigned on December 9, 1988, the accused pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The trial court in concluding that the accused-appellant was guilty of raping the complainant states, thus:<br><blockquote>x x x [t]he Court so holds that accused is undoubtedly the man who could have committed the crime alleged in the information.&nbsp; The young victim points to him and says that he was her ravisher.&nbsp; She was firm then as she is firm now in branding him as her rapist.&nbsp; Immediately after going through that painful experience at her tender age and accused had left with his wanton lust satisfied, the poor child instinctively called out for her uncle in the adjacent room and in childlike honesty told him that accused they called "Boy Gapo” had just entered her room and molested her.&nbsp; Her uncle confirms such statement from the girl which, of course, is evidence against the accused commanding strong probative value as part of the res gestae (Sec. 42, Rule 128, Rules of Court.)<br><br>The accused thru his witnesses despera­tely tried to shift suspicion on somebody else, the brother-in-law of victim's uncle.&nbsp; Such attempt cannot overcome the direct and categorical accusation of victim herself that it was accused, and no one else, who raped her.&nbsp; She has not shown all throughout any indication that she could have been mistaken in identifying her tormentor.&nbsp; In fact she recognized him during the commission of the act inside her room, because the fluorescent light therein was on throughout the night.&nbsp; (TSN, p. 7, January 11, 1989; p. 6, January 18, 1989).&nbsp; And there appears no reason, as admitted by accused himself, why complainant should point her accusing finger at him, if, indeed, he was not the culprit but somebody else, unless he was in fact that culprit.&nbsp; In a similar case the Supreme Court finds that a 13-year old girl cannot possibly have an ulterior motive to charge appellant with rape (<i>People vs. Daniel</i>, 86 SCRA 511).&nbsp; Neither can the 10-year old victim in this case have any against the accused under the facts and circumstances established.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></blockquote>In his appeal, the accused-appellant submitted the following assignment of errors:<br><blockquote><center>ASSIGNMENT OF ERRORS<br></center><br><ol type="I"><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT HOLDS THAT THE <i>ACCUSED</i> IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE MAN WHO COULD HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME ALLEGED IN THE INFORMATION;<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THERE WAS "A DIRECT AND CATEGORICAL ACCUSATION OF THE VICTIM HERSELF THAT IT WAS THE ACCUSED, AND NO ONE ELSE WHO RAPED HER";<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT CONSIDERED THE DEFENSE OF THE ACCUSED OF ALIBI AS WEAK;<br><br></li><li>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED WHEN IT FAILED TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE PROBATIVE VALUE OF THE ENTRY IN THE <i>BARANGAY</i> BLOTTER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></li></ol></blockquote>Thus, the foregoing errors raised by the accused-appellant relate to the crucial and singular issue of whether or not the prosecution has presented sufficient proof to overturn the constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of the accused-appellant and thereby establish his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br>We believe so.&nbsp; Hence, we rule to deny the appeal.<br><br>Evidence on record proves beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant is the victim of rape and that the accused-appellant is the culprit.<br><br>Article 335 provides:<br><blockquote>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x x x<br><br><i>When and how rape is committed</i> — Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under any of the following circumstances:<br><br>1.&nbsp; By using force or intimidation;<br><br>2.&nbsp; When the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious; and<br><br>3.&nbsp; When the woman is under twelve years of age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned in the next two preceding paragraphs shall, be present.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied).<br><br>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

x x x</blockquote>The medical examination reports prepared immediately after the alleged incident contained findings of healing laceration and swelling of the private genitals of the 10-year old complainant and the presence of sperm cells therein.&nbsp; Undoubtedly, she had been subjected to sexual intercourse.<br><br>The prosecution, without contesting the fact that rape had been committed, would like to convince this Court that the trial court convicted the wrong person and that the rapist could possibly be somebody else.<br><br>During the trial, accused-appellant Miscala testified as follows:<br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="5%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="95%">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
