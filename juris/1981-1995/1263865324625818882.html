				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Philippine Veterans Bank was created in 1963 with the hope
that it would ensure the economic future and perhaps even prosperity of the
hundreds of thousands of war veterans who were to be its stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a while the vision grew, but in time it
dimmed and finally faded as the Bank found itself enmeshed in financial
difficulties that <span style="">threatened its very
survival.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now the dream <span style="">is in </span>tatters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Efforts are at present being taken to piece
together its severed sinews but it is doubtful if the Bank will ever be whole </span><span style="">again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">The trouble began when on <st1:date year="1983" day="10" month="4">April
 10, <span class="GramE">1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> the
Bank was placed under receivership by virtue of Resolution No. 334 of the
Monetary Board of the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason <span style="">was </span>the precarious
condition of the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span><span style="">year </span>later,
on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1984</st1:date>, the
Philippine Veterans Bank Employees Union questioned the retrenchment and
reorganization program of the Bank and, on the ground of security of tenure,
prayed that the said program be prohibited.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In its petition, which was docketed <span style="">as </span>G.R. No. 67125, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
also asked for a temporary restraining order, which we issued on <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="5"><span style="">May </span><span style="">9, </span>1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, while the case was pending, the
Monetary Board ordered the liquidation of the Bank by Resolution No. 612 dated <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="6">June 7, 1985</st1:date>, after finding that the
Bank had incurred an outstanding liability of P540<span class="GramE">,835,860.79</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This order <span style="">was </span>opposed by the <st1:place>Union</st1:place> in a
supplemental petition for prohiÂ­bition with preliminary injunction filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1985</st1:date>, the Veterans Federation of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
entered the picture and filed with leave of court a petition in intervention
which, besides echoing the original petition in opposing the liquidation,
asserted the additional claim that it was in the process of formulating plans
for the rehabilitation and eventual expansion of the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed by an ancillary petition
for the immediate payment of the wage <span style="">or
</span>salary increase ordered by the NLRC in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="3">March
 26, 1987</st1:date>, <span style="">a </span>writ of preliminary injunction was <span style="">issued </span>by this Court reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>NOW THEREFORE, effective immediately and until further orders from
this Court, you (Respondent Central Bank of the Philippines, and PVB Liquidator),
your agents, representatives, and/or any person or persons acting upon your
orders or in your place or stead, are hereby ENJOINED from liquidating the
Phil. Veterans Bank and from taking or pursuing any act or transaction in
pursuance of such liquidation, including sales or other disposal of properties
of whatever kind, or disbursing PVB funds, except those incurred in the course
of ordinary administration of the affairs of the bank, including payment of
accrued and <span style="">unpaid claims of PVB
Employees under the 1982-1985 CBA, all of which should be subject to the prior
approval of the respondent liquidation court.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1988</st1:date>,
an original petition for restitution and for extraordinary and equitable writs
was filed by Simeon <span class="SpellE">Medalla</span> <u>et</u> <u>al</u>. in
their own right and "on behalf of the remaining 510,000 World War II
veterans or their heirs." It sought <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
<span style="">a </span>judicial declaration that the
petitioners were entitled to the ownership, possession and control of the Bank
and an order restraining the Central Bank from disposing of the assets of the
Bank or making any disbursements <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> except for
ordinary administrative expenses and for the payment of accrued wages and other
benefits of personnel as approved by the liquidator court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition was docketed as G.R. No. 82337
and consolidated with G.R. No. 67125.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, on <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="6">June 11,
 1987</st1:date>, then Judge <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Dayrit</span> of the Regional Trial Court of Manila had ordered
the payment of the claims of the employees amounting to P37<span class="GramE">,920,310.82</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was followed on October 21, 1988, by
another order issued by the same court for the payment of retirement benefits
to two former board members of the Bank, namely, Agustin Marking and Jaime S.
Mejia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the representations of the
petitioners, however, we prevented enforcement <span style="">or </span>this order with our temporary restraining order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="12">December 15, 1988</st1:date>,
the writ of preliminary injunction dated <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1987</st1:date>, was amended "to exclude from its
coverage the sale or disposal by the Central Bank or the Bank Liquidator of the
acquired assets of the PVB." This was done in response to petitions filed
by several persons seeking to redeem or repurchase the properties which had
earlier been purchased by the Bank through foreclosure sales.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1989</st1:date>,
another ancillary petition was filed for the immediate payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of the Bank personnel on the regular payroll <span style="">as </span>of June
1985 equivalent to five monthsâ gross salary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1990</st1:date>, the
City Government of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> filed a motion to lift the
preliminary injunction dated <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="3">March 26,
 1987</st1:date>, with respect to its deposit of P3<span class="GramE">,700,000</span>,
which it wanted to withdraw to finance several programs and projects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And on <st1:date year="1990" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1990</st1:date>, Dolores V. Molina filed her own motion to
withdraw her deposit of P1<span class="GramE">,100,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has purposely delayed resolution of these cases in the
hope that it would not be necessary to do so in view of the efforts being taken
by the Executive Department for the rehabilitation of the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The agency in charge of this matter is the
Special Presidential Committee on the Philippine Veterans Bank, which was
created by Adm. Order No. 29 dated July 10, 1987, and renewed by Adm. Order No.
62 dated February 23, 1988 and by Adm. Order No. 90 dated September 2, 1988, to
study the financial condition of the Bank and determine the feasibility of its
rehabilitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, although we may
assume that the Committee has been assiduously pursuing its objectives and
while there are optimistic statements every now and then that the Bank will be
reopening soon, that prospect does not really seem to be in sight yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have therefore decided to finally resolve
these cases, applying <span style="">a </span>judicial solution which, when all is said and done, will still
be less acceptable than a practical administrative settlement.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue in these petitions is whether the Central Bank
has the power to liquidate the Philippine Veterans Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners dispute this authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. 67125, they claim that as the
Bank was created by a special <span style="">law, a </span>contractual relationship now exists
between the Government and the stockholders of the Bank that cannot be
disturbed without violation of the impairment clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance of the benefits of that law by
the petitioners had conferred a vested right on them that cannot now be
withdrawn without their consent as this would <span class="SpellE">consitute</span>
a deprivation of their property without due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that such benefits could be validly
revoked, this cannot be done by the Central Bank only but by the legislature
itself which conferred the franchise on the Bank in the first place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Central Bank cannot exercise
any authority over the Bank because the latter is itself also a government bank
with the same status as the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the Land Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
and the Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Central Bank has no control over these government lending institutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the position of the respondents that these arguments
are not well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that the Bank was created by special law does not
confer upon it extraordinary privileges over and above those granted similar
charters like the Development Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and the Land Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a lending institution, it is part of the
banking system and therefore covered by the regulatory power exercised over
such entities by the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
authority is expressly provided for in the Central Bank Act, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 25.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Creation of the appropriate departments</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In order to assure the observance of this
Act and of other pertinent laws, and of the rules and regulations of the
Monetary Board, the Central Bank shall have <span style="">appropriate supervising and examining departments which shall be
charged with the supervision and periodic or special examinations of banking
institutions operating in the Philippines, including all Government credit
institutions, including their subsidiaries and affiliates of non-bank </span>financial
intermediaries, and subsidiaries and affiliates of non-bank financial
intermediaries performing quasi-banking functions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The supervising and/or examining departments shall
discharge their responsibilities in accordance with the instructions of the
Monetary Board.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The department heads and the examiners of the supervising and/or
examining departments are hereby authorized to administer oaths to any
director, officer, or employee of any institution under their respective
supervision or subject to their examination and to compel the presentation of
all books, documents, papers or records necessary in their judgment to
ascertain the facts relative to the true condition of any institution as well
as the books and records of persons and entities relative to or in connection
with the operations, activities or transactions of the institution under
examination.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>No restraining order or injunction shall be issued by the court
enjoining the Central Bank from examining any institution subject to
supervision or examination by the Central Bank, unless there is convincing proof
that the action of the Central Bank is plainly arbitrary and made in bad faith
and the petitioner or plaintiff files <span style="">with
</span>the clerk or judge of the court in which the action is pending a bond
executed in favor of the Central Bank, in an amount to be fixed by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order or
injunction shall be refused or, if granted, shall be dissolved upon filing by
the Central Bank of a bond, which shall be in the form of cash or Central Bank
cashier's check, in an amount twice the amount of the bond of the petitioner or
plaintiff conditioned that it will pay the damages which the petitioner or
plaintiff may suffer by the refusal or the dissolution of the injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provisions of Rule 58 of the New Rules of
Court insofar <span style="">as
</span>they are applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this
Section shall govern the issuance and dissolution of the restraining order or
injunction contemplated in this Section.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 25-A.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- The department heads and the examiners of the supervising and
examining departments, in the conduct of the periodic or special examination of
banking institutions may be specifically authorized by the Monetary Board to
examine, inquire or look into all deposits of whatever nature with banking
institutions in the Philippines including investments in debt instruments
issued by the Government of the Philippines, its political subdivisions and its
instrumentalities, after being satisfied that there is reasonable ground to believe
that <span style="">a </span>bank
fraud or serious irregularity has been or is being committed and that it is
necessary to look into the deposit to establish such fraud or irregularity.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 28.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Examination and fees</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>â It shall be the duty of the head of the
appropriate supervising and examining department, personally or by deputy, at
least once in every twelve months, and at such other times as either he or the
Monetary Board may deem expedient, to make an examination of the books of every
banking institution within the purview of this Act and make a report on the
same to the Monetary Board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Every such institution shall afford to the head of the appropriate
supervising and examining departments and to his authorized deputies full
opportunity to examine its books, cash and available assets and general
condition at any time when requested so to do by the Central Bank:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided</u>, <u>however</u>, That none of
the reports and other papers relative to such examinations shall be open to
inspection by the public except insofar as such publicity is incidental to the
proceeding hereinafter authorized or is necessary for the prosecution of
violations in connection with the business of such institutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

</span><span class="GramE"><u>Appointment of conservator</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Whenever, on the basis of a report submitted
<span style="">by </span>the appropriate supervising
or examining department, the Monetary Board finds that a bank or <span style="">a </span>non-bank financial intermediary
performing quasi-banking functions is in a state of continuing inability or
unwillingness to maintain a condition of liquidity deemed adequate to protect
the interest of depositors and creditors, the Monetary Board may appoint a
conservator to take charge of the assets, liabilities, and the management of
that institution, collect all monies and debts due said institution and
exercise all powers necessary to preserve the assets of the institution,

disclosed that the condition of the same is one of <span style="">insolvency, </span>or that its continuance in business would involve
probable loss to its depositors or creditors, it shall be the duty of the

cashier's check, in an amount twice the amount of the bond of the petitioner or
plaintiff conditioned that it <span style="">will pay
the damages which the petitioner or plaintiff may suffer by the refusal or the
dissolution of the injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
provisions of Rule 58 of the New Rules of Court insofar as they are applicable
and not inconsistent with the provisions of this Section shall govern the issuance

Section.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Insolvency, under this Act, shall be understood to mean that the
realizable assets of a bank or a non-bank financial intermediary <span style="">performing quasi-banking functions </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">determined by the Central Bank are insufficient to meet its
liabilities.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The appointment of a conservator under Section 28-A of this Act or
the appointment of a receiver or liquidator under this Section shall be vested exclusively
with the Monetary Board, the provision of any law, general or special, to the
contrary notwithstanding.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is stressed that in Section 25 of the said Act, the Department
of Supervision and Examination is charged with the supervision and periodic
examination of all banking institutions operating in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
including all government credit institutions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming for the moment that the Bank is owned or controlled by the
government, it is nevertheless not exempt from but in fact expressly placed
under the jurisdiction of the Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">More to the point, R.A. No. 3518 itself, which created the
Philippine Veterans Bank, provides in its Section 14 that the Bank shall be subject
to the authority of the Department of Supervision and Examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said Section 14 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 14.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Inspection by Department of Supervision and
Examination of the Central Bank</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>- The Veterans Bank shall be subject to inspection by the Department of
Supervision and Examination of the Central Bank in accordance with Republic Act
Numbered Two hundred sixty-five and Republic Act Numbered Three hundred
thirty-seven.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The purpose of these provisions is to enable the Central Bank, as
the entity charged with the responsibility of maintaining the stability of the
banking and monetary systems of the country, to take the necessary steps
against any banking institution whose continued operation may cause prejudice
to its depositors and creditors, and the general public as well.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it be conceded that the charter of the Bank constitutes a
contract between the Government and the stockholders of the Bank, it would not
follow that the relationship cannot be altered without violating the impairment
clause.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a too simplistic
conclusion that loses sight of the vulnerability of this "precious little
clause," <span style="">as </span>it is called,
to the inherent powers of the State when the public interest demands their
exercise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clause, according to
Corwin, "is lately of negligible importance, and might well be stricken
from the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For most
practical purposes, in fact, it has been."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The undeniable fact is that the notion of public interest has
made such considerable inroads into the constitutional guaranty that one could
validly say now that it has become the exception rather than the rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impact of the modern society upon
hitherto private agreements has left the clause in a shambles, as it were,
making practically every contract susceptible to change on behalf of the
public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The modern understanding is that
the contract is protected by the guaranty only if it does not affect public
interest, but there is hardly any contract now that does not somehow or other
affect public interest as not to come under the powers of the State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Part of that understanding therefore is that,
conversely, the contract may be altered validly if it involves the public
interest, to which private interests must yield "as a postulate of the
existing social order."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the landmark case of <st1:city><st1:place>Norman</st1:place></st1:city>
v. <st1:city><st1:place>Baltimore</st1:place></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the U.S. Supreme Court stressed that every contract involving the public
interest suffers a congenital infirmity, and that is its susceptibility to
change whenever required by the public interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The police power can be validly asserted to
make that change to meet any one of the several great public needs, such as, in
that case, regulation of the value of money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In upholding a legislative enactment providing for the payment of
existing debts dollar for dollar in the current legal tender, as against
contracts calling for such payment in gold coin of specified weight and
fineness, the decision stressed:</p>

<blockquote>Contracts, however express, cannot fetter the constitutional
authority of the Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contracts may
create rights of property, but when contracts deal with a subject matter which
lies within the control of the Congress, they have a congenital infirmity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parties cannot remove their transactions from
the reach of <span style="">dominant constitutional
power by making contracts about them.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The need in the case at bar is no less compelling, to wit, the
preservation of the integrity and stability of our banking system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless adequate and determined efforts are
taken by the government against distressed and mismanaged banks, public faith
in the banking system is certain to deteriorate to the prejudice of the
national economy itself, not to mention the losses suffered by the bank
depositors, creditors, and stockholders, who all deserve the protection of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The government cannot simply
cross its arms while the assets of a bank are being depleted through
mismanagement or irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
the duty of the Central Bank in such an event to step in and salvage the
remaining resources of the bank so that they may not continue to be dissipated
or plundered by those entrusted with their management.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' argument that by accepting the stocks granted to
them by the law, the same have become their inalienable and irrevocable
property is clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
stockholdings do not enjoy any special immunity over and above shares of stock
in any other corporation, which are always subject to the vicissitudes of
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their value may appreciate or
decline or the stocks may become worthless altogether.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like any other property, they do not have <span style="">a </span>fixed but
a fluctuating price.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the mere
acceptance of these shares of stock by the petitioners did not create any legal
assurance from the Government that their original value would be preserved and
that the owners could not be deprived of such property under any circumstance
no matter how justified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the charter subject to revocation only by the legislature,
as the petitioners also erroneously contend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The mere circumstance that the charter was granted directly by Congress
does not signify that only Congress can modify or abrogate it by another
enactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the charter itself
says that the Bank shall be subject to regulation by the Central Bank which is
empowered <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, by express
provision of law, to order its liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, by its own terms, the charter will automatically become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <u>officio</u> after fifty years and the
Bank itself will cease to exist unless its life is extended by positive act of
the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may also be noted
that <u>quo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>warranto</u></span> proceedings may be
filed against the Bank by the Solicitor General on behalf of the Republic of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
pursuant to the Rules of Court on any of the grounds enumerated in Rule 66
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these can be done without
the necessity of direct legislative action and, no less importantly, without
violation of the legislative will.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is also the practical difficulty of Congress itself
decreeing liquidation, presumably to be made after examination of the financial
condition of the Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the
legislature, through its corresponding appropriate committees, will be
undertaking the function purposely assigned by law to the Department of
Examination and Supervision of the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an intricate administrative function
wisely entrusted by Congress to the said body, from which the petitioners would
now recall it for its direct exercise by the lawmaking body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a procedure would bring us back to
square one, so to speak, and revoke the authority confided by Congress to the
Central Bank in recognition of its established expertise in the regulation of
banks.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the ownership of the Bank, we find it is not <span style="">a </span>government
bank, as claimed by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
fact is that under Section 3(b) of its charter, while 51% of the capital stock
of the Bank was initially fully subscribed by the Republic of the Philippines
for and in behalf of the veterans, their widows, orphans or compulsory heirs,
the corresponding shares of stock were to be turned over within 5 years from
the organization by the Bank to the said beneficiaries who would thereafter
have the right to vote such common shares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The balance of about 49% was to be divided into preferred shares which
would be opened for subscription by any recognized veteran, widow, orphans or
compulsory heirs of said veteran at the rate of one preferred share per
veteran, on the condition that in case of failure of any particular veteran to
subscribe for any preferred share of stock so offered to him within thirty (30)
days from the date of receipt of notice, said share of stock shall be available
for subscription to other veterans in accordance with such rules or regulations
as may be promulgated by the Board of Directors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, under Sec. 6(a), the affairs of the
Bank are managed by a board of directors composed of eleven members, three of
whom are <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>officio</u> members, with the
other eight being elected annually by the stockholders <span style="">in </span>the manner prescribed by the Corporation Law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Significantly, Sec. 28 also provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Sec. 28.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><u>Articles of incorporation.</u></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- This Act, upon its approval, shall be
deemed and accepted to all legal intents and purposes <span style="">as </span>the statutory articles of incorporation or Charter of the
Philippine Veterans' Bank; and that, notwithstanding the provisions of any
existing law to the contrary, said Bank shall be deemed registered and duly
authorized to do business and operate <span style="">as
a </span>commercial bank <span style="">as </span>of
the date of approval of this Act.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This point is important because the Constitution provides in its
Article IX-B, Section 2(1) that "the Civil Service embraces all branches,
subdivisions, instrumentalities, and agencies of the Government, including
government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters." As
the Bank is not owned or controlled by the Government although it does have an
original charter in the form of R.A. No. 3518, it clearly does not fall under
the Civil Service and should be regarded as an ordinary commercial
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Section
28 of the said law so provides.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The consequence is that the relations of the Bank with its employees
should be governed by the labor laws, under which in fact they have already
been paid some of their claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the Labor Code, the Court rules that the petitioners'
claim for back wages must be rejected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason is that the employees making this claim have not been
illegally dismissed but lawfully separated as <span style="">a </span>result of the liquidation of the
Bank on orders of higher authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
move was not the decision of the Bank; it was forced upon it by the resolution
of the Monetary Board of the Central Bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Back pay is awarded for work that could have been performed by the
employee except that he was prevented from doing so because of his illegal
dismissal by the employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clearly
not due in the case at bar to the employees whose services were terminated as a
result of the forcible closure of the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the claims of Marking and Mejia for the payment of
their retirement benefits, which we restrained temporarily on <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="1">January 12, 1989</st1:date>, we find with the
public respondents that such payment is in order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We so hold, considering that although the
said retirees are members of the board of directors, they are nevertheless
covered by the Retirement Plan of the Bank per the following pertinent
provisions:</p>

<blockquote>Article II, Section 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The
following words and phrases, as used herein shall have the meaning indicated,
unless a different meaning is plainly required by the text:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Employee" means any person who is
employed by the Bank on <span style="">a </span>regular
and permanent basis, including officers; <u>and such members of the Board of
Directors</u> and other hired workers not employed on a regular and permanent
basis but who, because of their extended service, would qualify under the
retirement categories under Article IV hereof and who for purposes of this
Plan, shall be deemed employees.</p>

<blockquote>Article III, Section 1 - <u>Eligibility at Effective Date</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>All employees as herein defined shall automa<span style="">tically </span>be eligible to participate in the Plan, <span style="">as </span>of its effective date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Stress supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, for purposes of the application of Article 110 of the
Labor Code, the said directors must be considered managerial employees, or
officers, and so not entitled to the preference of claims granted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> to workers in general or the rank-and-file
employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claims of these workers
must be accorded priority over all other claims, including those of the said
directors, and indeed even of the Government itself.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> This
provision, as amended by Republic Act No. 6715, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Article 110.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Worker preference in
case of bankruptcy</u>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
event of bankruptcy or liquidation of an employer's business, his workers shall
enjoy first preference as regards their unpaid wages <u>and other monetary
claims</u>, <span style="">any provision of law to the
contrary notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Such unpaid
wages and monetary claims</u> shall be paid in full <u>before the claims of the
Government and other creditors may be paid</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Amendments underlined).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Focusing now on G.R. No. 82337, the Court notes that the
petitioners therein are asking that the ownership and management of the Bank be
turned over to them in accordance with R.A. No. 3518.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They point out that the deficit incurred by
the Bank when its liquidation was ordered by the Central Bank in 1985 is not
imputable to them and suggest they can do better in rehabilitating the Bank,
given the proper support from the Government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For this reason, they ask the Court to order <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> the Central Bank to grant them the necessary
loans and other facilities, the Secretary of the Budget to certify as
appropriated the amount needed to fully pay all common and preferred shares of
the Bank, and the National <span style="">Treasurer </span>to release such amounts to the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that there is a procedural
flaw in the petition, <span style="">in </span>that -</p>

<blockquote>The Rules of Court, the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980 and
the Interim Rules of Court quite clearly delineate the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court in civil cases as encompassing a review on appeal only on
questions of law as well as original petitions in certain special civil actions
like <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The present petition does not come under any of the above.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, the petition is not an appeal from
the decision of any lower court or quasi-judicial body, as in fact, the same is
indeed an original petition for restitution.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Also, the present petition is certainly not one for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition or <i>mandamus</i> because there is no tribunal, board or officer
that has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion, or has neglected the performance of an act which the law enjoins <span style="">as </span>a duty,
and from whose acts or negligence the petitioners were supposed to have been
aggrieved thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">On the basis alone of jurisdiction, the
petition at bar should be dismissed.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A reading of the instant petition would show, however, that the
same partakes of the nature of <i>mandamus</i> because it seeks judgment
directing and commanding the Secretary of Budget, the National Treasurer, the
CB, the Monetary Board and the PVB Liquidator to do certain specific acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the facts hereof do not
present a case where such offices and officials are, by law, mandated to do the
adverted acts, even less, that they have neglected to perform them.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, from what has already been said of the power of the
Central Bank to regulate commercial banks, and to order their liquidation
whenever warranted, it would seem that the affairs of the Bank are best
entrusted to the liquidator court at this time rather than managed directly by
the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is no reflection
on their competence and sincerity, not to mention their genuine concern for the
Bank, of which they are the intended beneficiaries and owners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only that, considering the expertise of
the Central Bank on this matter, and the familiarity of the liquidator court
with the ramifications of the problem at hand, we feel it is advisable that
they be allowed, <span style="">as </span>long <span style="">as </span>the administration has not yet adopted its own plans, to
devise the proper steps to relieve the Bank of its present difficulties.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court reiterates its hope that the administrative authorities
may still find a way to rehabilitate the Bank even at this late hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is still possible even with this
decision, for all we are saying here is that the Central Bank has the power to
liquidate the Bank under existing laws and that, <span style="">in </span>the present circumstances, its
liquidation may be undertaken under the control of the liquidator court in
accordance with the procedure prescribed by R.A. No. 265 and the guidelines
herein laid down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such rehabilitation
may still be ordered by the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
if she sees fit, without violation of the import of this decision or of the
pertinent laws here interpreted and applied.</p>
