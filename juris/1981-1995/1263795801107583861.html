				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Assailed in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for a
writ of preliminary injunction and/or restraining order as <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of petitioners' right to due process is the unilateral cancellation by
respondent Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) of the Management Contract of
petitioner E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc. (ERI) to operate the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service in all the ports at South Harbor, Manila
and the subsequent appointment by respondent PPA of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
Marina Port Services, Inc. (Marina, for brevity) as interim operator of said <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc., also known
as Metro Port Service, Inc. (MPSI), is a Philippine corporation organized on <st1:date month="6" day="21" year="1962">June 21, 1962</st1:date> for the main purpose of
bidding for the contract to manage all the piers in <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Co-petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
was allegedly the 100% equity owner, having paid for the subscriptions of the
other in­corporators who were mere nominees.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a public bidding, petitioner ERI was awarded in 1966 a
five-year contract to operate the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service
for Piers 3 and 5 at the <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, it allegedly invested millions of
pesos in acquiring port-handling equipment upon assurance from the government
that its contract would be renewed without public bidding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when the Bureau of Customs informed
petitioner ERI in 1971 of its decision to call for a new bidding and
accordingly issued an invitation to bid for the operation of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service for any and all piers in South Harbor,
including Piers 3 and 5, petitioner ERI instituted a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition, <i>mandamus</i> and injunction with preliminary and mandatory
injunction and/or restrain­ing order before the then Court of First Instance of
Manila against the Secretary of Finance, Commissioner of Customs and members of
the Bidding Committee to enjoin them from proceeding with the bidding and to
compel them to renew petitioner <span class="SpellE">ERI's</span> contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance, presided by
Judge Juan <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>, issued the writ prayed for,
whereupon then Secretary of Finance Cesar <span class="SpellE">Virata</span>
elevated the case before this Court in G.R. No. 33426 entitled, "Cesar <span class="SpellE">Virata</span>, et al. vs. Hon. Juan <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span>,
et al."</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date month="5" day="13" year="1971">May
 13, 1971</st1:date>, this Court ordered the holding of a public bidding for
all the piers, conditioned that no final award should be given until further
orders from the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">An actual bidding was conducted for all the piers, with ERI
emerging as the Bidding Committee's unanimous choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The selection was confirmed by this Court in <span class="SpellE"><u>Virata</u></span> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bocar</u></span>,
50 SCRA 468, 489, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, herein petitioners are hereby
directed to make the final award in favor of E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>,
Inc., as the best and most advantageous bidder of the contract to operate the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service for all the piers in the Manila South
Harbor; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The management contract covering all the piers in the <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place> was executed between
petitioner ERI and the government on <st1:date month="1" day="18" year="1974">January
 18, 1974</st1:date> for a term of five years effective <st1:date month="1" day="1" year="1974">January 1, 1974</st1:date>, renewable for another five
years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In August of the same year,
petitioner ERI increased its capitalization from P2 Million to P20 Million.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1977 and early 1978, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
allegedly initiated negotiations with respondent PPA either for the renewal of
the management contract or for an immediate public bidding, if necessary, but
respondent PPA, which was represented in the negotia­tions by the then General
Manager, co-respondent <span class="SpellE">Primitivo</span> Solis, Jr., did not
act on the request, reportedly due to the unconcealed desire of people close to
then President Marcos to take over petitioner ERI.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, in late 1978, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>,
who was then owner of about 93% of <span class="SpellE">ERI's</span> equity was
allegedly coerced by emissaries from then President Marcos into endorsing in
blank <span class="SpellE">ERI's</span> stock certifi­cates covering 60%
equity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is further alleged that <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> did not receive a single centavo for these shares of
stock as the checks purportedly payable to him as payment of the shares were
immediately endorsed by <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> to and taken by unnamed
parties close to President Marcos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
party close to Presi­dent Marcos was later identified as Alfredo "<span class="SpellE">Bejo</span>" <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>, the
president's brother-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the transfer, a new group reportedly took over the active
control and management of peti­tioner company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, was, however, retained as
President, allegedly because of his acceptability and rapport with the shipping
lines, customs brokers and the unions, but without real powers as <span class="SpellE">ERI's</span> By-Laws were amended to make the office of the
executive vice-president more powerful than the president's which was vested
with mere recommendatory functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">ERI's</span> corporate name was also
changed to Metro Port Service, Inc. (MPSI).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="12" day="31" year="1978">December 31, 1978</st1:date>,
the contract of petitioner ERI/MPSI expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was extended in 1979 to <st1:date month="6" day="30" year="1980">June
 30, 1980</st1:date>, during which month respondent PPA executed a new contract
in favor of ERI for a term of eight (8) years, beginning <st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1980">July 1, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is alleged that on <st1:date month="2" day="26" year="1986">February
 26, 1986</st1:date>, after the ouster of the former government administration,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> went to <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place> and took active control,
supervision and management of MPSI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
called a special stockholders' meeting whereby he was able to re-organize the
Board of Directors by seating therein his own nominees and to restore the powers
of the President as well as the company's name through corresponding amendments
of the By-Laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was likewise able to
convince the nominee company, Maximum Trading and Industrial Corporation
(MATICO), in whose name the 60% equity appeared to have been registered, to
return the same to him under a "Deed of <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>
with Irrevocable Power of Attorney" (Annex "B", Petition, pp.
54-55, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He caused the books of accounts to be audited by the accounting firm of <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gorres</span> and <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> and exerted utmost efforts to improve service and
revenue as well as to restore harmonious relations with the unions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further undertook ways and means to
restore to work­ing condition the cargo-handling equipment in order to check
delay in the delivery of cargoes, which efforts were acknowledged by respondent
PPA in a letter dated <st1:date month="7" day="9" year="1986">July 9, 1986</st1:date>
(Annex "C", Petition, p. 56, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="7" day="18" year="1986">July 18, 1986</st1:date>,
some truckers staged a demonstration at the main gate of <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place> to complain about <span class="SpellE">Razon's</span> management of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The demonstration lasted
until <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time> of the same day.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 5:30 in the afternoon of July 18, 1986, a Friday,
respondent PPA sent to petitioner ERI/MPSI a letter signed by a co-respondent
Solis, demanding explanation and reply to the complaints from shippers and
others enumerated in said letter and to the various violations of the
management contract not later than 9:00 A.M. of the following day, July 19,
1986, (Annex "D", Petition, pp. 57-60, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a television newscast in the evening of <st1:date month="7" day="18" year="1986">July 18, 1986</st1:date>, then Minister of
Transportation and Communications Hernando Perez was quoted to have given
respondent PPA until Wednesday of the following week, <st1:date month="7" day="23" year="1986">July 23, 1986</st1:date>, within which to investigate the
complaints against MPSI and to submit its findings and recommendations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently relying on the time frame announced by Minister Perez
and finding the deadline set by respondent PPA in its letter of July 18, 1986
too short, apart from the fact that it had no staff, it being a week-end,
petitioner ERI prepared a letter dated July 19, 1986, addressed to respondent
PPA, stating that it would "reply early next week" (Annex
"F" p. 61, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that this letter was never
delivered to respondent PPA because there was allegedly no one in its office to
receive the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, <st1:date month="7" day="19" year="1986">July
 19, 1986</st1:date>, respondent PPA informed petitioner ERI/MPSI thru a letter
of even date that it was <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the management
con­tract and taking over the cargo handling operations as well as the
equipment of petitioner "effective immediately" (Annex "G",
Petition, p. 62, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="7" day="21" year="1986">July
 21, 1986</st1:date>, respondent PPA appointed Marina Port Services, Inc. as
interim operator of the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> service at <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, at <st1:time hour="10" minute="5">10:05 A.M.</st1:time>
of <st1:date month="7" day="21" year="1986">July 21, 1986</st1:date>, herein
petitioners, thru counsels Atty. Rafael T. Durian and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Jr. of Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Agabin</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Alday</span> Law Firm,
instituted the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for the
issuance of a preliminary restraining order and/or injunction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Less than an hour later or at <st1:time hour="11" minute="0">11:00 A.M.</st1:time>, they filed a similar complaint
before the Regional Trial Court of Manila, which issued a temporary restraining
order against respondent PPA at <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">3:00 P.M.</st1:time>
of the same day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Earlier, at <st1:time hour="11" minute="58">11:58 A.M.</st1:time>, petitioners filed a "Withdrawal
of Petition" with this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
"Withdrawal of Petition" was vigorously opposed by the
Solicitor-General in behalf of respondents who denounced petitioners' filing of
the two petitions in this Court and in the Regional Trial Court as proscribed
"forum?shopping and double-dealing".</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending action by the court on the "Withdrawal of
Petition", petitioners filed a supplemental complaint with the RTC of
Manila to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> Manila Port Services, Inc. as
co-respondent therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They likewise
filed <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>proprio</u></span>
a comment on the Opposi­tion to the Withdrawal of Petition, stating in the main
that they intended to withdraw the instant petition before filing the petition
in the RTC but that there was a miscommunication between counsels and their
messenger; that there was no intention to forum-shop and that they deeply
apologize for the delayed filing of the "Withdrawal of Petition".</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding the explanation <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> by
petitioners to be "feeble and untenable", the Court resolved on <st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1986">July 31, 1986</st1:date> to:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> a)
DENY the motion to with­draw the instant petition; b) summarily DISMISS both
the petition at bar as well as the complaint in Civil Case No. 86­-36754 of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila and to SET ASIDE effective imme­diately the
temporary restraining order and any other orders or processes issued in the
latter case as void and of no effect; and c) SUSPEND Atty. Rafael T. Durian and
<span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Jr. from
the practice of law effective imme­diately and until further orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Attys. Durian and <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
Jr. are hereby REQUIRED to show cause within ten (10) days from notice hereof
why the suspension should not stand, why no disbarment proceedings should be
instituted against them and why no other liability should attach to them by
reason of their above?described acts of deceit, malpractice and gross
misconduct." (p. 122, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On August 6, 1986, petitioners, assisted by Atty. Angel C. Cruz
of the same Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Agabin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Alday</span> Law Firm, filed a Manifestation that they
were abiding by the resolution of July 31, 1986 but "with express
reservation to their filing a new ordinary civil action before the competent
RTC and the legal remedy to be availed of by Attys. Durian and <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Jr. on the matter of the disci­plinary action taken
against them." (pp. 147-148, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day, petitioners filed a third identical complaint
before the RTC of Manila, docket­ed as Civil Case No. 86-37006.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of the Solicitor-General, this
Court issued on August 14, 1986 a temporary restraining order enjoining Judge <span class="SpellE">Alfin</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span>, RTC, Branch
50, Manila from acting on Civil Case No. 86-37006 and the petitioners from
instituting further action elsewhere without leave of court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Agabin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Alday</span> Law Firm and
Judge <span class="SpellE">Vicencio</span> were likewise required to show cause
why they should not be severally held in contempt of court and/or be held
administratively liable for malpractice (p. 233, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both comp­lied with this resolution, as did
Attys. Durian and <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Jr. with the resolution of <st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1986">July 31, 1986</st1:date> by filing a
"Compliance with Urgent Plea for Immediate Lifting of Suspension" (p.
150, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="8">August 18,
 1986</st1:date>, petitioners thru new counsel N. J. <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>
and Associates, filed a motion for reconsideration of the resolution of <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1986</st1:date> and for leave to file
suit whether in the Supreme Court or any court for judicial review of <span class="SpellE">PPA’s</span> cancellation of Petitioner <span class="SpellE">ERI's</span>
management contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was again
opposed by the Solicitor-General.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="13" year="1986">September 13, 1986</st1:date>,
Marina Port Services, Inc. filed a motion for intervention, which was in turn
opposed by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 30, 1986, the Court resolved to:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) make permanent the temporary restraining
order issued on August 14, 1986 inasmuch as this Court has resolved to
entertain the instant petition to accord petitioners access to the courts; b)
allow the intervention of Marina Port Services, Inc. in the present case; and
c) to lift the suspension of Attys. Rafael T. Durian and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, Jr. effective immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 435-A, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that they were denied their right to due
process when respondent PPA can­celled the Management Contract without prior
hearing and investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of
this contention, they advance the theory that the management contract is not an
ordinary commercial contract, but more in the nature of a franchise or license,
which, in this case, has been impressed with property rights by reason of the
length of time petitioners have been enjoying it, and hence cannot be cancelled
without according petitioners the opportunity to be heard on the alleged
complaints and contract violations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a
corollary, petitioners further assert that respondent PPA was not exercising
proprietary functions, i.e., as a party to a contract exercising its right to
res­cission or resolution when it cancelled petitioners' contract, but as a
regulatory body exercising adjudi­catory powers in finding and concluding that
peti­tioner ERI/MPSI had violated the management contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, their contention that since said
findings and conclusions were reached in violation of petitioners' right to due
process, the resultant cancellation is null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents PPA, et al. and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>,
on the other hand, submit in their joint memorandum the following arguments:</p>

<blockquote>“1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to
petitioners' assertion, the cancelled <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
contract was previously awarded, not to petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
or his old company, E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc., but to Metro Port
Services, Inc. that President Marcos' brother-in-law, Alfredo '<span class="SpellE">Bejo</span>' <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>, admittedly
controlled;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the cancelled
contract was the fruit of corruption in the Marcos government, it is a nullity
and petitioners cannot sue for its enforcement;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With his admission
that he agreed to front for <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> with respect to
the latter's illegal dealings with the Philippine Port Author­ity, <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> forfeits his claim as having been a victim of the
Marcos rule;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Besides, since
petitioners themselves admit the existence of sufficient grounds for <span class="SpellE">PPA's</span> cancellation of <st1:place><st1:placename>Metro</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype></st1:place>'s <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
con­tract, they cannot complain;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, respondent PPA was not required to hear petitioners prior to its
cancellation of the contract;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the validity of <span class="SpellE">PPA's</span> cancellation of that contract and its takeover of the
<span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations, the designation of respondent
Marina Port Services, Inc. to assist PPA in the operations is not for
petitioner to question; and,<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“7.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At all events,
respondent <st1:city><st1:place>MARINA</st1:place></st1:city> is qualified to
handle the limited task PPA assigned to it." (pp. 546-547, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Management Contract under consideration was executed by and
between petitioner E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc. represented by its
President, herein co-petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, and
respondent PPA, represented by its then General Manager, E. S. <span class="SpellE">Baclig</span>, Jr. on June 27, 1980 (Annex "A",
Petition, p. 18, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By petitioners' own admission, at the time of
the execution of the Management Contract, petitioner E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>,
Inc. later known as Metro Port Services, Inc. was controlled by Alfredo "<span class="SpellE">Bejo</span>" <span class="SpellE">Romuldez</span>,
brother-in-law of deposed President Marcos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under Section 5 of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. No.
3019), <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>, by reason of his relationship with
the then President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
was prohibited from intervening, directly or indirectly, in any transaction or
business with the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
Management Contract, entered into by E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc.,
ostensibly owned by petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, but in
fact controlled by Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> as 60% equity
owner thereof, is null and void and of no effect, being one expressly
prohibited by law (par. [7], Art. 1409, Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, as will be shown later, the
Management Contract is the direct result of a previous illegal contract and,
therefore, is itself null and void under Article 1422 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners attempt to evade the consequence of the <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> connection by alleging that the 60% equity of
petitioner E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc. was obtained thru force and
duress and without any monetary consideration whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, the trans­fer of the shares
of stock to persons close to President Marcos, later disclosed to be Alfredo
"<span class="SpellE">Bejo</span>" <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>
was, at the very least, <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> for lack of consent,
or altogether void for being absolutely fictitious or simulated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, the transfer of the shares of stock of petitioner E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc. representing 60% equity to persons fronting for
Alfredo "<span class="SpellE">Bejo</span>" <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>
was null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The invali­dity
springs not from vitiated consent nor absolute want of monetary consideration,
but for its having had an unlawful cause - that of obtain­ing a government
contract in violation of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the
general rule is that the <span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span> of the contract
must not be confused with the motives of the parties, this case squarely fits
into the exception that the motive may be regarded as <span class="SpellE"><u>causa</u></span>
when it predetermines the purpose of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Liguez</span> v. Court of
Appeals, 102 Phil. 577).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the part of <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>, the motive was to be able to contract with the
government which he was then prohibited by law from doing, and on petitioner <span class="SpellE">Razon's</span> part, to be able to renew his management
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For it is scarcely disputable
that Enrique <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> would not have transferred said
shares of stock to <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> without an assurance
from the latter that he would be unduly favored with a renewal of the
Management Contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it came to
pass that by transferring 60% of the shares in his company to <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>, petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>
was able to secure an eight-year contract with respondent PPA and for six years
before its cancellation benefit from the proceeds thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' attempt to dissociate or divorce themselves from the
illegality of the transfer and, consequently, of the management con­tract, as
well as their claim of innocence or being a victim of the Marcos regime must
fail for the "view has been taken x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that a party is a participant in the unlawful intention
where he knows and intends that the subject matter will be used for an illegal purpose
and there would seem to be no doubt that one may be deemed to be a participant
in the other's unlawful design if he shares in the benefits of the violation of
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, whether he is to derive
any benefit from the unlawful use of the subject matter is not the sole
test.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A test which has been said to be
more conformable to sound morality is whether he intends to aid the other in
the unlawful object.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may be deemed to
be a participant in the unlawful purpose if, with knowledge thereof, he does
anything which facilitates the carrying out of such purpose." (17 Am <span class="SpellE">Jur</span> 2d 515-516).</p>

<p class="BODY">The transfer of the control of petitioner E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>,
Inc. from petitioner Enrique <span class="SpellE">Razon</span> to Alfredo “<span class="SpellE">Bejo</span>” <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>, which We have
resolved to be null and void, served as the direct link to petitioner company's
obtaining the Management Con­tract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Being the direct consequence and result of a previous illegal contract,
the Management Contract itself is null and void as provided in Article 1422 of
the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Elementary in the law of contracts is the principle that no
judicial action is necessary for the annulment of a void contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any such action would be merely
declaratory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
Civil Code of the Philippines, Vol. IV, 1973 ed., p. 594).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it was well within the rights of
respondent PPA to unilaterally cancel and treat as avoided the Management
Contract and no arbitra­riness may be attached to its exercise of this right.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, even if the Management Contract were valid and
subsisting, the violations<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a> of the contract committed by its
predecessor, Metro Port Services Inc. which, except for the bare allegation
that these were untrue, were not specifi­cally denied by petitioners, but on
the contrary, unwittingly admitted with the allegation that Metro Port Services
Inc. mismanaged the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operations, were grave
and serious to justify immediate termination of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent PPA is the government agency charged with the specific
duty of supervising, controlling, regulating, constructing, maintaining,
operating and providing such facilities or services as are necessary in the
ports vested in, or belonging to it (Sec. 6 [ii], P.D. 857).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has the expertise to determine whether or
not Marina Port Services Inc. has the capability of discharging the tasks
assigned to it as interim operator of <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>
service in <st1:place><st1:placename>South</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except in cases of clear grave abuse of
discretion, which has not been shown in the instant petition, the Court will
not disturb such judgment and substitute its own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> Securities

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="text-indent:0in">Metro Port Service, Inc. has been
violating some PPA regulations and certain provisions of its Management
Contract with the Port Authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the violations are numerous, the following enumerations are the
only ones presented as these are supported by documents.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Operation of stevedoring services beyond the
authority granted by the PPA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On many
occasions, <st1:place><st1:placename>Metro</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype></st1:place>
undertook stevedoring work on board some vessels berthed outside Pier 3, Berths
3 and 4, resulting in complaints from the stevedoring Contractor and problems
with the shipping lines involved.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Equipment Requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite the requirement in the Contract that
the Contractor shall submit to the Authority a program of equipment renewal and
modernization for ap­proval, no such program has been submitted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Existing equipment for containerization has
been so inadequate and <span class="SpellE">unmaintained</span> that complaints
from the port users on operational delays have always been received.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:0in">It is worth
mentioning that nowhere in the Philippine ports except in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> can be found an
additional charge for container terminal handling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was, however, allowed by the Bureau of
Customs in the initial stages of containerization only because of an
understanding that the cargo handler would need extra revenue to invest in
container equipment.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:0in">To date, however,
the only two (2) tango cranes at Pier 3 and the four (4) shifters at Pier 13 - <span class="SpellE">Muelle</span> de San Francisco are owned by the ship­ping lines;
the two (2) shifters at Cy-01 are owned by the PPA while one (1) is owned by
Metro Port - the last one is not even operation­al.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In short, the major container equipment in
the harbor are not owned by the cargo handler.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose for allowing a container terminal handling fee was not
attained as envisioned.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:0in">A visit inside the
MPSI <span class="SpellE">motorpool</span> will show a large number of
unserviceable forklifts and other related equipment but these cannot be of
operational assistance because of poor maintenance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meantime, port users continue to complain
about non-availability of equipment and delays in cargo receipt and deliveries.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Submission of Reports.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:place><st1:placename>Metro</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype></st1:place> has not been very cooperative
in the submission of required reports.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some are submitted late while others are not submitted at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those not submitted at all include:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Out-Turn Report per Vessel, Bad Order Cargo
Certificates, Export Cargo Receipts, Discharging/Loading Tally, Cargo Location
System, Shut-Out Reports and Master Van Lists.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Compliance with Port Regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some port rules are not always complied with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Examples of these are those that pertain to
stuffing, stripping, billing, tariff system and other operational
requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Non-observance of these
regulations have only added to the confusion in the port, not to mention losses
in revenues due to the Port Authority.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Safety Requirements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to relevant provisions in the
Contract, there is no full-time Safety Officer employed by <st1:place><st1:placename>Metro</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Port.</st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its safety gears and equipment are far from
complete.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:.75in;text-indent:-.25in">6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An audit of <st1:place><st1:placename>Metro</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype></st1:place>'s
