Guzman, father of said petitioner, is extending full cooperation with petitioners to assure that whatever protest or grievance petitioner Guzman may have would be ventilated in a lawful and peaceful manner."<br><br>Petitioners' REPLY <i>inter alia</i> -<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">1) </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">denied that Urbiztondo attempted to enroll only on July 5, 1984 (when enrollment was already closed), it being alleged that "while he did try to enroll that day, he also attempted to do so several times before that date, all to no avail, because respondents x x x persistently refused to allow him to do so", respondents' ostensible reason being that "Urbiztondo (had) participated in mass actions x x x within the school premises", although there were no "existing disciplinary charge against petitioner Urbiztondo" at the time;<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">2)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">asserted that "neither the text nor the context of the resolution"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> justifies the conclusion that "petitioners' right to exercise their cons­titutional freedoms" had thereby been restricted or limited; and<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">3)</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">alleged that "the holding of activities (mass action) in the school premises without the permission of the school x x x can be explained by the fact that the respondents persistently refused to issue such permit repeatedly sought by the students".</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table></blockquote>On November 23, 1984, this Court promulgated another resolution, this time reading as follows:<br><blockquote>"x x x The Court, after considering the pleadings filed and deliberating on the issues raised in the petition for extraordinary legal and equitable remedies with prayer for prelimi­nary mandatory injunction as well as the respondents’ comment on the petition and the reply of counsel for petitioners to the respondents' comment, Resolved to (a) give DUE COURSE to the petition; (b) consider the respondents' comment as ANSWER to the petition; and (c) require the parties to file their respective MEMORANDA within twenty (20) days from notice. x x x."</blockquote>Immediately apparent from a reading of respondents' comment and memorandum is the fact that they had never conducted proceedings of any sort to determine whether or not petitioners-students had indeed led or participated "in activities within the university premises, conducted without prior permit from school authorities, that disturbed or disrupted classes therein"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> or perpetrated acts of "vandalism, coercion and intimidation, slander, noise barrage and other acts showing disdain for and defiance of University authority"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>.&nbsp; Parenthetically, the pendency of a civil case for damages and a criminal case for malicious mischief against petitioner Guzman, cannot, without more, furnish sufficient warrant for his expulsion or debarment from re-enrollment.&nbsp; Also apparent is the omission of respondents to cite this Court to any duly published rule of theirs by which students may be expelled or refused re-enrollment for poor scholastic standing.<br><br>Under the Education Act of 1982,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> the petitioners, as students, have the right among others "to freely choose their field of study subject to existing curricula and to continue their course therein up to graduation, except in case of academic deficiency, or violation of disciplinary regulations."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Petitioners were being denied this right, or being discip­lined, without due process, in violation of the admonition in the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> that ''(n)o penalty shall be imposed upon any student except for cause as defined in x x x (the) Manual and/or in the school rules and regulations as duly promulgated and only after <i>due investigation</i> shall have been conducted".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> This Court is therefore cons­trained, as in <i>Beriña v. Philippine Maritime Institute,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> to declare illegal this act of respondents of imposing sanctions on students without due investigation.<br><br>Educational institutions of course have the power to "adopt and enforce such rules as may be deemed expedient for x x x (its) government,x x x (this being)" incident to the very object of incorporation, and indispensable to the successful management of the college".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The rules may include those governing student discipline.&nbsp; Indeed, the maintenance of "good school discipline" is a duty specifically enjoined on "every private school" by the Manual of Regulations for Private Schools;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> and in this connection, the Manual further provides that -<br><blockquote>"x x x The school rules governing discipline and the corresponding sanctions therefor must be clearly specified and defined in writing and made known to the students and/or their parents or guardians.&nbsp; Schools shall have the authority and prerogative to promulgate such rules and regulations as they may deem necessary from time to time effective as of the date of their promulgation unless otherwise specified".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></blockquote>But, to repeat, the imposition of disciplinary sanctions requires observance of procedural due process.&nbsp; And it bears stressing that due process in disciplinary cases involving students does not entail proceedings and hearings similar to those prescribed for actions and proceedings in courts of justice.&nbsp; The proceedings in student discipline cases may be summary; and cross-examination is not, contrary to petitioners' view, an essential part thereof.&nbsp; There are withal minimum standards which must be met to satisfy the demands of procedural due process; and these are, that (1) the students must be informed in writing of the nature and cause of any accusation against them; (2) they shall have the right to answer the charges against them, with the assistance of counsel, if desired; (3) they shall be informed of the evidence against them; (4) they shall have the right to adduce evidence in their own behalf; and (5) the evidence must be duly considered by the investigating committee or official designated by the school authorities to hear and decide the case.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted and the respondents are directed to allow the petitioners to re-enroll or otherwise continue with their respective courses, without prejudice to any disciplinary proceedings to which any or all of them may be sub­jected in accordance with the standards herein set forth.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, C.J., Abad Santos, Feria, Yap, Fernan, Melencio-Herrera, Alampay, Gutierrez, Jr., Cruz, </i>and <i>Paras, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Resolution, Aug. 14, 1986.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> In G.R.
