<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution is succinctly summa­rized in the <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>At the time of the incident the offended party, Carol <span class="SpellE">Dumrique</span>, was a 17-year old Commerce student at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Ortanez</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>

where her parents reside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She came to
know of the accused-appellant because the latter was her professor in
Mathematics 2-B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, since November
of the previous year (1976) she has been invited no less than three times by
the accused-appellant to a <span class="SpellE">merienda</span> but she refused
because she had already a boy friend who was also studying in the same
school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 6-10,

<blockquote>"At about 2:30 o'clock in the afternoon of January 4, 1977,
the offended party was alone in Room 206 at the second floor of the school
building reviewing her test paper in Management when accused-appellant entered
the room and inquired from her what she was doing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After answer­ing him, the offended party in
turn inquired from the accused-appellant the results of their examination <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>his subject.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter did not immediately answer, but
continued staring at the offended party for a long time and remarked:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Hindi ka <span class="SpellE">kasi</span>
<span class="SpellE">sumasama</span>." As the latter did not answer,
accused-appellant continued:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"You
cannot do anything.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All of those who are
here are members of my <span class="SpellE">barkada</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You will still undergo two Mathematics

 <st1:placetype>University</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the two boarded a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> bound for <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the <span class="SpellE">Banco</span>

taxi, prompting the offended party to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">inquire:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>"Sir, is it not that we are just
going to take a <span class="SpellE">merienda</span>?" Accused-appellant did
not answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he opened the
taxicab's door and pushed the offended party inside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, he ordered the taxicab driver to
proceed to Maya Theatre.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The offended party
did not shout to avoid a scandal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">she did not foresee an</span>y<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> immediate </span>danger since the one taking
her to a movie was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">her p</span>rofessor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arriving thereat, accused-appellant
bought tickets, then took her to the lounge section where both sat on a
bench.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly, thereafter,
accused-appellant lighted a cigarette and as he pressed her on the shoulder
told the offended party to smoke it, which she did as the former placed it into
her mouth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This caused her to cough and
get dizzy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Forthwith, accused-appellant
led her to a secluded section on the balcony where they took their seats.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused-appellant, then pre­tending to relieve the offended
party of her dizziness, offered her a choco­late candy, which she ate
unsuspecting of the accused-appellant's evil inten­tion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, accused-appellant gave her
another one which she also ate still believing that it was also intended to
relieve her further of her dizziness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the offended party already felt different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was feeling warm inside, and could no
longer control her feelings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not
reveal this to the accused-appellant who must have sensed it just the same
because the former did not resist when he started stroking her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, accused-appellant gave her a
third candy, this time, directly from his mouth through kissing, as she already
lost control of her reason or will power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Taking advantage of her situation, accused-appellant started kissing her
and fondled her private parts, including her breasts for quite sometime. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Then accused-appellant invited the offended
party to leave, to which she did not object as she was no longer herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

to the Rose Garden Motel, in Sta. Mesa, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the motel, they entered a room <span class="GramE">whereupon,</span> the offended party proceeded to a bed and laid
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After closing the door,
accused-appellant sat beside her and gave her another candy, the fourth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also gave her a cigarette but she was not
able to smoke it because she was too dizzy that she fell from the bed, causing
her hips to hit the edge of a dresser.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She tried to stand but she fell on the bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant then was beside
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He started undressing her slowly,
but before removing her panty, he fondled her breasts, and then gave her the
fifth chocolate candy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next thing
she knew was that accused-appellant was able to have carnal knowledge of
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She trembled with pain just as she
also noticed the accused-appellant tremble.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was repeated for four times; after which she laid down motionless
as she felt so weak to move.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 57-67,

pulled her inside the bathroom and flushed her with water.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This made her feel alive ('<span class="SpellE">nabuhayan</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>') until she
regained her normal feelings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
started to cry, but accused-appellant tried to stop her in order not to attract
attention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, believing that she was
worried about getting pregnant; accused-appellant teasingly told her that
"with two hundred pesos (P200.00), it could be removed." Whereupon,
accused-appellant warned the offended party not to inform anybody about the
incident threatening to take her life, reminding her of her night classes and
of the two mathematics subjects she shall be taking under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter,
accused-appellant told her to dress up, and after advising her not to attract
the attention of anybody, they left the motel and took a taxicab for <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> where accused-appellant alighted near the Farmer's
Market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From there the offended party

she met the accused-appellant in his classes, the latter would threaten to kill
her and reveal their affair to her boyfriend, should she not accede to his

party's boyfriend, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, to whom the
former must have divulged his affair with the offended party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of that, <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
waited for the offended party to come out of her last class and invited her for
a talk which she accepted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They proceeded
to Barrio Fiesta Restau­rant in <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> where <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> confronted her about her affair with the

<blockquote>"Appellant testified that he knew the complaining witness since
she is her student in Math 2-B from November 1976; that at 3:00 p.m., January
4, 1977 he was at the <span class="SpellE">Ortanez</span> University compound and
at 4:00 p.m. of the same date, he entered his classroom which is Room 206 to
meet his students in Mathematics; that he has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">few </span>students who were present and around five minutes after he
arrived, complaining witness went inside his classroom and joined the class but
because of the number of absences he decided to dismiss them; that while inside
the classroom he talked to complainant in the presence of his students and when
his students left leaving her behind he jokingly invited her to see a movie and
that they will meet at the National Book Store, after saying that he left and
proceeded to the Office of the Vice?President where he stayed for about
five minutes; that he then went to the National Book Store, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City;<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>that he did not threaten to fail com­plaining witness or forced to go
down the <span class="SpellE">Ortanez</span> University; that when he arrived at
the book store, he saw her and they have a short conversation; that they walked
from said store to the International Drug Store around 100 meters away to get a
ride; that they boarded a bus bound for <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> and
both of them alighted <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of the Grand Theatre
along E. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos Ave., <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; that upon alighting from the bus they
went to the lobby <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>said
theater to look for the pictures being shown which she did not like, so they
went walking to Maya Theater also along E. de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Santos Ave., <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City, just around 200 meters away; that when they reached Maya Theater they
bought two orchestra seat tickets; that from <span class="SpellE">Ortañez</span>
University and all the places where they went or passed up to Maya theater
there were many people as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>Security
Guards and Policemen; that they then went up to the mezzanine floor using the
stairs and upon reaching said floor, he gave her P2.00 to buy peanuts but there
was none at the store so he suggested to buy chocolate instead and she bought
Nips chocolate; that at the ground floor of Maya theater up to the mezzanine
floor there were people around and on the ground floor there were guards; that
after she bought Nips chocolate, she went to the comfort room while he waited
for her near the person who collects the tickets for orchestra seats; that when
complaining witness came out of the comfort room there were people in the
mezzanine and they passed by the person who collects the tickets of the
orchestra seats; that he did (not) force her to smoke at the lounging area of
the theater or forced her to eat chocolate candy and the seats near them were
occupied by other movie goers; that after they were seated, he placed his right
hand over her shoulder and finding no reaction, he lowered it to her right side
and again there was no reaction so he tried to put his hand over her breast but
she removed it by a <span class="SpellE">jirk</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That after around 2 minutes, he tried again to put <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his </span>hand on her breast, this time she
held it and she gave by hand a Nips chocolate candy which she bought <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the store at the mezzanine of the
theater which he accepted also by hand, then another for the second by the same
manner and the third one, which she gave it to him by the mouth and he received
it also by the mouth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That he suggested to her to go out because it is very shameful
(embarrassing) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for </span>doing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">such in </span>the place where there are many
people but she did not answer and they went out of the movie after staying for
around 35 minutes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That while they were going out there were many people that they
have passed; that from the Maya theater they walked towards New York street to
the direction of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> and while walking they
passed many people; that they walked towards said street because he suggested
that they go to a private place; that at the corner of New York and E. de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos Ave. there was a police outpost and a policeman
was conducting traffic at the time; that when they boarded a taxi, appellant
directed the driver to bring them to the Rose Garden Motel which is located at
Sta. Mesa, Manila; that she entered the taxi voluntarily and she did not
attempt to get out; that while inside the taxi she asked him where they are
going and he told her that they will go to the Rose Garden Motel; that she did
not make any protest when he told her where they will go; that in going to the
motel they passed by several vehicles and pedestrians along Aurora Blvd., where
they passed; that while inside the taxi they were holding hands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That when they reached the motel they were allowed to enter
by a male person and at the gate there was a guard; that she did not make any
pro­test; that they alighted at the motel compound where there were people and <span class="SpellE">and</span> they walked to the motel to regis­ter; that while
registering there were motel personnel around and when they went to the room
they were accompanied by a personnel of the motel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That while inside the motel room they sat on the bed; that he
did (not) force her to smoke or eat cho­colate candy; that it was she who took
his cigarette when he placed it in the ashtray and puffed it; that for around
two minutes they had a conversation and after that he tried to kiss her; that
she did not protest and she also kissed him so they embraced each other
kissing; that he suggested to her to remove her dress because it might be
crumpled, which she did alone and after she removed her dress they started
kissing each other again while already lying on bed; that she removed her bra
and panty, he also removed his clothes and brief then they had sexual
intercourse without any protest from her; that after they had intercourse she
went to the comfort room still naked and after coming out she lie down beside
him and they were kissing again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That after they were kissing each other, he sat down and took
a cigarette; that they had a conversation and have the second intercourse which
lasted about 2 to 3 minutes, then another conversation about their plan on
their next date on January 8, 1977 while they were still naked; that they were
kissing again and after which they have again the third intercourse; that she
went to the comfort room for the second time and when she came out they had a
conversation that they will go home and they both dressed up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That he did not threaten her while inside the motel and she
was in her natural condition while in the taxi going to the motel and when they
entered the motel; that in going out they asked the permission of the motel
personnel and when they asked said permission she was beside him; that they
walked in going out of the motel compound, passed the guard at the gate and
when they were already at the street they hailed a taxi and boarded it for
Provident Village, <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>; that she did not
complain to the motel personnel, guard or the taxi driver; that upon reaching
the gate of Provident Village, he alighted from the taxi because she did not
want her auntie to see them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That he did not threaten her; that he has many friends in the
school and she could vanish easily, or meaning, to kill her; that she is close
to him since November 19, 1976 and said relationship has not changed after
January 4, 1977; that the following day January 5, 1977 she attended her class
with him in Math and on January 7, 1977 he met her and talked to her and on
both occasions she was in her natural way.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on January 8, 1977 at 10:00 a.m., a Saturday, they met
at the National Book Store, <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, the date, time and place they agreed to meet
on January 4, 1977 at the Rose Garden Motel; that she even arrived ahead of
him; that in the place where they met there were many people, security guards
as well as policemen; that when they met, she was in her normal way but in a
hurry because according to her, her auntie is going to <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>
and she might see us (sic) that is why we had to go to Aurora Boulevard.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That in going to Aurora Blvd., they passed by the alley of
business establish­ments crowded with people, guards and policemen; that upon
reaching Aurora Blvd., he hailed a taxi <span class="SpellE">infront</span> of <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> Filipino where there were security guards and many
pedestrians and when the taxi stopped she opened the door, entered first and he
followed; that when they were already inside the taxi, she was very happy for
having avoided her auntie.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That from <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> to the Rose Garden
Motel the taxi passed along Aurora Blvd., which at the time, traffic was heavy;
that in getting inside the motel compound they passed by the security guard at
the gate and a person opened the door for them; that all this time she was
happy and made no sign of protest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That while he was registering she never attempted to get out;
that on that date they stayed in the motel from 10:45 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. where
they had conversation, kissing and sexual intercourse; that in getting out of
the motel they asked the permission of the motel personnel and they walked
towards the street passing the guard at the gate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That when they reached the street they boarded a taxi for <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City and he
alighted at the gasoline station near <span class="SpellE">Ortanez</span>
University while she went home to <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>; that at
around 5:30 in the afternoon of the same day he saw her at the <span class="SpellE">Ortanez</span> Uni­versity acting in her normal way strol­ling at
the second floor after their short conversation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">she </span>filed
this case against him because her boyfriend, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>
got mad at her when he learned or found in her notebook the word "<span class="SpellE">Lyndiol</span>," a name of a pill for birth control; that <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">told </span>her
that he (appellant) revealed what happened between us (sic).</blockquote>

</span>and had sexual intercourse with her forcibly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In convicting the accused for the crime of rape, the court said
that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"This version of the accused
is quite unbelievable not only because the victim is pictured as a sex-starved
young girl but also worse than a prostitute, who, with everything in her power
will arouse a man to the height of his passion even in a crowded place in order
to get what she wants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is shown to
be even lower than a common prostitute, a tempting <span class="SpellE">Jesebel</span>
and a hussy who made all the aggressive moves to consummate their
intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But even assuming that this
unfounded allusions on the character and behavior of the victim is true, the
Court can (not) but condemn the accused, a professor in a university, a married
man and who because of his age, could be considered a father to the victim, to
take liberties on the body of his young student in a public place and in the
presence of many people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, as an
instructor and teacher, it is his obligation to guide and counsel his students
on what is right, on what should be, on what ought to be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a teacher, he should be a model of good
behavior and morality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His conduct alone
is the best evidence to show his depraved manner and which the Court can (not)
but condemn.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His behavior, in putting
the victim in a situation in which he took liberties on her body, more than
speak clearly and con­vincingly that his intentions towards her were not moral
but on the contrary, immoral and depraved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sad to say that the accused even came to realize later that what they
were doing inside the theater was shameful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Was it really his realization that his intentions while <span class="SpellE">carressing</span> the victim in the presence of many (people) was
shameful?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or was it because his passion
was already aroused to a height that his lust must be satisfied, so that he has
to suggest their leaving the theater?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or
was it because he already came to realize that the victim has become an easy
prey of his human desires and lust?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or
yet, was it because the accused know that after giving the victim chocolates to
eat and cigarette to smoke, her passion was already aroused so that she could
no longer resist him?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answers to
these questions find more meaning in the version of the victim herself."</p>

<p class="BODY">Justifying its conviction of rape against the accused-appellant,
the trial court recounted the evidentiary basis in the following wise and
manner:</p>

<blockquote>"The victim had categorically declared she was given chocolate
no less than three times before copulation and made to smoke cigarette also
twice, in addition to the fact that the accused made threats at her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these in effect, had deprived the victim
of her reason, weakened her resistance which the accused took advantage of in
order to satisfy his lustful and animal desires.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court believes that the three pieces of
choco­late given to the victim which she ate, as well as the cigarette she was
made to smoke, contained drugs which caused her to be dizzy, weak and had also
aroused her passion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the motel, after
taking the third chocolate, her physical condition worsened causing her to fall
off <span class="GramE">the</span> bed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="GramE">condition</span> in which the victim was in, could
not make her offer any effective resistance to any actual assault on her person
and virtue."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier indicated, the accused-appellant was found guilty of
rape and sentenced to RECLUSION PERPETUA; to pay the offended party the amount
of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and the further sum of P1<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">,000.00 </span>as attorney's fees and to pay
the costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court found no sufficient
evidence that there was a forcible abduction of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence presented by the prosecution
does not even show that the personal liberty of the victim was violated for the
same is the essence or nature of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence shows that the victim went voluntarily with the accused
when invited to take <span class="SpellE">merienda</span> until she was given
chocolates and made to smoke, the effects of which after eating and smoking has
deprived her of her resistance when she was raped."</p>

<p class="BODY">There are three (3) well-known principles that guide an appellate
court in reviewing the evidence presented in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">a prosecution for the crime of rape and these are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) that an accusation for rape can be made
with facility; it is difficult to prove it but more difficult for the person
accused, though innocent, to disprove it; (2) that in view of the intrinsic
nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the
testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3)
that the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and
cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the
defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above considerations and after a careful and
conscientious study, analysis and review of the prosecution evidence, <span class="GramE">We</span> have come to the conclusion that the government has not
proved the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is merit to the contention of the
accused-appellant that the act of sexual intercourse he had admittedly with the
offended party does not consti­tute the crime of rape because he did it with
the consent of the latter, there being no evidence showing that he used force
or intimidation nor was the offended party deprived of reason or otherwise
unconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are indeed a number

him four days subsequently on January 8, 1977 at the National Book Store in <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City at 10:00
o'clock a.m. and thereafter both proceeded to the Rose Garden Motel where they
had sexual intercourse four <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">times,
leaving the motel only at about 3:00 o'clock p.m., at which occasion the
complainant never complained of threats, intimidation nor of having been given
chocolate candy to eat or cigarette to smoke and, therefore, con­sented freely
and voluntarily to such repeated sexual pleasure, cannot but indicate serious
doubt and suspicion to her claim of rape at the first instance, that is four
days earlier at the same motel on January 4, 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is quite improbable that the victim of an
alleged rape would consent so soon to another tryst with the rapist and enjoy

and intimidation by the accused-appellant who allegedly told her that she had
two Mathe­matics subjects under him, cannot be believed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a conduct simply is diametrically
opposed to what is expected and is normal to a girl whose virtue had been
destroyed, her honor ruined, for then she would have been furious, bitter and
resentful against him who had violated her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in the evening of January 8, 1977, the
complainant met with her boyfriend, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>,
who brought her to his residence at St. Ignatius Village, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City where he had sexual intercourse with her for seven times, indicates the
laxity of complainant's moral behavior, detracting from the traditional and
proverbial modesty and decency of the Filipina.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The delay in subjecting the complainant to a
medical examination which took place eleven (11) days after the sex assault and
the lack of proof that the cho­colate candies taken by her were really
"drugged" reflect the weakness of the prosecution evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion is inevitable that the complainant was not
sexually assaulted against her will but that she yielded her honor and virtue
willingly.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The original information
filed against the accused-appellant was for forcible abduction with rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court acquitted him of the forcible
abduction charge, there being no showing that the personal liberty of the
victim was violated when she accepted the invitation of the ac­cused-appellant

</span>While there is proof that the complainant was a virgin, above twelve
years of age and below eighteen years at the time and the facts and
circumstances on record show the commission of the crime of consented abduction,
the failure in the infor­mation to allege these vital elements do not warrant a
conviction for consented abduction under the present infor­mation (See Art.
343, Revised Penal Code; <span class="SpellE">Valdepeña</span> vs. People, 16
