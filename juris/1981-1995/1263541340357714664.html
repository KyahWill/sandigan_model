There has been no demand after July 2, 1976 by petitioner directed to respondent school to admit her as required in <i>mandamus</i> action;<br><br>c. To the extent allowed by regulations and considering that petitioner was not yet an enrolled student, and hence the school had no jurisdiction yet to conduct any formal investigation and compel her presence therein, petitioner was given all the opportunity as early as June 14, 1976 to explain her side which privilege she however refused to take advantage of, by being adamant in submitting any explanation, oral or in writing to certain offenses made known to her, after having been compelled continuously to do so at several levels by respondents.</blockquote>That it is within the prerogative of private schools to deny admission of students for scholastic insufficiency, incomplete scholastic records and commission of an offense, like attempt to bribe, violating school regulations."</blockquote>The issues having been joined, the case was calendared for pre-trial on September 22, 1976.&nbsp; The parties submitted their respective pre-trial briefs.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </sup>A second pre-trial conference was held on October 7, 1976 on which date, the court <i>a quo</i> issued the following Order<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></sup> —<br><blockquote>"This is a second pre-trial conference of this case attended by the parties and their respective counsel.<br><br>Considering that this is a petition for <i>mandamus</i> so that the issue is limited to one of law, which is the question of whether respondent school had any legal ground for refusing the petitioner, Mely Tangonan, and therefore there is no factual issue involved, the parties are directed to submit to this Court not later than October 18, 1976, their respective affidavits and other pertinent documents they may wish to submit, in addition to what already appears on record.&nbsp; This is however, without prejudice to the continuous effort of both parties to settle this case.&nbsp; In this connection, the respondents have undertaken to persuade some other nursing schools in Metro Manila to admit the petitioner.&nbsp; If the plaintiff should agree to such admission to some other school, then this Court will dismiss this case if appropriate manifestations are made prior to October 22, 1976, otherwise the Court will decide the case on the merits before October 22, 1976."</blockquote>On October 8, 1976, respondents submitted a MANIFESTATION<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></sup> stating therein that upon representations of respondent Dra. Thelma Clemente, President and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of respondent school, the College of Nursing of the Ortañez University was willing to accept petitioner for enrolment therein, subject to the approval of the Department of Education and Culture.<br><br>On October 18, 1976, petitioner and respondents submitted their respective memoranda.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></sup><br><br>To the manifestation of respondent Thelma Clemente that Ortañez University was willing to admit petitioner, the latter counter-manifested<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></sup> that "in view of certain policies and requirements of Ortañez University she has no recourse but to demand her admission in Capitol Medical Center School of Nursing".<br><br>On October 22, 1976, the lower court rendered its decision<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></sup> dismissing the petition and dissolving the writ of preliminary mandatory injunction earlier issued.&nbsp;

Under Rule 65, Section 3 of the Rules of Court, <i>mandamus</i> lies under any of the following cases:&nbsp; (1) against any tribunal which unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law specifically enjoins as a duty; (2) in case any corporation, board or person unlawfully neglects the performance of an act which the law enjoins as a duty resulting from an office, trust or station; and (3) in case any tribunal, corporation, board or person unlawfully excludes another from the use and enjoyment of a right or office to which such other is legally entitled; and there is no other plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></sup><br><br><i>mandamus</i> is employed to compel the performance, when refused, of a ministerial duty, this being its main objective.&nbsp; It does not lie to require anyone to fulfill contractual obligations or to compel a course of conduct,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></sup> nor to control or review the exercise of discretion.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></sup><br><br>On the part of the party petitioner,<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></sup> it is essential to the issuance of a writ of <i>mandamus</i> that he should have a clear legal right to the thing demanded and it must be the imperative duty of the respondent to perform the act required.&nbsp; It never issues in doubtful cases.&nbsp; While it may not be necessary that the duty be absolutely expressed, it must however, be clear.&nbsp; The writ will not issue to compel an official to do anything which it is not his duty to do or to which it is his duty not to do, or give to the applicant anything to which he is not entitled by law.&nbsp; The writ neither confers powers nor imposes duties.&nbsp; It is simply a command to exercise a power already possessed and to perform a duty already imposed.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></sup><br><br>In the case at bar, the petitioner has miserably failed to show a clear legal right to be admitted and be enrolled in respondent's School of Nursing.&nbsp; As correctly held by the court <i>a quo</i> —<br><blockquote>"Moreover assuming that respondent has a legal duty to enroll petitioner, it does not appear to this Court that this is merely a ministerial duty; it is rather a duty involving the exercise of discretion.&nbsp; Every school has a right to determine who are the students it should accept for enrolment.&nbsp; It has the right to judge the fitness of students.&nbsp; This is particularly true in the case of nursing students who perform essential health services.&nbsp; Over and above its responsibility to petitioner is the responsibility of the school to the general public and the community.&nbsp; This Court take judicial notice that nursing has become a popular course because of the great demand for Filipino Nurses abroad, especially in the United States.&nbsp; It is essential therefore that Nursing graduates who go abroad and become in a sense our own ambassador should be highly qualified to perform their tasks.&nbsp; This is the responsibility of our school and the discharge of this responsibility, they certainly should be given the greatest latitude in formulating their admission policies.<br><br>While petitioner questions the findings of respondent school as to her academic competence, the Court cannot find any legal jurisdiction to interfere in the exercise of judgment of the school on this matter.&nbsp; The Court finds it significant that even the Department of Education and Culture refused to intervene in this case although the Court in its Order of July 6, 1976 invited the Department to send its legal officer as earlier mentioned, it is not disputed that petitioner agreed to transfer to another school during a conference held at the Department.<br><br>The Court, after weighing all the facts, does not find that the present case is one that calls for the application of Article 26 of the Declaration of Human Rights.&nbsp; She is not being prevented from completing her Nursing course.&nbsp; There are many nursing schools in Metropolitan Manila where she can finish her course.&nbsp; But she must enroll under the term, policies and conditions imposed by the schools, rather than on her own terms.&nbsp; She is moreover free to enroll in any of these schools.&nbsp; Respondent has not prevented her from doing so, and has offered to assist in such transfer."</blockquote>On the contrary, respondent School appeared perfectly justified in refusing to admit petitioner in its School of Nursing.&nbsp; Its refusal is sanctioned by law Section 107 of the Manual Regulations for Private Schools considers academic delinquency and violation of disciplinary regulations as valid grounds for refusing re-enrolment of a student.&nbsp; It is incontrovertible that petitioner flunked in Psychiatric Nursing and that as of June 14, 1976, no official report of grades for her summer course in the said subject was or could be submitted by her.&nbsp; Likewise, undisputed, (in fact admitted in her letter of apology earlier quoted) is her involvement in an attempt to bribe the dean of the De Ocampo School of Nursing.&nbsp; She was admitted in respondent's school merely on probation because she could not submit a sealed "Honorable Dismissal" and "Transcript of Records" valid for transfer.&nbsp; On top of that she had a failing grade in Communicable Disease Nursing at the PCC-Mary Johnston Hospital School of Nursing.&nbsp; Her records in respondent's school also show that she did not complete the prescribed clinical experience required in summer.&nbsp; She stopped reporting in the clinical area without notifying the clinical instructor or coordinator.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></sup><br><br>The foregoing notwithstanding, still petitioner would want Us to compel respondent school to enroll her despite her failure to meet the standard policies and qualifications set by the school.&nbsp; To grant such relief would be doing violence to the academic freedom enjoyed by the respondent school enshrined under Article XV, Section 8, Par. 2 of our Constitution which mandates "that all institutions of higher learning shall enjoy academic freedom".&nbsp; This institutional academic freedom includes not only the freedom of professionally qualified persons to inquire, discover, publish and teach the truth as they see it in the field of their competence subject to no control or authority except of rational methods by which truths and conclusions are sought and established in these disciplines, but also the right of the school or college to decide for itself, its aims and objectives, and how best to attain them — the grant being to institutions of higher learning — free from outside coercion or interference save possibly when the overriding public welfare calls for some restraint.&nbsp; It has a wide sphere of autonomy certainly extending to the choice of students.&nbsp; Said constitutional provision is not to be construed in a niggardly manner or in a grudging fashion.&nbsp; That would be to frustrate its purpose and nullify its intent.<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></sup><br><br>Elaborating further on the subject, this Court speaking thru that Eminent Constitutionalist then Mr. Justice now the Hon. Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando<sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></sup> held —<br><blockquote>"Petitioner cannot compel by <i>mandamus</i>, the respondent to admit her into further studies in the Loyola School of Theology.&nbsp; For respondent has no clear duty to admit the petitioner.&nbsp; The Loyola School of Theology is a seminary for the priesthood.&nbsp; Petitioner is admittedly and obviously not studying for the priesthood, she being a lay person and a woman.&nbsp; And even assuming <i>ex gratia argumenti</i> that she is qualified to study for the priesthood, there is still no duty on the part of respondent to admit her to said studies, since the school has clearly the discretion to turn down even qualified applicants due to limitations of space, facilities, professors and optimum classroom size and component considerations.&nbsp; No authorities were cited, respondent apparently being of the view that the law has not reached the stage when the matter of admission to an institution of higher learning rests on the sole and uncontrolled discretion of the applicant.&nbsp; There are standards that must be met.&nbsp; There are policies to be pursued.&nbsp; Discretion appears to be of the essence.&nbsp; In terms of Hohfeld's terminology, <i>what a student in the position of the petitioner possesses is a privilege rather than a right.&nbsp; She cannot therefore satisfactory the prime and indispensable requisite of a <i>mandamus</i> proceeding</i>".&nbsp; (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>Anent petitioner's submittal that respondent Judge acted without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion in requiring the parties to submit memoranda affidavits, instead of setting the case for a formal hearing on the merits - We find the same to be without merit.&nbsp; The very nature of the petition dictates its expeditious determination.&nbsp; This is implicit from Section 7, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court which provides:<br><blockquote>"Section 7.&nbsp; Expediting proceedings, Preliminary Injunction.&nbsp; — The court in which the petition is filed, or a judge thereof, may make orders expediting the proceedings, and may also grant a preliminary injunction for the preservation of the rights of the parties pending such proceedings."</blockquote>In the case at bar, it was evident that on the basis of the pleadings filed, the case did not call for the formal presentation of evidence for purposes of determining whether or not respondent school could legally be ordered to admit petitioner for the school year 1976-1977.&nbsp; Petitioner's position appeared clearly stated in her basic petition which was further amplified by her verified Position Paper dated July 8, 1976; REPLY to the position paper of respondents dated July 23, 1976, petitioner's Trial Brief dated September 9, 1976 and Memorandum dated October 18, 1976.&nbsp; Upon the other hand, respondents' stance appeared thoroughly spelled out in their position paper dated July 21, 1976, Answer dated August 5, 1976, respondent's Pre-Trial Brief dated September 20, 1976, Manifestation dated October 8, 1976 and Memorandum dated October 18, 1976.&nbsp; Moreover, in the second pre-trial conference held on October 7, 1976, the lower court declared that "the issue is one of law and that there is no factual issue involved".&nbsp; Hence, the parties were already required to submit their memoranda and the pertinent documents in support of their respective stand.&nbsp; Petitioner did not question the aforesaid order.&nbsp; Instead, she filed her memorandum.&nbsp; Consequently, she is now estopped from asserting that she was denied the chance to present her evidence in a formal hearing.<br><br>At any rate, as discussed earlier, petitioner is not legally entitled to the issuance of the writ prayed for.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is DISMISSED without pronouncement as to costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Concepcion, Jr., Abad Santos,</i> and <i>Escolin, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><i>Aquino, J.,</i> concur, the petition should not have been given due course.<br><br><i>Makasiar, J., (Chairman)</i>, in the result.<br><br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="LEFT"><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Of the then Court of First Instance of Rizal-Branch XVIII, Quezon City.<br><br><sup style="COLOR: RGB(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Decision dated October 22, 1976;
