<p class="BODY">The people's <span class="GramE">version of the facts are</span> as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"About 7:00 o'clock on the evening of September 17, 1983,
while <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> Poling was walking along Moreno Street,
<span class="SpellE">Daet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Camarines</span> Norte, he
heard a child's cry of '<span class="SpellE">Itay</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Itay</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>' inside the house

</span>Likewise, Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Pacay</span>, while waiting for a
tricycle ride, also heard the child's cry and saw appellant leave the house of
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Barde</span> together with Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Rivero</span> (pp. 10-12, TSN, </span><st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">March 4, 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

inquired from appellant what was going on but, instead of getting an answer,
appellant threatened him with an attack, which made <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span>
run (pp. 6-10, <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="11">Nov. 27, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> ran,

left the area aboard a tricycle, which was parked in front of Salvador <span class="SpellE">Barde's</span> residence (p. 10, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

circumstances of time and place, it was not impossible for the accused to be at
the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense of
alibi <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">should </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">established by </span>clear <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">and </span>convincing evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The requirement of time and place must be

convincingly prove that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">was </span>at
some other place for such period of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">time
as </span>to preclude or render impossible his presence at the place where the
crime was committed at the time of its commission (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Rizalidnay</span>, August 15, 1988, G.R. No. 48269).</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from bringing up the defense of alibi, the appellant
struggles to discredit the primary prosecution witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span>
Poling and Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Pacay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He specifically questions the failure of the
witnesses to testify soon after the commission of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held in <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Coronado</u>,
(145 SCRA 250 [1986]) that the failure of a witness to report at once to the
police authorities the crime they had witnessed should not be taken against
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not uncommon for a witness
to show some reluctance about getting involved in a criminal case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The natural reluctance of most people to get
involved in a criminal case is of judicial notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, <span class="SpellE">Magdahong</span>
ran after <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> Poling with the bolo when <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span> asked about the bloody incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was <span class="SpellE">Magdahong's</span>
companion who dissuaded him so they could leave the place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there should be no doubt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as to </span>the credibility of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their </span>testimonies considering that these
witnesses were subjected to intense and rigid cross-examination during <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The records also </span>show that there was some dilly-dallying by the
police investigators until complaints were filed with higher authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">therefore no </span>reason for us to depart from the well-established
rule that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">findings </span>of fact
of the trial court on the credibility of witnesses should be accorded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>highest respect because <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it has the </span>advantage of observing the
demeanor of the witnesses and can discern if such witnesses are telling the
truth (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ornoza</span>, 151 SCRA 495 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">More </span>importantly,
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">discussions </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>credibility of witnesses should
not detract from or lead to a disregard of other evidences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span class="GramE">were</span> several
prosecution evidence which could establish the guilt of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>Asst. City Fiscal testified that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>accused swore to him his confession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the appellant correctly contends
that his confession is inadmissible since it was signed without the p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">resence </span>of a counsel and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he was </span>mauled and tortured into
signing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the accused that
the confession is inadmissible considering the constitutional requirement that
the same should be made only in the presence of a counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But there is no basis for his claims of
mauling and torture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The confession is
rejected by the courts on the sole ground that it was taken in violation of the
appellant's right to counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The post mortem examination by Dr. Buena <span class="SpellE">Alegre</span>
on the victims corroborates the testimony of the witnesses that they saw the
accused-appellant come out of the house holding the bloodied bolo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case is further tilted against the accused on the basis of
testimony that <span class="SpellE">Magdahong</span> made death threats against
Salvador <span class="SpellE">Barde</span> because he was driven away from his
long time employment as family driver and charged with theft while he in turn
brought cases before labor agencies against <span class="SpellE">Barde</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Magdahong</span> was Salvador <span class="SpellE">Barde's</span> driver and that the former stole the latter's jack
from the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is confirmed by the admission of <span class="SpellE">Magdahong</span>
that he stole the jack (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. T). He even executed a
promissory note that he will pay the value of the jack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magdahong</span>, however,
did not pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he left his
employer and filed a case against him for recovery of wages and separation
pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was dismissed and this
angered <span class="SpellE">Magdahong</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was when he was talking to Rolando <span class="SpellE">Barde</span>
that he made the threat to kill Salvador <span class="SpellE">Barde</span> and
members of his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From these, it is
evident that <span class="SpellE">Magdahong</span> had a motive to kill the
fourteen-year old daughter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and the
eight-year </span>old adopted son of his former employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's insinuation that there could have been somebody
else who killed the victims is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">unbelievable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He was seen running out of the house by persons who<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> met </span>him at the gate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had a bloodied bolo while a voice inside
was crying "<span class="SpellE">Itay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Itay</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances under which the letters introduced by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">defense </span>were written are highly
doubtful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One is an unsigned and undated
letter allegedly from victim <span class="SpellE">Glorina</span> <span class="SpellE">Barde</span> to a certain Noel and another is an undated letter
allegedly from Noel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The letters are

to death and another unsigned letter to "<span class="SpellE">Etchie</span>"

was taking drugs and that this was related to her being <span class="SpellE">boloed</span>
to death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The letters attributed to <span class="SpellE">Glorina</span> are unsigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
