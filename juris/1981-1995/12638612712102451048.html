Case No. 88-44048 praying for a declaration of illegality of the strike of the
private respondents and to restrain the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals denied the petitioner's petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
hence, this petition for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The key issue </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">this case is whether the petitioner, National Parks Development
Committee (NPDC), is a government agency, or a private corporation, for on this
issue depends the right of its employees to strike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This issue came about because although the NPDC was originally
created in 1963 under Executive Order No. 30, as the Executive Committee for
the development of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Memorial, <span class="SpellE">Luneta</span> and other national parks, and later renamed as the
National Parks Development Committee <span class="GramE">under</span> Executive
Order No. 68, on <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1967</st1:date>,
it was registered in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a
non-stock and non-profit corporation, known as "The National Parks
Development Committee, Inc."</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in August, 1987, the NPDC was ordered by the SEC to show
cause why its Certificate of Registration should not be suspended for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) failure to submit the General Information
Sheet from 1981 to 1987; (b) failure to submit its Financial Statements from
1981 to 1986; (c) failure to register its Corporate Books; and (d) failure to
operate for a continuous period of at least five (5) years since September 27,
1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1987</st1:date>,
then NPDC Chairman, <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Lansang</span>,
Jr., informed SEC that his Office had no objection to the suspension,
cancellation, or revocation of the Certificate of Registration of NPDC.</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of Executive Order No. 120 dated <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1989</st1:date>, the NPDC was attached to the
Ministry (later Department) of Tourism and provided with a separate budget
subject to audit by the Commission on Audit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1987</st1:date>,
the Civil Service Commission notified NPDC that pursuant to Executive Order No.
120, all appointments and other personnel actions shall be submitted through
the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Park Supervisory
Employees Association, consisting of employees holding supervisory positions in
the different areas of the parks, was organized and it affiliated with the
Trade Union of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and Allied Services (TUPAS) under Certificate No. 1206.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1987</st1:date>,
two collective bargaining agreements were entered into between NPDC and NPDCEA
(TUPAS local Chapter No. 967) and NPDC and NPDCSA (TUPAS Chapter No. 1206), for
a period of two years or until <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="6">June
 30, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1988</st1:date>,
these unions staged a strike at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

<p class="BODY">On March <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">21, 1988, NPDC </span>filed
in the Regional Trial Court in Manila, Branch LII, a complaint against the
union to declare the strike illegal and to restrain it on the ground that the
strikers, being government employees, have no right to strike although they may
form a union.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1988</st1:date>,
the lower court dismissed the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">complaint
and lifted the restraining order for lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It held that the case "properly falls
under the jurisdiction of the Department of Labor," because "there
exists an employer-employee relationship" between NPDC and the strikers,
and "that the acts complained of in the complaint, and which plaintiff
seeks to enjoin in this action, fall under paragraph 5 of Article 217 of the
Labor Code, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, in
relation to Art. 265 of the same Code, hence, jurisdiction over said acts <span class="GramE">does</span> not belong to this Court but to the Labor Arbiters of
