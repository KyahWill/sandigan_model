with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of preli­minary injunction and/or
restraining order, the petitioner seeks to annul and set aside the resolution
of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, dated 21 April 1989, denying
his motion for a <u>bill of </u><u><span style="">particulars</span></u><span style=""> </span>as well as its resolution, dated 29
May 1989, which denied his motion for reconsideration; to compel the respondent
PCGG to prepare and file a bill of particulars, or that said respondent be
ordered to exclude petitioner as defendant in Civil Case No. 0035 should they
fail to submit the said bill <span style="">of </span>particulars;
and to enjoin the respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> from
further proceeding against petitioner until the bill of particulars is
submitted, claiming that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in
promulgating the aforesaid resolutions and that there is no appeal, nor any
plain, speedy and adequate remedy for him in the ordinary course of law other
than the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As prayed for, this Court issued on 1 August 1989 a temporary

culpability, it is necessary that plaintiff furnish him the particulars sought

denying the petitioner's motion for a bill of particulars on the ground that
the particulars sought by petitioner are <u><span style="">evidentiary</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>in</u>

reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"We are of the considered opinion that the allegations in the
Expanded Complaint are quite clear and sufficient enough for defendant-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> to know the nature and scope of the causes of action

illegal acts which are within defendant-<span class="SpellE">movant's</span>

dated <st1:date month="5" day="29" year="1990">29 May 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner filed the present petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue to be resolved in the <span style="">case at </span>bar is whether or not the respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
acted with grave abuse <span style="">of </span>discretion
in issuing the disputed resolutions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that the allegations of the Second Amended
Complaint in Civil Case No. 0035 (PCGG 35) pertaining to him state only
conclusions of fact and law, inferences <span style="">of
</span>facts from facts not pleaded and mere presumptions, not ultimate facts
as required by the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
by and through the Solicitor General, contends that the essential elements of
an action for recovery of ill-gotten wealth are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) an accumulation of assets, properties and
other posses­sions; (2) of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, Mrs. Imelda <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> Marcos, their close relatives, subordi­nates,
business associates, dummies, agents, or nominees; and (3) whose value is out
of proportion to their known lawful income, and that the ultimate facts
establishing these three (3) essential elements of an action for recovery of
ill-gotten wealth are sufficiently alleged in the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioner is not entitled to a bill
of particulars.</p>

<p class="BODY">A complaint is defined as a concise statement of the ultimate
facts constituting the plaintiff's cause or causes of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Like all other pleadings allowed by the Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
the complaint shall contain in a methodical and logical form a plain, concise
and direct statement of the ultimate facts on which the plaintiff relies for
his claim, omitting the statement of mere evidentiary facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Its office, purpose or function is to inform the defendant clearly and
definitely of the claims made against him so that he may be prepared to meet the
issues at the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint
should inform the defendant of all the material facts on which the plaintiff
relies to support his demand; it should state the theory of a cause of action
which forms the bases of the plaintiff's claim of liability.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The rules on pleading speak of two (2) kinds of facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first, the "ultimate facts",
and the second, the "evidentiary facts." In <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Remitere</span></u></span><u><span style=""> vs. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Yulo</span></span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the term "ultimate facts"
was defined and explained as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The term 'ultimate facts' as used in Sec. 3, Rule 3 of the
Rules of Court, means the essential facts constituting the plaintiff's cause of
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fact is essential if it cannot
be stricken out without leaving the statement of the cause of action
insufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>" (Moran, Rules of Court, Vol. 1, 1963 ed., p.
213).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Ultimate facts are
important and substantial facts which either directly form the basis of the
primary right and duty, or which directly make up the wrongful acts or
omissions of the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The term
does not refer to the details of probative matter or particulars of evidence by
which these material elements are to be established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It refers to principal, determinate,
constitutive facts, upon the existence of which, the entire cause of action
rests."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">while the term "evidentiary
fact" has been defined in the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Those facts which are
necessary for determination of the ultimate facts; they are the premises upon
which conclusions of ultimate facts are based.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Womack v. Industrial Comm., 168 </span><st1:state><st1:place><span style="">Colo.</span></st1:place></st1:state><span style=""> 364, 451 P.2d 761, 764.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Facts which furnish evidence of existence of
some other fact."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Where the complaint states ultimate facts that constitute the
three (3) essential elements of a cause of action, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the legal right of the plaintiff, (2) the
correlative obligation of the defendant, and (3) the act or omission of the
defendant in violation of said legal right, the complaint states a cause of
action, otherwise, the complaint must succumb to a motion to dismiss on that
ground of failure to state a cause of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
However, where the allegations of the complaint are vague, indefinite, or <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>form</u> <u>of</u> <u>conclusions</u>, the proper recourse would
be, not a motion to dismiss, but <span style="">a </span>motion
for a bill of particulars.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, Section 1, Rule 12 of the Rules of Court provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Before responding to a pleading or, if no responsive pleading
is permitted by these rules, within ten (10) days after service of the pleading
upon him, a party may move for a more definite statement or for a bill of
particulars of any matter which is not averred with sufficient definiteness or
particularity to enable him properly to prepare his responsive pleading or to
prepare for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such motion shall
point out the defects complained of and the details desired."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the following allegations have been held as
mere conclusions of law, inferences from facts not alleged or opinion of the
pleader:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the allegations that
defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were "actuated by ulterior
motives, contrary to <span style="">law </span>and
morals, with abuse of their advantageous position as employers, in gross and
evident bad faith and without giving plaintiff ….. his due, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
maliciously, unlawfully, and in summary and arbitrary manner", are
conclusions of law, inferences from facts not alleged and expressions of

(b) an allegation of duty in terms unaccompanied by a statement of facts
showing the existence of the duty, is a mere conclusion of law, unless there is
a relation set forth from which the law raises the duty;<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
(c) an averment ….. that an act was "unlawful" or

(d) the allegation that there was a violation of trust was plainly a conclusion
of law, for “a mere allegation that it was the duty of a party to do this or
that, or that he was guilty of a breach of <span style="">duty, </span>is a statement <span style="">of </span>a
conclusion, not of a fact";<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>

(f) the averment in the complaint that "defendant usurped the office of

and (g) the averment that "with intent of circumventing the constitutional
prohibition that 'no officer or employee in the civil service shall be removed

<p class="BODY">Let us now analyze and discuss the allegations of the complaint
in relation to which the petitioner pleads for a bill of particulars.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As quoted above,
paragraph 9(a) of the complaint alleges that "Defendant Ferdinand E.
Marcos, together with </span>other Defendants, acting singly or collectively,
and/or in unlawful concert with one another, in flagrant breach of public trust
and of their fiduciary obligations as public officers, with gross and
scandalous abuse of right and power and in brazen violation of the Constitution
and laws of the Philippines, embarked upon <span style="">a </span>systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth." In the
light of the rules on pleading and case law cited above, the allegations that
defendant Ferdinand <span style="">E. </span>Marcos,
together with the other defendants "embarked upon a systematic plan to
accumulate ill-gotten wealth" and that said defendants acted "in
flagrant breach of public trust and of their fiduciary obligations as public
officers, with gross and scandalous abuse of right and in brazen violation of
the Constitution and laws of the Philippines", <u>are</u> <u>conclusions</u>
<u>of</u> <u>law</u> <u>unsupported</u> <u>by</u><span style=""> </span><u>factual</u> <u>premises</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nothing is said in the complaint about the petitioner's acts in
execution of the alleged "systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten
wealth", or which are supposed to constitute "flagrant breach of
public trust", "gross and scandalous abuse of right and power",
and "violations of the Constitution and laws of the
Philippines".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint does
not even allege what duties the petitioner failed to perform, or the particular
rights he abused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, paragraph 15 avers that "defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Tantuico</span>, taking undue advantage of his position as
Chairman of the Commission on Audit and with grave failure to perform his
constitutional duties as such Chairman, acting in concert with Defendants
Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos facilitated and made possible the
withdrawals, disbursements and questionable use of government funds as stated
in the foregoing paragraphs to the grave and irreparable damage and injury of
Plaintiff and the entire Filipino people." In like manner, the allegation
that petitioner "took undue advantage of his position as Chairman of the
Commission on Audit," that he "failed to perform his constitutional
duties as such Chairman," and acting in concert with Ferdinand E. Marcos
and Imelda R. Marcos, "facilitated and made possible the withdrawals,
disbursements, and questionable use of government funds as stated in the fore­going
paragraphs, to the grave and irreparable damage and injury of plaintiff and the
entire Filipino people", are <u>mere</u> <u>conclusions</u> <u>of</u> <u>law</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in the complaint is there any
allegation as to how such duty came about, or what petitioner's duties were,
with respect to the alleged withdrawals and disbursements or how petitioner
facilitated the alleged withdrawals, disbursements, or conversion of public
funds and properties, nor an allegation from where the withdrawals and
disbursements came from, except for a general allegation that they came from
the national treasury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top of that,
the complaint does not even contain any factual allegation which would show
that whatever withdrawals, disbursements, or conversions were made, were indeed
subject to audit by the COA.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it may well be stated that the Commission on
Audit (COA) is an independent, constitutional commission, which has no power or
authority to withdraw, disburse, or use funds and property pertaining to other
government offices <span style="">or </span>agencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is done by the agency or office itself,
the chief <span style="">or head </span>of which is
primarily and directly responsible for the funds and property pertaining to
such office or agency.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
The COA is merely authorized to audit, examine and settle accounts of the
various government offices or agencies, and this task is performed not by the
Chairman of the COA but by the COA auditors assigned to the government office
or agency subject to COA audit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in each agency of the government, there is an auditing unit
headed by an auditor, whose duty is to audit and settle the accounts, funds,
financial transactions, and resources of the agency under his audit
jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision of the auditor is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the
Regional Director,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
whose decision, is <span style="">in </span>turn, <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the COA Manager.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Any party dissatisfied with the decision of the COA Manager may bring the
matter on appeal to the Commission proper, a collegiate body exercising
quasi-judicial functions, composed of three (3) COA Commissioners, with the COA
Chairman as presiding officer.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
It is only at this stage that the COA Chairman would come to know of the matter
and be called upon to act on the same, and only if an aggrieved party brings
the matter on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the Chairman of the COA does not participate in
or personally audit all disbursements and withdrawals of government funds, as
well as transactions involving government property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The averments in the particular paragraph of
the complaint merely assume that petitioner participated in or personally
audited <u>all</u> disbursements and withdrawals of government funds, and all
transactions involving government property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the alleged withdrawals, disbursements and questionable use of government
funds could not have been, as held by respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
"within the peculiar and intimate knowledge of petitioner as Chairman of
the COA."</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint further avers in paragraph 17 that "(t)he
following Defendants acted <span style="">as </span>dummies,
nominees and/or agents by allowing themselves (<span class="SpellE">i</span>) to
be instruments in accumulating ill-gotten wealth through government
concessions, order and/or policies prejudicial to Plaintiff, or (ii) to be
incorporators, directors, or members of corporations beneficially held and/or
controlled by Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Benjamin (<span class="SpellE">Kokoy</span>) T. <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juliette</span> Gomez <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> in order
to conceal and prevent recovery of assets illegally obtained:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Francisco</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Tantuico</u></span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, the allegation that petitioner acted as dummy, nominee, or agent by
allowing himself "to be used as instrument in accumulating ill-gotten
wealth through government concessions, orders and/or policies prejudicial to
Plaintiff" or "to be (an) incorporator, director, or member of
corporations beneficially held and/or controlled" by the <span class="SpellE">Marcoses</span> and <span class="SpellE">Romualdezes</span>, is <u>a</u>
<u>conclusion</u> <u>of</u> <u>law</u> <u>without</u> <u>factual</u> <u>basis.<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint does not contain any allegation as to how
petitioner became, or why he is perceived to be, a dummy, nominee or
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, there is no averment in
the complaint how petitioner allowed himself to be used as instrument in the
accumulation of ill-gotten wealth, what the concessions, orders and/or policies
prejudicial to plaintiff are, why they are prejudicial, and what petitioner had
to do with the granting, issuance, and or formulation of such concessions,
orders, and/or policies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Annex
"A" of the complaint lists down sixty-one (61) corporations which are
supposed to be beneficially owned or controlled by the <span class="SpellE">Marcoses</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Romualdezes</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the complaint does not state which corporations petitioner is
supposed to be a stockholder, director, member, dummy, nominee and/or
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More significantly, the petitioner's
name does not even appear in Annex "B" of the complaint, which is a
listing of the alleged "Positions and Participations of Some
Defendants".</p>

<p class="BODY">The allegations in the complaint, above-referred to, pertaining
to petitioner are, therefore, deficient in that they merely articulate conclusions
of law and presumptions unsupported by factual premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, without the particulars prayed for in
petitioner's motion for a bill of particulars, it can be said the petitioner
can not intel­ligently prepare his responsive pleading and for trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the particulars prayed for, such as, names of
persons, names of corporations, dates, amounts involved, a specification of
property for identification purposes, the particular transactions involving
withdrawals and disbursements, and a statement of other material facts as would
support the conclusions and inferences in the complaint, are not evidentiary in
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, those
particulars are material facts that should be clearly and definitely averred in
the complaint in order that the defendant may, in fairness, be informed of the
claims made against him to the end that he may be prepared to meet the issues
at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it has been held that the purpose or object of a bill of
particulars is --</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> to
amplify or limit a pleading, specify more minutely and particularly a claim or
defense set up and pleaded in general terms, give information, not contained in
the pleading, to the opposite party and the court as to the precise nature,
character, scope, and extent of the cause of action or defense relied on by the
pleader, and apprise the opposite party of the case which he has to meet, to
the end that the proof at the trial may be limited to the matters specified,
and in order that surprise at, and needless preparation for, the trial may be
avoided, and that the opposite party may be aided in framing his answering
pleading and preparing for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
also been stated that it is the function or purpose of a bill of particulars to
define, clarify, particularize, and limit or circumscribe the issues in the
case, to expedite the trial, and assist the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A general function or purpose of a bill of
particulars is to prevent injustice or do justice in the case when that cannot
be <span style="">accomplished without the aid of such
a bill."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the contention of the Solicitor General that the petitioner
is not entitled to a bill of particulars because the ultimate facts
constituting the three (3) essential elements of a cause of action for recovery
of ill-gotten wealth have been sufficiently alleged in the complaint, it would
suffice to state that in a motion for a bill of particulars, the only question
to be resolved is whether or not the allegations of the complaint are averred
with sufficient definiteness or particularity to enable the <span class="SpellE">movant</span>
properly to prepare his responsive pleading and to prepare for trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already discussed, the allegations of the
complaint pertaining to the herein petitioner are deficient because the
averments therein are mere conclusions of law or presumptions, unsupported by
factual premises.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandigan­<span style="">bayan</span></span><span style=""> </span>acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack <span style="">or </span>excess of jurisdiction in
promulgating the questioned resolutions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the
petition is GRANTED and the resolutions dated 21 April 1989 and 29 May 1989 are
hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents are hereby ordered to PREPARE and FILE <span style="">a </span>Bill of Particulars containing the facts prayed for by
petitioner within TWENTY (20) DAYS from notice, and should they fail to submit
the said Bill of Particulars, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
is ordered TO EXCLUDE the herein petitioner as defendant in Civil Case No.
