"Alternative Motion to Nullify and/or to Set Aside Decision and Affirm
Orders of the Trial Court or to Refer the Case to the Honorable Court en banc
and to Suspend Time to File Motion for Reconsideration" filed through
counsel on May 31, 1983 with the following prayer:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, it is respectfully prayed that this Honorable
Court set aside and nullify the decision rendered on May 19, 1983 and, instead,
enter an <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the orders of the trial court
sought to be reviewed or, in the alternative, set aside and nullify the said
decision for insufficiency of votes in view of the legal disqualification of
Mr. Justice Vasquez and, instead, refer the proceedings to this Honorable Court
<u>en</u> <u>banc</u> for decision.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the meantime that the matters raised herein are not yet
resolved, it is also respectfully prayed that if the decision be not annulled,
the period within which reconsideration of the decision can be sought, be suspended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Continental Bank, in a Manifestation dated June 1,
1983 and filed on the same date through counsel, Atty. Vicente P. Fernando,
adopted the aforesaid alternative motion and prayer of respondents-plaintiffs

Offices, making reference to the earlier Manifestation filed by said bank through
Atty. Vicente P. Fernando, likewise adopted the aforesaid alternative motion
and prayer of respondents-plaintiffs Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>,
et al.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Saint Rico Investment Corporation, through its counsel
Capistrano Law Offices, filed its "Manifestations and Motion to Declare
Decision Null and Void and/or Motion for Suspension of Period to file Motion

with Notice of Change of Address and Firm Name" dated June 2, 1983

"particularly the motion therein for the nullification of the signature
(vote) of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Vasquez," and
substantially making the same prayer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 17, 1983, petitioners through counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> A. Fernandez, filed their Opposition dated June 10,
1983 to the aforesaid alternative motion and prayer and prayed of the Court to
deny the same for lack of merit and to consider the decision of May 19, 1983 as
final.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main submittal of the aforesaid alternative motion and prayer
of respondents-plaintiffs is that</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Mr. Justice Vasquez is
disqualified from participating in the above-entitled case because while he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">was still the Presiding Judge of Branch VI of
the Court of First Instance of Manila, he sat in judgment on the case and, it
was to him that respondent Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> sub</span>mitted
his proposals (Annexes 'A' and 'A-1').</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, petitioners in open court said:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'ATTY. <span class="SpellE">UBIADAS</span>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>All the arguments and
pleadings had been heard by Judge Vasquez.' (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Feb. 24, 1968, p.
3, Annex 'B' hereof)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under Section 1 of Rule 137 of the Rules of Court,</blockquote>

any inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review,
without the written consent of all the parties in interest, signed by them and
entered upon the record.'</p>

<blockquote>"With Mr. Justice Vasquez legally disqualified to participate
in the instant proceedings, the requisite number of votes for a valid judgment
for a division in the above-entitled case has not been attained, such that the
instant proceedings should be referred to this Honorable Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
for decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">1. The Court finds no factual nor legal justification for
disqualifying Mr. Justice Vasquez from participating in its decision of May 19,
1983 in the case at bar nor "to set aside and nullify the said decision
for insufficiency of votes in view of the legal disqualification of Mr. Justice
Vasquez." As is evident from Sec. 1 of Rule 137, cited by the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> themselves, a member of this Court would be
disqualified from taking part in its decision <u>only in a case "in which
he has presided in any inferior court when his ruling or decision is the
subject of review</u>." None of the motions or manifestations filed by
respondents nor of the annexes of respondents-plaintiffs' alternative motion
cites any decision, ruling or order of Mr. Justice Vasquez when he was judge of
the Court of First Instance of Manila that is the subject of review in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the transcript of
the hearing of the motion of February 24, 1968 before respondent Judge Bautista
(Annex "B" of the alternative motion) makes it clear that then Judge
Vasquez had not resolved anything in the case, particularly with regard to the
"sale and who will be the buyer" and that "there has been no
decision [by him] as to whom the bid will be awarded." His only
participation was due to the pairing system adopted in the Court of First
Instance of Manila whereby as then regular presiding judge of Branch V of the
Court of First Instance of Manila, then Judge Vasquez took cognizance of the
case which was assigned to Branch VI of the same court merely to attend to and
take care of <u>interlocutory</u> matters that came up in the absence of an
incumbent judge of Branch VI, its regular incumbent judge having been suspended
from office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said transcript shows
quite clearly that upon Judge Bautista having been de<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">signated to preside over Branch VI, <span class="GramE">then</span> Judge
Vasquez immediately sent him the records of the case for proper determination
in due course.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Counsels for respondents-<span class="SpellE">movants</span> have
shown themselves less than candid in alleging Mr. Justice Vasquez'
disqualification because he "sat in judgment" in the case below.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records of the case as well as the
decision at bar show the contrary and quite plainly that the orders that were <u>passed
upon</u> and <u>set aside</u> by this Court were the Orders dated March 20,
1968 and May 7, 1968 (Annexes "A" and "B", petition) issued
by respondent Judge Bautista and four other questioned Orders dated De­cember
22, 1966, April 29, 1967, May 23, 1967 and July 19, 1967 (An­nexes
"D", "E", "F" and "G", respectively,
petition) issued by his pre­decessor Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being
no order or ruling whatsoever of Mr. Justice Vasquez as judge of the Court of
First Instance that has been questioned or passed upon in the case, there is
patently no factual nor legal basis to annul his participation or vote in the
decision of May 19, 1983 nor to refer the case to the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
for lack of the requisite number of votes.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The alternative submittal in
respondents-plaintiffs' motion that the annulled orders of respondent court
"should have been considered affirmed as the case was not decided by the
Court within 18 months from the period of its submission" deserves scant
consideration.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without need of
going into the applicability or non-applicability of the cited provi­sion, the
question has been raised only now after the rendition of the decision of May
19, 1983 and respondents-plaintiffs themselves had before then moved the Court
to render its decision (Manifestation and Motion dated June 7, 1978 and Motion
for Resolution dated June 4, 1979).</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Continental
Bank, through still another counsel, N.J. <span class="SpellE">Quisumbing</span>
&amp; Associates, filed its motions dated <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1983</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1983</st1:date>, praying for an extension of fifteen days each, <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> thirty days from <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1983</st1:date> within which to file its motion for
reconsideration of the decision of <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="5">May
 19, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No action is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">taken </span>thereon since they have been manifestly
superseded by said bank's adoption of respondents-plaintiffs' aforesaid
alternative motion and prayer.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The one-page
Manifestation and Motion dated May 31, 1983 filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Augusto</span>
D. Hidalgo, Jr. "for himself and on his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">own </span>behalf" praying for nullification of the decision
"not only because of the death of the receiver prior to its rendition but
also because of the disqualification of Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
M. Vasquez" is noted without action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The death of the receiver had previously been noted by the Court per its
Resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1981</st1:date>
and in no way affects the Court's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The alleged disqualification of Mr. Justice Vasquez has no basis
whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, Atty. <st1:state><st1:place>Hidalgo</st1:place></st1:state>,
Jr. apparently has no personality and does not represent any party in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice Vasquez,
however, in his self-explanatory separate opinion has found himself
"constrained to voluntarily disqualify myself to act in this case, and to
withdraw my signature signifying my concurrence to the decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1983</st1:date>." In deference
thereto, the Court resolved to set aside the promulgation of its decision of
May 19, 1983 and to re-promulgate the same with the presence of the two
members, namely, Mme. Justice Herrera and Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>
who were on leave at that time (with Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>
taking no part).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Court Resolved to SET ASIDE the
promulgation of its decision of <st1:date year="1983" day="19" month="5">May 19,
 1983</st1:date> and to direct the Clerk of Court to promulgate the decision
anew on this date with the presence of its two members who were then on leave
(with Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Relova</span> taking no part).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Continental Bank is hereby further directed to
designate its principal counsel who alone will be entitled to be served with
notices of the Court's processes and to inform the Court thereof within three
(3) days from date hereof, since in accordance with established and orderly
procedure, the Court will not entertain separate and multiple motions from its
counsels but only that filed by its designated principal counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court sets aside the order dated March 20, 1968 of the Court
of First Instance of Manila authorizing the piecemeal and separate sale of
choice corporate properties as well as the order dated May 7, 1968 denying
reconsideration and approving and confirming the sale <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">executed in favor of third parties by the receiver of the main bulk of
the corporate assets consisting of two choice commercial properties, the </span>said
orders having been issued arbitrarily and with grave abuse of discretion, since
what the parties had agreed upon for the purpose of putting an early end to
litigation was to sell all the shares of the corporation or the corporation as
a whole to the highest public bidder, with the buyer to assume all the assets
and liabilities of the corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court accordingly sets aside as void the two contracts of sale executed by the
receiver pursuant to the vacated orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The judicial discretion residing in the courts in the appreciation and
determination of the most competent and advantageous offer among those
submitted by <span class="SpellE">offerors</span> in the receivership sale of
corporate shares or properties must not be exercised arbitrarily or
capriciously, but reasonably, impartially and in accordance with the de­mands
of justice and the terms agreed by the contending stockholders as parties in
interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conflict at bar is between the majority stockholders of the
corporation Hap Hong Hardware Co., Inc. headed by petitioners (defendants
below) Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>, who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">are
</span>full blood brothers born of their father, founder of the business, Lim <span class="SpellE">Sico</span> and his first wife and the minority stockholders
above-named private respondents (plaintiffs below) headed by respondent Alfredo
<span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> who are children born of the late Lim <span class="SpellE">Sico</span> and his second wife, respondent <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
Sing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In December 1966, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>,
Felix <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>, Lim <span class="SpellE">Lian</span> <span class="SpellE">Khoan</span>, Lim <span class="SpellE">Lian</span> Sing, Lim <span class="SpellE">Lian</span> <span class="SpellE">Huy</span>, Agnes <span class="SpellE">Yuson</span>, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Sing (hereinafter referred to as the Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> or minority faction), claiming themselves as the
minority stockholders of Hap Hong Hardware Co., Inc. (hereinafter referred to
as HAP HONG) filed a Minority stockholders' complaint with the Court of First
Instance of Manila (Branch VI), presided by Judge <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, containing allegations of mismanagement of
the business of HAP HONG by the majority stockholders headed by Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>, president of the corporation, and co-petitioners <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gaw</span> Kang, Lim <span class="SpellE">Lian</span> Hong and Leon <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> (hereinafter referred to as the Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> or majority group).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The minority faction sought "a full and complete accounting of the
entire business, income, property and other assets of the corporation from 1958
up to the present" and applied for the issuance of the writ of preliminary
injunction to restrain the Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> group
and its representatives "from withdrawing and/or disbursing funds of [HAP
HONG] either deposited in its name or as the result of overdraft lines opened
in its behalf in any bank or banking institution and from disposing, selling or
offering for sale or mortgaging or offering to mortgage any of the assets or
properties of [HAP HONG]." Thereafter, respondent court through Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, in an order dated December 22, 1966, required the
majority group to show cause why the application for preliminary injunction
should not be granted, but, at the same time, restrained them, <u>ad</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">interim</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">, </span>from committing the acts sought to be enjoined.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority group specifically denied, in their answer, the
allegations of mismanagement and claimed in defense that the minority faction
brought the action with the end in view of destroying HAP HONG "for
motives of their own," and sought, in a subsequent motion, the dissolution
of the restraining order, which motion was opposed by the minority faction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In the first quarter of
1967, the majority group manifested to the court a quo their offer to purchase
the shares of the members of the minority faction at par value plus 20%.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The majority group later imposed certain
terms and conditions on the offer and amended the rate to the higher amount
between P135 per share and the appraisement to be fixed by an independent
certified public accountant as the actual value of each share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The minority faction <span class="SpellE">counteroffered</span>
to buy the majority's shares at par value plus 20%, likewise subject to certain
terms and conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">April
 29, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> issued an order directing that "the res­training
order should be maintained and no party should attempt to dis­turb the status
quo."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Upon a motion of the
minority faction setting forth "the necessity of having [HAP HONG] put
back into operating basis" and praying for the appointment of a
"receiver <span class="SpellE">pendente</span> <span class="SpellE">lite</span>,"
followed up by another motion for the same purpose, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>,
notwithstanding the repeated op</span>position of the majority, appointed
Rafael Contreras as receiver upon a P10, 000.00 bond in an order dated May 23,
1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners' mo­tion to set
aside the hasty appointment of the receiver was denied by Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> in an order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Respondent Rafael
Contreras (hereinafter referred to as the receiver) entered upon his duties as
receiver and, the following July, </span>he submitted to the court a quo a
number of reports as to his activities - the inventory and appraisal of the
assets of HAP HONG, the audit of its books, and the verification of its
vouchers and invoices - and the results thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1967</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
in turn required the receiver to submit his recommendation "on what to do
with the corporation, whether to sell the same or to divide its assets as well
as liabilities among the shareholders." The receiver was quick to propose
in his final recommendation dated <st1:date year="1967" day="31" month="8">August
 31, 1967</st1:date>, "the immediate liquidation of the company and
subsequent sale of its assets and liabilities."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On September 23, 1967,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, by order, required the receiver
"to proceed with the liquidation of the affairs" of HAP HONG and
"to devise ways and means to obtain the Most advantageous offer </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to buy the corporation as a whole</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">on

14.0pt">(Emphasis supplied) The minority fac­tion, taking exception to that
portion of the court directive to the receiver to sell HAP HONG, sought the
modification of the order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On October 3,
1967, Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>, notwithstanding petitioners'
opposition to the modi­fication, decreed the "dissolution" of HAP
HONG and required the receiver "to proceed with the liquidation of the
affairs of the corporation, especially pertaining to the settlement of its
indebtedness and payment of necessary expenses in order to determine the assets
that will remain to be </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">divided
among the stockholders of the corporation in proportion to their respective
shares."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

receiver advertised the sale of the following properties of HAP HONG:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The
notice of sale also stated that "(A)<span class="SpellE">ny</span> single

receiver, by motion, apprised the court a quo of the results of the sale
notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The receiver observed that the
three (3) offers submitted should not be accorded consideration:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Limsico's</span>
offer of P1,100,000 for all the four (4) items for being "much too

"fictitious," and Mariano C. Reyes' offer for, among others, not
being in accordance with the terms of the notice of sale and being
"low".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The receiver also
sought authority from the court a quo (1) to negotiate the sale of HAP <span class="SpellE">HONG's</span> properties, separately or as a whole, to <span class="SpellE">offerors</span> with <u>cash offers</u> in amounts not below the
upset prices set in the motion; and (2) to arrange with the mortgagee banks for
the release of their liens on the mortgaged properties with the court a quo's
as­surance that these prior liens would be recognized and that these <u>claims
would be satisfied from the proceeds of the sale</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He likewise asked the court a quo to
authorize the upset prices of P775,000 for the <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>
realty, P575,000 for the <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span> realty, P236,000

P9,000 for the office and store equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span> in an order dated
December 23, 1967 forthwith empowered the receiver (1) "to make further
negotiations with any interested party, including those who have already
submitted offers to him, for the sale in whole or in part of the corporate
properties" in cash in amounts not lower than the prescribed upset prices,
with the buyer either (a) <u>assuming the obligations</u> secured by the
properties for sale and paying the respective ba­lances in cash to the
receiver, or (b) paying the respective purchase prices agreed upon to the
receiver; and (2) "to make suitable arrangements with t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">he China Banking Corporation and the
Philippine Bank of </span>Communications <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to
release their respective liens over the real properties mortgaged </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">them without loss of their preference as
creditors and immediate satisfaction of their claims from the proceeds of the
sale that may be consummated." Judge <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>
also authorized the upset prices set forth in the receiver's motion and
required him to submit his report on the offers submitted as well as his recommendations
on or before <u>January 15, 1968</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On January 15, 1968, the
receiver submitted to the court a quo his report on the offers proposed,
mentioning therein that, among others, the minority faction Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>, et al. offered to buy, separately, the <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span> realty for P750,000 and the <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>
realty for P540,000 while the majority group Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>,

petitioners majority group, respondents minority faction and the receiver
thereafter submitted in compliance their respective supplemental memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Stated in other words, the core question for resolution relates
to whether or not respondent court, in issuing its order dated March 20, 1968
approving the recommendation of the receiver for the separate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">sale of HAP <span class="SpellE">HONG's</span> <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span> realties
to Continental Bank and Saint Rico Investment Corporation, respectively, and
rejecting the lock, stock and barrel offer of petitioner Manuel L. <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>, soundly exercised its discretion in the interest
of fairness and with due regard for the rights of all parties involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, in any judicial or forced sale, the
determination of whether or not an offer constitutes the most advantageous bid
rests largely in the sound discretion of the court ordering or overseeing the
sale Such discretion must be impartially and reasonably exercised with a just
regard for the rights and interests of all parties concerned and the demands of
justice and fairness, and particularly in accordance with the terms agreed by
the contending stockholders, since basically the sale was based on the parties'
agreement and submittal to obtain the most advantageous offer to <u>buy the
corporation as a whole on cash basis</u> thru public bidding to be conducted
within sixty (60) days from date, the <u>buyer to assume all the assets and
liabilities of the corporation</u>," as set forth in the basic Order of
September 23, 1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The process of
determination proceeding from such exercise of discretion will generally not be
disturbed by the Court on review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, where facts and circumstances establish plainly that respondent
court abused or otherwise exer­cised arbitrarily its discretion to the
prejudice of a party, then the process of determination would be subject to
this Court's scrutiny and remedy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
where respondent court, in acting upon the report and recommendation of the
person so appointed to conduct the sale, applies or interprets arbitrarily the
terms prescribed for the said sale, effecting the exclusion or rejection of a
responsible <span class="SpellE">offeror's</span> manifestly more advantageous
bid, then its process and result of the determination of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>most advantageous offer would be
open to this Court's review <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and </span>re­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">versal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court accordingly finds that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">petitioners' offer was by </span>far <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the most </span>advantageous and therefore grants the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. In the simplest arithmetical terms, even if the corporation's
two realty properties constituting the main bulk of its properties were to be
sold separately, as decreed by respondent court, petitioners' offers of
P1,000,000 for the <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span> property and P725,608 for
the <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span> property were unquestionably by far
higher and plainly more in terms of pesos than that of the receiver's buyers,
Continental Bank's price of P850,000 for the <span class="SpellE">Binondo</span>
property and Saint Rico's price of P610,000 for the <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>
property, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said lower
prices were supported by the minority faction who, as above stated, made the
same offer their own, should respondent court "not feel disposed to grant
the recommendations of the receiver."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners' above total offer of P1,725,608 as against the receiver's buyers'
much lesser total offer of P1,460,000 was formally made in their Manifestation
of <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1968</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

While petitioners consistently submitted that such piece-meal separate sale of
the corporation's choice properties would dismember the corpora­tion and strip
it of the main bulk of its assets leaving an empty shell with the total price
barely enough to discharge its liabilities of some P1,372,000, still they made
it clear and reiterated at the pre-trial conference held by respondent court on
March 7, 1968 that their firm offer for the two realty properties, if
respondent court maintained its stance of selling them separately, was as above
stated for a total price of P1,725,608.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Incom­prehensibly, respondent court arbitrarily swept aside petitioners’
much higher offer and approved the receiver's recommendation to sell the prop­erties
for the much lesser total of P1,460,000 per its Order of <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1968</st1:date>, the rationale whereof is <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> quoted once more for ready reference, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering the final recommendation of the receiver dated
February 14, 1968 to be well taken; considering that the offer of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> is questionable in many aspects, not to mention his
lack of cash to pay for the <span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span> properties; considering that it is paradoxical
that while Manuel <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Limsico</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>could make an offer to buy the entire
properties, yet he is not in a position to pay in cash the two (2) lots
proposed to be sold; considering that the immediate sale would stop the payment
of enormous interest which would accrue to the benefit of all the parties; and
considering finally that the most satisfactory arrangement under the
circumstances in view of the strained relations among the parties, is to order
the sale to disinterested third parties x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">2. The transcript of the pre-trial hearing of March 7, 1968 bears
out the unqualified offer of petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>
to pay the much higher total price of P1,725,608 for the two properties as
against the receiver's 'recommended buyers' much lesser total offer of
P1,460,000, so much so that the presiding judge of respondent court could find
no flaw in the higher price and the receiver himself spontaneously declared

acceptance of petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico's</span> offer for

"final recommendation" of February 4, 1968 to sell the said realties
to the recommended buyers for a much lesser price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The least that could be said is that the
questioned Order's general statement of conclusion without any specific facts
or particulars to support the same, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>
"that it is paradoxical that while Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span>
could make an offer to buy the entire properties [for the gross price of P2,634.124),
yet he is not in a position to pay in cash the two (2) lots proposed to be
sold," was based on respondent court's gross misapprehension of the facts

The<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>mechanics of petitioner's plan of
payment, assuming that all assets were realized and liabilities discharged,
estimated a net figure of some P682,000 belonging to the stockholders, majority
and minority, in proportion to their shareholdings as above stated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No other figure has been submitted by
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will readily be seen
that Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico's</span> personal resources besides the
readily available loan accommodation in the cash amount of P840,000 as
certified by the Philippine Bank of Communications which likewise agreed in
writing to said petitioner's assumption of the corporation's obligations to it
leave no doubt as to his being in a position to pay cash for the two
realties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being the majority shareholder
entitled to the greater share of the net proceeds of the sale of the two
realties, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> need not pay cash to himself
or to the receiver from such share of the sales proceeds, like taking money out
of one pocket to put into the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or
put in another way, petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> as a
major stockholde<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">r</span> who had
actively managed the business since the beginning with his father, would be
buyer and part seller, and in the mechanics of the transaction the amounts to

<p class="BODY">4. <span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the foregoing,
respondent court in disregarding petitioner's much higher offer for the two
realties in its questioned Order on his supposed "lack of cash to pay for
the <span class="SpellE">Dasmariñas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>
properties" acted arbitrarily and whimsically in applying a cash criterion
for petitioner in its March 20, 1968 Order while it itself had adopted a
non-cash criterion in its earlier Order of December 23, 1967 and allowed the
receiver to use such other non-cash criterion for his recommended buyers for a
lesser price.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Per its Order of December
23, 1967, respondent court authorized the receiver "to make further
negotiations with any interested party, including those who have already
submitted offers to him, for the sale in whole or in part of the corporate
properties of [HAP HONG] for cash which should not be lower than the 'upset
prices' set out in his motion …. and with the buyer assuming the corporate
obligations secured by the properties to be bought, the balance to be paid in
cash by the buyer to the receiver, or paying the purchase price as may be agreed
upon to the receiver." Respondent court through the said Order allowed the
sale although not as a full cash operation, since it gave the purchaser the
option to assume the obligations secured by the corporate properties and to pay
the balance in cash to the receiver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, respondent court, in the case of the receiver's buyers made no
exaction for the direct payment of the full purchase price in cash but exacted
such cash payment as a requirement in arbitrarily disregarding the higher offer
of petitioner for alleged "lack of cash" to pay for the properties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

major stockholder such as petitioner to acquire the business that he had built
up and managed through the years as against out</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

advantageous to all the other stockholders, will be respected and upheld.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To order "the sale at a lesser price to
disinterested third parties" of the corporation's choice real properties
and destroy its business and goodwill "in view of the strained relations
among the parties" is to arbitrarily impose an unjust sanction and penalty
of petitioners simply because they are of the majority group.</p>

<p class="BODY">8. In view of the resolution herein of the core issue upholding
petitioners' offer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as </span>far more
advantageous than the receiver's proposal pursuant to the Court's January 14,
1972 Resolution, it is unnecessary to dwell in detail on respondent court's
orders issuing a restraining order against petitioners' operation of the
business and appointing the receiver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same were improvidently and precipitately issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order was issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ex </span><span class="SpellE">parte</span>
upon the filing by respondents of their complaint without any urgent necessity <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and with dire consequences for the business
operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The receivership was
likewise improperly imposed in violation of the basic principle that the
appointment of a receiver, because of its drastic nature and burdensome
character, should be exercised with great caution and only in extreme cases and
on a clear showing of necessity <span class="SpellE">there<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

prevent</span>i<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">on, not imposition, of
grave and irremediable loss or damage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents' allegations of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> and <span class="SpellE">laches</span> on petitioners' part in bringing this action, aside
from being baseless, since petitioners</span> could come up here only after
respondent court had issued its questioned orders of March 20, and May 7, both
in 1968 rejecting their offer and allow­ing the corporation's decimation with
the sale of the two choice properties to the receiver's buyers at much lower
prices than those of petitioners, have been rendered moot in view of the
results reached.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ACCORDINGLY</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, the totality of all the foregoing facts and
considerations affords strong basis and justification for granting the petition
and its submission that respondent court gravely abused its discretion
amounting to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">excess </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of jurisdiction in disregarding and rejecting

8, 1968.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same was manifestly the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">It may be true that none
of the orders </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">Civil Case No. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

questioned in the instant proceeding was issued by me as Judge of the Court of
First Instance of Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also a
fact, however, </span>that in my capacity as the "pairing Judge" of
Branch VI of the Manila CFI to which Civil Case No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">67943 </span>pertained, I presided over several incidents in said
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the extent and nature of
my participation in handling said case now escape me, it has been represented
in the annexes to the motion of private respondent Saint Rico Investment
Corporation that "all the arguments and pleadings had been heard by"
me; that "all matters, recommendations, bids and arguments relative
thereto were submitted to and heard by" me; that I issued an order in the
case dated November <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">5, </span>1968; and
that petitioner Manuel <span class="SpellE">Limsico</span> addressed to me two
letters dated February 10, 1968 and February 18, 1968 regarding his bid to buy
all the assets of the company.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">I agree with the main
opinion that there appears to be no reason to disqualify me on the ground that
I "presided in any inferior court when (his) my ruling </span>or decision
is the subject of review" (Sec. 1, Rule 137) none of the questioned orders
having been issued by me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, my
actuations in the case (the nature of which, as I have said, I can no longer
remember they having occurred more than 15 years ago) could have led to, or
influenced, one way or the other, the issuance of anyone of the orders herein <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">subject of </span>review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">The law does not limit
the disqualification of a judge to the causes expressly provided </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">Wisely, it also explicitly allows a judge,
"in the exercise of his sound discretion, to disqualify himself from
sitting in a case, for just or valid reasons other than those mentioned"
therein (2nd par., Section 1, Rule 137).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appli</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">cable </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">jurisprudence </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">dictates that, in such instances, </span>the matter of disqualification
is addressed primarily, if not solely, to the discretion of the judge
concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">I wish to apologize for
my having participated in the decision promulgated on May 19, 1983 when the
propriety of my having taken part therein could be open to question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fact </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">is, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">my having acted in
the main case as a trial judge has escaped my memory, the same having </span>transpired
since quite some time past, and no reminder of the same having been brought to
my attention until the motion presently under consideration was filed by
private respondent Saint Rico Investment Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am deeply concerned with the legal effect of my voluntary
inhibition to participate in this case on the decision already promulgated
thereon wherein my vote was necessary to comply with the constitutional
requirement of five votes for a decision rendered by a division of this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I feel relieved, however, by the thought
that, there being enough members of the division, excluding myself, who may act
on the case, the situation is not beyond remedy, and the difficulty created by
my inhibition may readily be overcome.</p>

<p class="BODY">With deep regret, therefore, I am constrained to voluntarily
disqualify myself to act in this case, and to withdraw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">my </span>signature signifying my concurrence to the decision
promulgated on May 19, 1983.</p>
