and a research grantee of the Philippine Atomic Energy Agency -- was invited to
take part at a meeting of the Department of Research and Isotopes of the Joint
FAO-IAEA Division of Atomic Energy in Food and Agriculture of the United
Nations in <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Ispra</span></st1:city>, <st1:country-region>Italy</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
She was invited in view of her specialized knowledge in "foreign
substances in food and the agriculture environment." She accepted the
invitation, and was then scheduled by the organizers, to read a paper on
"The Fate of Radioactive Fusion Products Contaminating Vegetable
Crops."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The program announced that she would be the second speaker on the first day of
the meeting.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
To fulfill this engagement, Dr. Pablo booked passage on petitioner airline,
ALITALIA.</p>

<p class="BODY">She arrived in <st1:city><st1:place>Milan</st1:place></st1:city>
on the day before the meeting in accordance with the itinerary and time table
set for her by ALITALIA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was however
told by the ALITALIA personnel there at <st1:city><st1:place>Milan</st1:place></st1:city>
that her luggage was "delayed inasmuch as the same ** (was) in one of the
succeeding flights from <st1:city><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:city> to <st1:city><st1:place>Milan</st1:place></st1:city>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Her luggage consisted of two (2) suitcases:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>one contained her clothing and other personal items; the other, her
scientific papers, slides and other research material.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the other flights arriving from <st1:city><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:city>
did not have her baggage on board.</p>

<p class="BODY">By then feeling desperate, she went to <st1:city><st1:place>Rome</st1:place></st1:city>
to try to locate her bags herself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, she inquired about her suitcases in the domestic and
international airports, and filled out the forms prescribed by ALITALIA for
people in her predicament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, her
baggage could not be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Completely
distraught and discouraged, she returned to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
without attending the meeting in <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Ispra</span></st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Italy</st1:country-region></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once back in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
she demanded that ALITALIA make reparation for the damages thus suffered by
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ALITALIA offered her "free airline
tickets to compensate her for any alleged damages **." She rejected the
offer, and forthwith commenced the action<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which has given rise to the present appellate proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it turned out, Prof. Pablo's suitcases were in fact located
and forwarded to <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Ispra</span></st1:city>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
 <st1:country-region>Italy</st1:country-region></st1:place>, but only on the
day after her scheduled appearance and participation at the U.N. meeting there.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Of course Dr. Pablo was no longer there to accept delivery; she was already on
her way home to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And for some reason or other, the suitcases
were not actually restored to Prof. Pablo by ALITALIA until eleven (11) months
later, and four (4) months after institution of her action.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate proceedings and trial, the Court of First
Instance rendered judgment <span style="">i</span>n Dr.
Pablo's favor:<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>‘(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering the defendant
(ALITALIA) to pay ** (her) the sum of TWENTY THOUSAND PESOS (P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), Philippine Currency, by way of nominal damages;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Ordering the defendant to pay ** (her) the sum of FIVE THOUSAND
PESOS (P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>), Philippine Currency, as and for
attorney's fees; (and)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(3) Ordering the defendant to pay the costs of
the suit."</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">ALITALIA appealed to the Intermediate Appellate Court but failed
to obtain a reversal of the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the Appellate Court not only affirmed the Trial Court's decision but
also increased the award of nominal damages payable by ALITALIA to P40,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
That increase it justified as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Considering the circumstances, as found by the Trial Court
and the negligence committed by defendant, the amount of P20,000.00 under
present inflationary conditions as awarded ** to the plaintiff as nominal
damages, is too little to make up for the plaintiffs frustration and
disappointment in not being able to appear at said conference; and for the
embarrassment and humiliation she suffered from the academic community for
failure to carry out an official mission for which she was singled out by the
faculty to represent her institution and the country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After weighing carefully all the considerations,
the amount awarded to the plaintiff for nominal damages and attorney's fees
should be increased to the cost of her round trip air fare or at the present
rate of peso to the dollar at P40,000.00."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">ALITALIA has appealed to this Court on <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, it seeks to make basically the same
points it tried to make before the Trial Court and the Intermediate Appellate
Court, i.e.:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) that the Warsaw Convention should have been applied to limit
ALITALIA'S liability; and</p>

<p class="BODY">2) that there is no warrant in fact or in law for the award to
Dr. Pablo of nominal damages and attorney's fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In addition, ALITALIA postulates that it
was error for the Intermediate Appellate Court to have refused to pass on all
the assigned errors and in not stating the facts and the law on which its
decision is based.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

an air carrier is made liable for damages for:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) the death, wounding or other bodily injury of a passenger if
the accident causing it took place on board the aircraft or in the course of
its operations of embarking or disembarking;<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2) <span class="GramE">the</span> destruction or loss of, or damage

<p class="BODY">In these cases, it is provided in the Convention that the
"action for damages, however founded, can only be brought subject to the
conditions and limits set out" therein.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Convention also purports to limit the liability of the <span style="">carrier in the following manner:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the carriage of
passengers the liability of the carrier for each passenger is limited to the
sum of 250,000 francs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>*** Nevertheless,
by special contract, the carrier and the passenger may agree to a higher limit
of liability.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a) In the carriage of
registered baggage and of cargo, the liability of the carrier is limited to a
sum of 250 francs per <span class="SpellE">kilogramme</span>, unless the
passenger or consignor has made, at the time when the package was handed over
to the carrier, a special declaration of interest in delivery at destination
and has paid a supplementary sum if the case so requires.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case the <span class="GramE">carrier,</span>
will be liable to pay a sum not exceeding the declared sum, unless he proves
that that sum is greater than the actual value to the consignor at delivery.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the case of loss,
damage or delay of part of registered baggage or cargo, or of any object
contained therein, the weight to be taken into consideration in determining the
amount to which the carrier's liability is limited shall be only the total
weight of the package or packages concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, when the loss, damage or delay of a part of the registered
baggage or cargo, or of an object contained therein, affects the value of other
packages covered by the same baggage check or the same air waybill, the total
weight of such package or packages shall also be taken into consideration in
determining the limit of liability.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As regards objects of
which the passenger takes charge <span class="GramE">himself</span> the liability
of the carrier is limited to 5000 francs per passenger.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The limits prescribed
** shall not prevent the court from awarding, in accordance with its own law,
in addition, the whole or part of the court costs and of the other expenses of
litigation incurred by the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The foregoing provision shall not apply if the amount of the damages
awarded, excluding court costs and other expenses of the litigation, does not
exceed the sum which the carrier has offered in writing to the plaintiff within
a period of six months from the date of the occurrence causing the damage, or
before the commencement of the action, if that is later.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Warsaw Convention however denies to the carrier <span class="SpellE">availment</span> "of the provisions which exclude or limit
his liability, if the damage is caused by his <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
misconduct or by such default on his part as, in accordance with the law of the
court <span class="SpellE">seised</span> of the case, is considered to be
equivalent to <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> misconduct," or "if
the damage is (similarly) caused ** by any agent of the carrier acting within
the scope of his employment."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The Hague Protocol amended the Warsaw Convention by removing the provision that
if the airline took all necessary steps to avoid the damage, it could exculpate
itself completely,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and declaring the stated limits of
liability not applicable "if it is proved that the damage resulted from an
act or omission of the carrier, its servants or agents, done with intent to
cause damage or recklessly and with knowledge that damage would probably
result." The same deletion was effected by the Montreal Agreement of 1966,
with the result that a passenger could recover unlimited damages upon proof of <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> misconduct.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Convention does not thus operate as an exclusive enumeration
of the instances of an airline's liability, or as an absolute limit of the
extent of that liability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
proposition is not borne out by the language of the Convention, as this Court
has<span style=""> </span>now, and at an earlier time,
pointed out.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, slight reflection readily leads to the conclusion that it should be
deemed a limit of liability only in those cases where the cause of the death or
injury to person, or destruction, loss or damage to property or delay in its
transport is not attributable to or attended by any <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
misconduct, bad faith, recklessness, or otherwise improper conduct on the part
of any official or employee for which the carrier is responsible, and there is
otherwise no special or extraordinary form of resulting injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Convention's provisions, in short, do not
"regulate or exclude liability for other breaches of contract by the
carrier"<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
or misconduct of its officers and employees, or for some particular or
exceptional type of damage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
"an air carrier would be exempt from any liability for damages in the
event of its absolute refusal, in bad faith, to comply with a contract of
carriage, which is absurd."<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Nor may it for a moment be supposed that if a member of the aircraft complement
should inflict some physical injury on a passenger, or maliciously destroy or
damage the latter's property, the Convention might successfully be pleaded as
the sole gauge to determine the carrier's liability to the passenger.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither may the Convention be invoked to
justify the disregard of some extraordinary sort of damage resulting to a
passenger and preclude recovery <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> beyond the
limits set by said Convention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is in
this sense that the Convention has been applied, or ignored, depending on the
peculiar facts presented by each case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Pan American World Airways, Inc. v. I.A.C</i>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>for example, the Warsaw Convention was
applied as regards the limitation on the carrier's liability, there being a
simple loss of baggage without any otherwise improper conduct on the part of
the officials or employees of the airline or other special injury sustained by
the passenger.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Warsaw Convention has invariably been held
inapplicable, or as not restrictive of the carrier's liability, where there was
satisfactory evidence of malice or bad faith attributable to its officers and
employees.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, an air carrier was sentenced to pay not only compensatory but also moral
and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, for instance, where its employees
rudely put a passenger holding a first-class ticket in the tourist or economy
section,<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
or ousted a brown Asiatic from the plane to give his seat to a white man,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
or gave the seat of a passenger with a confirmed reservation to another,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
or subjected a passenger to extremely rude, even barbaric treatment, as by
calling him a "monkey."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, no bad faith or otherwise improper conduct
may be ascribed to the employees of petitioner airline; and Dr. Pablo's luggage
was eventually returned to her, belatedly, it is true, but without appreciable
damage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact is, nevertheless, that
some special species of injury was caused to Dr. Pablo because petitioner
ALITALIA misplaced her baggage and failed to deliver it to her at the time
appointed -- a breach of its contract of carriage, to be sure -- with the
result that she was unable to read the paper and make the scientific
presentation (consisting of slides, <span class="SpellE">autoradiograms</span> or
films, tables and tabulations) that she had painstakingly labored over, at the
prestigious international conference, to attend which she had traveled hundreds
of miles, to her <span style="">chagrin </span>and
embarrassment and the disappointment and annoyance of the organizers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt, not unreasonably, that the
invitation for her <span style="">to </span>participate
at the conference, extended by the Joint FAO/IAEA Division of Atomic Energy in
Food and Agriculture of the United Nations, was a singular honor not only to
herself, but to the University of the Philippines and the country as well, an
opportunity to make some sort of impression among her colleagues in that field
of scientific activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The opportunity
to claim this honor or distinction was irretrievably lost to her because of <span class="SpellE">Alitalia's</span> breach of its contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from this, there can be no doubt that Dr. Pablo underwent
profound distress and anxiety, which gradually turned to panic and finally
despair, from the time she learned that her suitcases were missing up to the
time when, having gone to Rome, she finally realized that she would no longer
be able to take part in the conference.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As she herself put it, she "was really shocked and distraught and
confused."</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the compensation for the injury suffered by Dr. Pablo
cannot under the circumstances be restricted to that prescribed by the Warsaw
Convention for delay in the transport of baggage.</p>

<p class="BODY">She is not, of course, entitled to be compensated for loss or
damage to her luggage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already
mentioned, her baggage was ultimately delivered to her in Manila, tardily but
safely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She is however entitled to
nominal damages -- which, as the law says, is adjudicated in order that a right
of the plaintiff, which has been violated or invaded by the defendant, may be
vindicated and recognized, and not for the purpose of indemnifying the
plaintiff for any loss suffered -- and this Court agrees that the respondent
Court of Appeals correctly set the amount thereof at P40,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to the purely technical argument that the
award to her of such nominal damages is precluded by her omission to include a
specific claim <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in her complaint, it suffices
to draw attention to her general prayer, following her plea for moral and
exemplary damages and attorney's fees, "for such other and further just
and equitable relief in the premises," which certainly is broad enough to
comprehend an application as well for nominal damages.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, petitioner should have realized that
the explicit assertion, and proof, that Dr. Pablo's right had been violated or
invaded by it -- absent any claim for actual on compensatory damages, the
prayer thereof having been voluntarily deleted by Dr. Pablo upon the return to
her of her baggage -- necessarily raised the issue, of nominal damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court also agrees that respondent Court of Appeals correctly
awarded attorney's fees to Dr. Pablo, and the amount of P5,000.00 set by it is
reasonable in the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law
authorizes recovery of attorney's fees <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></i>
where, as here, "the defendant's act or omission has compelled the
plaintiff to litigate with third persons or to incur expenses to protect his
interest,"<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
