				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">After the issues had been joined in these consolidated cases, the
Court resolved to give due course to the petitions therein and to decide the
cases on the merits.  It can no longer
allow the parties to delay these cases.  Their legal skirmishes, which have unduly magnified uncomplicated
issues, have effectively deprived the people of the Second Legislative District
of Northern Samar of representation in the House of Representatives for more
than two years now.</p>

<p class="BODY">These cases are sequels to G.R. No. 105717, entitled <i><span style="">"Jose L. Ong, Jr.  vs. Commission on Elections</span></i><span style=""> </span>and <i><span style="">Wilmar P. Lucero,"</span></i><span style="">

the Second Legislative District of Northern Samar in the synchronized national
and local elections held on 11 May 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">The canvass of the Provincial Board of Canvassers (PBC) of
Northern Samar credited Jose L. Ong, Jr. with 24,272 votes and Wilmar P. Lucero
with 24,068 votes, or a lead by Ong of 204 votes.  However, this tally did not include the results of Precinct No. 7
of the municipality of Silvino Lobos, where the submitted election returns had
not been canvassed because they were illegible; of Precinct No. 13 of Silvino
Lobos, where the ballot boxes were snatched and <span style="">no </span>election was held; and of Precinct No. 16, also of Silvino
Lobos, where all copies of the election returns were missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 May 1992, Lucero asked the Commission on Elections
(COMELEC), in SPA No. 92-282, to:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 8 June 1992, Ong moved to lift the suspension <span style="">of </span>the proceedings by the PBC, which
Lucero opposed on 10 June 1992 on the ground that the canvass could not be
completed even if the PBC were to reconvene because no election was held in
Precinct No. 13 (Barangay Gusaran) of Silvino Lobos and there was no canvassing
of the votes in Precinct No. 7 (Barangay Camayaan) and Precinct No. 16
(Barangay Tubgon) both of Silvino Lobos.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 June 1993, the COMELEC <i>en banc</i> promulgated a
resolution, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the Commission hereby orders the Provincial
Election, Supervisor of Northern Samar to bring to the Commission within three
(3) days from receipt hereof the ballot boxes from Precinct 7 and 16 of Silvino
Lobos, to be escorted by representatives from the petitioner and the
respondents as well as other parties who have an interest to protect, and too
notify said parties hereof.  The
Municipal Treasurer of said town is directed to turn over custody of said
ballot boxes to the Provincial Election Supervisor, and the keys thereof shall
likewise be turned over by the appropriate officials in custody thereof to the
PES, who shall in turn give one key for each ballot box to the duly authorized
representatives of the petitioner and the respondent.</blockquote>

votes of petitioner Lucero in the same return, if such discrepancy of votes of
the candidates concerned would affect the over-all results of the election
after the totality of the votes of the contending parties shall have been determined."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both Lucero and Ong have come to this Court by way of separate
special civil actions for <i>certiorari</i> to challenge the Resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 113107, Lucero maintains that (1) the count of the
ballots in Precinct No. 7 of Silvino Lobos must be unconditional because the
election returns therefrom are invalid; and (2) his chances in the special
election in Precinct No. 13 of Silvino Lobos would be spoiled if the returns
for Precinct No. 7 were to be included beforehand in the canvass.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 113509, Ong questions (1) the authority of the
COMELEC to order the correction of the alleged manifest error in the Municipal
Certificate of Canvass of Las Navas despite the absence of any appeal; and (2)
the authority of the COMELEC to call for a special election in Precinct No. 13
almost two years after the regular election.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we see it, the core issues in these consolidated cases are:</p>

<blockquote>(1)  Whether there should first be a count of the
ballots of Precinct No. 7 of Silvino Lobos before determining the necessity of
holding a special election in Precinct No. 13 of Silvino Lobos;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  Whether the COMELEC acted with grave abuse
of discretion in ordering the correction of the alleged manifest error in the
Municipal Certificate of Canvass of Las Navas; and<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)  Whether the COMELEC acted with grave abuse
of discretion in calling for a special election in Precinct No. 13 after almost
two (2) years, or more specifically after one (1) year and ten <span style="">(10) months, following the day of the
synchronized elections.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We shall take up these issues <i><span style="">seriatim</span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer to the first issue is in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the COMELEC's disposition regarding Precinct No. 7 to be
unclear.  In the first paragraph of the
dispositive portion of the challenged resolution, it directs the Provincial
Board of Canvassers "to include in the municipal certificate of canvass of
Silvino Lobos the sixty-one (61) votes of private respondent Ong and 29, 30, or
31 votes of petitioner Lucero as reflected in the election returns (MBC copy
submitted as "COMELEC Copy") of Precinct No. 7 (Barangay Camaya-an),
as canvassed by the special Municipal Board of Canvassers for Silvino
Lobos," and "to submit to the Commission a computation of the votes
of the contending parties including therein all the votes of petitioner Lucero
(with alternative totals) and private respondent Ong, in Precinct Nos. 7 and 16
of Silvino Lobos...." On the other hand, in the fourth paragraph of the
said dispositive portion, it orders the<span style="">
Provincial Board of Canvassers, after "including in the tabulation the
results of the special election of Precinct No. 13," to "decide the
issue of the recount of the votes (ballots) of Precinct </span>No. <span style="">7 of Silvino Lobos, pursuant to Section 236
of the Omnibus Election Code [and] to resolve the discrepancy of the votes of
petitioner Lucero in the same return, if such discrepancy of votes of the
candidate concerned would affect the  over-all results of the election after the totality of the votes of the
contending parties shall have been determined."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, instead of ordering an outright recount of the ballots
of Precinct No. 7, the COMELEC would first give full faith and credit to the
questioned election returns thereof, <span style="">which
it describes as the "Comelec Copy," and, accordingly, direct the PBC
to include in the municipal certificate of canvass of Silvino Lobos the 61
votes for Ong and the uncertain votes for Lucero -- 29, 30, or 31.  The recount would only be made if after a
special election in Precinct No. 13 shall have been held, it shall be determined
that such a recount would be necessary.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We fail to grasp the logic of the proposition.  First, it is clear to us that the COMELEC,
which has in its possession the so-called "Comelec Copy" of the
questioned election returns of Precinct No. 7 and heard the witnesses who
testified thereon, doubts the authenticity of the so-called "Comelec
Copy" of the election returns of Precinct No. 7;<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, it authorizes the PBC to decide the issue of a recount "pursuant to
Section 236 of the Omnibus Election Code." Since it doubts such
authenticity, it could not, without arbitrariness and abuse of discretion,
order the inclusion of the "votes" of Ong and Lucero found in the
doubtful "Comelec Copy" of the election returns in the municipal
certificate of canvass.  Second, it is
an uncontroverted fact that an election was held in Precinct No. 7.  None was held in Precinct No. 13 for reasons
the parties fully knew.  Pursuant to
Section 6 of the Omnibus Election Code (B.P. Blg. 881), a special election may
be held in Precinct No. 13 only if the failure of the election therein
"would affect the result of the election."  This "result of the election" means the net result of
the election in the rest of the precincts in a given constituency, such that if
the margin of a leading candidate over that of his closest rival in the latter
precincts is less than the total number of votes in the precinct where there
was failure of election, then such failure would certainly affect "the
result of the election"; hence, a special election must be held.  Consequently, the holding of a special
election in Precinct No. 13 can only be determined after the votes in Precinct
No. 7 shall have been included in the canvass by the Provincial Board of
Canvassers.</p>

<p class="BODY">We may further state that the so-called "Comelec Copy"
of the election returns of Precinct No. 7 can by no means be validly included
in the municipal canvass.  The summary
of the evidence <span style="">in </span>the
"preparation" of the election returns of Precinct No. 7, both in the
challenged Resolution and in the separate Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of
Commissioners Gorospe and Claravall, leaves no room for doubt that there was
actually <u>no</u> <u>counting</u> of the votes in Precinct No. 7.  Quoted in the challenged Resolution is a
portion of the testimony of Sabina T. Jarito, Precinct Chairman of Precinct No.
7, which clearly shows that on questions by COMELEC Chairman Christian S.
Monsod and Commissioner Vicente B. de Lima, the witness candidly admitted that
the election returns were prepared at the <i>"munisipyo"</i> or
municipal building and not at the polling place of Precinct No. 7 in barangay
Camaya-an.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
This <i>"munisipyo"</i> is located at the <i>poblacion</i> of Silvino
Lobos.  Under the law, the board of
election inspectors shall prepare the election returns simultaneously with the
counting of votes in the polling place.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
There is no evidence whatsoever that the COMELEC had, for valid reasons,
authorized the transfer of venue of the counting of the votes of Precinct No. 7
from the polling place in barangay Camaya-an to the municipal building and that
the counting did in fact take place at the latter.  Although in the Concurring and Dissenting Opinion of
Commissioners Gorospe and Claravall there is a reference to Exhibit
"E," the Joint Affidavit of Sabina Jarito and Mevilyn Surio wherein
they declare that after the voting the Board of Election Inspectors unanimously
approved to transfer the counting of votes to the Municipal Building in the
Poblacion of Silvino Lobos, which was allegedly concurred in by all the
watchers of political parties and the candidates present, the alleged
"counting" at the municipal building was denied by no less than the
Municipal Election Officer of Silvino Lobos, Antonio Tepace, and the Municipal
Treasurer thereof, Mr. Gabriel Basarte, in their affidavits marked as Exhibit
"F" and Exhibit "G," respectively.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since there was no counting of the votes of Precinct No. 7, <span style="">no </span>valid election returns could be
made and any copy of election returns <span style="">purporting
</span>to come therefrom is a fabrication.  A <u>recount</u>  thereof, which
presupposes a <u>prior</u> <u>count</u>, would obviously be unwarranted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only a count then of the votes of Precinct No. 13 would
heretofore be in order.  Sections 234,
235, and 236 of the Omnibus Election Code are thus still inapplicable.  And, in the light of what we stated before
in relation to the holding of a special election, such a count of the votes of
Precinct No. 7 must, perforce, precede the special election in Precinct No. 13.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

in the municipal certificate of canvass of Las Navas was made pursuant to the
declaration made by this Court in G.R. No. 105717 <i>(Ong vs. </i><i><span style="">COMELEC)</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>that:</p>

<blockquote>"The correction of the certificate of canvass of Las Navas is
likewise in order.  Even though a
pre-proclamation issue is involved, the correction of the manifest error is
allowed under Sec. 15 of R.A. No. 7166."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since no motion for reconsideration was filed in that case, the
decision therein became final and entry of judgment was made on 4 August
1993.  Consequently, Ong cannot now
re-litigate the issue of the correction of the certificate of canvass of Las
Navas.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the authority of the COMELEC to order the holding of a special
election, Section 6 of the Omnibus Election Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. </span>6.  <i>Failure of election.</i> -- If, on
account of <i>force majeure</i>, violence, terrorism, fraud, or other analogous
causes the election in any polling place has not been held on the date fixed, or
had been suspended before the hour fixed by law for the closing of the voting,
or after the voting and during the preparation and the transmission of the
election returns or in the custody or canvass thereof, such election results in
a failure to elect, and if in any of such cases the failure or suspension of
election would affect the result of the election, the Commission shall, on the
basis of a verified petition by any interested party and after due notice and
hearing, call for the holding or continuation of the election not held,
suspended or which resulted in a failure to elect  on a date reasonably close to the date of the election not held,
suspended or which resulted in a failure to elect but not later than thirty
days after the cessation of the cause of such postponement or suspension of the
election or failure to elect."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The first paragraph of Section 4 of R.A.
No. 7166 likewise provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. </span>4.  <i><span style="">Postponement,
</span>Failure </i><i><span style="">of Election and
Special Elections</span></i><span style="">. -- </span>The
postponement, declaration of failure of election and the calling of special
elections as provided in Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Omnibus Election Code shall
be decided by the Commission sitting <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> by a majority votes
of its members.  The causes for the
declaration of a failure of election my occur before or after the casting of
votes or on the day of the election."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There are, therefore, two requisites for the holding of special
elections under Section 6 of the Omnibus Election Code, <i>viz</i>., (1) that
there is a failure of election, and (2) that such failure would affect the
results of the election.  The parties
admit that the failure of the election in Precinct No. 13 was due to ballot-box
snatching and do not dispute the finding of the COMELEC as to the necessity and
inevitability of the holding of a special election in said precinct, even if
the result of Precinct No. 7 should be based on the questionable "Comelec
Copy" of its election returns.  The
COMELEC held:</p>

<blockquote>"Based on the adjudged correction of the votes in favor of
petitioner Lucero in the Municipality of Las Navas, the results of the recount
of votes (ballots) of Precinct No. 16 <span style="">(<i>Silvino
</i></span><i>Lobos</i>), and the votes reflected in the available copy of the
election returns for Precinct No. 7 <span style="">(<i>Silvino
</i></span><i>Lobos</i>), it is safe to predict that when the special
Provincial Board of Canvassers will reconvene to sum up the votes of the
contending parties, the original lead of private respondent Ong of two hundred
four (204) votes against petitioner Lucero -- <i><span style="">24,272 as against 24,068</span></i><span style="">
</span>-­- will be reduced to either 175 or 173 depending on whether Lucero
will be credited a low of 29 or a high of 31 votes as reflected in the election
returns <span style="">of </span>Precinct No. 7.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Without preempting the exact figures which only the special
Provincial Board of Canvassers can correctly determine, undoubtedly it is
inevitable that a special election will have to be held in Precinct No. 13
(Barangay Gusaran) of the Municipality of Silvino Lobos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>Given the established lead of private respondent Ong over
petitioner Lucero, We answer in the affirmative.  According to Comelec records, the number of registered voters in
Precinct No. 13 is <i><span style="">two hundred
thirteen (213)</span></i><span style="">.  </span>Since the lead of respondent Ong is
less than the number of registered voters, the votes in that precinct could
affect the existing result because of the possibility that petitioner Lucero
might get a majority over Ong in that precinct and that majority might be more
than the present lead of Ong."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the additional votes credited so far to the
parties,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
the following computation is in order: to Ong's 24,272 votes will be added 2
more from Precinct No. 16, to make a total of 24,274, while to Lucero's 24,068
votes will be added 20 more from Las Navas and 43 from Precinct No. 16, for a
total of 24,131.  Ong's earlier lead
will thus be reduced to 143, which is admittedly less than the 213 registered
voters in Precinct No. 13.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The two requirements then for a special election under Section 6
of the Omnibus Election Code have indeed been met.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fixing the date of the special election, the COMELEC should
see to it that:  (1) it should be not
later than thirty days after the cessation of the cause of the postponement or
suspension of the election or the failure to elect, and (2) it should be
reasonably close to the date of the election not held, suspended, or which
resulted in failure to elect.  The first
involves questions of fact.  The second
must be determined in the light of the peculiar circumstances of a case.  In the instant case, the delay was not
attributable to the poor voters of Precinct No. 13 or to the rest of the
electorate of the Second Legislative District of Northern Samar.  The delay was, as stated in the opening
paragraph of this <i>ponencia,</i> primarily caused by the legal skirmishes or
maneuvers of the petitioners which muddled simple issues.  The Court takes judicial notice of the fact
that G.R. No. 113509 is the third case Ong has brought to this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering then that the petitioners themselves must share the blame for the
delay, and taking into account the fact that since the term of office of the
contested position is only three years, the holding of a special election in
Precinct No. 13 within the next few months may still be considered
"reasonably close to the date of the election not held." Ong's
postulation should then be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the deliberations on these cases, the Court
considered the possible application, by analogy, of Section 10, Article VII of
the 1987 Constitution providing that no special election in the event of a vacancy
in the Offices of the President and Vice President "shall be called if the
vacancy occurs within eighteen months before the date of the next presidential
election," and of the second paragraph of Section 4 of R.A. No. 7166 which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"In case a permanent vacancy shall occur in the Senate or
House of Representatives at least one (1) year before the expiration of the
term, the Commission shall call and hold a special election to fill the vacancy
not earlier than sixty (60) days nor longer than ninety (90) days after the
occurrence of the vacancy.  However, in
case of such vacancy in the Senate, the special election shall be held
simultaneously with the next succeeding regular election."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A view was expressed that we should not
hold the special election because the underlying philosophy for the prohibition
to hold the special election if the vacancy occurred within a certain period
before the next presidential election or the next regular election, as the case
may be, is obviously the avoidance of the expense to be incurred in the holding
of a special election when a regular election is, after all, less than a year
away.  The Court ultimately resolved
that the aforesaid constitutional and statutory proscriptions are inapplicable
to special elections which may be called under Section 6 of the Omnibus
Election Code.  First, the special
election in the former is to fill permanent vacancies in the Office of the
President, Vice President, and Members of Congress occurring after the
election, while the special election under the latter is due to or by reason of
a failure of election.  Second, a
special election under Section 6 would entail minimal costs because it is
limited to only the precincts involved and to the candidates who, by the result
of the election in a particular constituency, would be affected by the failure
of election.  On the other hand, the
special election for the Offices of the President, Vice President, and Senators
would be nation-wide, and that of a Representative, district-wide.  Third, Section 6, when specifically applied
to the instant case, presupposes that no candidate had been proclaimed and
therefore the people of the Second Legislative District of <span style="">Northern Samar would be unrepresented in the
House of Representatives until the special election shall ultimately determine
the winning candidate, such that if none is held, they would have no
representation until the end of the term.  Under the aforesaid constitutional and statutory provisions, the elected
officials have already served their constituencies for more than one-half of
their terms of office.  Fourth, if the
law had found it fit to provide </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">specific and determinate
time-frame</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">for the holding of a special election under
Section 6, then it could have easily done so in Section 4 of R.A. No. 7166.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another serious obstacle to Ong's proposition is that,
considering the COMELEC's disposition of Precinct No. 7 in the challenged
Resolution, he would then be declared and proclaimed the duly elected
Representative of the Second Legislative District of Northern Samar despite the
fact that as earlier observed, there was no counting of the votes of Precinct
No. 7, and the results of the district elections for Representative would be
affected by the failure of the election in Precinct No. 13.  To accept the proposition is to allow a
proclamation based on an incomplete canvass where the final result would have
been affected by the uncanvassed result of Precinct No. 7 and by the failure of
the election in Precinct No. 13 and to impose upon the people of the Second
Legislative District of Northern Samar a Representative whose mandate is, at
the very least, uncertain, and at the most, inexistent.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Unavailing is Ong's assertion that the registered voters in Precinct No. 13
have been reduced from 213 to 185 as a result of the transfer and death of some
of the voters.  The original and
exclusive jurisdiction over all matters of inclusion and exclusion of voters
from the voter's list lies with the municipal and metropolitan trials court under
Section 138 of the Omnibus Election Code (as amended). Their decisions are
appealable to the proper regional trial court, whose decisions are immediately
final and executory.</p>
