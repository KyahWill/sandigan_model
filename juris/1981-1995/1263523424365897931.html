At about 9:00 p.m. on October 9, 1982, Aristedes Sarmiento and his wife,
 Laura del Castillo Sarmiento, were apprehended by armed men in civilian
 attire as the couple left the Rosarian Hotel in Gumaca, Quezon.  They 
were brought to Camp Arsenio Natividad, also in Gumaca, where they were 
interrogated without benefit of counsel.  Laura was then eight months 
pregnant.  She was not maltreated; at least she made no claim to that 
effect.  But Aristedes complained that he was struck at his side with 
the barrel of an Armalite rifle.
<p>
The spouses were not released from detention despite the fact that they 
were said to have been merely invited for questioning.  For this reason,
 Ignacio del Castillo, father of Laura, filed the instant petition for 
the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus on October 20, 1982, with the 
assistance of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG).  We issued the 
writ on October 21, 1982; required the respondents to make a return on 
October 27, 1982; and set the case for hearing on October 28, 1982.
</p><p>
The return of the writ states in part:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "2.     The evidence in the hands of the military shows that at 
the time of his arrest, Aristedes Sarmiento headed an operating unit of 
the New People's Army (NPA) called the Pangkat JACINTO-BONIFACIO.  This 
unit conducts agitation propaganda among the farmers and directly 
recruits members for the NPA.  Laura Sarmiento was the unit's finance 
officer. </p>
  <p> "3.     On October 14, 1982, Aristedes and Laura Sarmiento were 
charged with violation of the Revised Anti-Subversion Law (P.D. 885) as 
ranking leaders of the NPA in a complaint filed before the Municipal 
Court of Gumaca, Quezon in Criminal Case No. 8053.  A copy of that 
Complaint is hereby attached as Annex 1. </p>
  <p> “4.     Upon preliminary examination duly had, the court found 
probable cause against the subject accused.  Accordingly, they were 
ordered detained pending further proceedings in their case.  A copy of 
the court's directive committing the persons of the accused to the 
custody of the 232nd PC Company is attached hereto as Annex 2. </p>
  <p> “5.     Since Aristedes and Laura Sarmiento are being held by 
virtue of a valid order of the Municipal Court of Gumaca, Quezon, the 
writ of habeas corpus will not lie in their case.  (Luna vs. Plaza, 26 
SCRA 310; Celeste vs. People, 31 SCRA 391; Canary vs. Director of 
Prisons, 36 SCRA 29)."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On November 3, 1982, the respondents filed a supplement to the return of the writ.  It states, <em>inter alia</em>,
 that "a Presidential Commitment Order against Aristedes and Laura 
Sarmiento was issued by the President of the Philippines on October 27, 
1982, for the crime of subversion." A copy of the PCO was attached as 
Annex 1 to the supplement.  (<em>Rollo</em>, p. 45.)
</p><p>
Laura Sarmiento was temporarily released on March 14, 1983, for 
humanitarian reasons.  She gave birth during detention and she was 
released to enable her to provide proper care for the infant child.
</p><p>
On March 31, 1983, the Sarmiento spouses were accused of subversion in 
two separate informations filed with the Regional Trial Court of Gumaca,
 Quezon.  After the prosecution had presented its evidence and rested 
its case, the defense moved to dismiss the charges for insufficiency of 
evidence.  And on March 15, 1984, the trial court issued an order 
dismissing the cases against the Sarmiento spouses.  In doing so, the 
trial court said in part:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "After a careful and thorough examination and evaluation of the 
entire records in these two cases, this Court has arrived at the 
conclusion, that there is no prima facie case, or much less, probable 
cause, to let the Sarmiento couple stand trial on the charges against 
them. </p>
  <p> "The sworn statement of prosecution witness, Luisito Marcuap, 
(Exh. A) executed by him together with P/Cpl Rolando Gonzales and C2C 
Jaime Mendoza, states, that he came to know about the Sarmiento couple 
only on October 9, 1982, which he confirmed in open court, upon 
clarificatory question by this Court, when he admitted that before said 
date he never had opportunity to see what said couple was doing, and 
that his knowledge about them was merely based upon information. </p>
  <p> "Indeed, there is nothing that the Armed Forces of the Philippines
 or any of the law enforcement agencies of the Government, could offer 
to prove any connection of the Sarmiento couple with any subversive 
organization, even with the New People's Army, if ever it is to be 
considered such, and much more as leaders thereof.  It seems that the 
investigative agencies of the Armed Forces, notably the Philippine 
Constabulary with its highly efficient intelligence network, did not 
have any documented dossier against the Sarmiento couple, such as their 
being in the order of battle of the NPA as ranking leaders or even as 
members or mere sympathizers.  All information obtained by them, come 
from surrenderees.  But then, even the information gathered by them from
 such surrenderees, who were not presented on the witness stand, 
especially Honorio Estrada, would seem to indicate, that the NPA itself 
was not certain whether or not the Sarmiento couple were with it, so 
much so, that said surrenderee was sent to verify such fact." (<em>Rollo</em>, pp. 108-109.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Despite the dismissal of the charges, Aristedes Sarmiento was not released from confinement.
</p><p>
In a letter dated March 29, 1984, addressed to Defense Minister Juan 
Ponce Enrile, Atty. Jose W. Diokno of FLAG asked for the immediate 
release of Aristedes.  He was not released.  Accordingly, an Urgent 
Motion was filed with this Court on May 16, 1984, wherein it is prayed 
that the immediate release of Aristedes Sarmiento be ordered.
</p><p>
The respondents were required to comment on the Urgent Motion and after 
considerable delay they did so on July 14, 1984.  They said that the 
Minister of Defense ordered the release of Aristedes on July 6, 1984, 
and he was actually released on July 11, 1984, at 2:30 p.m.  They pray 
that the petition for habeas corpus being moot and academic be 
dismissed.
</p><p>
The majority of the Court, which does not include the undersigned <em>ponente</em>,
 is of the opinion that the petition for habeas corpus has become moot 
and academic because the Sarmiento spouses are no longer in detention.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    WHEREFORE, the instant petition is hereby dismissed on the ground 
that it has been rendered moot and academic and it is so ordered.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The undersigned <em>ponente </em>is constrained to disagree with the majority of the Court and the statements following are entirely his own:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  I believe that the Court should have resolved the petition on 
the merits and it is for this reason that on the face of the Urgent 
Motion praying for the release of Aristedes Sarmiento after the trial 
court had dismissed the two cases against the spouses that I voted for 
immediate affirmative relief.
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> The unstated premise of the majority opinion is that a person who is
 detained under a PCO cannot be released except by executive action even
 if the charges against him have been dismissed or he has been acquitted
 by a court of competent jurisdiction.  I hold the contrary view; it is 
consistent with what I have previously adopted, namely: "if and when a 
formal complaint is presented, the court steps in and the executive 
steps out." (Morales, Jr. vs. Enrile, G.R. No. 61016, April 26, 1983, 
121 SCRA 538, 594-596.) In the case at bar since the Sarmiento spouses 
had been brought before a court of competent jurisdiction, the fact that
 they were covered by a PCO is of no consequence; the court which 
acquired jurisdiction over them could order their release without 
recourse to executive action. </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
      2.  The military authorities acted in a cavalier fashion in 
assessing the evidence against the Sarmientos which proved to be so 
worthless that they did not even have to rebut it.  The whole process, 
from their arrest to their continued detention under a PCO, was a 
serious affront to their liberties.
    </p>
</blockquote>

<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
TEEHANKEE, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I am constrained to dissent from the Court majority's dismissal of the 
case for "being moot and academic" because the accused-detainee, 
Aristedes Sarmiento, was eventually released from detention on July 11, 
1984 or four (4) months after his acquittal.
</p><p>
I agree with the disagreement of the ponente, Mr. Justice Abad Santos, 
with such dismissal and with the grounds stated by him that "the Court 
should have resolved the petition on the merits" and that “since the 
Sarmiento spouses had been brought before a court of competent 
jurisdiction, the fact that they were covered by a PCO is of no 
consequence; the court which acquired jurisdiction over them could order
 their release without recourse to executive action."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  I likewise agree with his statement that "(T)he whole process, from 
their arrest to their continued detention under a PCO, was a serious 
affront to their liberties," as well as with Mr. Justice Felix V. 
Makasiar’s suggestion that "(T)he military establishment should inquire 
into whether the President was deceived into issuing the PCO and who 
initiated the arrest of the couple without supporting evidence.”
</p><p>
With the regional trial court's dismissal on March 15, 1984 of the 
charges for subversion against the accused Sarmiento spouses for utter 
"worthlessness of evidence," the urgent motion filed on May 16, 1984 in 
this habeas corpus proceeding for Aristedes Sarmiento's immediate 
release<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  (after his 
counsel's administrative appeal through the Minister of National Defense
 for his release had failed and two months had already gone by since the
 spouses' acquittal) should have been immediately granted 
notwithstanding Aristedes Sarmiento's detention under a Presidential 
Commitment Order (PCO).  As it is, Aristedes was released on July 11, 
1984 only after still two more months' delay, when the PCO was finally 
lifted - an agonizing wait after almost two years (short by three 
months) of detention found by final judgment to be totally bereft of 
basis and evidence.
</p><p>
If the Rule of Law means anything, a judgment of acquittal must prevail 
over the PCO.  When the competent court has rendered a judgment of 
acquittal of charges of subversion and/or other national 
security-related offenses, the accused who is held on no other lawful 
cause is entitled to be forthwith set at liberty regardless of the PCO. 
 Aristedes therefore was entitled to his release from the date of his 
acquittal on March 15, 1984.  The Court should so rule squarely, instead
 of dismissing the case as moot.  The issue at bar is a decisive and 
fundamental issue of public interest and importance affecting the very 
liberties of the people.  The vital issue demands to be resolved, rather
 than emasculated with a dismissal of the case as moot, for the guidance
 of public respondents and all concerned.
</p><p>
This case is but a replica of the <em>Cañete </em>case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  wherein the public respondents likewise failed and/or refused to 
release the therein accused, Renato Cañete, despite his acquittal by the
 trial court, on the ground that such acquittal "does not affect the 
effectivity of the PCO (which is) beyond the ambit of judicial inquiry,"
 citing the majority ruling in the <em>Padilla-Parong</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  and <em>Morales</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  cases.  I have filed my separate opinion in the said case, dissenting 
from the Court's dismissal of the case as having likewise become moot 
after Cañete's eventual release by the military on May 7, 1983, three 
months after his acquittal - not by virtue of his acquittal but because 
the PCO had been lifted.  I likewise urged that the Court should have 
therein ruled squarely on the fundamental issue of the effect of a 
decision of acquittal upon a PCO, and to hold that a ver­dict of 
acquittal entitles the accused to his liberty, despite the PCO, which 
thereby became<em> functus officio</em>.
</p><p>
It is imperative then, in order to avoid countless other <em>Cañetes</em> and Sarmientos, that in the language of the now Chief Justice in <em>De la Camara vs. Enage</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  "the fact that this case is moot and academic should not preclude this
 Tribunal from setting forth in language clear and unmistakable . . . . 
for the guidance of lower court judges, the controlling and 
authoritative doctrines that should be observed" in according full 
respect to constitutional rights (referring in said case to the 
constitutional mandate that excessive bail shall not be required - 
notwithstanding that petitioner-accused had meanwhile escaped from the 
provincial jail - since the issue in the case was not alone the fate of 
therein petitioner).  As stressed by the late Chief Justice Fred Ruiz 
Castro in <em>Aquino, Jr. v. Enrile</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
 , "the fact that a final determination of a question involved in an 
action is needed will be useful as a guide for the conduct of public 
officers or tribunals is a sufficient reason for retaining an action 
which would or should otherwise be dismissed.  Likewise appeals may be 
re­tained if the questions involved are likely to arise frequently in 
the future unless they are settled by a court of last resort."
</p><p>
I reiterate my stand in the above-cited case of <em>Cañete</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  that in such cases of conflicting claims of authority, the 
individual's right to be set at liberty by virtue of his acquittal by 
the courts must prevail over the military's claim of a right to continue
 holding him in detention under the PCO.  Former Chief Justice Roberto 
Concepcion rightfully observed in <em>People vs. Hernandez</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  that "individual freedom is too basic, too transcendental and vital in
 a republican state, like ours, to be denied upon mere general 
principles and abstract considerations of public safety." For brevity's 
sake, I herewith re­produce by reference my said separate opinion which 
fully applies, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, in view of the identical issues involved, to the case at bar.
