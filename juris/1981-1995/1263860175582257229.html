praying that: (a) Presidential Decree No. 1789 otherwise <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">known <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span></span>the "Omnibus Investment Code," dated January 16, 1981,
the 1981 Investment Priorities Plan and Executive Order No. 676 which approved
the said plan dated April 10, 1981; and (b) Presidential Decree No. 1892 which
allowed an increase in foreign equity participation in preferred areas of
investment effective for one (1) year dated December 4, 1983, all be declared
unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered from the records, the factual background of this <span class="GramE">case,</span> is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 16, 1981 or one day before President Ferdinand E. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">M</span>a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">rcos
</span>signed Proclamation No. 2045 announcing the lifting of Martial Law in
the Philippines, he, pursuant to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">his
legislative or </span>decree-making power under both the 1935 Constitution and
the transitory provisions of the 1973 Constitution, issued P.D. No. 1789
otherwise known as the Omnibus Investment Code, revising, modifying and
amending R.A. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">No. </span>5186 and R.A.
No. 6135, both enacted by the Congress of the Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter or on <st1:date year="1983" day="4" month="12">December
 4, 1983</st1:date>, President Marcos issued P.D. No. 1892, suspending for a
period of one year from date of its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> the
nationality requirement of at least 60% Philippine Nationals for non-pioneer
industries entitled to registration under aforementioned P.D. No. 1789.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner NEPA, suing as citizens of the Philippines, taxpayers,
businessmen, officers and members of said association, who allegedly stand to
be adversely affected by the enforcement or continued enforcement of the
aforementioned presidential decrees (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 1-4)
filed the instant petition in this Court, seeking to enjoin public respondents
from enforcing said decrees as well as "The Investment Priorities
Plan" actually a memorandum of the Minister of Trade to the President,
consisting of preferred areas of economic activity that are entitled to
investment incentives under P.D. 1789 and Executive Order No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">676, entitled "Approving the 1981

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General for the respondents filed his separate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">comments on </span>the petition, on <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1984</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

filed and deliberating on the issues raised in the petition for prohibition
with preliminary injunction with prayer for a restraining order and on the
amended and/or supplemental petition as well as the respondents' separate
comments on the petition and on the amended and/or supplemental petition, gave
due course to the petition on August 27, 1985 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 148).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties were required to
file simultaneous memoranda in the resolution dated <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1986</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p. 152).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Solicitor General filed a manifestation in lieu of memorandum (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 155), which the Court noted on <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="4">April
 3, 1986</st1:date> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>., </span>p.

13.0pt">p. </span>175).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners raised the following issues:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to P.D. 1789, they claim that
while it <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>issued during
martial law, the subject matter of the decree does not relate to the
emergencies of invasion, insurrection, rebellion or imminent danger thereof,
which are the only situations where the President's martial law legislative
power may be exercised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, even
assuming that it was issued pursuant to Amendment No. 6 of the Constitution
still, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pre-conditions for the
exercise of legislative power by the President did not exist.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to P.D. 1892, the pre-conditions
for the exercise of legislative power by the President, under Amendment No. 6
were similarly absent aside from the fact that it violates due process and
equal protection clauses of the Constitution and is repugnant to the
nationalistic and conserving spirit of the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the Investment Priorities
Plan and Executive Order No. 676 which approves it, they claim that said plan
and order offend Sections 8 and 9 of Article XIV of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 58-59)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other extreme, the Solicitor General for the respondents
contend that petitioners have no personality and standing to sue in the absence
of an actual controversy concerning the enforcement of the Presidential Decrees
in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said laws are valid as they
were issued Pursuant to Amendment No. 6 of the 1973 Constitution, the
preconditions for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their issuance were
present and neither does P.D. 1892 violate the due process and equal </span>protection
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">clause of the Constitution, nor does it
extend the Parity Amendment and the Laurel-Langley Agreement; the 1981
Investment Priorities Plan and Executive Order No. 676 do not offend Sections 8
and 9, Article XIV, of the </span>1973 Constitution (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 59<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">-</span>79).</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled rule that no constitutional question will be
heard and resolved unless the following requisites of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>judicial inquiry are present: (1)
the existence of an appropriate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">case; (2)
an interest personal and substantial by the party raising the constitutional
question; (3) the plea that the function be exercised at the earliest
opportunity; and (4) the necessity that the constitutional question be passed
upon in order to decide the case (People v. Vera, 65 Phil. 56 [1937]; <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> v. COMELEC, 95 SCRA 400 [1980]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners merely complied with the third <span class="GramE">requisite,
that</span> of raising the issue of constitutionality at the earliest instance
in their pleadings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition is
deficient as to the other three criteria.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise stated, the power of judicial review is limited to the
determination of actual cases and controversies, which are obviously absent in
the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners question the constitutionality of Sections 1 and 3 of
P.D. 1892 in relation to P. D. 1789, the 1981 Investment Priorities Plan and
Executive Order No. 676 quoted earlier, as being <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the due process and equal protection clauses of the 1973 Constitution as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">well </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>Sections 8 and 9 of Article XIV
thereof, and seek to prohibit respondent Minister of Finance from implementing
said laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, not even one of the
petitioners has been adversely affected by the application of those provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No actual conflict has been alleged wherein
the petitioner could validly and possibly say that the increase in foreign
equity participation in non-pioneer areas of investment from the period of
December 2, 1983 to December 4, 1984 had any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">direct bearing on them, such as considerable rise in unemployment, real
increase in foreign investment, unfair competition with Philippine nationals,
exploitation of the country's natural resources by f</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">o</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reign
investors under the decrees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
advance an abstract, hypothetical issue which is in effect a petition for an
advisory opinion from this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, the constitutionality of a statute will be
passed upon only if, and to the extent that it is directly and necessarily
involved in <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversy and is essential
to the protection of the rights of the parties concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, this Court has ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"The power of courts to declare a law unconstitutional arises
only when the interests of litigants require the use of that judicial authority
for their protection against actual interference, a hypothetical threat being
insufficient." <span class="GramE">(United Public Works vs. </span><st1:place><st1:city><span class="GramE">Mitchell</span></st1:city><span class="GramE">, </span><st1:country-region><span class="GramE">U.S.</span></st1:country-region></st1:place><span class="GramE">

<p class="BODY">The unchallenged rule is that the person who impugned the
validity of a statute must have a personal and substantial interest in the
case, such that he has sustained or will <span class="GramE">sustain,</span>
direct injury as a result of its enforcement (People v. Vera, <u>supra</u>;<u> </u><span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> v. COMELEC, <u>supra</u>, p. 402).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of petitioners, not one of them has averred to have
been adversely affected by the operation of the statutory provisions they
assail as unconstitutional.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They have no
personal <span class="GramE">nor</span> substantial interest at stake.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any legal conflict, they
can claim no <u>locus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>standi</u></span> in seeking
judicial redress especially so, as the challenged laws do not relate to
appropriation measures that constitute misappropriation of public funds (<span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> v. Secretary of Public Works &amp; Communications,
110 Phil. 331[1960]; <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> v. COMELEC, <u>supra</u>,
p. 403).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Courts will not pass upon the
constitutionality of a law upon the complaint of one who fails to show that he
is injured by its operation (PACU v. Sec. of Education, <u>supra</u>, p. 810).</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutionality of an act of the legislature will not be
determined by the courts unless that question is properly raised and presented
in appropriate cases and is necessary to a determination of the case, i.e., the
issue of constitutionality must be the very <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>mota</u></span> presented (People v. Vera, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Dumlao</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <u>supra</u>,
p. 403).</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1981 Investment Priorities Plan which is an overall plan
prepared by the Board of Investments is simply an analysis, synthesis and
projection of data collected by the Board from public and private sources which
are measurements and indicators in areas of production, production capacities
and possibilities in areas of economic activities from which investors might
select (Article 28, P.D. 1789), while Executive Order No. 676 is but an
approval of said plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are by no
means <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Constitution nor were they
successfully shown to be inimical to public interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But more than that, it will be noted that
P.D. 1892 <u>ipso</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>jure</u></span> ceased its <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> on <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="12">December
 4, 1984</st1:date>, while P.D. 1789 has been expressly repealed by Executive
Order No. 226, otherwise known as the Omnibus Investments Code of 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, it bears reiteration that in interpreting statutes, that
which will avoid a finding of unconstitutionality is to be preferred (<span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> v. Executive Secretary, 128 SCRA 6 [1984]).</p>
