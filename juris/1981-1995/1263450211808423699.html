Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, to recover possession of a portion

The defendants, petitioners herein, filed an answer thereto, asserting that <span class="SpellE">Felomino</span> Ramirez is the owner of the land occupied by them
while the defendant <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Valdez is his tenant
thereon; and counter-claimed that the plaintiffs had illegally usurped a
portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 654, with an area of about 6.2399
hectares and refused to vacate the same notwithstanding demands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Wherefore, they prayed that the plaintiffs be

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal without, however,
submitting the corresponding appeal bond, so that on November 10, 1975, the
respondent municipal judge ordered them to submit the <span class="SpellE">the</span>

Obviously, the plaintiffs failed to comply with the said order, for on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1976</st1:date>, the respondent
judge of first instance, to whom the records of Civil Case No. R-184 were
erroneously forwarded, issued an order, which reads:<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, let the records of this case be returned to the

Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="18" month="3">March 18, 1976</st1:date>,

The said court, however, denied the motion for the reason that "the Court

the outcome of Civil Case No. 436", so that "this Court apparently
could not take any action regarding the instant motion for the issuance of a

Whereupon, the defendants filed the instant recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that the respondent judge of first
instance had no jurisdiction to hold the execution of the judgment rendered in
Civil Case No. R-184, to await the outcome of Civil Case No. 436, since no
appeal was perfected from the decision of the Municipal Court in Civil Case No.
R-184 as to confer the court of first instance with appellate jurisdiction over
Civil Case No. R-184; and that the petitioners have clearly shown that they are
entitled to the writ of execution because the judgment rendered in Civil Case
No. R-184 had already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents, upon the other hand, claim that <span style="">"the subject petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>
with <i>Mandamus</i> is without merit made purposely for delay considering the
fact that the land subject matter in Forcible Entry Case No. 184 of the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bongabong</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> is the same land subject matter in Civil Case No.
269 of the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Pinamalayan</span> Branch wherein the herein respondents Dr.
<span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bundal</span> and others
were declared owners of the portion claimed against </span>the petitioner, the
decision is now final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the petition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To begin with, the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> had not acquired appellate jurisdiction over Civil
Case No. 184 of the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bonga<span style="">bong</span></span><span style="">, </span>Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> because the
appellants therein (now private respondents) failed to perfect their appeal
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Well settled is rule that if a party does not
perfect his appeal within the time prescribed by law, the appellate court cannot
acquire jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the order of the respondent judge of first instance, dated <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1976</st1:date>, directing the respondent
Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Bongabong</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> to hold the execution of the judgment rendered in
Civil Case No. R-184 to await the outcome of Civil Case No. R-436, was issued
without jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, it appears that Civil Case No. R-436 was filed by the
herein private respondents with the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> on January 20, 1976, "in a final bid to
recover the property in question from the petitioners herein who were adjudged
to be in possession in the said forcible entry case,"<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
after the decision rendered in Civil Case No. 184 had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and designed to set at naught the said final
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in the resolution,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1976" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1976</st1:date>,
issued in Special Proceeding No. R-131, the respondent judge justified the
filing of Civil Case No. 436, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Consequently, the filing of the case No. 436 for recovery of
possession by the respondent against the herein petitioners was proper and
sanctioned by law and jurisprudence because it is only in so doing that they
may be able to repossess the property now in the possession of the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fine, the decision of
the respondent judge in the forcible entry case, referring as it does only to
possession, cannot determine with finality who is the owner or owners of the
land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow the lower
court to issue the writ of execution sought by the petitioners without their
right and those of the respondents being first determined in the Civil Case No.
436 for recovery of possession would certainly result in chaos and confusion
tending to becloud rather than clarify the issue of possession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, if the lower court should issue
the writ of execution and petitioners are placed in possession of the property,
and later on, in Civil Case No. 436 respondents are adjudged the lawful owners
of the same property, they cannot be precluded from likewise asking for a writ
of execution to enable them to recover its possession from the
petitioners."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under our rules of procedure, the validity of a judgment or order
of the court which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> may
be attacked only by a direct action or proceeding to annul the same, or by
motion in another case if the court had no jurisdiction to enter the order or <span style="">pronounce </span>the judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain a collateral attack on a judgment,
the record must show that the court lacked jurisdiction to render the judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, there is no showing, much less an allegation, that the
Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bongabong</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> lacked jurisdiction to render judgment in Civil
Case No. 184.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the order
of <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1976</st1:date>,
holding in abeyance the execution of the judgment in Civil Case No. R-184 to
await the disposition of Civil Case No. 436, was improperly issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of Civil Case

before the Court of First Instance of Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>,
does not preclude nor bar the execution of the judgment rendered in Civil Case
No. R-184, where the action was for forcible entry and the only issue involved
was the material possession or possession <i style="">de</i><span style=""> </span><i style="">facto</i><span style=""> </span>of the land under litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such action which involves the title over the
