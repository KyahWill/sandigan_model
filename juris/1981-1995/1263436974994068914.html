to private respondent as an equitable mortgage.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Emphatically declaring that what private respondent signed was a deed of
absolute sale over her house and lot, petitioner asks us to reverse.  Private respondent, on the other hand,
states that the real intention of the parties was that her house and lot would
only be mortgaged to petitioner as shown by an "Option To
Repurchase." Since the decisions of the trial court and the appellate
court are worlds apart, the Court has decided to scrutinize the evidence
thoroughly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case as summed up by the trial court and adopted
by the appellate court are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As summed by the trial court:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘This case is for reconveyance of a house and lot with TCT No.
214580 - Quezon City, then in the name of plaintiff (herein private respondent
Maria del Rosario-Tanjuakio) but which was cancelled by virtue of a Deed of
Absolute Sale dated June 11, 1979, executed by plaintiff for a consideration of
P70,000.00 in favor of defendant (herein petitioner Felimon Uy) who was issued
his TCT No. 28338 on November 18, 1981.  Brought to fore is the said Deed of Absolute Sale.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘Pursuant to the pre-trial Order of August 5, 1983, the issue of
whether the said Deed of Absolute Sale may be declared as an equitable mortgage
was agreed by the parties to be submitted for decision on the basis of the
facts stipulated and reflected in the said pre-trial order, to wit:</p>

<p class="2Q">‘By virtue of a Deed of Sale, dated June 11, 1979, executed by
plaintiffs in favor of defendants, the latter caused the cancellation of the
former's T.C.T. No. 214580, Quezon City, and a new TCT No. 283384 - Q.C., was
issued to said defendants on November 18, 1981.  By virtue also of a letter, dated June 11, 1979, said defendants
granted plaintiffs 60 days from said date an option to purchase the subject
land covered by the aforesaid titles.  It appears that plaintiffs have failed to exercise that said option.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘Culled from the foregoing is the singular issue of whether the
aforesaid Deeds of Sale may be declared as an equitable mortgage.  This being a legal issue, the same may be
resolved without further reception of evidence and for this purpose, parties
are given 15 days from receipt hereof to submit their memoranda after which the
case shall be deemed submitted for decision.’</p>

<p class="2Q">‘Both parties submitted their respective memoranda and accordingly,
a decision was rendered on October 18, 1983, ‘finding no justification to
consider the subject Deed of Absolute Sale an equitable mortgage, the complaint
is hereby DISMISSED.'</p>

<p class="2Q">'Plaintiff went on appeal and in a decision dated February 27,
1987, in CA-G.R. CV No. 05001, the Honorable Court of Appeals set aside the
aforesaid decision and remanded the instant case for trial on the merits before
this Court.  Defendant elevated that decision
of the Court of <span style="">Appeals </span>by way of
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.  In a Resolution, dated December 2, 1987 in G.R. No. 78532, the Honorable
Supreme Court denied said petition.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Accordingly, the records were remanded to this Court for trial on
the merits.  The records of the instant
case were, however, among those burned in the conflagration of the Quezon City
Hall on June 11, 1988.  It was only on
September 27, 1988 that the records of the case was officially declared
reconstituted.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Pre-trial briefs were then submitted by the parties, with proffer
(sic) of their documentary exhibits on the same issue as defined in the
aforequoted pre-trial order of August 5, 1983:  Whether the Deed of Absolute Sale between plaintiff vendor and defendant
as vendee may be declared as an equitable mortgage.'</p>

<blockquote>"After trial the court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>rendered judgment as stated at the outset, the decretal
portion of which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'WHEREFORE, premises above considered, finding no merit in
plaintiff's claim that the Deed of Absolute Sale was an equitable mortgage, the
instant complaint is hereby DISMISSED.</p>

<p class="2Q">'Further, plaintiff is hereby ordered to pay P10,000.00 for
attorney's fee of defendant and costs of suit.</p>

<p class="2Q">'SO ORDERED.’</p>

<blockquote>"Not satisfied, plaintiff elevated her cause once again to this
Tribunal."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second time around with the appellate court, petitioner
received <span style="">a </span>decision which, in its
dispositive portion, stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision of the trial court is
hereby SET ASIDE and <i><span style="">in lieu </span></i>thereof
another rendered declaring the deed of absolute sale between the parties an
equitable mortgage.  Plaintiff is
declared entitled to redeem the mortgaged property which shall be effected upon
the payment of plaintiffs mortgage debt to defendants in the total amount of
P70,000.00 with legal rate of interest from the time the deed in question was
executed on June 11, 1979 until it is fully paid."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition where petitioner faults the appellate court <span style="">with the </span>following errors:</p>

not express the true intention of the parties;</blockquote>

still in possession of the house and lot which was the subject matter of the
case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  A finding that the private respondent had
paid all the real estate taxes;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  The doctrine of "doubt to be settled in
favor of the greatest reciprocity of interest" for onerous contracts was
misapplied.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

when her own witness explained to her the contents thereof (tsn., pp. 24-25,

private respondent states that:</p>

appreciated the facts that Petitioner controlled the preparation of the deed of

of necessity; and that the context of Morales' testimony is that the contract

<p class="BODY">When counsel for private respondent tried to have petitioner
confirm <span style="">that </span>private respondent's

when Mr. Morales testified."</p>

<p class="BODY">However, petitioner FORGOT his defense strategy <b><i><span style="">when he wanted to emphasize </span></i></b>the
fact that private respondent signed a document entitled <span style="">deed </span><span style="">of </span>absolute
sale in response to private respondent's counsel's question as to what he had
to say about Morales' testimony that he (Morales) told private respondent that
what she was signing was a deed of absolute sale.  Petitioner answered: "Mr. Morales kept pointing to the
plaintiff that the document she is signing was a deed of absolute sale."</p>

petitioner answered started with: "And in the testimony of Mr. Morales x x

<p class="BODY">Necessarily, the cross-examination testimony of Mr. Morales must
be studied to provide any clue as to the real nature of the transaction between
<span style="">private </span>respondent <span style="">and </span>petitioner.  The significant cross-examination testimony
of Mr. Morales is the following:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And

<blockquote>  A:  I
also reminded the plaintiff about this 60 day period and she informed me that
they have an agreement with the Uys that provided she will be able to pay the
interest, the property will not be foreclosed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:  She told that to you not-withstanding the fact <span style="">according </span>to your explanation to her the significance of the
document that what she is signing is a deed of absolute sale?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>(NOTE: "Sic" not used to avoid
cluttering up the testimony)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Morales' cross-examination testimony is very clear that
although <span style="">private </span>respondent
signed a deed of absolute sale over her house and lot in favor of the
petitioner, she did so because she was granted the right to repurchase the
same.  And she could still redeem the
same even after the 60-day period granted as long as she would pay the
corresponding interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of course, Mr. Morales' testimony would have been pure hearsay
were it not for the fact that, although petitioner's counsel tried to get
private respondent to say something else during her cross-examination, she said
the very same thing.  Private
respondent's cross-examination testimony is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:  You made a statement to the effect that
although you were given 60 days from June 11 to repurchase the property... you
made a statement to the effect that as long as you can pay 5% or the equivalent
of P3,500.00 you would be allowed to redeem the property, do you confirm or
deny that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because that was what
Nena told me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And you agreed to that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, I believed
her."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that private respondent intended to mortgage her
property to the Uys to borrow P70,000.00, incidentally, to pay Morales
P50,000.00<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
which she owed him.  She was, however,
made to sign a deed of absolute sale with a right to repurchase the same
granted in a separate document.  The
appellate court, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in holding that the
deed of absolute sale was in reality an equitable mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly held by the appellate court:</p>

<blockquote>"Under Article 1604 of the Civil Code a contract purporting to
<span style="">be an </span>absolute sale shall be
presumed to be an equitable mortgage should any of the conditions in Article
1602 be present.  Otherwise stated, the
presence of only one circumstance defined in Article 1602 is sufficient for a
contract of sale with right to repurchase to be presumed an equitable
mortgage.  The said article expressly
provides therefor ‘in any of the following cases', hence, the existence of any
of the circumstances enumerated therein, not a concurrence nor an overwhelming
number of such circumstances suffices to give rise to the presumption that the
contract with right to repurchase is an equitable mortgage.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Several circumstances x x x persuade this Court to construe
the questioned documents as an equitable mortgage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"First, while concededly plaintiff may have been aware of the
contents of the Deed of Absolute Sale, the preponderance of the evidence shows
however that she signed knowing that the said contract did not express the real
intention of the contracting parties.  She was, in fact, led to believe by the defendants whom she approached
for a loan to pay her obligation to Jesus Morales that it was the policy of
defendants in lending money to execute such a Deed of Absolute Sale over the
mortgaged property before extending the loan, and that the turning over of the
title to the property to the defendants was a mere formality.  If plaintiff signed notwithstanding all
these, it is more probable to believe that she did so because she was in urgent
need of funds for, verily, 'Necessitous men are not, truly speaking, free men;
but to answer a present emergency, will submit to any terms that the crafty may
impose upon them'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Second, the amount of P70,000.00, even in 1979, is too
inadequate for a purchase price of plaintiffs property consisting of a house
and lot measuring four hundred twenty (420) square meters together with all the
other improvements made therein located at Novaliches, Quezon City.  In Quinga vs. Court of Appeals, et al.,
although the contract between the parties upon its face was one of sale, the
Supreme Court, nevertheless, upheld the findings of this Court that the transaction
was not a sale but a loan secured by an equitable mortgage under the prevailing
circumstances of <span style="">the case, such as, </span>that
the price of the land was grossly inadequate and the vendor remained in
possession thereof and enjoyed the fruits.  Article 1602 of the Civil Code, in fact, expressly provides that in case
of doubt a contract purporting to be a sale with a right to repurchase shall be
construed as an equitable mortgage when the price or consideration of the sale
is unusually inadequate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Third, although symbolically the possession of the property
was transferred to defendant, it was plaintiff who continued to be in physical
possession of the property.  The second
paragraph of Article 1602 of the Civil Code provides that when the vendor
remains in possession as lessee or otherwise, the contract shall be construed
as an equitable mortgage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fourth, the supposed vendor had been paying the realty taxes
thereon even after the execution of the document in 1979.  It was only in 1982 that the alleged
vendees-spouses started paying the same.  In Santos vs. Duata, in affirming a decision of this Court, the Supreme
Court considered the facts that the vendor remained in possession of the land
and continued paying the taxes thereon significant circumstances which
justified a judgment holding the transaction between the parties as an
equitable mortgage and not a <u>pacto de</u> <u>retro</u>sale thereby applying
Article 1602 of the Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, there is the rule that in case of any doubt
concerning the surrounding circumstances in the execution of the contract, the
least transmission of rights and interests shall prevail if the contract is
gratuitous, and, if onerous, the doubt is to be settled in favor of the
greatest reciprocity of interest.  Thus,
in the old case of Olino vs. Medina, Olino filed a complaint against Medina to
recover a parcel of riceland which he alleged to have mortgaged for P175.00 and
which Medina refused to return on the ground that the latter allegedly bought
the property.  In deciding the conflict
of allegations between the parties, the Supreme Court through Justice
Florentino Torres considered the transaction over the property as a loan
reasoning that 'such a contract involves a smaller transmission of rights and <span style="">interests, </span>and the debtor does not
surrender all rights to his property but simply confers upon the creditor the
right to collect what is owing from the value of the thing given as security,
there existing between the parties a greater reciprocity of rights and
obligations.'"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
