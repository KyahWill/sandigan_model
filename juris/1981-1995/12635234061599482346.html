The Motions for Reconsideration separately filed by the private 
respondent San Carlos Milling Co., Inc., the private respondents Carlos,
 Connie and Julieta, all surnamed Ledesma, and the private respondents 
Vicente and Amparo Gustilo now before Us, seek to reconsider Our 
Decision<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  in the instant case rendered on September 28, 1982, the dispositive portion of which states, to wit:
<blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of petitioners 
and against the res­pondents Central and planters in the manner set 
forth in the foregoing opinion, which, summarized, is that from crop 
year 1958-59 and all the crop years thereafter the Central is sentenced 
to pay all the planters in the San Carlos Milling district, regardless 
of their classification as emergency or non-quota planters, the 
corresponding rates of share prescribed in Section 1 of Republic Act 809
 minus what said planters have already been actually paid pursuant to 
their milling contracts, which should be deemed to include that paid to 
the Association for 'research, investment, development and social 
welfare funds to be used by the planters for these purposes, in 
accordance with their sole judgment and discretion', and the respondent 
planters in turn are hereby sentenced to pay their respective laborers, 
herein petitioners, 60% of such difference they will be paid by the 
Central, pursuant to Section 9 of the Act, and the Minister of Labor is 
hereby directed to supervise the payments to the laborers herein 
adjudged.  Respondent planters are further sentenced to pay their 
respective laborers 60% of what they have already been paid by the 
Central during all the crop years involved in this case. </p>
  <p>
    All amounts herein ordered to be paid shall bear interest at the 
legal rate from the time of the finality of this judgment, and this case
 being one involving a claim of laborers in the nature of unpaid portion
 of wages due them by mandate of the law, the respondents shall pay as 
attorney's fees, per Article 2208, paragraphs (7) and (11) of the Civil 
Code, 10% of their respective proportion of payments to be made as above
 adjudged.
  </p>
  <p> No costs."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These Motions for Reconsideration took some time to resolve because of 
the many pleadings filed by the parties in support of their respective 
stands on the merits, or lack of it, of said Motions, which pleadings We
 required and allowed because of the issues raised by the pleadings, not
 discounting the numerous extensions of time requested by the parties.
</p><p>
After much thought and careful deliberation, it is Our considered 
opinion that no error lies in Our Decision of September 28, 1982.
</p><p>
The main issues presented by private respondents' motions for reconsideration are:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (1)  Whether or not We erred in assuming jurisdiction and granting 
due course to the petition-at-bar, much more render judgment for the 
petitioners, considering the fact that the petition was filed beyond the
 reglementary period provided for under PD 946, section 18 thereof;
  </p>
  <p>
    (2)  Whether or not We erred in not finding that respondent San 
Carlos Milling Co., Inc. has milling contracts with the majority of the 
planters within its district; and
  </p>
  <p> (3)  Whether or not We erred in rendering what private respondents
 term as the "all planters, all subse­quent crop years" judgment. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Anent the first issue, private respondents maintain that in assuming 
jurisdiction over the petition-at-bar despite that it was allegedly 
filed out of time and, therefore, the respondent court's decision had 
become final and executory, We have departed from Our ruling laid down 
in <em>Caparas vs. CA</em>, 105 SCRA 355, that under the provisions of 
section 18 of Presidential Decree No. 946, the reglementary period for 
filing the appeal by <em>Certiorari </em>to the Supreme Court from a 
final judgment of the Court of Appeals in an agrarian case, is 
non-extendible, being peremptory or mandatory in character.  Private 
respondents' contention is without merit.
</p><p>
The attention of the private respondents is called to the fact that the 
issue of whether or not We correctly acquired jurisdiction over the 
petition-at-bar, has been passed upon by Us on several occasions.  The 
first was when We granted the petition due course despite the raising of
 this issue in respondents' Comments.  The granting of due course should
 be taken to mean that the issue on lapses of procedural requirements 
had been overlooked in favor of deciding the case on the merits.  An 
appeal to this Court is given due course as a rule only when it involves
 important legal issues (Feraren vs. Santos, 193 SCRA 707).  The second 
was when We denied in Our Resolution of October 7, 1981 their Motion to 
Dismiss which raised the same issue; and third, in Our Resolution of 
November 4, 1981, when We also did not consider nor act upon private 
respondent San Carlos Milling's motion for reconsideration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  of Our denial of their Motion to Dismiss.  The Decision of September 
28, 1982 was actually the fourth occasion that We resolved the issue 
against them.  Certainly, it has been more than sufficiently considered.
</p><p>
Considering, however, the tenor of the pleadings filed, which We 
perceive as bordering on belligerence, We shall set forth Our opinion on
 the matter.
</p><p>
It is in the <em>Caparas case</em> that We made a pronouncement on the 
nature of the reglementary period provided for under the stated legal 
provision.  This was followed by <em>Soque vs. CA</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  in August of the same year.  In both cases, We cited as reason for Our
 rulings that the manifest intent of the law is the speedy disposition 
of agrarian cases.  By these cases, We have not, however, laid down an 
absolute rule which is totally not subject to exceptions, depending on 
the circumstances peculiar to the case before Us and provided that the 
intent of the law is not thereby defeated.
</p><p>
Here, the instant case is not without exceptional circumstances.  While 
concededly the petition was filed beyond the thirty-day reglementary 
period, We cannot simply ignore and disregard the facts obtaining below 
which, for all intents and purposes, caused the questioned late filing. 
 Thus, petitioners were first misled by the very notice of judgment 
received from the respondent court which required compliance with 
Section 10, Rule 51 of the Rules of Court to prevent its judgment from 
becoming final, instead of the correct law, that is PD No. 946.  Then 
came the granting by the same court of their two motions for extension 
of time to file motions for reconsideration of its adverse judgment, 
which may be considered as having lulled the peti­tioners into believing
 that they took the correct remedy.  And finally, the respondent court, 
when it recalled its two Resolutions granting the aforesaid extension of
 time in its Resolution of November 19, 1979, also declared that the 
same is without prejudice to petitioner's right to appeal to this Court.
  Petitioners then filed their peti­tion within thirty (30) days from 
receipt of this last Resolution of the respondent court.  The above 
facts alto­gether show that petitioners were not guilty of any 
deliberate delay or transgression of the provisions of the pertinent law
 and therefore, may be excused under a liberal interpretation of the 
law.  They simply complied with what was required of them under the 
circumstances obtaining.  The respondent court was the one who fell into
 error.  While the counsel for petitioners himself fell into error, this
 Court is constrained to take into consideration that the error was not 
entirely his own, because the respondent court's own acts lulled him 
into believing that he was in the right course, and at any rate, 
petitioners immediately filed their petition after receipt of the 
respondent court's last Resolution.  This Court, in <em>Mendoza vs. Mercado</em>, 98 SCRA 45, speaking through Justice Aquino, who also penned Our decisions in the aforecited <em>Caparas </em>and<em> Soque cases, </em>said, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "An attorney-at-law is not expected to know all the law.  For an 
honest mistake or error, an attorney is not liable.  Chief Justice Abbot
 said that 'no attorney is bound to know all the law; God forbid that it
 should be imagined that an attorney or a counsel, or even a judge, is 
bound to know all the law.'  (Montorious vs. Jeffreys, 2 lar. P. 113, 
cited In re Filart, 40 Phil. 205, 208.)"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, in view of the foregoing, tending to show that petitioners' 
failure to appeal in accordance with the pro­visions of Presidential 
Decree 946 was due to an honest mistake and/or excusable negligence, and
 there being no sign of manifest intention to delay the proceedings so 
as to defeat the obvious intent of the law, We upheld Our jurisdiction 
over the petition-at-bar, which We hereby affirm.  Petitioners should be
 allowed to establish the merits of its appeal without constraints of 
technicality but in the spirit of fairness and liberality, considering 
that they have an ostensibly meritorious claim.  Private respondents' 
contention that the claim is not meritorious is belied by the results 
obtained in the main Decision where the majority of the Court En Banc 
concurred with the <em>ponente's</em> opinion.
</p><p>
We now come to the "majority issue".  In the main Decision, We ruled 
that majority of the planters in the San Carlos Milling District did not
 have written milling contracts with the respondent Central, for which 
reason We upheld the applicability of Republic Act 809.  We so ruled 
because We counted or included the non-quota, non-district and 
accommodation planters, and the records indicate that should they be 
considered in ascertaining the number of planters with written milling 
contracts with the sugar mill, the planters in the San Carlos Milling 
District with such written milling contracts would be in the minority.
</p><p>
Movants' contention that We erred in including these classifications of 
planters upon the private respondents' allegations that the inclusion of
 non-quota, non-district and accommodation planters was never intended 
by the lawmakers when they enacted RA 809 as they were not yet in being 
which in effect assailed Our construction of the law, is devoid of 
merit.  It is true that statutes are to be construed as they were 
intended to be understood when they were passed, and words of a statute 
must be taken in the sense in which they were understood at the time 
when the statute was enacted, thus giving an impression of validity to 
the contention of the private respondents that the legislators could not
 have intended to include in the word "planter" the non-quota, 
non-district and accommodation planters, because at the time of the 
enactment of the law they were not yet in existence.  But the rules on 
statutory construction does not end there, but continues that if the 
language used is broad enough to include unknown things which might 
spring into existence in the future, they would be deemed to come within
 and be subject to the evident meaning of the terms used.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Thus, the following authority:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 237.  Application to New Cases, Conditions and Subjects.  - 
Since the words of a statute must be taken in the sense in which they 
were un­derstood at the time when the statute was enacted, and the 
statute must be construed as it was intended to be understood when it 
was passed, statutes are to be read in the light of attendant conditions
 at the time of their enactment. x x x </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the other hand, the fact that a situation is new, or that a 
particular thing was not in existence, or was not invented, at the time 
of the enactment of a law, does not preclude the application of the law 
thereto.  The language of a statute may be so broad, and its object so 
general, as to reach conditions not coming into existence until a long 
time after its enactment.  Indeed, it is a general rule of statutory 
construction that, in the absence of a contrary indication, legislative 
enactments, which are prospective in operation and which are couched in 
ge­neral and comprehensive terms broad enough to include unknown things 
that might spring into existence in the future, even though they are 
words of the present tense, apply alike to new situations, cases, 
conditions, things, subjects, methods, inventions, or persons or 
entities coming into existence subsequent to their passage, where such 
situations, cases, conditions, things, subjects, methods, inventions, 
persons or entities are of the same class as those specified, and can 
reasonably be said to come within the general purview, scope, purpose, 
and policy of the statute, the mischief sought to be prevented, and the 
evident meaning of the terms used."
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 419.  Application to New Cases, Conditions, and Subjects. - 
It is a general rule of statutory construction that, in the absence of a
 contrary indication, legislative enactments which are prospective in 
operation and which are couched in general and comprehensive terms broad
 enough to include unknown things that might spring into existence in 
the future, apply alike to new situations, cases, conditions, things, 
subjects, methods, inventions, persons, or entities coming into 
existence subsequent to their passage, where such situations, cases, 
conditions, things, subjects, methods, inventions, persons, or entities 
are of the same class as those specified, and are within the general 
purview, scope, purpose, and policy of the statute, the mischief sought 
to be prevented, and the evident meaning of the terms used.  x x x<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As to the alleged lack of evidence of no majority, assuming <em>arguendo </em>to be true, We, at this stage after Our pronouncements in <em>Asociacion de Agricultures de Talisay-Silay, Inc., et al. vs. Talisay-Silay Milling Co., Inc. et al</em>.,
 88 SCRA 294, observe that the same will not defeat petitioners' claim. 
 In the cited case, We categorically held that any increase in 
participation given to planters in contracts executed after the approval
 of Republic Act 809 must be shared with laborers of the planters in the
 manner provided in Section 9, even if by the reason of the number of 
such contracts, Section 1 would not apply.  In other words, even when 
there is a majority of contract planters in the district, Section 9 
would still apply as long as the contracts providing for increase in the
 participation of the planters have been executed purportedly to attain 
the majority required by Section 1 and thereby to prevent the 
application of the higher rates of increase prescribed by the provisions
 thereof.
</p><p>
In assailing what the private respondents call as Our "all planters, all
 subsequent crop years" judgment, private respondents claim that they 
were deprived procedural due process and, therefore, Our decision is 
void.  They insist that We cannot enlarge the scope of petitioners' 
claims, the same allegedly being only against the private respon­dent 
San Carlos Milling Company, the private respondents Ledesma and the 
private respondents Gustillos, and no other planter, and being limited 
only to the crop years of 1958-1959 to 1967-1968, and not for all 
subsequent crop years.
</p><p>
We see no reason to change or modify Our main Decision.
</p><p>
It is true that petitioners below filed their complaint only against the
 herein named private respondents.  However, considering that from the 
averments of the complaint,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  it is clear that the suit was principally directed against the 
respondent San Carlos Milling Co.; that the suit by the petitioners was 
brought as a class suit or for the benefit of all the others similarly 
situated;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  and, that the 
private respondents, the Ledesmas and the Gustillos, were merely 
impleaded as co-defendants because they refused to join the petitioners 
as plaintiffs in their complaint below.  Thus, Our Decision sentencing 
the Central to pay all planters within its district, and, in turn, for 
all planters to pay their respective laborers, is in order.  In <em>Lakas ng Manggagawang Makabayan vs. Marcelo Enterprises</em>,
 118 SCRA 522, We affirmed Our authority to cure defect of inclusion/ 
non-inclusion of proper parties even while on appeal before Us, therein 
considering, as We did here, the fact that the entirety of the records, 
or the pleadings filed, sufficiently show that the proper parties were 
brought before the courts so that any incorrect designation may be 
overlooked for being merely an error in form.
</p><p>
With regards to the question of "subsequent crop years", and after 
reading through the records, We find that this new issue was raised by 
the petitioners in their pleadings before Us.  The records bear out that
 from the crop year 1952-53 and thereafter, the sharing arrangement 
between respondent Central and the Planters in the San Carlos Mil­ling 
District always fell short of the correct sharing proportion under 
Section 1 of RA 809, which is understand­able because up to the present,
 the parties are not yet definite and certain as to whether or not the 
Sugar Act applies to the San Carlos Milling District, as in fact the 
Central and the Planters are of the negative opinion.  In connection 
therewith, petitioners undertook to submit to Us the tabulated sharing 
arrangement by and between respondent Central and respondent Planters of
 the unrefined sugar and molasses in the San Carlos Milling District and
 the share that should pertain to them from crop year 1958-59 up to crop
 year 1979-1980;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  the increase in plan­ters' participation from crop year 1952-53 up to and including crop year 1981-1982;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>  and list of prices of sugar and molasses from 1948 up to 1981.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  In <em>Asiatic Integrated Corp. vs. Alikpala</em>,
 67 SCRA 60, We ruled that new issues not brought before the trial court
 will be entertained by the appellate court without need of supplemental
 pleadings where all the facts for determination of said issues are 
before the appellate court and matters of public interest need to be 
promptly settled.  Therefore, Our decision to hold the private 
respondents liable not only for the ten (10) crop years claimed but also
 for the years thereafter, is not without precedent.  Facts were brought
 to Our attention upon which We can, and did, base Our determination of 
the issue.
</p><p>
What significantly compelled Us to render the "all planters, all 
subsequent crop years" judgment is the fact that We have been apprised 
of the other claims, already filed, and still to be filed, in the courts
 below, which have merely been suspended or not yet filed because they 
are awaiting the finality of Our Decision.  Certainly, as soon as Our 
Decision becomes final, the courts will be deluged by claims of all 
laborers in the San Carlos Milling District against all the Planters 
therein.  To open the gates to such suits, would not only be encouraging
 multiplicity of suits which time and again We have openly deplored, but
 more importantly, would only result in needless delays for the 
hard-pressed laborers - more years of tortuous and expensive journey 
through new proceedings in the trial courts, appeal to the Intermediate 
Appellate Court, and the last resort to this Court through a petition 
for review, to finally achieve the same result.
