<p class="BODY">Appellant's contention, as above indicated, is without merit,
judged from the facts as established by the evidence of the prosecution
narrated in the People's brief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On March 11, 1976, at around 11:30 o'clock in the evening,
complainant <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Resurreccion</span>,
a widow, 36 years old, was sleeping in her house at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Pahinga</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
together with <span class="SpellE">Gemma</span>, her three-year old daughter (pp.
2-3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her four other children were then at the house
of her father at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Canda</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sariaya</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> (p. 3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31,
1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
was awakened by a knock at their wall and heard the voice of her son-in-law,
Leon <span class="SpellE">Alviz</span>, Jr., herein accused, calling her "<span class="SpellE">Inay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Inay</span>," and requesting
her to open the door (p. 4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When she finally opened the door, Leon <span class="SpellE">Alviz</span>,
Jr. suddenly grabbed her by her hands and dragged her downstairs at a distance
of five meters (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While downstairs, <span class="SpellE">Alviz</span>
clutched her dress and held her nape (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May
31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
struggled and tried to shout, but he covered her mouth and ripped her dress
open near her breast (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> continued
to struggle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alviz</span>
therefore continued to box her on the breast and left eye and to bump her head
on the ground (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Anastacia</span></span>
who then became very weak, felt that <span class="SpellE">Alviz</span> was
removing her panties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After removing the
same, he sat on her private organ (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31,
1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She pleaded with the accused
saying '<span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, don't, because you are already my son,
"but instead of heeding her, <span class="SpellE">Alviz</span> boxed her
again on the breast which rendered <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
unconscious (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When she regained her consciousness, <span class="SpellE">Alviz</span>
had already left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was naked and felt
pain all over her body especially on her private part (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She also discovered that she lost her earrings and false teeth (p. 39, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, July 9, 1976).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, she went up her house, dressed up and <span class="GramE">proceeded</span> to the house of her neighbor Patricio de Chavez to
ask for help (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing her condition, Patricio de Chavez
reported the matter to the barrio councilman <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span>
de Chavez (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was then brought to the Community Clinic
at <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
where she was physically examined by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Montecillo</span> who issued a medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C) <span class="GramE">containing</span> the following

(p. 10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon her discharge from the hospital, she
went to the Municipal Building of <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span> where

of the <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span> Police Force (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31, 1976).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, she filed a case for rape against herein accused, Leon <span class="SpellE">Alviz</span>, Jr. (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 31,
1976)."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In assigning the first error of the trial court, appellant claims
that the testimony of the complainant is unnatural to be believed, first
because appellant would not have had to forcibly bring complainant downstairs
and there raped her, instead of doing the act right in her room; second,
because she did not tell Patricio de Chavez that she was mauled and raped; and
third, complainant did not shout as she should have done if she was ravished
against her will.</p>

<p class="BODY">If appellant brought complainant downstairs there to ravish her,
it is because there was her three-year-old daughter sleeping upstairs with
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If awakened, as she was sure to be,
by the noise occasioned by the struggle, the daughter would witness the sex act
and testify against appellant, the child being already of such age as to be
able to relate what she would see with sufficient coherence and clarity.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is absolutely not true that complainant did not tell Patricio
de Chavez what happened to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
contusions and the black-eye visible on complainant were, in themselves, enough
to tell what happened to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the records show that when <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> Chavez arrived at
<span class="SpellE">Patricio's</span> house, and asked what happened to
complainant, the latter replied that she was raped by appellant, her
son-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records do not show that
complainant did not tell Patricio that she was mauled and raped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She did not testify to that effect, nor did
Patricio.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to complainant not shouting when appellant assaulted and
ravished her, again appellant's assertion is not supported by the records. The
evidence is clear in showing that complainant wanted to shout and did try to,
but appellant covered her mouth.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
After having been repeatedly boxed and her head even bumped against the ground,
she naturally got so weakened to be able to shout, or even just to try to in
her state of weakness and shock.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, counsel's contention that the examining physician did
not corroborate complainant's testimony that she was raped by her son-in-law is
a brazen distortion of the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
medical findings of physical injuries and presence of sperm cells in her
private parts, toge­ther with the doctor's own testimony that the presence of
the male sperm cells indicates actual penetration or introduction of the substance
into the complainant's private parts<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
proves the falsehood committed by appellant's counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">With all the evidence as above assessed and analyzed, how can
appellant assert that there is no evidence that he had carnal knowledge of
complainant?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim that what was
proven was only the infliction of physical injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This crime is, however, not included in the
charged crime of rape which is of a different class of offense--crime against
chastity as distinguished from crime against persons--and, therefore, will not
legally permit conviction on the basis of what was proven, being at variance
with what was alleged as the crime committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to appellant's unsupported claim, the crime charged was
proved with overwhelming evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
testimony of complainant, given with no motive for her to testify falsely
against her own son-in-law, as none of any worth was shown by the defense, in
itself deserves full and faith credence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It becomes more so with the corroboration found in the testimony of the
examining physician and his medical findings, and that supplied by the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> de Chavez who brought her to
the hospital after being told by complainant that she was mauled and raped by
appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This statement forms part of
the <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>gestae</u></span>
because it was given after the startling incident complainant had just gone
through, who may thus be assumed to be then still under the influence of such a
shocking occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as in U.S. vs. Ramos,<span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span> a 1901 decision, it was said that when
a woman testifies that she has been raped, she says all that is needed to
signify that the crime has been committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is so against any man committing the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is more so when the accusing words are
said against a close relative, as a son-in-law that appellant is to
complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> with the modification that an indemnity of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> be ordered paid to the complainant by appellant, the
judgment appealed from is affirmed in all other respects, with costs.</p>
