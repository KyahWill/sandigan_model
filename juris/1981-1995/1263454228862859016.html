				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The city court of Manila in its decision of
February 24, 1976 ordered <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamin</span>
to vacate the apartment located at 440-B M.F. <span class="SpellE">Jhocson</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, Manila and to pay the landlord,
Juan <span class="SpellE">Echiverri</span>, Jr., the sum of P165 a month from
January 1, 1975 until the premises are vacated plus P300 as attorney’s fees
(pp. 17-18, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision was based on the ground that the rental for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">January, </span>1975, which was due and
payable within the first five days of the month, was not paid on time since the
money order for that rental was mailed only on February 3, 1975 while the money
order for the February rental was mailed only on February 24, 1975 (p. 16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Villamin</span> appealed to the Court of First
Instance of Manila which in its decision of <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1976</st1:date> affirmed the city court's judgment (p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of
that decision was received by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">her </span>counsel
on July 27.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Three days later, she filed
a motion for reconsideration which was denied in the lower court's order of <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Villamin</span> on <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1976</st1:date> filed in this Court the instant
petition for <i>certiorari</i> wherein she contends that the lower court
committed a grave abuse of discretion in affirming the city court's
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She filed a memorandum in
support of her petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Echiverri</span>, Jr. did not submit any memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the city court <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> <span class="SpellE">Villamin</span> testified that she and her husband had occupied
the apartment in question since <st1:date year="1967" day="29" month="5"><u>May
 29, 1967</u></st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her baby,
nephew and niece have been staying with her in that apartment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In November, 1974 the landlord gave a verbal
notice that the monthly rental would be increased to P300.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the owner's representative came to collect the rental for
January, 1975, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> tendered in cash the stipulated
rental of P165 but it was rejected because the landlord wanted her to pay an
increased rental of P300.</p>

<p class="BODY">So, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> had to send by registered
mail to the landlord the postal money orders covering the January and February
rentals in the amount of P165 a month (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2 and
3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Echiverri</span>
refused to accept the rental of P165, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> reported
the matter to the Department of Public Information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Miguel R. <span class="SpellE">Logarta</span>,
supervisor of the Public Information Assistance Unit of <span class="SpellE">Malacañang</span>
Palace, advised her in a letter dated January 27, 1975 to "refrain from
participating in the proposed increase, in order to avoid a possible court
action" since Presidential Decree No. 20, "which prohibits such
increase, is still very much in operation and violation thereof is
punishable" under its provisions (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1, p. 19,
Record).</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that there was no valid ground for ejecting <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She had not
defaulted in the payment of the rentals for the apart­ment which she had
already occupied for more than seven years when the alleged delayed payment
occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lease had no fixed term.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because the landlord refused to accept the payment of the rentals
in cash at the old rate, <span class="SpellE">Leonor</span> had to resort to the
expedient of mailing to the landlord the money orders covering the stipulated
rentals (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 2-A and 4-A).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The eviction was motivated by the desire to
charge increased rentals.</p>

<p class="BODY">That was the contingency sought to be forestalled by Republic Act
No. 6359, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decree froze the rentals not exceeding
P300 for dwelling units or for land on which another's dwelling is
located.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also prohibited the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of tenants occupying such dwelling units or land
which had been leased for an indefinite period if the ground for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> is the expiration of the term fixed in articles
1682 and 1687 of the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purpose is to protect persons in the lower income group who
cannot afford to acquire their own houses or residential lots from being forced
to pay high rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was the same
policy adopted after liberation in Emergency Civilian Administrative Order No.
12 and in Commonwealth Act No. 689 as amended <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">by </span>Republic Act No. 66.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Note that the supposed injustice caused to the landlord by Presidential
Decree No. 20 has been remedied by Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decisions of the city court and the Court
of First Instance are reversed and set aside and the com­plaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> is dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Echiverri's</span> motion of <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1982</st1:date> for the withdrawal
of the rentals deposited in court is granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No costs.</p>
