				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This original action for <i>certiorari</i> seeks to set aside the
order of respondent Minister of Labor dated <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1977</st1:date> which affirmed the resolution of the
National Labor Relations Commission in NLRC Case No. RB-IV-3710-76 entitled
"<span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> v.
International Travel Service" on the ground that the same was issued with
grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting upon a complaint filed by private respondent, the Regional
Director of Region IV of the Ministry (now Department) of Labor, on May 17, 1971,
recommended to the City Fiscal of Manila the filing of charges against
petitioner for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) violation of Section
3(a) in relation to 15(a) of RA 602 as amended by RA 6129, otherwise known as
the Minimum Wage Law; (2) violation of Section 56 of RA 3428 as amended, for
failure to register his travel agency with the Bureau of Workmen's
Compensation; and (3) for violation of Section 11 (b) of RA 679 as amended, for
his failure to furnish a list of his women employees to the Department of
Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the corresponding
criminal <span class="SpellE">informations</span> were filed (pp. 39-41, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With the advent of PD 442 (New Labor Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>)
which took effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioner moved for the dismissal of the cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court thereupon ordered the
dismissal of the cases on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1975</st1:date> on the ground that the acts complained of were no longer
penalized by the New Labor Code which has repealed the Minimum Wage Law RA 602,
as amended, (pp. 42­-50, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, private respondent, on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1975</st1:date>, filed with the
Regional Office No. <span class="GramE">IV of the Department of Labor, a
complaint against petitioner for non­-payment of wages and overtime pay.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the usual exchange of pleadings and,
after the parties filed their respective memoranda (pp. 52-57, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) the labor arbiter assigned to the case rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, within five (5) days after this Decision becomes
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the respondent International
Travel Service is hereby directed to pay complainant <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> the sum of Five Hundred Seventy-Six Pesos
(P576.00) by way of restitution of underpaid wages from the period <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1971</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1972</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span> (p. 63, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioner appealed to the NLRC (p. 64, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) but nevertheless the decision was affirmed (p. 70, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>last ditch effort for a reversal,
petitioner further appealed to respondent Minister of Labor who, thru his
Deputy Minister ordered the dismissal of the appeal on September 25, 1978 for
lack of merit (p. 77, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence the petition alleging that respondent
gravely abused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">his </span>discretion in
dismissing the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main contention of petitioner is that private respondent's claim
for underpayment has prescribed under Art. 281 (now second paragraph <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>Article 290) of PD 442 as amended
by RA 6715 which provides among others that:</p>

<blockquote>"All money claims accruing prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Code shall be filed with the appropriate entities established under th<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">i</span>s Code <u>within one year from the
date of such <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span></u> and shall be <span class="GramE">proceeded</span> or determined in accordance with the <span class="SpellE">implementating</span> rules and regulations of the Code; otherwise
they shall be forever barred." (Underscoring Ours) (p. 34, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It argues that, since PD 442 took effect
on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1974</st1:date> and
that private respondent filed the complaint only on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1975</st1:date>, her claim has
prescribed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also claims that the
labor arbiter unjustifiably concluded that the one (1) year period under said
article was arrested by reason of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
civil action for restitution of the underpaid wages which was impliedly
instituted with the filing of the criminal information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to it, such conclusion is erroneous
because under Article 281 (now Article 290) of PD 442 as amended what is
required is that, money claims must be filed and adjudicated before the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">appropriate entity, which is the Regional
Office of the </span>NLRC, within the one year period fixed therein, independently
from the criminal action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's defense of prescription as a bar to private
respondent's claim for underpayment is<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 281 (now second paragraph of Article
290) refers to <span class="GramE">money</span> claims <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">not yet filed in the appropriate </span>entities when the New Labor
Code took effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not cover the
case of private respondent who appropriately filed her complaint with the old
Region IV of the then Department of Labor but who, in turn, merely recommended
to the City Fiscal of Manila the criminal prosecution of petitioner in the
Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch XVII without mention of her money
claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She should not be prejudiced by
the ineptness of one labor official.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
cannot be faulted for relying on the information filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1973</st1:date>
for recovery of those claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
she pursued the same until it was unfortunately dismissed on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1975</st1:date> on the legal
technicality that the act complained of is no longer penalized by the New Labor
Code which has repealed the Minimum Wage Law, RA 602, as amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, she was given a flicker of hope
when the trial court pointed out that "the remedy if any, of the
complainant is that provided in Article 128 of the Code under which any
regional office of the Department of Labor may certify to the NLRC any matter
involving the recovery of wages and benefits owing to an employee." With
renewed fervor, she immediately filed her complaint anew with the Regional
Office of the Ministry of Labor on <st1:date year="1975" day="11" month="11">November
 11, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly then, the
second paragraph of Article 290, New Labor Code should not affect her money
claims which were filed as early as 1971 and through no fault of her own, were
referred to the regular courts only to be unceremoniously dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In all probability, she received the order of dismissal dated <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1975</st1:date> after the lapse of
the one-year period from <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="11">November 1,
 1974</st1:date> within which to file money claims accruing prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Labor Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the records are bereft of this important
information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, even if she
received the order of dismissal prior to the lapse of the prescriptive period,
she was only re-filing her claim, the amount of which is only P576.00
representing unpaid wages from the period of <st1:date year="1971" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1971</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1972" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering all the circumstances in this case, Article 290 of the New
Labor Code should be made inapplicable to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As held in Manila Electric Company v. NLRC, G.R.
No. 78763, <st1:date year="1989" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1989</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"In carrying out and interpreting the Labor Code's provisions
and its implementing regulations, the workingman's welfare should be the
primordial and paramount consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This kind of interpretation gives meaning and substance to the liberal
and compassionate spirit of the law as provided for in Article 4 of the New
Labor Code which states that 'all doubts in the implementation and
interpretation of the provisions of the Labor Code including its implementing
rules and regulations shall be resolved in favor of labor.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against petitioner.</span></p>
