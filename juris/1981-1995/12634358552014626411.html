<blockquote>"x x x the Intelligence Special Operations Groups of the
Navotas Police Station had been receiving telephone calls from concerned
citizens complaining about the rampant selling of marijuana somewhere in a
basketball court at Kapalaran St., San Roque, Navotas, Metro Manila.  On October 20, 1990, Pat. Nemesio Ira, a
member of said unit, received a similar complaint from a caller, who did not
identify himself, naming the persons allegedly selling marijuana near said
basketball court as alias 'Larry' and alias 'Raul long hair' and have the
description of said persons.  Pat. Ira
then reported the said complaint to Cpl. Roland Mabbun of the same unit.  In order to check the veracity of the said
complaint, Cpl. Mabbun contacted his civilian informer, gave him P100.00 and
instructed the latter to buy marijuana near the basketball court at Kapalaran
Street from alias Raul and Larry, after giving the description of the two suspects.  After thirty minutes, the civilian informer
reported to Cpl. Mabbun that he was able to buy three (3) tea bags of
marijuana.  At about noontime of the
same day, Cpl. Mabbun again instructed the said civilian informer to buy
marijuana to check of Raul and Larry were still at said place, and said
civilian informer returned at about 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon with two tea
bags of marijuana allegedly bought from Raul and Larry.  As only Cpl. Mabbun and Pat. Ira were at the
police station then, they waited for Pat. Lauro Santos and Pfc. Victor Luya,
who arrived at about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon and they organized
themselves into a team for the purposes of conducting a buy-bust operation,
with Cpl. Mabbun as team leader and Pat. Ira as poseur-buyer.   At about 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon of the
same day, the team, accompanied by the civilian informer, proceeded to
Kapalaran St. and positioned themselves in an alley near the basketball court
where they were met along the way by Raul and Larry.  The civilian informer  introduced Pat. Ira to Raul and Larry as a person who wanted to buy
marijuana.  Raul then asked Pat. Ira how
much he wanted to buy and the latter replied that he would buy P30.00 worth of
marijuana.  Raul asked for the money and
Pat. Ira gave him the marked money consisting of one ten peso bill and one
twenty peso bill, on which he and Cpl. Mabbun had earlier placed their initials
(Exhs. 'A' and 'B').  Raul and Larry
then went to the basketball court and took something from beneath the pile of
wood at the side of the basketball court.  Raul and Larry then returned to where they left Pat. Ira and was joined
on the way by Joselito de la Cruz.  Larry handed three tea bags of marijuana wrapped in newsprint to Pat.
Ira who, thereupon, gave the pre-arranged signal to the other members of the
team, who ran towards them and helped him in arresting the three suspects.  The team members then asked Raul as to where
the other stocks of marijuana were and the latter accompanied them to the side
of the basketball court where there was a pile of pieces of wood.  Raul took a nestogen milk can under the pile
of wood and gave it to the police officers.  The can contained seventeen (17) tea bags of marijuana which were
individually wrapped in newsprint.  The
police officers likewise recovered the marked money from Raul and they brought
the three suspects to the Navotas Police Station.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the Navotas Police Station, Pat. Ira and Cpl. Mabbun placed
their initials and the words 'buy bust' on the newsprint wrapper of the three
(3) tea bags of marijuana bought by Pat. Ira from the accused (Exhs. 'H-1' to
'H-3'; 'H-1-A' to 'H-3-A'; 'H-1-B' to 'H-3-B').  They likewise placed their initials on the nestogen can (Exh.
'G') and on the newsprint wrapper of the seventeen (17) tea bags of marijuana
contained in said can (Exh. 'G-1' to 'G-17').  All the marijuana confiscated were thereafter turned over to the
National Bureau of Investigation for laboratory examination.  The certification and report subsequently
issued by the National Bureau of Investigation, which were admitted by the
defense counsel, show that the examination of the specimen submitted gave
positive results for marijuana (Exhs. 'E' to 'F')."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These facts were testified to by Pat. Nemesio Ira<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

agents of the Intelligence Special Operations Group of the Navotas Police
Station who had posed as buyer-poseur and team leader, respectively, of the
buy-bust operation.  The testimony of
the forensic chemist of the Forensic Chemistry Section of the National Bureau
of Investigation ("NBI") was not ?????fered by the prosecution, since
the defense admitted<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>the former's Certification dated 22
October 1990 (Exhibit "E") and Report dated 23 October 1990 (Exhibit
"F"); both documents concluded that the specimens delivered to the
NBI for forensic chemistry examination, weighing approximately 34 grams, proved
positive for marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants presented a different version of the facts.  The trial court summed up appellants' story
as follows:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, both accused denied the charge against
them.  They claim that between 4:00 to
4:30 o'clock in the afternoon of October 22, 1990, they were sitting on a bench
near the basketball court at Kapalaran St., together with Joselito de la Cruz,
watching five persons playing basketball.  Three policemen, whom they later came to know as Pat. Ira, Pat. Luya and
a certain Baba suddenly alighted from a motorized tricycle which stopped in
front of them.  The said policemen
arrested them and brought them to the Navotas Municipal Building.  During the investigation, Cpl. Mabbun was
forcing them to admit ownership of the marijuana which was shown to them but
they refused to do so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anna Rose Rafael tried to corroborate the claim of the
accused.  She testified that at about 4:00
to 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon of October 22, 1990, she was at the door of
her house at Kapalaran St., about six (6) meters away from the basketball court
when a motorized tricycle stopped in front of Raul Roldan, Larry Santiago and
another person who were then sitting on a bench near the wall of the basketball
court; that three policemen alighted from said motorized tricycle, drew their
guns and poked the same at Raul Roldan and Larry Santiago; and that the
policemen thereafter brought Raul Roldan and Larry Santiago with them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As noted, appellants' brief assigns a solitary error, cast in
very general terms, allegedly committed by the trial court.  Close study of appellants' brief reveals an
enumeration of seven (7) instances where the trial court arrived at conclusions
adverse to the defense because, according to appellants, the former
"misread certain pieces of evidence [or] it overlooked certain material
circumstances."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> In

</span>(7) assignments of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">error.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These assignments of error, however, have a common element:  the trial court's ascribing credibility to
prosecution witnesses which the defense contends to be misplaced.  Hence, the ultimate issue posed in this case
is whether the trial court erred (1) in giving credence to the testimony of
prosecution witnesses tending to show that they had succeeded in entrapping
appellants in a buy-bust operation as peddlers of marijuana on the afternoon of
22 October 1990; and (2) in not believing the claims of the defense that (a) no
buy-bust operation actually occurred and (b) that the accused were merely being
forced to admit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ownership of, and to
implicate a certain Jojo Florendo as </span>the source of, the marijuana.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fundamental issue obviously involves the credibility of
witnesses.  There is no paucity of
jurisprudence relating to the Court’s role in respect of issues of this nature.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Court accords great
respect to the factual conclusions drawn by trial courts, particularly on the
matter of credibility of witnesses, since the trial judge had the opportunity

were telling the truth or not.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> When the issue is one of credibility of

<p class="BODY">Appellants here have failed to show any reason why the Court
should depart from the general rule.</p>

On the contrary, appellants contend, they had established ill motive on the

one Jojo Florendo as the source of the marijuana.  This fact was allegedly revealed in the cross-examination<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
