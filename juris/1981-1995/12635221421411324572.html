The award in favor of the private respondents taxi-drivers Romelto 
Zagado, Anastacio Marfil, Dioscoro Dimpal and other drivers of the taxis
 of the EM Transport, Inc. who later joined them there being a total of 
sixty-six (66) in all of the emergency cost of living allowance pursuant
 to Presidential Decree No. 525 by respondent Jacobo C. Clave, the 
Presidential Executive Assistant of the Office of the President 
sustaining a decision of the respondent Presidential Assistant for Legal
 Affairs of the Office of the President, Ronaldo B. Zamora, now 
incumbent Assemblyman, is assailed in this <em>certiorari </em>proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  The principal reliance for the reversal sought is on the due process,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  both in its procedural and substantive aspects.  The claim of the 
denial of procedural due process arose in the opinion of petitioner from
 the fact that the order of the Officer-in-Charge of Regional Office No.
 IV of the then Department of Labor was issued without the benefit of 
any hearing.  The assertion of lack of substantive due process was based
 on what petitioner considered to be the oppressive and unjust character
 of the application to the respondent taxi-drivers of the Presidential 
Decree working as they do under the "boundary system".  As will be 
shown, the arguments adduced do not suffice to call for a reversal.  The
 petition is not impressed with merit.
<p>
The decision of respondent Zamora, now under review states the case and 
the facts with clarity and right of respondent taxi-drivers to the 
emergency cost-of-living allowance under Presidential Decree No. 525 
with persuasiveness.  Thus:  "This is an appeal filed by 
respondent-appellant (company), through counsel, from the order dated 
December 27, 1977, of the Secretary of Labor (Secretary for short) 
affirming the order of the Officer-in-Charge of Regional Office No. 4 
and dismissing the partial appeal of both parties.  Records reveal that 
complainants-appellees are taxi drivers of the company who were then 
paid on commission basis which was subsequently changed to boundary 
system pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement entered into by 
and between the herein company and the Samahan ng mga Tsuper sa E.M. 
Transport, Inc. and Trade Unions of the Philippines and Allied Services 
(TUPAS) of which the former are members.  On April 19, 1976, 
complainants-appellees filed a complaint against the company for 
non-payment of emergency cost of living allowance pursuant to 
Presidential Decree No. 525 and non-payment of the 13th month pay under 
Presidential Decree No. 851.  On February 28, 1977, the Regional Office 
No. 4 issued an order granting payment of emergency cost of living 
allowance to complainants-appellees and dismissing their claim for 
payment of the 13th month pay.  Thereafter, both parties filed their 
partial appeal from this order, complainants-appellees reiterating their
 claim for payment of the 13th month pay and respondent-appellant 
contending that the former are not entitled to the emergency cost of 
living allowance, considering that they work under the boundary system 
and, therefore, have no fixed salary.  On June 30, 1977, the 
Officer-in-Charge of Regional Office No. 4 issued an order affirming 
said order of February 28, 1977, and denying both parties' partial 
appeal, treated as motions for reconsideration, for lack of merit.  
Dissatisfied, both parties filed their partial appeal to the Secretary 
who issued the appealed order.  On February 20, 1978, 
respondent-appellant filed the instant appeal.  * * * The main issue to 
be resolved as this Office sees it is whether or not 
complainants-appellees are entitled to emergency cost of living 
allowance under PD 525.  Respondent-appellant anchors its defense on the
 fact that since complainants-appellees are paid on commission basis 
which was later on changed to boundary system and, further, are not 
covered by the minimum wage law, they, therefore, are not entitled to 
emergency cost of living allowance under said Decree.  This contention 
is rendered untenable by Section 2 of the Rules and Regulations 
Implementing PD 525, which pertinently states:  'Section 2. Employees 
Covered.  (a) The Decree shall apply to all employees of covered 
employers, regardless of their position, designation or employment 
status, and irrespective of the method by which their wages are paid, 
including temporary, casual, probationary, and seasonal employees and 
workers.' It is therefore clear that ‘irrespective of the method by 
which their wages are paid,’ whether on commission basis and later on 
converted to boundary system as in the case at bar, the 
complainants-appellees are covered by the provisions of said Decree.  
The aforequoted provision is indubitable and needs no further 
explanation.  However, this Office is at a loss as to the basis of the 
computation of the total amount of the award and the listing of the 
deserving drivers, it appearing that no evidence from respondent was 
received on this point by the department.  The elementary rules of 
justice and fair play dictate that a fair determination of the amount of
 the individual awards be made on the basis of material evidence and 
pertinent records submitted by the parties herein.  In view of all the 
foregoing, the decision of the Secretary of Labor upholding the 
entitlement of complainants-appellees to the cost of living allowance 
should be, as hereby it is, affirmed.  Accordingly, the Department of 
Labor is hereby directed to receive the necessary evidence to determine 
the listing of the deserving drivers and the amount of individual 
awards."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
To repeat, the petition lacks merit and must be dismissed.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  Presidential Decree No. 525 is quite clear.  It is free from 
ambiguity.  Its very title "Making Mandatory the Payment of Emergency 
Allowance Under Letter of Instructions No. 174" speaks categorically.  
The payment of emergency allowance is mandatory.  It applies to all 
employers.  The only exemption is "a severely distressed industry or 
branch thereof, or enterprise therein, as defined by the Department of 
Labor in accordance with established standard methods of determining the
 same."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  Petitioner does 
not belong to such category.  There is no escaping the conclusion then 
that compliance is required from the petitioner.  Absent any valid 
ground for non-applicability as to it under the due process objection, 
it cannot evade its liability.  There was in the recent case of National
 Federation of Labor v. Eisma<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> a reiteration of the Lizarraga Hermanos doctrine: "The first and fundamental duty of courts, in our judgment, is to <em>apply </em>the
 law.  Construction and interpretation come only after it has been 
demonstrated that application is impossible or inadequate without them."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  There is no merit to the contention that there was lack of 
procedural due process.  Even if it be assumed that the Order of the 
Officer-in-Charge was issued without any hearing, the subsequent 
developments revealed that the claim of the petitioner was accorded the 
fullest consideration.  So it is apparent from his own petition.  He 
filed a motion for reconsideration which was denied by the same 
Officer-in-Charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  He 
appealed to the then Secretary of Labor, now Minister, Blas Ople, 
raising the same question.  Again, he was unsuccessful, the order of 
such Officer-in-Charge being affirmed in toto.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>
  After which, the matter was elevated to the Office of the President 
resulting in the decision of the Presidential Assistant for Legal 
Affairs, now Assemblyman Ronaldo B. Zamora.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  There was, thereafter, a motion for reconsideration, but, again, no 
merit could be discerned therein as evidenced by the denial of then 
Presidential Executive Assistant Jacobo C. Clave.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>  According to Dormitorio v. Fernandez:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup>
 "The order * * * was the subject of a motion for reconsideration.  The 
motion for reconsideration was thereafter denied.  Under the 
circumstances, the failure to give notice to petitioners had been cured.
  That is a well-settled doctrine."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> 
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  There is no merit either to the argument that there was a denial
 of substantive due process.  What is involved is a police power 
measure, regulatory in character.  It is a well-settled doctrine that to
 nullify it on substantive due process ground, there must be a factual 
foundation of invalidity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> 
 The need for such support is all the more exigent considering that 
Presidential Decree No. 525 was inspired by the constitutional mandates 
of social justice<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>  and protection to labor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup>
 The petition is thus devoid of any reason to justify the petitioner 
from being exempted, on a plea of unconstitutional application because 
of the alleged arbitrariness.  Moreover, when it is noted how careful 
then Presidential Legal Assistant Zamora was in his decision to avoid 
any injustice to petitioner, there will be a greater realization of how 
flimsy and insubstantial is such due process argument.  As therein 
stated: "However, this office is at a loss as to the basis of the 
computation of the total amount of the award and the listing of the 
deserving drivers, it appearing that no evidence from respondent was 
received on this point by the department.  The elementary rules of 
justice and fair play dictate that a fair determination of the amount of
 the individual awards be made on the basis of material evidence and 
pertinent records submitted by the parties herein."
