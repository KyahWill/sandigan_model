<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution, upon which the trial court
based its decision, is summarized in the People's Brief as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Appellant Luciano Jumamoy and the victim Rolando Miel were
once friends and belonged to the same 'barkada' until sometime in 1970 when the
former was stabbed by the latter on his left forearm.  As a result, appellant's left arm was deformed, despite medical
attendance, because the main vein of his left arm was severely cut.  Since then the two had not met each other,
as the victim avoided appellant (sic) (p. 2, tsn, April 3, 1989).</p>

<p class="2Q">In the evening of April 1, 1987, the victim and his younger brother
Edgar, together with three other companions, went to the Cultural Center of
Inabanga, Bohol, where a 'disco' dance was being held in connection with the
commencement exercises of St. Paul Academy.  However, upon reaching the premises of the Center, the victim's brother
and a companion stayed behind and sat on a concrete bench, as the victim and
their other companions proceeded (p. 2, tsn, Nov. 11, 1988; p. 4, tsn, June 26,
1990).</p>

<p class="2Q">Upon reaching the Center, the victim and his companions joined
three other members of their 'barkada' watching the disco outside.  The victim and three of his friends were
leaning against a concrete post of the Center conversing and watching the
'disco,' when all of a sudden appellant appeared in front obliquely to the
right of the victim and fired three (3) successive shots at the latter, who
slumped and fell to the ground (pp. 2-7, tsn, July 6, 1988; pp. 2-5, tsn, Nov.
11, 1988).</p>

<p class="2Q">Thereafter, the people inside and outside the Center scampered for
safety (p. 7, tsn, July 6, 1988; p. 5, tsn, Nov. 11, 1988).  However, on his way to escape, appellant
passed by the victim's brother Edgardo and a companion who were then sitting on
a bench about 60 meters away from the Center.  When appellant got near the two, the former poked his gun at the victim's
brother, and uttered, ‘Unsa, laban ka?’ (‘What now, are you taking
sides?’).  The two remained silent, as
appellant ran behind a house and into the bushes when he saw the Mayor
approaching (pp. 1-3, tsn, June 26, 1990).</p>

<p class="2Q">Meanwhile, the victim's sister Zeny, who was then inside the
Center, came to his (sic) brother's rescue.  With the help of other people, she brought her brother to a hospital,
but the latter expired before arrival thereat (p. 9, tsn, July 6, 1988; pp.
8-9, tsn, Nov. 11, 1988).</p>

<p class="2Q">Dr. Hector Enriquez, who conducted an examination on the victim's
cadaver, issued a Medico-Legal Report (Exhibit “A”), wherein he described the
four (4) gunshot wounds sustained by the victim.  Although he found four (4) gunshot wounds on the victim's body,
Dr. Enriquez reported that it was possible that the victim was shot at only
three (3) times since the 4th wound on the right forearm was through and
through; hence, the same bullet may have also caused the 2nd wound which
penetrated the ‘subcostal margin, mid-clavicular line, right’ (pp. 1-2, tsn,
Feb. 24, 1978).</p>

<p class="2Q">The doctor deduced that based in (sic) the locations of the wounds,
the assailant must have been in front obliquely to the right of the victim when
the former shot the latter.  He also
opined that since he did not notice the presence of powder burns on the victim
and the downward trajectory of the bullets, the assailant must have been more
than two (2) feet away from, and taller or stood on a higher level than the
victim.  Furthermore, of the four (4)
wounds sustained by the victim, he considered wound No. 1 along the '7th ICS,
anterior axillary line, right,' and wound No. 2 penetrating the ‘subcostal
margin, mid-clavicular line, right’ as fatal, which caused the victim's death
(pp. 2-3, Ibid.).</p>

<p class="2Q">Dr. Enriquez also recovered from the victim's body one (1) slug (p.
3, Ibid.), which, when examined by the NBI Supervising Ballistician of Region
VII stationed at Cebu, City, was found to have been fired from a .38-caliber
firearm, probably a homemade (paltik) firearm, caliber .38 (pp. 1-3, tsn,
August 23, 1988).</p>

<p class="2Q">Upon request, Sgt. Misericordio Sapong of the Bohol PC Command
issued a certification (Exhibit "E") that appellant was never issued
a permit or license to possess or carry a firearm (p. 1, tsn, Nov. 11, 1988).”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court disregarded the accused's defense of alibi.  The latter testified that he had left
Inabanga, Bohol for Cebu City on 29 March 1987 to look for employment; he
claims to have boarded a motor banca, the M/B Roxan, which left for Cebu City
from Buenavista, Bohol at 9:00 o'clock in the morning of that date.  The motor banca supposedly reached Cebu City
at 11:00 o'clock on the same day.  He
recounts that he stayed in the house of a friend, Feliciano Cenita, in Pasil,
Cebu City from 1 April to 4 April 1987.  While in Cebu City, he drove, as a reserve driver, the passenger jeepney
owned and driven by Cenita under the so-called boundary system.  In the evening of 4 April 1987, Jumamoy
avers that he took a boat, the M/V Sweet Roro, for Manila and stayed in the
house of his brother Abundio in Mandaluyong, Metro Manila.  He stayed there for seven (7) months and
departed Inabanga only upon hearing that he had been named a suspect in the
killing of Rolando Miel; he arrived   in
Inabanga on 9 November 1987.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused did not, however, present Feliciano Cenita as a
witness despite his (accused's) repeated manifestation of his intention to do
so and the court's liberality in granting his request for postponement for the
said purpose.  Instead, "out of the
blue, the accused ... presented one Ramon Micutuan ... to corroborate his claim
that in the evening of April 1, 1987, he was in Cebu City driving a passenger
jeepney."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Commenting on the accused's defense, the trial court declared:</p>

<p class="2Q">"It is a well-settled rule that <u>alibi</u> as a defense is
weak although the Courts should not take a negative attitude in some cases
against the accused, if the defense of <u>alibi</u> reveals the truth.  <u>Alibi</u> is also entitled to credit if
the accused is not positively identified by the prosecution witnesses.  Moreover, the accused claiming <u>alibi</u>
as a defense must prove that it was impossible for him to be at the place at
the time of the commission because he was elsewhere during the incident.</p>

<p class="2Q">The records in this case will show that at the time of the
incident, at the time of the police investigation, during the preliminary
investigation before the Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Inabanga-Buenavista
as well as in the trial proper, the accused was positively identified by the
prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="2Q">It was established by the prosecution that the prosecution
witnesses and the accused knew and were familiar with each other from the time
they attained the age of reason because they lived in adjacent barangays located
in the same municipality.  It was also
established by the prosecution that at the time of the incident there were
several ‘blinking’ dancing lights at the cultural center because of the ongoing
disco dance.  In fact, there was another
light -- an electric of 25 watts -- which was placed at the concrete post where
the victim and some of the prosecution witnesses were then leaning
against.  That electric bulb was very
near to the victim and the accused at the time of the incident.</p>

<p class="2Q">During the hearing proper as well as during the investigation
conducted by the police and before the municipal circuit trial court during the
preliminary investigation, all the prosecution eyewitnesses pointed without
hesitancy to the accused as the murderer of the victim, and during the trial
before this Court there was not even one witness wavered of (sic) his
identification of the accused as the author of the crime.</p>

<p class="2Q">To the mind of the Court, the accused's evidence of <u>alibi</u>
cannot be believed, the same being clearly an <u>afterthought</u> or <u>afterwit</u>
because while the accused himself and his witness Manuelito Cajes positively
declared during the presentation of the defense evidence in chief that it was
on <u>March</u> <u>29,</u> <u>1987</u> that they were on board MB Roxan
together from Buenavista, BohoI, to Cebu City, the owner of the MB Roxan, Engr.
Leandro Tirol, however, declared on rebuttal that it was impossible for the
accused to have boarded on the said vessel on March 29, 1987, that date being a
Sunday and that MB Roxan did not have any voyage from Buenavista, Bohol, to
Cebu City on that date because it was not legally authorized to do so.  So that on surrebuttal, the accused
conveniently changed the date March 29, 1987 to <u>probably</u> March 30,
1987."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused thus appeals the said judgment of conviction<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and in his Appellant's Brief, claims that the trial court committed the
following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE PROSECUTION FAILED TO
PROVE THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT IN THE TWO
CASES.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR THE
TWO CRIMES OF MURDER AND QUALIFIED ILLEGAL POSSESSION OF FIREARM AND SENTENCING
HIM THE (sic) PENALTY OF <u>RECLUSION</u> <u>PERPTUA</u> IN EACH OF THE SAID
TWO CRIMES.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The assigned errors were discussed in eight (8) short paragraphs,
to wit:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Let us try to assess the testimonies of the alleged
eyewitnesses of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="2Q">Originally there were six (6) alleged eyewitnesses for the
prosecution.  Surprisingly, only three
(3) took the witness stand and testified.  The supression (sic) of the testimonies of the other three (3) alleged
eyewitnesses raises some doubts that their testimonies would mixed (sic) up the
evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="2Q">The testimonies of the three (3) alleged eyewitnesses who actually
testified were inconsistent with each other.  Each of the three witnesses presented different versions as to the
source of light that lighted the place of the incident.  They were not united as to whether the place
was sufficiently lighted that enabled (sic) them to identify the accused.</p>

<p class="2Q">The inconsistencies of the three witnesses only prove that they are
not telling the truth.  They wanted to
hide the truth that the place of incident was dark, and they could not identify
the person or persons who shot and killed the victim.</p>

<p class="2Q">Another doubtful testimony is about the description of the firearm
allegedly used by the assailant.  One
witness said that the firearm used by the accused was a short firearm, but on
cross-examination the same witness declared that he did not actually see the
firearm.  What he saw was the sparkling
lights that came out from the barrel of the firearm after it was fired (Page 4,
TSN, August 24, 1988).  If the witness
saw the sparks, then the place must be dark.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="letter-spacing:-.5pt">Alfredo Alforque, one of the
prosecution </span>witnesses who claimed to have seen the shooting, made the
following doubtful testimonies (sic):</p>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While in that position,
you said Luciano Jumamoy suddenly appeared.  From what direction did he come?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From behind us, passing
our right side walking towards Rolando Miel (Page 7, TSN, Oct. 4, 1988).<span style="letter-spacing:-.7pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">However, on cross-examination, he changed his answer when he made
the following answer:</p>

<blockquote><span style="letter-spacing:.85pt">Q<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>you did not notice immediately the accused when (sic) he
suddenly arrived?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="letter-spacing:1.6pt"><span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I noticed him because he suddenly arrived from behind.  He was running (Page 9, TSN, Oct. 4, 1988).</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The serious and material inconsistencies of the testimonies of
prosecution witnesses only proves (sic) that said witnesses were lying.  Their testimonies were all fabricated.  They were planted witnesses.  They have to testify falsely in order to
help the family of their fallen close friend.</p>

<p class="2Q">On the other hand, the firearm alleged to have been used by the
accused in killing the victim was not presented in court during the trial.  Its caliber and make was (sic) never
established by sufficient evidence, so that there is no basis to convict the
accused for illegal (sic) possession of firearm."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is at once obvious that the instant appeal is bereft of any
merit.  The accused's failure to point
out to this Court, with specific references to the transcripts of the
stenographic notes of the testimonies of the witnesses, the so-called
inconsistencies committed by the three (3) prosecution witnesses, and to make <u>statements</u>
<u>of</u> <u>facts</u>, though he started the Appellant's Brief with the
heading "Statement of Facts And of the Case,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
betrays an honest realization of the futility of this appeal and not merely the
lack of diligence or zeal in the pursuit thereof which, incidentally, is
likewise eloquently evidenced therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant appeal rests principally on the issue of the
credibility of the witnesses for the prosecution and, to a lesser extent, on
the alleged suppression of evidence and failure to present in evidence the
firearm used by the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that the issue of credibility is to be resolved
primarily by the trial court because it is in a better position to decide the
question, having heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during the trial.  Thus,
its findings on the matter of the credibility of witnesses are entitled to the
highest respect and will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of any
showing that it overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied some facts or
circumstances of weight or substance which would have affected the result of
the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully reviewed the records and the transcripts of the
stenographic notes of the testimonies of the witnesses and find nothing therein
to warrant a reversal of the findings of fact of the trial court.  The meticulous care with which the court <i>a
quo</i> summarized and analyzed, in its 31-page decision, the testimonies of
the witnesses of both parties during the direct and cross examinations attests
to its impartial disposition of the cases in the light of applicable
jurisprudence.  That the accused was
positively identified by prosecution witnesses Lino Gudes, Alfredo Alforque and
Rodrigo Aparicio is beyond dispute.  These three had known the accused long before the incident; moreover,
the place where the shooting took place, the cultural center, was sufficiently
lighted.  Nor was any motive ascribed by
the accused to these witnesses to show why they would falsely testify against
him.  In the absence of evidence manifesting
any ill motive on the part of the witnesses for the prosecution, it logically
follows that no such improper motive could have existed and that, corollarily,
their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, if an accused had nothing to do with the crime, it is against the
natural order of events and of human nature and against the presumption of good
faith that a prosecution witness would falsely testify against the former.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's failure to present the other witnesses listed
in the information did not constitute, contrary to the contention of the
accused, suppression of evidence.  The
prosecutor has the exclusive prerogative to determine the witnesses to be
presented for the prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
If the prosecution has several eyewitnesses, as in the instant case, the
prosecutor need not present all of them but only as many as may be needed to
meet the quantum of proof necessary to establish the guilt of the accused
beyond reasonable doubt.  The
testimonies of the other witnesses may, therefore, be dispensed with for being
merely corroborative in nature.  This
Court has ruled that the non-presentation of corroborative witnesses would not
constitute suppression of evidence and would not be fatal to the prosecution's
case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, there is no showing that the eyewitnesses who were not presented in
court as witnesses were not available to the accused.  We reiterate the rule that the adverse presumption from a
suppression of evidence is not applicable when (1) the suppression is not wilful;
(2) the evidence suppressed or withheld is merely corroborative or cumulative;
(3) the evidence is at the disposal of both parties; and (4) the suppression is
an exercise of a privilege.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, if the accused believed that the failure to present the other
witnesses was because their testimonies would be unfavorable to the
prosecution, he should have compelled their appearance, by compulsory process,
to testify as his own witnesses or even as hostile witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The claimed inconsistencies are on minor, if not inconsequential
or trivial, matters.  Settled is the
rule that discrepancies on minor matters do not impair the essential integrity
of the prosecution's evidence as a whole or detract from the witnesses'
honesty.  These inconsistencies, which
may be caused by the natural fickleness of memory, even tend to strengthen
rather than weaken the credibility of prosecution witnesses because they erase
any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.  What is important is that the testimonies agree on the essential facts
and that the respective versions corroborate and substantially coincide with
each other to make a consistent and coherent whole.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can We agree with the accused that it was indispensable for
the prosecution to introduce and offer in evidence the firearm which was used
in the killing of the victim.  There is
no law or rule of evidence which requires the prosecution to do so; there is
also no law which prescribes that a ballistics examination be conducted to
determine the source and trajectory of the bullets.  For conviction to lie, it is enough that the prosecution
establishes by proof beyond reasonable doubt that a crime was committed and
that the accused is the author thereof.  The production of the weapon used in the commission of the crime is not
a condition <i>sine</i> <i>qua</i> <i>non</i> for the discharge of such a
burden for the weapon may not have been recovered at all from the
assailant.  If the rule were to be as
proposed by the accused, many criminals would go scot-free and much injustice
would be caused to the victims of crimes, their families and society.  In the instant case, it was established with
moral certainty that the accused attacked, assaulted and shot the victim
Rolando Miel with an unlicensed firearm, thereby inflicting upon the latter
multiple gunshot wounds which caused his death.  Such proof was all that was needed for the conviction of the
accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the overwhelming evidence consisting of his positive
identification as the author of Rolando Miel's death, accused has nothing to
offer but alibi.  It is a fundamental
judicial dictum that the defense of alibi cannot prevail over the positive
identification of the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, his alibi is obviously fabricated.  He was caught lying through his teeth when during rebuttal, it was shown
through the testimony of Leandro Tirol, owner of the M/B Roxan, that he
(Jumamoy) could not have left -- as he had vigorously insisted -- on board the
said vessel for Cebu City on 29 March 1987 because the same was not authorized
by its franchise to travel on that day, a Sunday.  In an effort to dodge this fatal blow, the accused took the
witness stand on surrebuttal to change the date of his supposed departure to 30
March 1987.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, despite his assurances that he would present as his witness Feliciano
Cenita of Pasil, Cebu City -- in whose house he allegedly stayed from 1 April
to 7 April 1987 -- for which reason the trial court accommodated his requests
for postponements, accused never did so.  No acceptable explanation had been offered to justify the failure of the
said prospective witness to come to the rescue of the accused.  Thus, the inevitable conclusion is that
either this Cenita is a fictitious person or that, if he exists, he was
unwilling to support the accused's claim of alibi.  If the accused had gone to Cebu City at all, it must have been
after the incident -- not to look for employment as he claimed, but to evade
arrest.  In fact, it appears that on 7
April 1987, he left for Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly convicted the accused of Murder under
Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Case No. 5064.  The killing was indeed attended by the
qualifying circumstance of treachery, which is duly alleged in the information.  The mode, manner and means of attack adopted
by the accused insured the accomplishment of his purpose, <i>i.e.,</i> the
killing of the victim without giving the latter any opportunity to defend
himself or resist the attack.  The
firing of the gun at the victim was so sudden and unexpected that the latter,
who was unarmed, was caught totally unprepared to defend himself or
retaliate.  There is treachery when the
offender commits any of the crimes against persons employing means, methods or
forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its
execution, without risk to himself arising from the defense which the offended
party might make.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to the charge of illegal possession of firearms, Section 1
of P.D. No. 1866 penalizes, <i>inter alia</i>, the unlawful possession of
firearms or ammunition with <i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum period to <i>reclusion</i>
<i>perpetua</i>.  However, under the
second paragraph thereof, the penalty is increased to death if homicide or
murder is committed with the use of an unlicensed firearm.  It may thus be loosely said that homicide or
murder qualifies the offense because both are circumstances which increase the
penalty.  It does not, however, follow
that the homicide or murder is absorbed in the offense.  If this were to be so, an anomalous
absurdity would result whereby a more serious crime defined and penalized under
the Revised Penal Code will be absorbed by a statutory offense, one which is
merely <i>malum</i> <i>prohibitum</i>.  Hence, the killing of a person with the use of an unlicensed firearm may
give rise to separate prosecutions for (a) the violation of Section 1 of P.D.
No. 1866 and (b) the violation of either Article 248 (Murder) or Article 249
(Homicide) of the Revised Penal Code.  The accused cannot plead one to bar the other; stated otherwise, the
rule against double jeopardy cannot be invoked as the first is punished by a
special law while the second -- Murder or Homicide -- is punished by the
Revised Penal Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering, however, that the imposition of the death penalty is prohibited by
the Constitution, the proper imposable penalty would be the penalty next lower
in degree, or <i>reclusion</i> <i>perpetua</i>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court also correctly imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion</i>
<i>perpetua</i> in Criminal Case No. 5065.  However, the words "or life imprisonment" following "<i>reclusion</i>
<i>perpetua</i>" in the dispositive portion of the decision should be
deleted, for the latter is not the same as life imprisonment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>
