This is an appeal from the decision rendered by the Court of First 
Instance, Branch VI of Malay­balay, Bukidnon, 15th Judicial District, 
which convicted Federico Somontao alone, among several named accused.
<p>
On May 14, 1975, Acting Provincial Fiscal Arcadio D. Fabria charged on 
three separate counts of murder and two frustrated murders before the 
Court of First Instance of Bukidnon the same group of accused:  Ciriaco 
Ganahon, Florencio Albulario, Federico Somontao, Donato Donggo, Silvino 
alias Gaye Somontao, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That on or about the 28th day of July 1974 in the afternoon, in 
barrio Patpat, Municipality of Malaybalay, Province of Bukidnon, 
Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honor­able Court, the 
above-named accused together with Conrado Maniano, Celestino Miake alias
 Felomino Miake and Carido Meleston, who are still at large, with intent
 to kill and with the use of assorted unlicensed firearms with which 
they were conveniently provided by means of treachery and evident 
preme­ditation, conspiring together and mutually helping one ano­ther, 
did then and there wilfully, unlawfully, and criminally assault, attack,

  <p> "xx xx Casiano Navarro Jr. the following injury xx xx thus the 
accused had commenced the commission of the murder directly by overt 
acts but did not perform all the acts of execution which would have

  <p> "The crime is committed by a band. </p>
  <p> "Contrary to and in viola­tion of Article 248 in relation to 
Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code" (pp. 3-4, CC 1130). “xxx x on the 
person of the latter, the following injury to wit:  xx thus the accused 
had commenced the commission of murder directly by overt acts but did

  <p> "Contrary to and in viola­tion of Article 248 in relation to Article 6 of the Revised Penal Code" (p. 2, CC 1131 rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On June 17, 1975, the accused were all arraigned.  Assisted by their 
counsels, Nemesio Beltran, Rube Gamolo and Alfredo Aquino, all pleaded 
not guilty (p. 112, rec. of CC No. 1129; p. 65, rec. of CC No. 1130; p. 
67, rec. of CC No. 1131).  The joint trial of the three [3] crimes was 
commenced on August 11, 1975 and concluded on June 28, 1976 (pp. 22 
&amp; 234, rec. of CC No. 1129, Orders of August 6, 1975 &amp; June 28, 
1976).
</p><p>
The decision dated October 28, 1976 was promulgated on November 4, 1976 
and all the accused were acquitted except herein defendant-appellant.  
The dispositive portion of said decision reads:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, as heretofore stated, the Court hereby acquits on 
reasonable doubt Ciriaco Ganahon, Florencio Albulario, Donato Dongo and 
Silvino Somontao in these three cases, and orders the immediate release 
of Ganahon, Dongo and Silvino Somontao unless detained for the 
commission of some other crime, and the cancellation of the bail bond 
posted for the provisional liberty of Albulario. </p>
  <p> "In Criminal Cases Nos. 1129, 1130 and 1131 accused Federico 
Somontao is convicted in all the three charges against him and he is 
hereby sentenced to suffer imprisonment as follows: </p>
  <p> "In Criminal Case No. 1129 -- <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to 
suffer the accessory penalties provided for by law, to indemnify the 
heirs of Emerita Navarro in the amount of P12,000.00 without subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay 1/5 of the costs. </p>
  <p> "In Criminal Case No. 1130 -- the proper penalty for this case is <em>prision correccional</em> in its maximum period to <em>prision mayor</em>,
 medium period, this being two degrees lower from the penalty prescribed
 for the consummated crime of murder under Article 248 in relation to 
Article 51 of the Revised Penal Code, there being no mitigating or 
aggravating circumstance.  Applying the Indeter­minate Sentence Law, the
 Court hereby sentences the accused Federico Somontao to suffer an 
indeterminate penalty of six months and one day of <em>prision correccional</em> as minimum to six years and one day of <em>prision mayor</em>
 as maximum, to suffer the accessory penalties provided for by law, to 
indemnify Casiano Navarro, Jr. in the amount of P2,000.00 without 
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insol­vency and to pay 1/5 of the 
costs. </p>
  <p> "In Criminal Case No. 1131 -- an indeterminate penalty of six months and one day of <em>prision correccional</em> as minimum to six years and one day of <em>prision mayor</em>
 as maximum, to suffer the accessory penalties provided for by law, to 
indemnify Dr. Navarro in the sum of P2,000.00 without subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay 1/5 of the costs. </p>
  <p> "The penalties herein imposed shall be served one after the other 
beginning with Crim. Cases Nos. 1130 and 1131, but the accused Federico 
Somontao is entitled to full credit of his preven­tive imprisonment 
beginning July 28, 1974 pursuant to the provisions of Article 29 of the 
Revised Penal Code as amended by Rep. Act No. 6127, the Court taking 
judicial notice of the fact that detention prisoners are subjected to 
the same rules and regulations as convicted prisoners" (pp. 39­-41, 
rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On November 10, 1976, the Court granted the motion of 
defendant-appellant to post bail for his release.  On April 13, 1977, 
the Court ordered his release after he posted bail in accordance with 
the November 10, 1976 order (pp. 79-81, rec. pp. 295­-302, rec. of CC 
No. 1129).
</p><p>
On February 29, 1977, the notice of appeal filed by defendant-appellant was accepted by this Court (p. 67, rec.).
</p><p>
On December 14, 1981, Attys. Roldan Mangubat and Benjamin Estrada filed a
 brief for defendant-appellant.  They impugned the decision of the court
 <em>a quo</em> which convicted the accused for hereunder assigned errors as per defendant-appellant's brief:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> “1.  In convicting accused-appellant without any basis in law and 
fact -- no proof that accused-appellant is the author of the crime and 
no proof of conspiracy; </p>
  <p> “2.  In not being consistent and firm in his Decision by believing
 the prosecution witnesses testimony against accused appellant and at 
the same time not believing the testimonies of the same prosecution 
wit­nesses as against the four (4) other accused; </p>
  <p> “3.  In not acquitting accused-appellant as the case against him is not proved beyond reasonable doubt; and </p>
  <p> “4.  In convicting the accused-appellant without finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt" (p. 227, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Solicitor General, in his Manifestation in lieu of brief, 
recommended the acquittal of the appellant on the ground that his guilt 
had not been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
It appeared that on July 28, 1974 at about 2:00 o'clock in the 
afternoon, Navarro Jr. drove their jeep from their ranch to the town 
proper of Malaybalay, Bukidnon.  Aboard, beside Navarro Jr., was Mrs. 
Emerita A. Navarro, with Dr. Navarro at the other end, and three other 
passengers, Mr. and Mrs. Aniceto Palco and Mrs. Lamayo seated at the 
back.  Along the way, they were ambushed by armed men.  After the 
shooting subsided, the Navarros, without their three passengers, 
proceeded to the Bethel Clinic for treatment.  On arrival thereat, Mrs. 
Navarro was pronounced dead (Exh. "M").  Dr. Navarro and son were 
admitted for treatment.  The latter left the following day.  Dr. Navarro
 stayed on for a few days.
</p><p>
The wounds sustained by Navarro Jr. were:  "a wound entry on the lateral
 aspect of his left thigh and an exit wound on the medial aspect of the 
same thigh.  No bone damage was seen in x-ray."
</p><p>
The wounds of Dr. Navarro were:  "x x a small bullet wound (entry) on 
the lateral mid thigh (right) and a larger wound (exit) on the medial 
aspect of the same thigh.  X-ray proved the bone to be unaffected and 
one slug to be lodged behind the right knee" (p. 21, rec. of CC No. 
1130).
</p><p>
Dr. Navarro testified that during his confinement, around 200 of the 
townspeople visited him, among whom were friends including fiscals and 
investigators.  He was pressed by the investigators for answers to their
 queries, despite his express request that the investigation be put off,
 because he did not know the answers and did not like to make mistakes, 
compounded by the fact that he was in a state of shock and pain, and 
may, as a consequence, be suffering from mental lapses as one under his 
condition at the time could suffer from.  For said reasons, his 
responses to the queries which appeared in his several statements that 
were not uniformly signed, varied (pp. 57-60, t.s.n., Aug. 11, 1975; pp.
 66-70, t.s.n., Aug. 19, 1975).
</p><p>
Dr. Navarro likewise stated that on that fateful day, after the first 
volley of fire, without having fully recovered from the shock caused by 
the sound which he mistook as flat tire, he almost simultaneously heard 
his spouse Mrs. Navarro's cry of pain, and as he turned towards her to 
determine her cause of anguish, his leg felt numb because he was also 
hit; that immediately within split seconds he jumped out of the jeep for
 cover and to safety; and that during the intervening period, he managed
 to look at, and thus recognized each of the accused including the guns 
that they used.
</p><p>
Navarro Jr. stated that he was also in a state of shock and pain when 
initially investigated (p. 16, rec. of CC No. 1130).  During the ambush,
 Navarro Jr. further stated that he stayed in the jeep longer than Dr. 
Navarro as he attended to his mother, before he followed suit and jumped
 out of the jeep for cover.
</p><p>
The Navarros impressed upon the Court that despite the terrorizing rapid
 succession of occur­rences, amidst the volleys of continuous firing, 
within fleeting seconds, both still managed to pause and thus not only 
noticed the presence of the ambushers, but that they were able to 
recognize clearly each one of them, as well as their positions and the 
guns they used.
</p><p>
Situated as the Navarros were, not even a man with the quickest reflexes
 will tarry and bother to know who and where the sources of the danger 
were except to respond to the instinct of self-preservation in the 
fastest manner possible, to secure one's life by seeking cover or 
running for safety.  On the other hand, were the ambushers keen on 
liquidating all of them, they could have done so, equipped allegedly as 
they were with guns.  Nothing appeared to have prevented them from 
firing continuously until they have killed all persons aboard the jeep 
that was at full stop.  The alleged assailants were about eight (8) or 
twenty (20) men in all firing their guns from all directions (pp. 4-5, 
CFI decision; p. 6, t.s.n., Aug. 11, 1975).  WE are hard put to believe 
that the Navarros, not only noticed, but also recognized, each of the 
faces of their ambushers, the kind of firearms each used, and their 
positions at the time of the ambush, or that there was a concerted 
desire among those they named and charged to kill all of them.  As the 
trial court noted, "the testimony of Dr. Navarro on many points detracts
 from its credibility" (p. 19, decision of the court <em>a quo</em>; p. 137, rec.).
</p><p>
Thorough examination of the testimonies showed that prior to, or at the 
time of, the ambuscade, the Navarros did not see who actually fired the 
shots that wounded them.

<p>
Aside from the Navarros' testimonies which had been rendered unreliable 
because of their mental and physical conditions when they gave their 
initial statements, the prosecution failed to present other proof which 
could have corroborated or strengthened their weak testimonies.  The 
court <em>a quo</em> in fact bewailed the lack of evidence when it said in its decision:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x It is pertinent to make an observation in the lamentable and 
half-hazard manner the police authorities made in the investiga­tion of 
these cases, thus making the prosecution labor under a handicap.  No 
evidence was shown that all the accused possessed licensed firearms, or 
that, if they did not have, that an immediate search of the houses of 
the accused and the vicinities were made to locate the firearms.  And as
 firearms were really used as shown by the wounds inflicted upon the 
victims, considering the gravity of the offenses committed, no stone 
should have been left unturned to subject all accused to a paraffin test
 to determine if they have recently fired guns.  A positive finding 
would have clinched the case for the prosecution, in that there would 
have been no doubt in the identification made by the prosecution 
witnesses" (p. 39, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Neither was there evidence nor proof presented by the prosecution to 
show that defendant-appellant acted in any manner in conspiracy with the
 other named ambushers.  The absence of proof on conspiracy was settled 
by the acquittal of all the accused, except appellant Federico Somontao.
</p><p>
Under the foregoing circumstances, Federico Somontao's individual 
culpability for the crimes charged cannot be determined, much less 
sustained; and acceptance of his alibi is thus warranted.  Alibi of the 
accused Federico Somontao, was the same as the other accused, that on 
the date of the ambush he was at a barangay meeting which started at 
1:00 o'clock and lasted up to 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon.  His 
presence thereat was confirmed by their witnesses Aida Gumindan, 
secretary-treasurer of their barrio, who had records of those who were 
at the meeting (Exh. "4" -- Federico Somontao's name was marked Exh. 
"4-0") and Chief of Police Litanon who testified that he saw Federico 
Somontao with Ganahon at the meeting.
</p><p>
Whether the alibi appeared convincing to the court <em>a quo</em> or not
 in the absence of other stronger and more convincing proof, its 
acceptance must prevail.  "The defense is alibi, known to be the weakest
 of all defenses, as it is easy to concoct and difficult to disprove.  
But x x x where the accused's identification is weakened and rendered 
unreliable, the defense of alibi assumes importance and may be given 
credence.  And while the alibi may not have been proven so 
satis­factorily as to leave no room for doubt, such an infirmity cannot 
invigorate at all the weakness of the prosecution's evidence, the reason
 being that in a criminal prosecution, the State must rely on the 
strength of its own evidence, not on the weakness of the defense xx x" 
(People vs. Basuel, 47 SCRA 222-223).
</p><p>
If at all Federico Somontao was seen at the site of the ambush, his 
presence cannot automatically justify the conclusion that he perpetrated
 any, much less committed all, of the crimes as even the Navarros 
themselves did not zero in or pinpoint on him as the person who actually
 fired all the shots that wounded all or any of them.
</p><p>
WE also said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Only by proof beyond reason­able doubt, which requires moral 
certainty, ‘a certainty that con­vinces and satisfies the reason and 
conscience of those who are to act upon it,' may the presumption of 
innocence be over­come.  For the reasons aforestated, the culpability of
 appellant Raymundo Basuel has not been demonstrated to meet the 
requisite legal and moral certainty for a judgment of conviction" 
(People vs. Basuel, <em>supra</em>, p. 224). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Solicitor General assailed Federico Somontao's conviction, citing 
aptly the case of People vs. Beltran (61 SCRA 250-51), in which We said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The important question to be determined is whether the appellant 
was the person who perpetrated the offense.  Exam­ining carefully the 
evidence of the prosecution about the identity of the assailant, We find
 that the prosecution's evidence leaves much to be desired.  The 
identity of the offender, like the crime itself, must be proven beyond 
reasonable doubt.  The question of the identification of an accused as 
the perpetrator of an offense might seem to be the simplest that could 
possibly come before a court.  But the fact is precisely the reverse.  
The question of iden­tification has proved itself over and over again, 
by far, instead the most perplexing.  As one court has observed:  'There
 are few more difficult subjects with which the administration of 
justice has to deal.  The carelessness or superficiality of observers, 
the rarity of powers of graphic description, and the different force 
with which peculiarities of form or color or expression strike different
 persons, make recognition or identification one of the least reliable 
of facts testified to even by actual witnesses who have seen the parties
 in question."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WE continued to say:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Considering the aforecited infirmities of the testimonies of the 
prosecution witnesses, We are not satisfied that the constitutional 
presumption of innocence accorded to appellant has been overcome.  To 
overcome that presumption, the guilt of appellant must be shown beyond 
reasonable doubt.  While this does not connote absolute certainty, it 
means that degree of proof which after an investigation of the whole 
record, produces moral certainty in an unprejudiced mind of appellant's 
culpability" (People vs. Beltran, <em>supra</em>, p. 255). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
WHEREFORE, THE JUDGMENT APPEALED FROM IS HEREBY REVERSED, THE 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT FEDERICO SOMONTAO IS HEREBY ACQUITTED, AND THE BAIL 
BOND FOR HIS PROVISIONAL LIBERTY IS HEREBY CANCELLED.
