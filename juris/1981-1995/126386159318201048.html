				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF THE PETITION FOR HABEAS CORPUS OF:Â  LUCIEN TRAN VAN NGHIA, PETITIONER, VS.
HON. RAMON J. LIWAG, ACTING COMMISSIONER OF THE COMMISSION ON IMMIGRATION AND DEPORTATION
(CID) AND JOHN DOES, AGENTS OF THE CID, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus
filed by Lucien Tran Van <span class="SpellE">Nghia</span> alleging that he was
arrested without warrant and deprived of his liberty by respondent Commissioner
of Immigration and Deportation and his agents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Lucien Tran Van <span class="SpellE">Nghia</span> is a
French national with temporary address in Sta. Ana, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Originally admitted to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1981</st1:date> as a
temporary visitor, his status was changed to that of an immigrant on <st1:date year="1984" day="16" month="11">November 16, 1984</st1:date> based on his
representation that he is financially capable and will invest in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To date, however, petitioner has not made any
investment and has engaged only in French tutoring and practice of acupressure.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1987</st1:date>,
respondent CID Commissioner Ramon J. <span class="SpellE">Liwag</span> received a
sworn complaint from a certain <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> G. Cabrera,
Jr., allegedly petitioner's landlord, accusing petitioner of being an
undesirable alien for "committing acts inimical to public safety and
progress."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Acting thereon, respondent Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Liwag</span>
issued on <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1987</st1:date> a
mission order to a team of seven (7) CID agents for them "to locate and
bring subject to Intelligence Division for proper disposition" and
"submit report."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1987</st1:date>,
the aforementioned CID agents went to petitioner's residence in Sta. Ana to
invite the latter to the CID headquarters for verification of his status but
petitioner and his then lady companion reportedly locked themselves inside
their bedroom and refused to talk to the agents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The immigration agents then sought the assistance of members of
the Western Police District.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once again
petitioner adamantly refused to be taken in and in the ensuing struggle, both
petitioner and the lawmen were injured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, petitioner was subdued and immediately taken to the CID
Intelligence Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">A warrant of arrest was issued by respondent Commissioner on <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="6">June 2, 1987</st1:date> but there is nothing in
the records to convince this Court that said warrant was served on petitioner
prior to his apprehension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said warrant
was based on the following acts and circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>"That<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>he applied for and
was granted permanent status on his representation that he is financially
capable of investing in the Philippines but he made no investments but engaged
in tutoring in French and practice of acupressure; that he <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>
refused to recognize the authority of immigration agents who were sent to
invite him to CID for verification of his status and physically resisted being
taken in by the agents resulting in physical injuries to himself and the
agents; that he has thereby made himself an undesirable alien subject to
deportation."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By reason of the injuries he allegedly sustained when he was
"brutally seized" by the CID agents, petitioner, upon request of the
French consul, was transferred from his detention cell at the immigration
office to the Philippine General Hospital for urgent medical treatment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1987</st1:date>,
petitioner's counsel filed the instant petition for habeas corpus to avert the
"threatened removal" of petitioner from PGH and to question the <span class="SpellE">valdity</span> of his detention by respondent Commissioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A return of the writ was filed by the
Solicitor General and the Court heard the case on oral argument on <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the parties were required to
submit their respective memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">The core issue is the legality of the arrest and detention of
petitioner by the Immigration Commissioner preparatory to deportation
proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner insists that
respondent official has no power, authority or jurisdiction to cause his arrest
because under the 1987 Constitution, it is provided that "no search
warrant or warrant of arrest shall issue except upon probable cause to be
determined personally by the judge after examination under oath or affirmation
of the complainant and the witnesses he may produce x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid argument raised by petitioner has been resolved in
the case of <st1:city><st1:place>Harvey</st1:place></st1:city> vs. <span class="SpellE">Defensor</span>-Santiago, G.R. No. 82544.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="6">June
 28, 1988</st1:date>, where the Court, through Madame Justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera, said: :</p>

<blockquote>"'The requirement of probable cause to be determined by a
Judge, does not extend to deportation proceedings.' (<span class="SpellE">Morano</span>
vs. Vivo, <u>supra</u>, citing <span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> Chun <span class="SpellE">Hai</span> vs. Commissioner, <u>infra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There need be no 'truncated' recourse to both
judicial and administrative warrants in a single <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">deportation proceeding.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The foregoing does not deviate from the ruling in Qua <span class="SpellE">Chee</span> <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> vs. Deportation Board
(G.R. No. 10280, September 30, 1963, 9 SCRA 27 [1963] <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">reiterated in Vivo vs. <span class="SpellE">Montesa</span>, <u>supra</u>,
that under the express terms of our Constitution (the 1935 Constitution), it is
therefore even doubtful whether the arrest of an individual may be ordered by
authority other than a judge if the purpose is merely to determine the
existence of a probable cause, leading to an administrative investigation.'</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"What is essential is that there should be a specific charge
against the alien intended to be arrested and deported, that a fair hearing be
conducted (Section 37 [c]) with the assistance of counsel, if desired, and that
the charge be substantiated by competent evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The particular circumstances obtaining in the case at bar have
seriously placed on doubt the legality and propriety of petitioner's
apprehension by respondent Commissioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For unlike in the Harvey case where the <span class="SpellE">warrantless</span>
capture of two suspected alien pedophiles was based on probable cause
ascertained only after close surveillance for a three-month period during which
their activities were monitored, herein petitioner was "invited" by a
combined team of CID agents and police officers at his apartment unit on the
strength of a mission order issued by the Commissioner on Immigration based on
a sworn complaint of a single individual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The essential requisite of probable cause was conspicuously absent.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even assuming that the arrest of petitioner was not legal at
the beginning, certain events have supervened to render his petition moot and
academic or to otherwise cure whatever defect there was at the inception of his
arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, petitioner is no longer under confinement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="6">June
 20, 1987</st1:date>, petitioner was released upon the posting and approval of
a personal <span class="SpellE">bailbond</span> on <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1987</st1:date> in the amount of P20,000.00 during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the administrative proceedings by the CID or
until further orders of the Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The general rule in a number of cases is that the release, whether permanent or
temporary, of a detained person renders the petition for habeas corpus moot and
academic, unless there are restraints attached to his release which precludes
freedom of action, in which case the Court can still inquire into the nature of
his involuntary restraint under the <span class="SpellE">Villavicencio</span> vs.
<span class="SpellE">Lukban</span> rule.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Moncupa</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>,
<u>supra</u>, the Court granted the writ of habeas corpus <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the fact that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Moncupa</span> had been
temporarily released from detention on orders of the defense minister.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">Moncupa</span>
case, it was shown that attached to his discharge was the prohibition to
travel, to change his abode and to grant interviews to members of the mass
media without official permission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was also ordered to report regularly to the military authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court subsequently nullified said
conditions and ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Such restrictions limit the freedom of movement of the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not physical restraint
alone which is inquired into by the writ of habeas corpus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Where a person continues to be unlawfully denied one or more
of his constitutional freedoms, where there is present a denial of due process,
where the restraints are not merely involuntary but appear to be unnecessary,
and where a deprivation of freedom originally valid has, in the light of
subsequent developments, become arbitrary, the person concerned or those
applying in his behalf may still avail themselves of the privilege of the
writ."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Lucien Tran Van <span class="SpellE">Nghia</span> is not
similarly restrained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only condition
in his <span class="SpellE">bailbond</span> is that ordinarily found in any other
analogous undertaking, which is "to appear and answer the complaint x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; will at all times hold
himself x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> amenable to
the orders and processes of the Court; and after conviction, he will surrender
himself x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> in execution
of such judgment x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, records show that formal deportation proceedings have
been initiated against petitioner before the Board of Special Inquiry of the
CID.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The restraint (if any) against petitioner's person has therefore become
legal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writ of habeas corpus has
served its purpose.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>
