ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> of the
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. no. 51078-R, dated 29 August 1978, which dismissed
petitioner's action for recognition and support against private respondent, and
from the respondent Court's resolution, dated 11 October 1978, denying
petitioner's motion for reconsideration of said decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 October 1968, petitioner Janice Marie Jao, then a minor,
represented by her mother and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">guardian-<u>ad</u>-<u>litem</u>
</span>Ar­lene Salgado, filed a case for recognition and support with the
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court against private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">respondent Perico V. Jao.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
latter denied paternity so the parties agreed to a blood grouping test which
was in due course conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) upon
order of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The result of
the blood grouping test, held 21 January 1969, indicated that Janice could not
have been the possible offspring of Perico V. Jao and Arlene S. Salgado.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court initially found the result of the tests legally
conclusive but upon plaintiff's (herein peti­tioner's) second motion for
reconsideration, it ordered a trial on the merits, after which, Janice was
declared the child of Jao, thus entitling her to his monthly support.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jao appealed to the Court of Appeals, questioning the trial court's
failure to appreciate the result of the blood grouping tests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As there was no showing whatsoever that there
was any irregularity or mistake in the conduct of the tests, Jao argued that
the result of the tests should have been conclusive and indisputable evidence
of his non-pater­nity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals upheld Jao's contentions and re­versed the
trial court's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its decision,
the Court of Appeals held:</p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence of the contending par­ties, it appears
undisputed that JAO was intro­duced to ARLENE at the Saddle and Sirloin, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Bay</span>side Club, by Melvin Yabut.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After this meeting, JAO dated and courted
ARLENE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not long there­after, they had
their first sexual intercourse and subsequently, they lived together as husband
and wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>It further appears undisputed that in April 1968, JAO accompanied
ARLENE to the Marian Gene­ral Hospital for medical check-up and her confine­ment
was with JAO's consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>JAO paid the ren­tals
where they lived, the salaries of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">maids,
</span>and other household expenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>The record discloses that ARLENE gave birth to JANICE on August 16,
1968, after completing 36 weeks of pregnancy, which indicates that ARLENE must
have conceived JANICE on or about the first week of December, 1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, one issue to be resolved in this appeal
is whether on or about that time, JAO and ARLENE had sexual intercourse and
were already living with one another as hus­band and wife.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In this connection, ARLENE contends that she first met JAO sometime
in the third or fourth week of November, 1967 at the Saddle and Sirloin,
Bayside Club; that after several dates, she had carnal knowledge with him at
her house at 30 Long-beach, Merville, Paranaque, Rizal in the evening of
November 30, 1967, and that he started to live with her at her dwelling after
December 16, 1967, the date they finished their cruise to Mindoro Island.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, JAO, albeit admitting that he met ARLENE at the
Saddle and Sirloin, Bayside Club, however, maintains that this <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>on December 14, 1967 because the
day following, he and his guests:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>ARLENE, Melvin Yabut, Didi Cres­cini and Charlie Litonjua went to
Mindoro by boat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He dated ARLENE four
times in January, 1968.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He remembered he
had carnal knowledge of her for the first time on January 18, 1968, be­cause
that was a week after his birthday and it was only in May, 1968 that he started
cohabiting with her at the Excelsior Apartments on Roxas Boulevard.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These conflicting versions of the parties emphasize, in resolving
the paternity of JANICE, the role of the blood grouping tests conducted by the
NBI and which resulted in the negative find­ing that in a union with ARLENE,
JAO could not be the father of JANICE.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We cannot sustain the conclusion of the trial court that the NBI is
not in a position to determine with mathematical precision the issue of
parentage by blood grouping test, considering the rulings of this Court xxx
where the blood <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">grouping tests of the
NBI were admitted; especial­ly where, in the latter case, it was Dr. Lorenzo
Sunico who conducted the test and it appears that in the present case, the same
Dr. Sunico approved the findings and report.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>xxx In Co Tao vs. Court of Appeals, 101 Phil 188</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the Supreme </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Court had given weight to the findings of the NBI in its blood grouping
test.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it cannot be gainsaid that
the competency of the NBI to conduct blood grouping tests has been recognized
as early as the 1950's.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The views of the Court on blood grouping tests may be stated as
follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Paternity -- <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Science
has demons­</span>trated that by the analysis of blood samples of the mother,
the child, and the alleged father, <u>it can be estab­lished conclusively that
the man is not the father of the child</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But group blood testing cannot show that a man is the father of a
particular child, but at least can show only a possibility that he is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Statutes in many states, and courts in
others, have recognized the value and the limitations of such tests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some of the decisions have recognized the
conclusive presumption of non-paternity where the results of the test, made in
the prescribed man<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ner, show the
impossibility of the </span>alleged paternity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is one of the few cases in which the judgment of the Court may
scientifically be completely accurate, and intolerable results avoi­ded, such
as have occurred where the finding is allowed to turn on oral tes­timony
conflicting with the results of the test.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The findings of such blood tests are not admissible to prove
the fact of paternity as they show only a possi­bility that the alleged father
or any one of many others with the same blood type may have been the father of
the child.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the Uniform Act
recognizes that the tests may have some probative value to establish paternity
where the blood type and the combination in the child is shown to be rare, in
which case the judge is given discretion to let it in" (I Jones on
Evidence, 5th Ed., pp. 193-194).</p>

<p class="2Q">"In one specific biological trait, viz, <u>blood groups</u>,
scientific opinion is now in accord in accepting the fact that there is a
causative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">relation between the trait of
the pro­genitor and the trait of the progeny.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the blood composition of a child may be some evidence as
to the child's paternity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But thus far
this trait (in the present state of scientific discovery as generally accepted)
can be used only <u>negatively</u> i.e. to evidence that a particular man F is
not the father of a particular child C." (I Wigmore on Evidence 3rd Ed.,
pp. 610-611).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>In a last ditch effort to bar the admissi­bility and competency of
the blood test, JANICE claims that probative value was given to blood tests
only in cases where they tended to estab­lish paternity; and that there has
been no case where the blood test was invoked to establish non-paternity,
thereby implying that blood tests have probative value only when the result is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a </span>possible affirmative and not when in
the nega<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">tive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This contention is fallacious and must be </span>rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To sustain her contention, in effect, would
be recognizing only the possible affirma­tive finding but not the blood
grouping test it­self for if the result were negative, the test is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">regarded worthless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, this is illogical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>xxx As an admitted test, it is
admissible in subsequent similar proceedings whether the result be in the
negative or in the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>xxx"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals also found other facts that ran contrary to
petitioner's contention that Jao's actions be­fore and after JANICE was born
were tantamount to recogni­tion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
the respondent appellate court:</p>

<blockquote>"On the contrary, after JANICE was
born, JAO did not recognize her as his own.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, he filed a petition that his name as father of JANICE in the
latter's certificate of live birth be dele­ted, evidencing his repudiation,
rather than re­cognition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere acts
of JAO in cohabiting with ARLENE, the attention given to her during her
pregnancy and the financial assistance exten­ded to her cannot overcome the
result of the blood grouping test.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
acts of JAO cannot be evaluated as recognizing the unborn JANICE as his own as
the possession of such status cannot be founded on conjectures and
presumptions, espe­cially so that, We have earlier said, JAO re­fused to
acknowledge JANICE after the latter's birth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>JAO cannot be compelled to recognize JANICE based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on </span>paragraph
2 of Article 283 in relation to Article 289 of the New Civil Code which
provides:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"When the child is in
conti­nuous possession of status of a child of the alleged father by the direct
acts of the latter."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nor can there be compulsory recognition under paragraphs 3 or 4 of
said article which states:</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">"(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>When the child was
conceived during the time when the mother cohabited with the supposed father;</p>

<p class="3Q">(4)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the child has in
his favor any evidence or proof that the defendant is his father."</p>

<blockquote>As aptly appreciated by the court below,
JANICE could have been conceived from November 20, 1967 to December 4,
1967.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, ARLENE claims that her
first sexual intercourse with JAO was on Nov­ember 30, 1967 while the latter
avers it was one week after January 18, 1968.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, to satis­fy paragraph 3 as above-quoted, JANICE must have been
conceived when ARLENE and JAO started to cohabit with one another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since ARLENE herself testified that their
cohabitation started only after December 16, 1967, then it cannot be gain­said
that JANICE was <u>not</u> conceived during this cohabitation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, no recognition will lie.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, recognition cannot be had under
paragraph 4 as JANICE has no other evidence or proof of her alleged paternity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Apart from these, there is the claim of JAO that, at the critical time
of conception, ARLENE had carnal knowledge with two other men:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Oying" Fernandez and Melvin Yabut,
which was not even rebutted; and considering that it was Melvin Yabut, who
introduced ARLENE to JAO at the Bayside Club.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the testimony of ARLENE is not wholly reliable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the trial court said that "the
Court is further convinced of plaintiff's cause by ARLENE's manner of tes­tifying
in a most straight-forward and candid manner", the fact that ARLENE was
admittedly a movie actress may have been overlooked so that not even the trial
court could detect, by her acts, whether she was lying or not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby set aside and a new
one entered dismissing plaintiff-appellee's complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without pronouncement as to costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner now brings before this Court the issue of
admissibility and conclusiveness of the result of blood grouping tests to prove
non-paternity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, the result of blood tests, among other
evidence, to <u>affirm paternity</u> was dealt with in <u>Co Tao v. Court of
Appeals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

an action for declaration of filia­tion, support and damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said case, the NBI expert's report of the
blood tests stated that "from their blood groups and types, the defendant
Co Tao is a possible father of the child." From this statement, the
defendant contended that the child must have been the child of another
man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court noted:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"For obvious reasons, the NBI expert
cannot give assurance that the appellant was the father of the child; he can
only give his opinion that he is a 'possible father'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This possibility, coupled with the other
facts and circumstances brought out during the trial, tends to defi­nitely
establish that appellant Co Tao is the father of the child Manuel."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

grouping tests <u>to disprove paternity</u>, rulings have been much more
definite in their conclusions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the
past three decades, the use of blood typing in cases of disputed parent­age has
already become an important legal procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is now almost universal scientific agreement that blood group­ing
tests are conclusive as to non-paternity, although inconclusive as to paternity
- that is, the fact that the blood type of the child is a possible product of
the mother and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">alleged father does not
conclusively prove that the child is born by such parents; but, if the blood
type of the child is not the possible blood type when the blood of the mother
and that of the alleged father are crossmatched, then the child <u>cannot</u>
possibly be that of the alleged father.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

UNIF. Uniform Act on Blood Tests to Determine Paternity 9 U.L.A. '55 P.P. 12

If the court finds that the conclusions of all the experts, as disclosed by the
evidenced based upon the tests, are that the alleged father is not the father
of the child, the question of paternity shall be resolved accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the experts disagree in their findings or
conclu­sions, the question shall be submitted upon all the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the experts conclude that the blood tests
show the possibility of the alleged father's paternity, admission of this
evidence is within the discretion of the court, depending upon the infre­quency
of the blood type."</p>
