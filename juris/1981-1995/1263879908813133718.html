<p class="BODY">The first question which arises refers to our jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution explicitly provides that the House of
Representatives Electoral Tribunal (HRET) and the Senate Electoral Tribunal
(SET) shall be the <u>sole</u> <u>judges</u> of all contests relating to the
election, returns, and <u>qualifications</u> of their respective members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Article VI, Section 17, Constitution)</p>

<p class="BODY">The authority conferred upon the Electoral Tribunal is full,
clear and complete.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The use of the word <u>sole</u>
emphasizes the exclusivity of the jurisdiction of these Tribunals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Lazatin</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> <u>v.</u> </span><u>HRET</u> (168 SCRA 391
[1988]) stated that under the 1987 Constitution, the jurisdiction of the
Electoral Tribunal is original and exclusive, <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"The use of the word 'sole' emphasizes the exclusive character
of the jurisdiction conferred (<span class="SpellE">Angara</span> v. Electoral
Commission, <u>supra</u> at p. 162).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
exercise of power by the Electoral Commission under the 1935 Constitution has
been described as 'intended to be as complete and unimpaired as if it had
originally remained in the legislature.' (id., at p. 175) Earlier this grant of
power to the legislature was characterized by Justice Malcolm as 'full, clear
and complete; (<span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> v. Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> and <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, 39 Phil. 886
[1919]) Under the amended 1935 Constitution, the power was unqualifiedly
reposed upon the Electoral Tribunal and it remained as full, clear and complete
as that previously granted the Legislature and the Electoral Commission, (<span class="SpellE">Lachica</span> v. Yap, 25 SCRA 140 [1968]) The same may be said
with regard to the jurisdiction of the Electoral Tribunal under the 1987
Constitution." (P. 401)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court continued further, ". . . so long as the
Constitution grants the HRET the power to be the sole judge of all contests
relating to election, returns and qualifications of members of the House of
Representatives, any final action taken by the HRET <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">on </span>a matter within its jurisdiction shall, as a rule, not be
reviewed by this Court . . . the power granted to the Electoral Tribunal is
full, clear and complete and excludes the exercise of any authority on the part
of this Court that would in any wise restrict it or curtail it or even affect
the same." (pp. 403-404)</p>

<p class="BODY">When may the Court inquire into acts of the Electoral Tribunals
under our constitutional grants of power?</p>

<p class="BODY">In the later case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Robles</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> <u>v.</u> <u>HRET</u> </span>(181 SCRA 780
[1990]) the Supreme Court stated that the judgments of the Tribunal are beyond
judicial interference save only "in the exercise of this Court's so-called
extraordinary jurisdiction, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
upon a determination that the Tribunal's decision or resolution was rendered
without or in excess of its jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion or
paraphrasing <span class="SpellE">Morrero</span>, upon a clear showing of such
arbitrary and improvident use by the Tribunal of its power as constitutes a
denial of due process of law, or upon a demonstration of a very clear
unmitigated ERROR, manifestly constituting such GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION that
there has to be a remedy for such abuse." (<span class="GramE">at</span> pp.
785-786)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the leading case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Morrero</u></span> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">v.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>B</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ocar</span></u></span></span>,
(66 Phil. 429 [1938]) the Court ruled that the power of the Electoral
Commission "is beyond judicial interference except, in any event, upon a
clear showing of such arbitrary and improvident use of power as will constitute
a denial of due process." The Court does not venture into the perilous
area of trying to' correct perceived errors of independent branches of the
Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It comes in only when it has
to vindicate a denial of due process or correct an abuse of discretion so grave
or glaring that no less than the Constitution calls for remedial action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supreme Court under the 1987 <span class="GramE">Constitution,</span>
has been given an expanded jurisdiction, so to speak, to review the decisions
of the other branches and agencies of the government to determine whether or
not they have acted within the bounds of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Article VIII, Section 1, Constitution)</p>

<p class="BODY">Yet, in the exercise thereof, the Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>merely check
whether or not the governmental branch or agency has gone beyond the
Constitutional <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">limits </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">its </span>jurisdiction, not that it erred or
has a different view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of
a showing that the HRET has committed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">grave
abuse of </span>discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction, there is no
occasion for the Court to exercise its corrective power; it will not decide <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a matter </span>which by its nature is for
the HRET alone to decide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Marcos v.
<span class="SpellE">Manglapus</span>, 177 SCRA 668 [1989]) It has no power to
look into what it thinks is apparent error.</p>

<p class="BODY">As constitutional creations invested with necessary power, the
Electoral Tribunals, although not powers in the tripartite scheme of the
government, are, in the exercise of their functions independent organs -- ­independent
of Congress and the Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
power granted to HRET by the Constitution is intended to be as complete and
unimpaired as if it had remained originally in the legislature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Angara</span> v.
Electoral Commission, 63 Phil. 139 [1936])</p>

<p class="BODY">In passing upon petitions, the Court with its traditional and
careful regard for the balance of <span class="GramE">powers,</span> must permit
this exclusive privilege of the Tribunals to remain where the Sovereign
authority has placed it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span> v. Boards of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, 39 Phil. 886 [1919])</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been argued that under Article VI, Section 17 of the
present Constitution, the situation may exist as it exists today where there is
an unhealthy one?sided political composition of the two Electoral
Tribunals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the <span class="GramE">Constitution,</span> however, that makes the HRET because of its
composition any less independent from the Court or its constitutional functions
any less exclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The degree of
judicial intervention should not be made to depend on how many legislative
members of the HRET belong to this party or that party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The test remains the same - manifest grave
abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the Court finds no improvident use of power,
no denial of due process on the part of the HRET which will necessitate the
exercise of the power of judicial review by the Supreme Court.</p>

in 1905.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was brought by <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>
in the year 1915.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan spent his childhood in

easy assimilation into the community.</p>

<p class="BODY">As Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan grew older in the

<p class="BODY">The couple bore eight children, one of whom is the private

<p class="BODY">The private respondent's father never emigrated from this
country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He decided to put up a hardware

respondent, unsure of his legal status and in an unequivocal affirmation of
where he cast his life and family, filed with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> an application for naturalization on <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1954">February 15, 1954</st1:date>.</p>

elementary education in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the records to

<p class="BODY">Fortunes changed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
house of the family of the private respondent in <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> was burned to the
ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">Undaunted by the catastrophe, the private respondent’s family
constructed another one in place of their ruined house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, there is no showing other than that <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span> was their abode and home.</p>

<p class="BODY">After completing his elementary education, the private
respondent, in search for better education, went to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in order to acquire his secondary and college education.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, another misfortune was suffered by the family in
1975 when a fire gutted their second house in <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent's family constructed still
another house, this time a 16-door apartment building, two doors of which were
reserved for the family.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent graduated from college, and thereafter
took and passed the CPA Board Examinations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since employment opportunities were better in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the respondent looked for work here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
found a job in the Central Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as an examiner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, however, he
worked in the hardware business of his family in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1971, his elder brother, Emil, was elected
as a delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His status as a natural born citizen was
challenged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically, the
Convention which in drafting the Constitution removed the unequal treatment
given to derived citizenship on the basis of the mother's citizenship formally
and solemnly declared Emil <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>, respondent's full

<p class="BODY">The private respondent after being engaged for several years in

<p class="BODY">The provision in question was enacted to correct the anomalous
situation where one born of a Filipino father and an alien mother was
automatically granted the status of a natural-born citizen while one born of a
Filipino mother and an alien father would still have to elect Philippine
citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If one so elected, he was
not, under earlier laws, conferred the status of a natural-born.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the 1973 Constitution, those born of Filipino fathers and
those born of Filipino mothers with an alien father were placed on equal
footing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were both considered as
natural-born citizens.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the bestowment of the status of "natural-born"
cannot be made to depend on the fleeting accident of time or result in two
kinds of citizens made up of essentially the same similarly situated members.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is for this reason that the amendments were enacted, that is,
in order to remedy this accidental anomaly, and, therefore, treat equally all
those born <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">before the 1973 Constitution

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the respondent's mother was a natural

</span>Crucial to this case is the issue of whether or not the respondent
elected or chose to be a Filipino citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Election becomes material because Section 2 of Article IV of the
Constitution accords natural born status to children born of Filipino mothers
before January 17, 1973, if they <u>elect</u> citizenship upon reaching the age
of majority.</p>

<p class="BODY">To expect the respondent to have formally or in writing elected
citizenship when he came of age is to ask for the unnatural and
unnecessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason is obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was already a citizen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only was his mother a natural born
citizen but his father had been naturalized when the respondent was only nine

when he came of age that in 1973 and 1987 the Constitution would be amended to

1957.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1969, election through a sworn

a Filipino and has always considered himself a Filipino citizen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the records to show that

of his acts since childhood, they have considered him as a Filipino.</p>

requirement for those who still have to elect citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>For</u> <u>those</u> <u>already</u> <u>Filipinos</u>

is a qualification, voting during election time, running for public office, and
other categorical acts of similar nature are themselves formal manifestations

<p class="BODY">An election of Philippine citizenship presupposes that the person
electing is an alien.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or his status is
doubtful because he is a national of two countries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt in this case about Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span> being a Filipino when he turned twenty-one (21).</p>

of the private respondent would not only have been superfluous but it would
also have resulted in an absurdity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How

<p class="BODY">The respondent HRET has an interesting view as to how Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> elected citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It observed that "when <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> was only

authority in the exercise of its powers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the respondent traces his natural born citizenship through his

only to determine whether or not the respondent "chose" to be a
Filipino when he came of age.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that

which he could possibly have chosen.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another reason why we cannot declare the HRET as having

<p class="BODY">The domicile that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te established in
1895 continued until April 11, 1899; it even went beyond the turn of the 19th
century.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also in this place where <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te set-up his business and acquired his real property.</p>

<p class="BODY">As concluded by the Constitutional Convention, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te falls within the meaning of sub-paragraph 4 of
Article 17 of the Civil Code of Spain.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te made brief visits to
China, he, nevertheless, always returned to the Philippines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he died in China, during one of
his visits in said country, was of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This will not change the fact that he already had his domicile fixed in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

<p class="BODY">If <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te became a Spanish subject by
virtue of having established his domicile in a town under the Monarchy of
Spain, necessarily, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te was also an inhabitant of
the Philippines for an inhabitant has been defined as one who has actual fixed
residence in a place; one who has a domicile in a place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Bouvier's</span> Law
Dictionary, Vol. II) A priori, there can be no other logical conclusion but to
educe that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te qualified as a Filipino citizen
under the provisions of section 4 of the Philippine Bill of 1902.</p>

<p class="BODY">The HRET itself found this fact of absolute verity in concluding
that the private respondent was a natural-born Filipino.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' sole ground in disputing this fact is that the
documents presented to prove it were not in compliance with the best evidence
rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners allege that the
private respondent failed to present the original of the documentary evidence,
testimonial evidence and of the transcript of the proceedings of the body upon
which the aforesaid resolution of the 1971 Constitutional Convention was predicated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On the contrary, the documents presented by the
private respondent fall under the exceptions to the best evidence rule.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was established in the proceedings before the HRET that the
originals of the Committee Report No. 12, the minutes of the plenary session of
1971 Constitutional Convention held on November 28, 1972 cannot be found.</p>

<p class="BODY">This was affirmed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ricafrente</span>,
Assistant Secretary of the 1971 Constitutional Convention; by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nolledo</span>, Delegate to the 1971 Constitutional Convention; and
by Atty. Antonio Santos, Chief Librarian of the U. P. Law Center, in their

governmental agency which is the official custodian of the records of the 1971
Constitutional Convention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN,

<p class="BODY">The execution of the originals was established by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ricafrente</span>, who as the Assistant Secretary of the 1971
Constitutional Convention was the proper party to testify to such
execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, December 12, 1989, pp.
11-24)</p>

<p class="BODY">The inability to produce the originals before the HRET was also
testified to as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ricafrente</span>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nolledo</span>, and
Atty. Santos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In proving the inability
to produce, the law does not require the degree of proof to be of sufficient
certainty; it is enough that it be shown that after a bona fide diligent
search, the same cannot be found.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">see</span> Government of P. <st1:place>I.</st1:place> v. <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>,

<p class="BODY">Since the execution of the document and the inability to produce
were adequately established, the contents of the questioned documents can be
proven by a copy thereof or by the recollection of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, to erase all doubts as to the authenticity of the
documentary evidence cited in the Committee Report, the former member of the
1971 Constitutional Convention, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nolledo</span>, when
he was presented as a witness in the hearing of the protest against the private
respondent, categorically stated that he saw the disputed documents presented
during the hearing of the election protest against the brother of the private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, February 1, 1989, pp.
8­-9)</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners question the residence qualification of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners lose sight of the meaning of
"residence" under the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The term "residence" has been understood as synonymous with <u>domicile</u>
not only under the previous Constitutions but also under the 1987 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The deliberations of the Constitutional Commission reveal that
the meaning of residence <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the qualifications
of a candidate for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Congress </span>continues
to remain the same as that of domicile, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. <span class="SpellE">Nolledo</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to Section 5, I remember that in
the 1971 Constitutional Convention, there was an attempt to require residence
in the place not less than one year immediately preceding the day of the
elections.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So my question is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is the Committee's concept of residence
of a candidate for the legislature?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is
it actual residence or is it the concept of domicile or constructive residence?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Davide</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Madame President, insofar as the regular members
of the National Assembly are concerned, the proposed section merely provides,
among others, 'and a resident thereof', that is, in the district, for a period
of not less than one year preceding the day of the election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was in effect lifted from the 1973 <span class="GramE">Constitution,</span> the interpretation given to it was
domicile." (Records of the 1987 Constitutional Convention, Vol. II, July

has raised the same point that 'resident' has been interpreted at times as a
matter of intention rather than actual residence.</blockquote>

reside?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mr. <st1:place>Delos</st1:place> Reyes:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But we might encounter some difficulty
especially considering that a provision in the Constitution in the Article on
Suffrage says that Filipinos living abroad may vote as enacted by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, we have to stick to the original concept
that it should be by domicile and not physical and actual residence."

<p class="BODY">The framers of the Constitution adhered to the earlier definition
given to the word "residence" which regarded it as having the same
meaning as domicile.</p>

<p class="BODY">The term "domicile" denotes a fixed permanent residence
to which when absent for business or pleasure, one intends to return.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Huan</span> Tin v. Republic, 19 SCRA 966 [1967]) The absence of a

sufficiently established that after the fire that gutted their house in 1961,
another one was constructed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' allegation that since the private respondent
owns no property in <span class="SpellE">Laoang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
he cannot, therefore, be a resident of said place is misplaced.</p>

<p class="BODY">The properties owned by the <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> family

country.</p>

<p class="BODY">Many great Filipinos have not been whole-blooded nationals, if

</span>To mention a few, the great Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> was

we do not, on the basis of too harsh an interpretation, have to unreasonably
deny it to those who qualify to share in its richness.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the overly strict jurisprudence surrounding our antiquated
naturalization laws only the very affluent backed by influential patrons, who
were willing to suffer the indignities of a lengthy, sometimes humiliating, and
often corrupt process of clearances by minor bureaucrats and whose lawyers knew
how to overcome so many technical traps of the judicial process were able to
acquire citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is time for the
naturalization law to be revised to enable a more positive, affirmative, and

this does not alter the fact that private respondent was not born to a Filipino
father, and the operation of Section 15 of CA 473 did not confer upon him the

perform any act to acquire or perfect his status <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

private respondent could be considered a natural-born citizen by virtue of the

therefore, private respondent is not even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a

naturalization must emanate from the Government and must be made in a
proper/appropriate and direct proceeding for de-naturalization directed against
the proper party, who in such case is <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan, and
also during his lifetime.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Naturalization is not a right, but a privilege of the most

<p class="BODY">Considering the legal implications of the allegation made by the

should make a ruling on the validity of said naturalization proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This course of action becomes all the more

<p class="BODY">It cannot be overlooked, in this connection, that the citizenship
of private respondent is derived from his father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If his father's Filipino citizenship is void from
the beginning, then there is nothing from which private respondent can derive
his own claimed Filipino citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For a spring cannot rise higher than its source.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And to allow private respondent to avail of
the privileges of Filipino citizenship by virtue of a void naturalization of
his father, would constitute or at least sanction a continuing offense against
the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that private respondent's father, Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan, took the oath of allegiance to the Constitution
and the Philippine Government, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>prescribed
by Section 12 of CA 473 on the same day (15 May 1957) that the CFI issued its

<p class="BODY">However, it is settled that an order granting a petition to take

<p class="BODY">It would appear from the foregoing discussion that the
naturalization of Jose <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan (private
respondent's father) was null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that the private respondent did not acquire any legal rights

considered a Filipino citizen, more so, a natural-born Filipino citizen.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

clerk of court to issue the certificate of naturalization to <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan and for the latter to take the oath of allegiance
was final and not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>, the resulting
naturalization of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan effected, as previously
stated, an automatic naturalization of private respondent, then a minor, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>Filipino citizen on 15 May 1957, but
not his acquisition or perfection of the status of a natural-born Filipino
citizen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us now look into the question of whether or not private
respondent acquired the status of a natural-born Filipino citizen by reason of
the undisputed fact that his mother was a natural-born Filipino citizen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This in turn leads us to an examination of
the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">second</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>sentence</u> </span>in Article IV,
Section 2 of the 1987 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
expands, in a manner of speaking, in relation to Section 1, paragraph (3) of
the same Article IV, the status of a natural-born Fili­pino citizen to those
who elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right or privilege of election is

Constitution, and before the 1973 Constitution took effect on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">17 January 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners contend that the respondent tribunal acted in
excess of its jurisdiction or gravely abused its discretion as to exceed its
jurisdiction in "distorting" the conferment by the 1987 Constitution
of the status of "natural-born" Filipino citizen on those who elect
Philip­pine citizenship - all in its strained effort, according to petitioners,
to support private respondent's qualification to be a Member of the House of
Representatives.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

January 1973 and who would reach the age of majority (and thus elect Philippine
citizenship) after the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the 1987

<p class="BODY">I agree with respondent tribunal that the debates,
interpellations and opinions expressed in the 1986 Constitutional Commission
may be resorted to in ascertaining the meaning of somewhat elusive and even

constitutional construction is to ascertain and thereafter assure the
realization of the purpose of the framers and of the people in the adoption of
the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may also be safely

<p class="BODY">The deliberations of the 1986 Constitutional Commission relevant

natural-born Filipino citizen as provided in Section 4 of the 1973
Constitution, by adding that persons who have elected Philippine citizenship
under the 1935 Constitution shall be considered natural-born.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Am I right, Mr. Presiding Officer?</blockquote>

are quite aware that it is contrary to the letter really.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But whether it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">contrary </span>to the spirit is something that has been debated before
and is being debated even now.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We will
recall that during the 1971 Constitutional Convention, the status of
natural-born citizenship of one of the delegates, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>,
was challenged precisely because he was a citizen by election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the 1971 Constitutional Convention
considered him a natural-born citizen, one of the requirements to be a Member
of the 1971 Constitutional Convention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The reason behind that decision was that a person under his
circumstances already had the inchoate right to be a citizen by the fact that
the mother was a Filipino.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And as a
matter of fact, the 1971 Constitutional Convention formalized that recognition
by adopting paragraph 2 of Section 1 of the 1971 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, the entire purpose of this proviso is
simply to perhaps remedy whatever injustice there may be so that these people
born before January 17, 1973 who are not naturalized and people who are not
natural born but who are in the same situation as we are considered
natural-born citizens.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, the intention

purpose of that proviso is to remedy an inequitable situation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Between 1935 and 1973, when we were under the

natural-born Filipinos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, those
born of Filipino mothers but alien fathers would have to elect Philippine
citizenship upon reaching the age of majority; and, if they do elect, they
become Filipino citizens, yet, but not natural-born Filipino citizens.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The 1973 Constitution equalized the status of those born of
Filipino mothers and those born of Filipino fathers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So that from January 17, 1973 when the 1973
Constitution took effect, those born of Filipino mothers but of alien fathers
are natural-born Filipino citizens.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also, those who are born of Filipino fathers and alien mothers are
natural-born Filipino citizens.</blockquote>

and to foster equality among them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since private respondent was born on 19 June 1948 (or before 17
January 1973) to a Filipino mother (with an alien spouse) and should have
elected Philippine citizenship on 19 June 1969 (when he attained the age of
majority), or soon thereafter, in order to have the status of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>natural-born Filipino citizen under
the 1987 Constitution, the vital question is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>did private respondent really elect Philippine citizenship?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, I believe that private
respondent did not elect Philippine citizenship, contrary to the ruling of the
respondent tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent tribunal, on this issue, ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Where a person born to a Filipino mother and an alien father
had exercised the right of suf­frage when he came of age, the same constitutes
a positive act of election of Philippine citizen­ship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>) [<span class="GramE">sic</span>] The acts of the
petitioner in registering as a voter, participating in elections and
campaigning for certain candidates were held by the Supreme Court as sufficient
to show his preference for Philippine citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, even without complying with the
formal requisites for election, the petitioner's Filipino citizenship was
judicially upheld."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I find the above ruling of the respondent tribunal to be patently
erroneous and clearly untenable, as to amount to grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For it is settled doctrine
in this jurisdiction that election of Philippine citizenship must be made in
accordance with Commonwealth Act 625.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sections 1 and 2<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Act mandate that the option to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">elect
Philippine citizenship must be effected expressly, not impliedly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

which held that Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mallare's</span> exercise of the

of Philippine citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Mallare</u></span>, cited by respondent
tribunal as authority for the doctrine of implied election of Philippine
citizenship, is not applicable to the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent tribunal failed to consider
that Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span> reached the age of majority <u>in</u>
<u>1924</u>, or seventeen (17) years before <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">CA </span>625 was approved and, more importantly, eleven (11) years

<p class="BODY">To quote Mr. Justice Fernandez in <span class="SpellE"><u>Mallare</u></span>:<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"Indeed, it would be unfair to expect the presentation of a

party by Section 1, subsection 4, Article IV of the 1935 Philippine
Constitution."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Moreover, Esteban <span class="SpellE">Mallare</span>
was held to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>Filipino

in an <u>obiter</u> <u>dictum</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent tribunal also erred in ruling that by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">operation of CA 473, </span>the Revised
Naturalization Law, providing for private respondent's acquisition of Filipino
citizenship by reason of the naturalization of his father, the law itself had
already elected Philippine citizenship for him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For, assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the
naturalization of private respondent's father was valid, and that there was no
further need for private respondent to elect Philippine citizenship <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

not mean that the operation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
Revised </span>Naturalization Law amounted to an election by him of Philippine
citizenship as contemplated by the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, election of Philippine citizenship
derived from one's Filipino mother, is made upon reaching the age of majority,
not during one's minority.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt in my mind, therefore, that private respondent
did not elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>1969 or within a reasonable time
thereafter as required by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">CA 625.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently, he cannot be deemed a
natural-born Filipino citizen under Sections 2 and 1(3), Article IV of the 1987
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on all the foregoing considerations and premises, I am
constrained to state that private respondent is not a natural-born citizen of
the Philippines in contemplation of Section 6, Article VI of the 1987
Constitution in relation to Sections 2 and 1(3), Article IV thereof, and hence
is disqualified or ineligible to be a Member of the House of Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, I find it no longer necessary to rule on the issue
of required residence, inasmuch as the Consti­tution requires that a Member of

<p class="BODY">The general rule is that the fact that a plurality or a majority

<blockquote>"Sound policy dictates that public elective offices are filled
by those who have the highest number of votes cast in the election for that
office, and it is a fundamental idea in all republican forms of government that

<p class="BODY">The 1971 Constitutional Convention in holding that Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> was a "natural-born citizen" of the

and this appears crucial and central to its decision - that Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span> grandfather, <span class="SpellE"><u>Ong</u></span> <u>Te</u>,
became a Filipino citizen under the Philippine Bill of 1902 and, therefore, his

<p class="BODY">The "test" then, following the premises of the 1971

was "an inhabitant of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>

contrary to private respondent's pretense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the face of these proofs or evidence, private respondent FAILED TO
PRESENT ANY REBUTTAL OR COUNTERVAILING EVIDENCE, except the decision of the
1971 Constitutional Convention in the case of Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>,
previously discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not surprising then that, as previously noted, the majority
decision of the House Electoral Tribunal skirted any reliance on the alleged <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ipso</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <u>facto</u></span> Filipino citizenship of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Te under the Philippine Bill of 1902.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is equally not surprising that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan, the son of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te and father of private respondent, did not even attempt
to claim Filipino citizenship by reason of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te's
alleged Filipino citizenship under the Philippine Bill of 1902 but instead
applied for Philippine citizenship through naturalization.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can it be contended by the private respondent that the House
Electoral Tribunal should no longer have reviewed the factual question or issue
of <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te's citizenship in the light of the
resolution of the 1971 Constitutional Conven­tion finding him (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Te) to have become a Filipino citizen under the
Philippine Bill of 1902.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tribunal
had to look into the question because the finding that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
Te had become a Filipino citizen under the Philippine Bill of 1902 was the
central core of said 1971 resolution but as held in <u>Lee vs. Commissioners of
Immigration</u>:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

contended by private respondent that the resolution of the 1971 Constitutional
Convention in the Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> case was elevated to
this Court on a question involving Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong's</span>
disqualification to run for membership in the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> and that, according to private respondent,
this Court allowed the use of the Committee Report to the 1971 Constitutional
Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY">To fully appreciate the implications of such contention, it would
help to look into the circumstances of the case brought before this Court in
relation to the Court's action or disposition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>

filed a petition for disqualification with the Commission on Election on <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="3">29 March 1984</st1:date> docketed as SPC No.
84-69 contending that <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> is not a natural-born
citizen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>motion to dismiss the
petition on the ground that the judgment of the 1971 Constitutional Convention
on his status as a natural-born citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
bars the petitioner from raising the identical issue before the COMELEC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(G.R. No. 67201, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. </span>94) The motion was denied by
the COMELEC, thus, prompting Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> to file with
this Court a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>
with preliminary injunction against the COMELEC, docketed as G.R. No. 67201.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated 8 May 1984, this Court resolved to issue a
writ of preliminary injunction enjoining respondent COMELEC from holding any
further hearing on the disqualification case entitled "<span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>

dismiss the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(G.R. Nos. 92202-03, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">. </span>335)</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>explaining
its action, held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Acting on the prayer of the petitioner for the issuance of a
Writ of Preliminary Injunction, and considering that at the hearing this
morning, it was brought out that the 1971 Constitutional Convention, at its
session of November 28, 1972, after considering the Report of its Committee on
Election Protests and Credentials, found that the protest questioning the
citizenship of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> (the petitioner herein)
was groundless and dismissed Election Protests Nos. EP 07 and EP 08 filed
against said petitioner (p. 237, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), the
authenticity of the Minutes of said session as well as of the said Committee's
Report having been duly admitted in evidence without objection and bears out, <u>for</u>
<u>now</u>, without need for a full hear­ing, that petitioner is a natural-born
citizen, the Court Resolved to ISSUE, effective immediately, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>Writ of Preliminary Injunction
enjoining respondent COMELEC from holding any further <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">hearing on the disqualification case entitled <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
Del Valle vs. Emil <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> (SPC No. 84-69) scheduled at
3:00 o'clock this afternoon, or any other day, except to dismiss the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>This is without prejudice to any
appropriate action that private respondent may wish to take after the elections</u>."
(<span class="GramE">underscoring</span> supplied)</span><span style="font-size:
12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the resolution of this Court in G.R. No.
67201 was rendered without the benefit of a hearing on the merits either by the
Court or by the COMELEC and merely on the basis of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a </span>Committee's Report to the 1971 Constitutional Convention, and
that this Court (and this is quite significant) did not foreclose any
appropriate action that Del Valle (therein petitioner) may wish to take after
the elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus abundantly clear also that to this Court, the
resolution of the 1971 Constitutional Convention recognizing Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> as a natural-born citizen under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">the 1935 </span>Constitution did not foreclose a future or further
proceeding in regard to the same question and that, conse­quently, there is no <u>vested</u>
<u>right</u> of Emil L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> to such recognition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">How much more when the
Constitution involved is not the 1935 Constitution but the 1987 Constitution
whose provisions were never considered in all such proceedings because the 1987
Constitution was still inexistent.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">A final word.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is regrettable that one (as private
respondent) who unquestionably obtained the highest number of votes for the
elective position of Representative (Cong­ressman) to the House of
Representatives for the second district of Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>,
would have had to cease in office by virtue of this Court's decision, <u>if</u>
<u>the</u> <u>full</u> <u>membership</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Court</u> <u>had</u>
<u>participated</u> <u>in</u> <u>this</u> <u>case</u>, with the result that the
legislative district would cease to have, in the interim, a representative in
the House of Representatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the
fundamental consideration in cases of this nature is the Constitution and only
the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has to be assumed,
therefore, that when the electorate in the second legislative district of
Northern <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> cast the majority of their votes for
private respondent, <u>they assumed and believed that he was fully eligible and
qualified for the office because he is a natural-born Filipino citizen</u>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>That erroneous assumption and belief can not
prevail over, but must yield to the majesty of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a sad day for the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As I see it, the Constitution mandates that
members of the House of Representatives should be "<u>natural</u>-<u>born</u>
citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The voting majority of the present Court
says, "Filipino citizens will do." This is bad enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is worse is, the same voting majority,
in effect, says, "<span class="GramE">even</span> aliens will do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>well."</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE,</b> my vote is
clear:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>to declare private respondent
Jose L. <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Chuan, Jr., as he clearly is, NOT a
natural-born citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and </span>therefore NOT QUALIFIED to

<p class="BODY">I wish to point out first that the question of citizenship is a
question of fact, and as a rule, the Supreme Court leaves facts to the tribunal
that determined them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I am quite agreed that
the Electoral Tribunal of the House of Representatives, as the "sole
judge" of all contests relating to the membership in the House, as
follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">Sec. 17.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Senate and the
House of Representatives shall each have an Electoral Tribunal which shall be
the sole judge of all contests relating to the election, returns, and
qualifications of their respective Members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Each Electoral Tribunal shall be composed of nine Members, three of whom
shall be Justices of the Supreme Court to be designated by the Chief Justice,
and the remaining six shall be Members of the Senate or the House of
Representatives, as the case may be, who shall be chosen on the basis of
proportional representation from the political parties and the parties or
organizations registered under the party-list system represented therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The senior Justice in the Electoral Tribunal
shall be its Chairman.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">is the best judge of facts and this Court
can not substitute its judgment because it thinks it knows better.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <b>Aratuc v. Commission on Elections,</b><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that this Court can not review the errors of the Commission on
Elections (then the "sole judge" of all election contests) -- in the
sense of reviewing facts and unearthing mistakes--and that this Court's
jurisdiction is to see simply whether or not it is guilty of a grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is true that the new
Constitution has conferred expanded powers on the Court,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
but as the Charter states, our authority is "to determine whether or not
there has been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">excess </span>of jurisdiction on the part of
any branch or instrumentality of the Government."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

It is not to review facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Grave abuse of discretion" has been defined as whimsical
exercise of power amounting to excess of jurisdiction, or otherwise, to denial
of due process of law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I find none of that here.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the majority indicates, Jose Ong's citizenship is a matter of
opinion with which men may differ, but certainly, it is quite another thing to
say that the respondent Tribunal has gravely abused its discretion because the
majority has begged to differ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does
not form part of the duty of the Court to remedy all imagined wrongs committed
by the Government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Tribunal has spoken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the Tribunal, Jose Ong is a
Filipino citizen and consequently, is possessed of the qualifications to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>member of the House.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the sole judge, precisely, of this
question, the Court can not be more popish than the pope.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">(2)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I can not say, in the second place, that the Decision in question
stands exactly on indefensible grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be noted that Jose Ong had relied on the Report dated <st1:date year="1972" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1972</st1:date> of the 1971
Constitutional Convention Committee on Election Protests and Credentials, in
which the Committee<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
upheld the citizenship, and sustained the qualification to sit as Delegate, of
Emil Ong, Jose Ong's full blood brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to the Report, Ong Te, the Ong’s grandfather, was already <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>Filipino citizen having complied
with the requirements on Filipinization by existing laws for which his
successors need not have elected Filipino citizenship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I quote:</p>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">There is merit in protestee's claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There can hardly be any doubt that Ong Te,
protestees's grandfather, was a Spanish subject residing in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on <st1:date year="1899" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1899</st1:date>, and was
therefore one of the many who became ipso facto citizens of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under the provisions of the Philippine Bill of 1902.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said law expressly declared that all
inhabitants of the Philippine Islands who continued to reside therein and who
were Spanish subjects on <st1:date year="1899" day="11" month="4">April 11,
 1899</st1:date>, as well as their children born subsequent thereto,
"shall be deemed and held to be citizens of the Philippine Islands"
(Sec. 4, Philippine Bill of 1902).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Excepted from the operation of this rule were Spanish subjects who shall
have elected to preserve their allegiance to the Crown of Spain in accordance
with the Treaty of Paris of <st1:date year="1898" day="10" month="12">December
 10, 1898</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But under the
Treaty of Paris, only Spanish subjects who were natives of Peninsular Spain had
the privilege of preserving their Spanish nationality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="2Q">As earlier noted, protestee's grandfather established residence in
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in 1895, as shown by the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Registro
Central de Chinos.</b><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also
issued a certificate of registra­tion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He established a business here, and later acquired real property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although he went back to <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for brief visits, he invariably came back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He even brought his eldest son, Ong Chuan, to live in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
when the latter was only 10 years old.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And Ong Chuan was admitted into the country because, as duly noted on
his landing certificate, his father, Ong Te, had been duly enrolled under CR
16009-36755 -- i.e., as a permanent resident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, even when Ong Te went back to China in the 1920's for another
visit, he left his son, Ong Chuan, who was then still a minor, in the
Philippines -? obviously because he had long considered the Philippines
his home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The domicile he established in
1895 is presumed to have continued up to, and beyond, <st1:date year="1899" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1899</st1:date>, for, as already adverted to, a
domicile once acquired is not lost until a new one is gained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only conclusion then can thus be drawn is
that Ong Te <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>duly domiciled
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
as of <st1:date year="1899" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1899</st1:date>,
within the meaning of par. 4, Art. 17, of the Civil Code of 1889 -- and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was, </span>consequently, a Spanish subject,
he qualified as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>Filipino
citizen under the provisions of Section 4 of the Philippine Bill of 1902.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Ong Chuan, the Ong brothers’ father, subsequently
sought naturalization in the belief that he was, all along, a Chinese citizen,
but as the Report held:</p>

<p class="2Q">Protestants, however, make capital of the fact that both Ong Te and
his son, Ong Chuan (protestee's father), appear to have been registered as Chinese
citizens even long after the turn of the century.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Worse, Ong Chuan himself believed the was
alien, to the extent of having to seek admission as a Pilipino citizen through
naturalization proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The point,
to our mind, is neither crucial nor substantial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ong's status as a citizen is a matter of law,
rather than of personal belief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
what the law provides, and not what one thinks his status to be, which
determines whether one is a citizen of a particular state or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere mistake or misapprehension as to one's
citizenship, it has been held, is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a
</span>sufficient cause or reason for forfeiture of Philippine citizenship; it
does not even constitute estoppel (Palanca vs Republic, 80 Phil. 578,
584).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Too, estoppel applies only to
questions of fact and not of law (Tañada v. Cuenco, L-10520, Feb. 28, 1957).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the Report was unanimously approved by the
Committee, and on <st1:date year="1972" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1972</st1:date>,
approved without any objection by the Convention in plenary session.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I am not, of course, to be mistaken as acting as mouthpiece of
Emil Ong, but in all candor, I speak from experience, because when the
Convention approved the Report in question, I was one of its vice-presidents
and the presiding officer.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted finally, that the matter was elevated to this
Court (on a question involving Emil Ong's qualification to sit as member of the
defunct Batasang Pambansa)<sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt;color:red">11</span></sup> in which this Court allowed the use of the
Committee Report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Faced with such positive acts of the Government, I submit that
the question of the Ongs' citizenship is a settled matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let it rest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that Electoral Protest Nos. EP-07 and EP-08 of the
Convention as well as G.R. No. 67201 of this Court, involved Emil Ong and not
his brother; I submit, however, that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the
gander.</p>

<p class="BODY">I also submit that the fundamental question is whether or not we
will overturn the unanimous ruling of 267 delegates, indeed, also of this
Court.</p>
