This is a murder case. In the early morning of October 9, 1981, the dead
 body of Manuel Pascual, 34, a tricycle driver, was found by the police 
near the bridge or creek east of the Mariano Marcos State University 
Compound (Normal School) in Laoag  City (Exh. M). It had thirteen 
incised and stab wounds (Exh. A). The victim was killed the night before
 (Exh. P).
<p>
His tricycle was found on the shoulder of the road south of the Barit 
Elementary School of the city (Exh. F-1). A bolo was found a few meters 
from the tricycle in the field planted to <em>kangkong</em> (Exh. E).
</p><p>
About two weeks later, or on October 23, 1981, five suspects, Fidel 
Mateo, 20, Elmer Dajugar, 18, Rene Ambrocio, 15, Florante Martinez, 15, 
and Edwin Aglugob, 15, were arrested. Their confessions were taken 
(Exhs. H to L).
</p><p>
According to their extrajudicial confessions, the five accused boarded 
the tricycle of Pascual at about five o'clock in the afternoon of 
October 8, 1981 at the bus terminal. They went to Juman's Eatery at 
Pasiocan, Bacarra, Ilocos Norte. They invited Pascual to drink gin with 
them. They got drunk.
</p><p>
They returned to the city with Pascual driving his tricycle. Mateo 
allegedly concocted the idea of killing Pascual because the latter had 
boxed him sometime in July, 1981. They stopped the tricycle in Barangay 
Barit on the street leading to the city mayor's residence.
</p><p>
Dajugar boxed Pascual while Martinez stabbed him. To avoid further 
assault, Pascual ran and shouted for help. They caught up with him and 
stabbed him until he fell on the concrete road. Dajugar and Martinez 
loaded him in his tricycle and dumped his body east of the Don Mariano 
Marcos State University (Exh. H to L-4 and M).
</p><p>
The trial court said that what precipitated the assault was the refusal 
of Pascual to enter the road leading to the city mayor's residence. He 
feared that they would harm him. As Pascual was good in karate and was 
armed and as he was reminded that he had previously boxed Mateo, Pascual
 attacked the accused. They retaliated by killing him.
</p><p>
Aside from the confessions, the prosecution offered the eyewitness 
testimony of Froilan Ramirez, 16. He testified that he knows accused 
Mateo. He knows also Aglugob who was his classmate in the elementary 
grades. At around nine o'clock in the evening of October 8, 1981, while 
he was in front of his parents' house at Barrio Pandan, Laoag City, near
 the highway leading to Bacarra, Ilocos Norte, he saw Pascual running, 
pursued by Mateo, Aglugob and a third person. The scene was illuminated 
by a light from the office of the National Power Corporation (See sketch
 prepared by Ramirez, Exh. N, p. 119, Record).
</p><p>
A tricycle with a driver and a passenger was following them. He did not 
recognize the driver and passenger of the tricycle. The three pursuers 
were able to overtake Pascual. They repeatedly stabbed and hacked him. 
Then, they loaded him in the tricycle. The sidecar number of the 
tricycle was 640.
</p><p>
The five accused were charged on November 12, 1981 with murder <em>qualified by treachery and evident premeditation</em> and with "the <em>generic aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength</em> (and) nighttime and the alternative aggravating circumstance of drunkenness" (p. 1, Record).
</p><p>
After the prosecution had rested its case and the defense had presented 
the testimonies of Mateo and Dajugar about their alibis, or at the 
hearing on July 20, 1983, the three accused, Ambrocio, Aglugob and 
Martinez, all fifteen-year olds at the time of the commission of the 
crime, changed their <em>plea of not guilty to guilty</em>.
</p><p>
They were rearraigned. The trial judge interrogated them. In answer to 
the judge's questions, Aglugob answered that he was one of the killers 
of Pascual, that the killing was the offshoot of his drunkenness and 
that he felt in his conscience that he was guilty (184 tsn).
</p><p>
Ambrocio admitted that he was one of the killers of Pascual and he 
informed his parents of that fact. He was ready to suffer the 
consequences of his act (184-5, tsn).
</p><p>
But Martinez changed his mind. He told the court that he had no 
participation in the killing of Pascual. So, although he had changed his
 plea to guilty, this was withdrawn and his former plea of not guilty 
was restored (186 tsn).
</p><p>
On the same day, July 20, 1983, the trial court rendered a decision 
finding Ambrocio and Aglugob guilty but suspended sentence on the two 
and committed them to the custody of the Laoag City branch of the 
Ministry of Social Services and Development.
</p><p>
Trial was continued as to Mateo, Dajugar and Martinez. In its decision 
of July 29, 1983, the trial court found them guilty of murder, sentenced
 Mateo and Dajugar to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and ordered the three 
accused to pay solidarily an indemnity of P43,496 to the heirs of the 
victim, Manuel Pascual (Criminal Case No. 1751).
</p><p>
Mateo did not appeal. Martinez was also committed to the Laoag City branch of the Ministry of Social Services and Development. <em>Only Dajugar appealed</em>.
</p><p>
Dajugar contends in this appeal that the trial court erred in admitting 
his confession, considering that he was maltreated and that he was not 
informed by the investigator that if he could not get a lawyer he would 
be provided with one to assist him. The Solicitor General recommends 
Dajugar's acquittal on that ground (People vs. Pascual, G. R. No. 53403,
 November 12, 1981, 109 SCRA 197, 205). Without his confession, there is
 allegedly no evidence as to his complicity in the killing.
</p><p>
Article IV of the Constitution provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "SEC. 20. - No person shall be compelled to be a witness against 
himself. Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense
 shall have the right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be 
informed of such right. No force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any
 other means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him. Any
 confession obtained in violation of this section shall be admissible in
 evidence."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Section 20 on its face requires that the accused under custody should be
 advised that he has the right to remain silent and the right to be 
assisted by counsel. It should be noted that article 125 of the Revised 
Penal Code, as amended, provides that "in every case, the person 
detained shall be informed of the cause of his detention and shall be 
allowed, upon his request, to communicate and confer at any time with 
his attorney or counsel." (See sec. 11, Rule 112, Rules of Court.)
</p><p>
However, in Miranda vs. Arizona, 384 U. S. 436, 16 L. ed. 694 (a 
five-to-four decision, said to be an "earthquake in the world of law 
enforcement" and a "handcuff on the police"), it was held that "in order
 fully to apprise a person interrogated of the extent of his rights 
under this system then, it is necessary to warn him not only that he has
 the right to consult with an attorney, but also that <em>if he is indigent a lawyer will be appointed to represent him</em>." (p. 723, Syllabus No. 33.)
</p><p>
In this case, in the confession of appellant Dajugar, he was merely 
informed of his right "to remain silent and to hire a lawyer to assist" 
him. (Preliminary Question, Exh. K-4.) Dajugar was 18 years old, who 
finished third year high school. He said in his confession that he "used
 a scout knife in stabbing" Pascual. (No. 5, Exh. K-4.)
</p><p>
Appellant's contention might be tenable if only his confession would be taken into account. However, there are <em>five (5) extrajudicial confessions in this case</em>.
 In the three (3) confessions of Ambrocio, Aglugob and Mateo, all taken 
by Patrolman R. A. Ventura, the following admonition is found (Exh. H, I
 and J):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "6.   Q - If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, we can hire one 
so that he will assist you during your investigation? A - No more, sir, 
as I will be telling the truth."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case of Dajugar, the investigator apprised him of his right to 
remain silent and to have counsel and then gave him this warning:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Question: I am also informing you that your statement may be used
 as evidence in favor or against you in any Court, do you still want to 
continue giving your statement without a lawyer to assist you? - Answer:
 Yes, sir." (Exh. K-4.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The rule is that "extrajudicial confessions, independently made without 
collusion, which are identical with each other in their essential 
details and are corroborated by other evidence on record, are admissible
 as circumstantial evidence against the person implicated to show the 
probability of the latter's actual participation in the commission of 
the crime" (People vs. Condemena, L-22426, May 29, 1968, 23 SCRA 910, 
919).
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "While confessions of a co-conspirator are not ordinarily 
admissible as evidence against another co-conspirator, the fact that 
they implicate the latter and were made soon after the commission of the
 crime, is circumstantial evidence to show the probability of their 
co-conspirator having actually participated therein." (People vs. 
Lumahang, 94 Phil. 1084.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The admissibility of the four confessions of Dajugar's co-accused <em>is not in question in this appeal</em>.
 The recitals therein as to Dajugar's involvement in the case, which are
 partly corroborated by Ramirez' testimony, are evidence against 
Dajugar.
</p><p>
His counsel contends that the lower court erred in convicting Dajugar on
 the basis of his confession, that he is not guilty of murder, that 
treachery, evident premeditation, nocturnity, abuse of superior strength
 and drunkenness were not aggravating and that he is entitled to a 
one-degree reduction of his penalty because he was less than eighteen at
 the time of the killing. He was born on October 11, 1963 (60 tsn August
 12, 1982).
</p><p>
We hold that there is sufficient evidence proving that appellant Dajugar
 was a co-principal in the killing. It was qualified by abuse of 
superiority. The fiscal was mistaken in characterizing it as generic 
aggravating. The five accused ganged up on Pascual. The latter as a 
tricycle driver had imprudently joined the five accused in the drinking 
spree.
</p><p>
The circumstances of treachery and evident premeditation, which were 
alleged in the information as qualifying, were not proven. Intoxication,
 which was nonhabitual and unintentional, is mitigating.
</p><p>
At the time of the commission of the crime, Dajugar was below eighteen. 
He was exactly 17 years, 11 months and 28 days old. Therefore, he is 
entitled to a one-degree reduction of his penalty (Art. 68, Re­vised 
Penal Code). The maximum of his indeterminate sentence should be taken 
from <em>prision mayor</em> maximum; the minimum, from <em>prision correccional </em>maximum.
</p><p>
Considering all the circumstances of this case, particularly that 
Dajugar's participation in the assassination was due to camaraderie (<em>barkada</em>),
 drunkenness and teenage indiscretion, he may be paroled after serving 
his minimum sentence, if he satisfies the other legal requirements.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, appellant Dajugar is sentenced to four years, two months and one day of <em>prision correccional </em>as minimum to ten years and one day of <em>prision mayor</em> as maximum. In other respects, the lower court's judgment is affirmed. No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Escolin, </em>and <em>Cuevas, JJ., </em>concur.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, J., (Chairman)</em>, dissent on the grounds stated by the Solicitor General.
</p><p>
<em>Abad Santos, J.,</em> in the result.
