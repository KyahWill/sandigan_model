				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">At the time the National Labor Relations Commission dismissed the
petitioners' complaint for illegal dismissal by the National Service <span style="">Corporation, </span>the ruling case was
National Housing Authority v. <span class="SpellE">Juco</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The challenged decision of the public respondent must now be reversed on the
basis of the doctrine announced in NASECO v. NLRC.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Dismissed by the National Service Corporation, the petitioners
complained to the Ministry of Labor and Employment on <st1:date year="1980" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After considering the position papers of the
parties, the Labor Arbiter ordered the petitioners' reinstatement without loss
of seniority rights and the payment to them of two years back wages and other
benefits.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The decision was appealed to and affirmed by the First Division of the NLRC on
December <span style="">9, </span>1985, and in due
time, the petitioners moved for the issuance of a writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was opposed by NASECO on the ground that
it had not been furnished with a copy of the decision, but the opposition was
rejected and the petition was granted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reconsideration of the order having been denied, the NASECO appealed to
the NLRC, which, through its Third Division this time, declared itself without
jurisdiction and dismissed the case on August 18, 1987.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Citing the NHA case, the public respondent held that the NASECO was not covered
by the Labor Code but by Civil Service rules and regulations, being a
government-owned or controlled corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are now before us asking for <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span>
of the original decision rendered by the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In National Housing Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Juco</span>,
this Court, applying the 1973 Constitution, declared that the petitioner
corporation was part of the Civil Service and, accordingly, its employees were
covered not by the Labor Code but by Civil Service rules and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The basis of the ruling was Article XII-B,
Section 1(1) providing that "the Civil Service embraces every branch,
agency, subdivision and instrumentality of the Government, including every
government-owned or controlled corporation."</p>

<p class="BODY">In National Service Corporation v. NLRC, however, that decision
was overturned on <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1988</st1:date>,
after the Court found that the NASECO did not have an original charter from the
legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule applied was
Article IX-B, Section 2(1) of the 1987 Constitution providing that "the
Civil Service embraces all branches, subdivisions, instrumentalities and
agencies of the Government, including government-owned or controlled
corporations with original charters."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the applicability of the new doctrine, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>On the premise that it is the 1987 Constitution that governs the
instant case because it is the Constitution in place at the time of decision
thereof, the NLRC has jurisdiction to accord relief to the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an admitted subsidiary of the NIDC, in
turn a subsidiary of the PNB, the NASECO is a government-owned or controlled
corporation without original charter.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the NASECO is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>
from challenging the jurisdiction of the NLRC, having accepted it all the while
this case was in progress and until 1987, when it appealed the order of the
Labor Arbiter for the issuance of the writ of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A long line of decisions operates against the
NASECO.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is especially noted that when petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fausto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Baclig</span> filed <span style="">a
</span>complaint with the Merit System Board of the Civil Service for his
reinstatement, the NASECO general manager alleged in his answer dated February
9, 1981, that the case was cognizable not by the Board but by the labor
authorities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His reason was that the
NASECO was a private corporation organized under the Corporation Law.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General correctly observes that the petitioners do
not allege grave abuse of discretion on the <span style="">p</span>art of the respondents as required in a petition for <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i> under Rule 65 of
the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall disregard
that procedural flaw, however, in view of the jurisdictional issue here raised,
and in the interest of substantial justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our finding is that the respondent NLRC erred in dismissing the
petitioners' complaint for lack of jurisdiction because the rule now is that
only government-owned or controlled corporations with original charters come
under the Civil Service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NASECO
having been organized under the Corporation Law and not by virtue of a special
legislative charter, its relations with its personnel are governed by the Labor
Code and come under the jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order of the NLRC dated <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1987</st1:date>, is REVERSED and SET
ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Labor Arbiter
dated <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1983</st1:date>, <span style="">as affirmed </span>by the NLRC on <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1985</st1:date>, and his order dated
<st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1986</st1:date>, are
REINSTATED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
