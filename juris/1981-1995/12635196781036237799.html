Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the defunct CFI of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, the
private respondents applied for the registration of four parcels of land with
an aggregate area of 754 hectares, more or less. The application was opposed by
in­dividual persons as well as by the Directors of Lands and Forestry.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence showed that Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>,
predecessor-in-interest of the private respondents owned a big tract of land. When
he died, the land was inherited by his two sons - <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span>
and Julio. Upon the death of Julio, his heirs registered his share of the land
under two original certificates of title: Nos. 4325 and 8386 with each title
covering 345 hectares, more or less.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> died, he was succeeded by
his only child, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>. The land which is
the subject of the present proceeding was the share of <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span>
transmitted to Vicente and by Vicente to his daughters <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the applicants, namely: Helen, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Carolina</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and Esther all Surnamed <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The CFI said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"During the lifetime
of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>, the </span>property in question
had been declared in his name for taxation purposes (Exhibits C, H, I, J, K and
M) and the taxes thereon duly paid (Exhibits K-1 to K-25). There<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">after, it was declared in the name of the
Heirs of Vicente </span><span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span> (Exhibits L, N and
O) and the taxes thereon also duly paid (Exhibits L-1 to L-14, M-1 and N-2, O-1
to O-9)." <span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, pp. 99-100.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the CFI:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> it has
been sufficiently established to the satisfaction of this Honorable Court that
as early as the Spanish regime, the applicants as well as their predecessors in
interest have been in the actual, continuous and public possession of the land
applied for as owners. First it was Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>,
<span class="GramE">then</span> <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span> from whom the applicants herein in­herited the
land applied for. Their possession has been gene­rally peaceful until the
outbreak of the <span class="GramE">second world war</span> when the private <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> herein began to enter into the land applied for
in spite of the warning of the overseer of the applicants that the land is a
private land of the latter. However, some of these who entered the land like <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rivadinera</span> aria the
late Pedro Robles, who has been substituted in this action by his heirs,
expressly recognized the ownership of the applicants over the property applied
for when they entered into a planting contract with the latter (Exhibits V-9
and V-18, respectively). <span class="SpellE">Hermenegildo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rivadinera</span> and the heirs of the late Pedro Robles, who are
among the private <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in this land
registration proceeding, are therefore <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from
claim­ing any title adverse to the herein applicants." <span class="GramE">(Record
on Appeal, pp. 101-102.)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The CFI also said:</p>

<blockquote>"For the sake of consistency and justice, there is no reason
therefore for the Court to treat the instant case different [from the lands
registered in favor of the heirs of Julio <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>
especially so that the welter of the evi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">dence
clearly and convincingly preponderates in favor of the applicants herein."
<span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, p. 103.)</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the claim of the Director of Forestry, the CFI said:</p>

<blockquote>“The Court likewise finds the claim of <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>
Director of Forestry to the effect that the land applied for is within the
timberland of <span class="SpellE">Mulanay</span> and San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, classified as such by the Bureau of Forestry
in 1955 to be with­out merit. It has been established that no notice whatever
or was given the applicants by the Bureau of Forestry of such classification so
that the same cannot be binding upon the former. Moreover, this classification
by the Bureau of Forestry in 1955 cannot affect the property rights of the
applicants for as early as <span class="GramE">1800,</span> the land was already
the private property of their great <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">grandfather
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>. Even granting that the land
applied for is part of the public domain, it has been held that 'A possessor of
the public domain, to be entitled to registration of his title thereto in his
name, need not have a <span class="SpellE">titulo</span> real, or a </span><span class="SpellE">titulo</span> de <span class="SpellE">composicion</span> con el <span class="SpellE">estado</span>, or a <span class="SpellE">titulo</span> de
information <span class="SpellE">posesoria</span> covering the same. An open,
continuous and adverse possession of such land for at least from <st1:date year="1894" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1894</st1:date> (now 30 years under
Republic Act No. 1942) is sufficient to confer upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

46 Phil. 424, <span class="SpellE">Vaño</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Gov't</span>).</span>
And the right thus acquired cannot be defeated by a subsequent declaration of
the land by the Bureau of Forestry as timber land within a forest zone, or </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the fact that there are some trees
valuable for timber growing on the property.' <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Barot</span> vs. Director of Forestry, 7806-R, 51 O.G. 3495, July
1955.)</span></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, as admitted by witness <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>
Villanueva in his testimony, a large portion of the property is an open cogon
land and no more trees of commercial value exist in the area, which fact
strengthens the conclusion that the property applied has long been a pasture
land." <span class="GramE">(Record on Appeal, pp. 104-106.)</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I dissent. The <u>754-hectare</u> land sought to be registered is
not <span class="SpellE">registerable</span> because it is a <span class="SpellE">forestal</span>
land as per LC Map 1880. It is within Timberland Block-B and has not been
released for agricultural purposes by the Director of Forestry (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2-A, 2-C, 2-C and 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even under the rule of constructive possession, it is hard to
believe that the applicants and their predecessors could have satisfied the <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> requirements for such a vast tract of land.</p>
