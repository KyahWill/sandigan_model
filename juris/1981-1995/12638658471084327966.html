				<BR><STRONG>MEDIALDEA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking the
reversal of the decision rendered by the defunct Court of Industrial Relations
on <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1974</st1:date>
adjudging the petitioner corporation guilty of unfair labor practice and
ordering the reinstatement of and payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to respondent Antonio Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts as found by the industrial court are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Antonio Cruz was employed by <span class="GramE">petitioner
corporation</span> in 1957 as an electrician.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in December, 1961, he was elected president of the Royal
Undergarment Workers Union (RUWU for brevity)<span class="GramE">,</span> a
legitimate labor organization which became affiliated with the Philippine
Transport and General Workers Organization (PTGWO for brevity).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 14, 1961, the RUWU-PTGWO, represented by the National
Secretary of PTGWO and respondent Cruz as RUWU President, sent proposals to
petitioner corporation for the purpose of collective bargaining.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, <st1:date year="1961" day="15" month="12">December
 15, 1961</st1:date>, petitioner corporation, thru its personnel manager,
terminated the services of respondent Cruz allegedly on the basis of the
latter’s “record and after careful analysis and deliberation.” Respondent’s
wife, <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> Cruz, who was also an employee of petitioner,
was likewise terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, RUWU
called a strike sometime during the first week of January, 1962.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1962</st1:date>,
RUWU-PTGWO and <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> entered into a
Return-to-Work Agreement thru the conciliation efforts of the Department of
Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The agreement contained the
following provision:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Regarding the two (2) employees, Mr. Antonio Cruz and Mrs. Cruz,
the union entrusts the settlement of its complaint for decision to the
Management, which shall be reinstatement for both employees when the Royal
Undergarment Workers Union-PTGWO shall have been chosen as the collective
bargaining agent for the workers at the consent election to be held in the
company premises;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span> (pp. 39-40, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The records do not disclose the results of the consent
election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently however,
respondent Cruz and his wife were both re-employed and reinstated by <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span>, thereby indicating the victory of
RUWU-PTGWO in the consent election.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="3">March 31, 1962</st1:date>,
RUWU-PTGWO and <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> entered into a
collective bargaining agreement which contained a grievance procedure for the
settlement of disputes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such grievance
procedure was applied on several occasions involving suspensions of union
members-employees through the help and active participation of respondent Cruz
as union president.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in November, 1962, the PTGWO urged its member-unions to
stage a nationwide strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
respondent Cruz campaigned among the members of RUWU to join the strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1962</st1:date>
at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="23">11:00 p.m.</st1:time>, within the
company premises, respondent Cruz approached three co-employees who are
supervisors of the company, namely, <span class="SpellE">Camaguin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dayadante</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These persons contended that respondent Cruz,
who was under the influence of liquor, uttered the following remarks to
them:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“<span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span> - - - <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">hayop</span> kayo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bibigyan</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> kayo <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">isang</span>
<span class="SpellE">linggong</span> <span class="SpellE">taning</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">buhay</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>
<span class="SpellE">ipapapatay</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> kayo.” They
also claim that respondent Cruz had challenged another co-employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent and his witnesses denied this
charge and claimed that what the respondent actually said to the three
employees was:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“<span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span> pare, <span class="SpellE">alam</span> <span class="SpellE">kong</span> <span class="SpellE">matitigas</span>
kayo <span class="SpellE">rito</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">compania</span>, <span class="SpellE">kaya’t</span> <span class="SpellE">ako’y</span> <span class="SpellE">nakikiusap</span>, kung <span class="SpellE">maaari</span> <span class="SpellE">pag-natuloy</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> nationwide strike <span class="SpellE">bukas</span>, <span class="SpellE">makiisa</span> kayo at <span class="SpellE">gamitin</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">tigas</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span>.”
Immediately thereafter, the three employees went to the personnel officer of <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1962" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1962</st1:date>,
they executed an affidavit regarding the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, on <st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="11">November
 30, 1962</st1:date>, the general manager of <span class="GramE">petitioner
corporation</span> placed respondent Cruz on preventive suspension effective <st1:date year="1962" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1962</st1:date> for threatening “the
lives of four (4) employees” and for having “been reported under the influence
of liquor,” both acts being “contrary to rules and regulations.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the request of respondent Cruz and PTGWO, the petitioner
corporation conducted a conference which was in the nature of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">an </span>investigation of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1962" day="13" month="12">December 13, 1962</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> dismissed respondent Cruz for
being under the influence of liquor on <st1:date year="1962" day="28" month="11">November
 28, 1962</st1:date> and for having threatened the lives of four of his
co-employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Cruz filed a complaint for unfair labor practice
against <span class="GramE">petitioner corporation</span> with the Court of
Industrial Relations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="1">January 21, 1974</st1:date>, the respondent
industrial court, while affirming the findings of the hearing examiner,
rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, respondent is hereby declared guilty of unfair labor
practice and is ordered to cease and desist from further committing the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent is further directed to
reinstate complainant Antonio Cruz to his former or equivalent position without
loss of seniority and other privileges and to pay him <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
including all benefits attached to his position, from the date he was dismissed
up to <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="11">November 17, 1969</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SO ORDERED.”</span> (pp. 43-44, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> with the
petitioner assigning the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">“I</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">RESPONDENT
CIR COMMITTED A GRAVE MISAPPREHENSION OF FACT IN HOLDING IN ITS</span> DECISION
THAT IT WAS RESPONDENT CRUZ’ UNION ACTIVITIES WHICH CAUSED HIS DISMISSAL BY
PETITIONER.</span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">“II</p>

<blockquote>RESPONDENT CIR LIKEWISE COMMITTED A GRAVE MISAPPREHENSION OF FACT
IN NOT HOLDING IN ITS DECISION THAT THE DISMISSAL OF RESPONDENT CRUZ WAS FOR
CAUSE AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE TERMINATION PAY LAW AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH
MANAGEMENT PREROGATIVE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in">“III</p>

<blockquote>ASSUMING <u>ARGUENDO</u> THAT PETITIONER IS GUILTY OF UNFAIR LABOR
PRACTICE, RESPONDENT CIR ERRED IN AWARDING RESPONDENT CRUZ FULL BACKWAGES
WITHOUT DEDUCTING THEREFROM THE INCOME HE EARNED DURING SAID PERIOD.” (pp. 9?10,
<span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first and second assigned errors, petitioner submits
that the records of the case, particularly the testimonies of respondent Cruz
himself and his witnesses, show that petitioner corporation did not interfere
with or prevent the union activities of its employees; that the former has even
allowed or abetted active unionism within the company; that the dismissal of
respondent Cruz <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>not impelled
by reason of union participation of respondent Cruz but solely by his
infraction of company rules and regulations, specifically, serious threats
against the lives of three co-employees, challenging another to a fight and
intoxication while on duty, all of which clearly amounted to a dismissal for
cause under the Termination Pay Law, Rep. Act No. 1052, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Court of Industrial Relations found from
the surrounding circumstances of the case, a valid and sufficient basis for the
charge of unfair labor practice against <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said the respondent court:</p>

<p class="2Q">“There is no question as to the union activities of the
complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Starting from the time he
was elected president of the RUWU, he had engaged himself actively in union
affairs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had in behalf of others
pursued assiduously the employee relationships of the membership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And on a higher plane, he urged the members
to join the nation-wide strike being planned by the PTGWO.</p>

<p class="2Q">“On the part of respondent there appears to be an attitude of
antipathy towards the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Going
back to the time, when the RUWU sent collective bargaining proposals
represented then by the complainant, the latter and his wife were dismissed <u>one</u>
<u>day</u> after the same was received by respondent company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record does not show the specific reasons
or bases for this action except the general proposition that this
(complainant’s) record was supposedly carefully analyzed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And yet, why include his wife in the
dismissal?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the Return-to-Work
Agreement of January, 1962 which followed, a peculiar and strange arrangement
was made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reinstatement of
complainant and his wife was made to depend on a contingency - - the victory of
RUWU in the consent election. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The main
consideration therefore of complainant’s reinstatement, as well as that of his
wife, is<span class="GramE">,</span> he gets back to work if his union wins; he
stays out, if his union loses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Should
one’s employment be made to depend on his union affiliation or identity?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This aspect only projects the animosity
harbored by the respondent against the complainant.</p>

<p class="2Q">“Then, in the space of eleven months, complainant once again was
dismissed from respondents’ employ, e.g. in December of the same year he was
reinstated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents based its
dismissal of complainant on the ground that he was obviously under the
influence of liquor and he threatened the lives of four co-employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence of being ‘obviously under the
influence of liquor’ is based on the supposed observation of the three
witnesses whose lives were allegedly threatened, coming as it is from a biased
source.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>None of these witnesses have
ever supplied, much less hinted on the motivation why complainant threatened
their lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they
claimed that they were on friendly terms with the complainant with no previous
background of misunderstanding between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>None of them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">ever filed criminal
charges against the</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">complainant
for the supposed threat on their</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">lives
indicating that whatever has transpired</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">is not as serious as pictured by the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incident was simply blown into such
proportion so as to provide a</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">supposed</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">valid cause</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">for</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">complainant’s</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">initial</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">attitude of respondent earlier discussed, the</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">inducing cause directly contributing to
complainant’s dismissal is the respondent’s antipathy to complainant’s union
activity and not his misconduct.” (pp. 42-43, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We accord respect to the findings of the industrial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 3 of Republic Act No. 875, known as
the <span class="SpellE">The</span> Industrial Peace Act, as amended, provides
that employees shall have the right to self?organization and to form,
join or assist labor organizations of their own choosing for the purpose of
collective bargaining through representatives of their own choosing and to
engage in concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining and
other mutual aid or protection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence,
it shall be unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate in regard to
tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or
discourage membership in any labor organization (Section 4 (a)(4), R.A. No.
875).</p>

<p class="BODY">We have perused the record and found that the totality of
evidence as found by respondent court supports the conclusion that respondent
Cruz has been unjustly dismissed by reason of his union activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The charge by petitioner against respondent
Cruz for being under the influence of liquor on a certain date and for having
threatened the lives of his co-employees is too flimsy to merit serious
consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have on record the
undisputed facts that private respondent, as president of RUWU, was known for
his aggressive and militant union <span class="SpellE">activites</span>; that he
and his wife had been previously dismissed on the ground of active participation
in union affairs; that they were re­employed only pursuant to the express terms
of the Return-to-Work Agreement executed by petitioner corporation and RUWU
when the latter won in the consent election; that respondent Cruz was dismissed
again for the second time in the course of his campaign among RUWU members to
join the nationwide strike of PTGWO in which RUWU is a member union.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has previously been indicated that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">an </span>employer may treat freely with an employee and is not obliged
to support his actions with a reason or purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, where the attendant circumstances,
the history of the employer’s past conduct and like considerations, coupled
with an intimate connection between the employer’s action and the union
affiliations or activities of the particular employee or employees taken as a
whole raise a suspicion as to the motivation for the employer’s action, the
failure of the employer to ascribe a valid reason <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
may justify an inference that his unexplained conduct in respect of the
particular employee or employees was inspired by the latter’s union membership
or activities (<span class="SpellE">Rothenbergon</span> Labor Relations, pp.
401-402, cited in San Miguel Brewery, Inc., et al. v. Santos, et al., No. <span class="GramE">L-12682, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="31" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 31, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 2 SCRA 1081).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Further, factual findings of the Court of Industrial Relations
are conclusive in the absence of a showing that the same have no support in the
evidence on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court will not
review said court’s factual findings as long as the same are supported by
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so because the
industrial court is governed by the rule of substantial evidence rather than by
the rule of preponderance of evidence as in ordinary civil cases (Sanchez v.
Court of Industrial Relations, L-19000, July 31, 1963, 8 SCRA 654; Industrial
Commercial Agricultural Workers Organization v. Bautista, L-15639, April 30,
1963, 7 SCRA 907).</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the third assigned error, it is the judicial trend to fix a
reasonable period for the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to
avoid protracted delay in post judgment hearings to prove earnings of the
worker elsewhere during the period that he had not been reinstated to his
employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In consonance with the
rulings in many cases, and in view of the circumstances and equity of the instant
case, respondent Cruz should be reinstated and granted <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
corresponding to a period of three (3) years from the time he was dismissed on
December 13, 1962, without deduction for his earnings elsewhere during his
lay-off and without qualification of his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> as
thus fixed, that is, unqualified by any wage increases (<span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span>
