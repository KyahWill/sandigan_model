modifying the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Pasig, Branch 157, dated
November 29, 1990, and absolving private respondent Angel Santos from liability
for the damages sustained by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as borne by the records, are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject matter of this case is a commercial unit at the
Madrigal Building, located at Claro M. Recto Avenue, Sta. Cruz, Manila.  The building is owned by Susana Realty
Corporation and the subject premises was leased to private respondent Angel
Santos.  The lessee's haberdashery
store, Santos &amp; Sons, Inc., occupied the premises for almost twenty (20)
years on a yearly basis.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> Thus,
the lease contract <span style="">in </span>force
between the parties in the year 1983 provided that the term of the lease shall
be one (1) year, starting on August 1, 1983 until July 31, 1984.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 28, 1984, the lessor Susana Realty Corporation, through
its representative Mr. Jes Gal R. Sarmiento, Jr., informed respondents that the
lease contract which was to expire on July 31, 1984 would not be renewed.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, private respondent's lease contract was extended
until December 31, 1984.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent also continued to occupy the leased premises beyond the
extended term.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 5, 1985, private respondent received a <span style="">letter</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> from the lessor, through its Real Estate
Accountant Jane F. Bartolome, informing him of the increase in rentals,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Four days later or on
February </span><span style="">9, </span><span style="">1985, petitioner Manolo Samson saw private
respondent in the latter's house and offered to buy the store of Santos &amp;
Sons and his right to lease the subject premises.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Petitioner was advised to return after a
week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On February 15, 1985,
petitioner returned to private respondent's house to confirm his offer.  On said occasion, private respondent
presented petitioner with a letter containing his counter proposal, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"MANOLO SAMSON</blockquote>

<blockquote>Marikina, Metro Manila</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sir:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In line with our negotiation to sell our
rights in the Madrigal building at Recto, Rizal Avenue, I propose the
following:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">1.  <u>The</u>
<u>lease</u> <u>contract</u> <u>between</u> <u>Santos</u> </span><u>and</u> <u>Sons</u>,
<u>Inc</u>. <u>and</u> <u><span style="">Madrigal</span></u><span style=""> <u>was</u> <b><u>impliedly</u></b> <b><u>renewed</u></b>.  <u>It</u> </span><u><span style="">will</span></u><span style=""> <u>be</u></span><span style=""> <u>formally</u> <u>renewed</u> <u>this</u> <u>monthly</u>

<blockquote>3.  I will answer and pay all obligations of
Santos and Sons, Inc. as of February 28, 1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Very truly yours,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Angel C. Santos"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioner affixed his signature on the
letter-proposal signifying his acceptance.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> They
agreed that the consideration for the sale of the store and leasehold right of
Santos &amp; Sons, Inc. shall be P300,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 20, 1985, petitioner paid P150,000.00 to private
respondent representing the value of existing improvements in the Santos &amp;
Sons store.  The parties agreed that the
balance of P150,000.00 shall be paid upon the formal renewal of the lease
contract between private respondent and Susana Realty.  It was also a condition precedent to the
transfer of the leasehold right of private respondent to petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In March 1985, petitioner began to occupy the Santos &amp; Sons
store.  He utilized the store for the
sale of his own goods.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All went well for a few months.  In July 1985, however, petitioner received a notice from Susana Realty,
addressed to Santos &amp; Sons, Inc., directing the latter to vacate the leased
premises on or before <span style="">July </span>15,
1985.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent failed to renew his lease over the premises and petitioner
was forced to vacate the same <span style="">on July
16, 1985.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed an action for damages against private respondent.  He imputed fraud and bad faith against
private respondent when the latter stated in his letter-proposal that his lease
contract with Susana Realty has been impliedly renewed.  Petitioner claimed that this
misrepresentation induced him to purchase the store of Santos &amp; Sons and
the leasehold right of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In defense, respondent alleged that their agreement was to the
effect that the consideration for the sale was P300,000.00, broken down as
follows:  P150,000.00 shall be for the improvements
in the store, and the balance of P150,000.00 shall be for the sale of the
leasehold right of Santos &amp; Sons over the subject premises.  The balance shall be paid only after the
formal renewal of the lease contract and its actual transfer to petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial on the merits ensued.  On November 29, 1990, the trial court rendered a decision<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
in favor of <span style="">petitioner.  The dispositive portion reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, AND IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, judgment is
hereby rendered in favor of plaintiff Manolo P. Samson and against defendants
Santos and Sons, Inc., and Angel C. Santos, ordering the said defendants to pay
jointly and severally unto the plaintiff:</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.  The sum<span style=""> </span>

right to occupy its leased premises subject matter of the sale involved;  with interest thereon at the legal rate from
the filing of the complaint on November 5, 1985 until the same is fully paid;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“4.  The sum of P100,000.00 representing the

moral and exemplary damages, respectively, also with legal interest thereon,
from the date of this judgment until fully paid; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“6.  The sum of P45,000.00 as and for attorney's
fees and expenses of litigation, in addition to judicial costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the defendants' counterclaim, the plaintiff is ordered to
return to the defendants the latter's steel filing cabinet, adding machine,
typewriter and all its unused sales invoices, receipts and blank checks, if the
plaintiff still has any of the said papers or documents.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent appealed to the Court of Appeals.  In a Decision dated November 27, 1992,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
the appellate court modified the decision of the trial court after finding that
private respondent did not exercise fraud or bad faith in its dealings with
petitioner.  The dispositive portion of
the impugned decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is hereby MODIFIED by
reducing the amounts the trial court awarded to appellee Manolo P. Samson in
that appellants Santos &amp; Sons, Inc. and Angel C. Santos are ordered to pay
appellee, by way of reimbursement, the P150,000.00 which the latter gave
appellants as advance payment for their store and lease right with legal
interest to be reckoned from the promulgation date of this decision; and
AFFIRMED with respect to the trial court's judgment ordering appellee to return
to appellants the latter's filing cabinet, adding machine, typewriter, and all
their unused sales invoices, receipts and blank checks, if appellee still has
any of these documents.  No costs.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition for review with the following assigned
errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED

<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN
HOLDING RESPONDENTS FREE FROM LIABILITY TO PETITIONER FOR THE DAMAGES THE

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue in the case at bench is whether or not private
respondent Angel Santos committed fraud or bad faith in representing to
petitioner that his contract of lease over the subject premises has been
impliedly renewed by Susana Realty.  Undoubtedly, it was this representation which induced petitioner to
enter into the subject contract with private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find the
petition devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><i>Bad </i></b><b><i><span style="">faith</span></i></b><span style=""> </span>is essentially a state of mind

<p class="BODY">In contracts, the kind of fraud that will vitiate consent is one
where, through insidious words or machinations of one of the contracting
parties, the other is induced to enter into a contract which, without them, he
would not have agreed to.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> This
is known as <b><i>dolo causante</i></b> or causal fraud which is basically a
deception employed by one party prior to or simultaneous to the contract in
order to secure the consent of the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that their agreement was that the amount of P300,000.00
is the consideration for the transfer of private respondent's leasehold right
to him and he paid P150,000.00 as downpayment therefor.  He insists that private respondent acted in
had faith in assuring him that his lease contract with Susana Realty has been
impliedly renewed and would be formally renewed upon the arrival of Tanya
Madrigal (representative of Susana Realty).  As evidence of private respondent's bad faith, petitioner stresses that
private respondent himself admitted that prior to February 15, 1985, he was
informed by his lawyer that he could not yet sell his lease right to petitioner
for his lease over the premises has not been renewed by Susana Realty
Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully examining the records, we sustain the finding of
public respondent Court of Appeals that private respondent was neither guilty
of fraud nor bad faith in claiming that there was implied renewal of his
contract of lease with Susana Realty.  The records will bear that the original contract of lease between the lessor
Susana Realty and the lessee private respondent was for a period of one year,
commencing on August 1, 1983 until July 31, 1984.  Subsequently, however, private respondent's lease was extended
until December 31, 1984.  At this point,
it was clear that the lessor had no intention to renew the lease contract of
private respondent for another year.  However, on February 5, 1985, the lessor, thru its Real Estate
Accountant, sent petitioner a letter<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> of
even date, worded as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Dear Mr. Santos:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>Clearly, this letter led private respondent to believe and
conclude that his lease contract was impliedly renewed and that formal renewal
thereof would be made upon the arrival of Tanya Madrigal</b>.  This much was admitted by petitioner himself
when he testified during cross-examination that private respondent initially
told him of the fact that his lease contract with Susana Realty has <b>already
expired</b> but he was anticipating its formal renewal upon the arrival of
Madrigal.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, from the start, it was known to both parties that, insofar as the
agreement regarding the transfer of private respondent's leasehold right to
petitioner was concerned, the object thereof relates to a future right.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>

the efficacy of which depends upon an expectancy -- the formal renewal of the
lease contract between private respondent and Susana Realty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records would also reveal that private respondent's lawyer
informed him that he could sell the improvements within the store for he
already owned them but the sale of his leasehold right over the store could not
as yet be made for his lease contract had not been actually renewed by Susana
Realty.  Indeed, it was <b>precisely</b>
pursuant to this advice that private respondent and petitioner agreed that the
improvements in the store shall be sold to petitioner for P150,000.00<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
while the leasehold right shall be sold for the same amount of P150,000.00, <b>payable
only upon the formal renewal of the lease contract and the actual </b><b><span style="">transfer of the leasehold right to petitioner</span></b><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">The
efficacy of the contract between the parties was thus made dependent upon the
happening of this suspensive condition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moreover, public
respondent Court of Appeals was correct when it faulted petitioner for failing
to exercise sufficient diligence in verifying first the status of private
respondent's lease.  We thus quote with
approval the decision of the Court of Appeals when it ruled, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When appellant Angel C. Santos said that the lease contract
had expired but that it was impliedly renewed, that representation should have
put appellee on guard.  To protect his
interest, appellee should have checked with the lessor whether that was so, and
this he failed to do; or he would have simply deferred his decision on the
proposed sale until Miss Madrigal's arrival, and this appellee also failed to
do.  In short, as a buyer of the store
and lease right in question -- or as a buyer of any object of commerce for that
matter -- appellee was charged with the obligation of caution aptly expressed
in the universal maxim <u><span style="">caveat</span></u><span style=""> <u>emptor</u>."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, petitioner had every opportunity to verify the status of
the lease contract of private respondent with Susana Realty.  As held by this Court in the case <span style="">of </span><b><i>Caram, Jr. v. Laureta</i></b><i>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><b><i>
</i></b><span style="">the rule </span><b><i>caveat

vendor and he who buys without checking the vendor's title takes all the risks
and losses consequent to such failure.  In the case at bench, the means of verifying for himself the status of
private respondent's lease contract with Susana Realty was open to
petitioner.  Nonetheless, no effort was
exerted by petitioner to confirm the status of the subject lease right.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
He cannot now claim that he has been deceived.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, we hold that under the facts proved, private respondent
cannot be held guilty of fraud or bad faith when he entered into the subject
contract with petitioner.  Causal fraud or
bad faith on the part of one of the contracting parties which allegedly induced
the other to enter into a contract must be proved by clear and convincing
evidence.  This petitioner failed to do.</p>

without the knowledge and consent of the lessor-owner, Susana Realty; see also
