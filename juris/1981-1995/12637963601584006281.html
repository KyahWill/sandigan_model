<p class="BODY">The facts of this case as found by the Minister of Labor are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">in </span>April,
1976, petitioner (complainant) met Minister <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, husband of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>
Imperial <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, who is the president of respondent hotel,
the <span class="SpellE">Mayon</span> Imperial Hotel, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
20.0pt">in </span>a coffee shop at the Manila Hilton Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time respondent Hotel was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">in </span>need of a general manager and while
the parties in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">that </span>meeting were
talking about the hotel industry, Minister <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> was
made to understand that complainant was an expert in the industry and could be
a hotel manager <u>par</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">excellence</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
18).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the expense of the respondent
Hotel (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61), complainant Riker accepted the
invitation of Minister <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> to visit respondent
Hotel in <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> City, and while there on April 23,
1976, it was verbally agreed that respondent hotel would engage complainant's
services as general manager of the hotel beginning May 1, 1976, (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 18) on a four months probationary basis (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A proposed
contract for two years with the terms and conditions stated therein was
considered by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This other
contract contained the following benefits to be extended to petitioner by
respondent hotel, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) payment of
air fares of petitioner and his family as well as expenses of transport of
personal effects from New York to <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> City and
vice versa; (b) free residential quarters and accommodations including food and
beverages; (c) monthly salary of P7,000.00 net-net and (d) arrangements for conversion
of petitioner's visa and those of his family as well as for petitioner's
working visa (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said probationary contract was signed by the
complainant but not by the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was nevertheless paid his salary in full in the amount of P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a </span>month per his own admission (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hardly a month passed when respondent began to notice that
complainant could not be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>good
manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was lavish in entertaining
his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">guests at the </span>hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He would be drunk occasionally (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1976</st1:date>,
the employees of <span class="SpellE">Mayon</span> Imperial Hotel wrote a letter
to the Commission on Immigration and lodged a complaint against the petitioner
for "un-Filipino activities and attitudes." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 121).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On August 20, 1976, complainant
received a letter </span>from <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> A. Gonzales,
corporate secretary of respondent hotel informing him that a working visa for
him was not secured and a change <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>status
of the members of his family was not obtained, advising him therefore, to leave
on or before August 23, 1976.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
complainant's request so that he could find another job, the letter did not
state <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">anymore </span>respondent's
unfavorable opinion of him (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 62).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these notwithstanding and on the belief
that he was illegally dismissed, complainant filed a complaint on March 29,
1977 against the hotel for illegal dismissal, unpaid wages and other money
claims with the Department of Labor, Regional Office No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">IV<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">After</span></span></span>
efforts to settle the case amicably failed, the same was submitted for
resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finding the employment
contract submitted by complainant without the signature of respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>therefore not perfected, the
Regional Director on <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1978</st1:date>
issued an Order (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 19) which reads:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On Appeal, public respondent Minister of Labor without making any

held that respondent did not violate the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, complainant was held guilty of serious misconduct
resulting in the employer's loss of confidence in him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, respondent cannot be blamed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The crucial issues of this case are the following:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not complainant-appellant's
dismissal from employment as general manager <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">of </span>the <span class="SpellE">Mayon</span> Imperial Hotel was with
legal basis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not alleged contract existed and
was violated by the respondent so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span>to
warrant the grant of damages prayed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for
and other money claims the petitioner.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first issue, there is no doubt that the petitioner
was designated and actually did manage the big hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a pretentious assumption on the part of
the petitioner to assail the ruling that he was a managerial employee
(Memorandum of Petitioner; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 160).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that Vincent Riker assumed
the position of General Manager from <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="5">May
 1, 1976</st1:date> and continued to do so until <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1976</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
19).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the record
indicating that the petitioner was ever limited or restricted in his functions
as such during the period <span class="GramE">covered.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">By the very nature of his position, the maintenance of an
employer-employee relationship is highly dependent upon the trust and
confidence reposed on him by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The loss of trust and confidence by the
employer would instantly mean the termination of his employment (Order of the
Respondent Minister of Labor, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 20).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Thus, the claim of the
petitioner that his dismissal was without basis and not supported by evidence
is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly found by the
respondent Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Complainant is guilty of serious misconduct resulting in the
employer's loss of confidence on him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Records show that complainant's bar and storeroom requisitions (for
beverage and food) were way beyond what a manager should normally consume.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if we take the contract to be valid, the
provision on the matter states that complainant shall be entitled to normal
food and beverage requirement free of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">charge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the records would show that his
requisitions of these items were not </span>in keeping with the <span class="SpellE">aforesighted</span> provi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">sion
of the employment contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant
might have been forgiven for </span>this but certainly his un-Filipino attitude
could not be countenanced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If only<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> for this reason a Filipino employer may, as
did respondent Hotel </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">this case, very well loss confidence on such
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was unfortunate indeed that
complainant uttered words belittling the Filipinos and did discriminating acts
against the said people, even to the extent of having to make a memo that a
particular place in that hotel was reserved for him and other white men.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent therefore convinced that the complainant
is not the right person who could very well manage the hotel and having lost
confidence on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">him </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">because of the latter's serious misconduct
did the most practical thing, the situation de</span>manded to terminate his
services."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It has been repeatedly held by the Supreme Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in a long </span>line
of decisions that where an employee has been guilty of breach of trust or that
his employer has ample reason to distrust <span class="GramE">him,</span> a labor
tribunal cannot deny the employer the authority to dismiss the employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(National Labor Union vs. Standard Vacuum Oil
Company, 73 Phil. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">279; Reynolds

16.0pt">National Labor Relations Commission et al., G.R. No. 72248, July 22,
1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an established principle
that an employer cannot be compelled to continue in employment, an employee
guilty of acts inimical to the interests of the employer and justifying loss of
confidence in him (San Miguel Corporation vs. Deputy Minister </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Labor, 145 SCRA 196 [1986]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, no cogent reason can be found to disturb the pronouncement
of the Minister of Labor as to the validity of the act of respondent hotel in
terminating the employment of complainant, as an act well within the
prerogatives of the former to terminate the employment of erring employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">As further observed by the Solicitor General, the above-quoted
factual findings of public respondent Minister <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>
are supported by evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As shown in
Exhibit "I" petitioner had made requisitions for wines and other
beverages for his personal use from May 24 to <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1976</st1:date>, which amounted to P5<span class="GramE">,080.40</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such excessive requisitions for wines gave
veracity to the claim of the respondent company that the petitioner is an
alcoholic and a suspected drug addict as reported by hotel guests and evidenced
by his huge consumption of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the hotel
liquor supplies xxx (Exhibit "IV").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Similarly, the petitioner did not refute the claims in the answer of the
respondent company that he (petitioner) had been the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">subject </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of complaints for anti-Filipino behavior and activities (Record, p.
70).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the seriousness of the
aforesaid allegations, petitioner's silence thereon is an implied admission of
the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 124-125).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Records also reveal that he withdrew amounts of hotel funds for
official trips to and stay in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>;

<p class="BODY">Unquestionably, proof beyond reasonable doubt of the employees'
misconduct is not required, it being sufficient that there is some basis for
the same or that the employer has reasonable ground to believe that the
employee is responsible for the misconduct and his participation therein
renders him unworthy of the trust and confidence demanded by his position (<span class="SpellE">Nevans</span> vs. CIR, 23 SCRA 1321; Central Textile Mills, Inc. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">vs. </span>NLRC, 90 SCRA 9; San Miguel

<p class="BODY">Neither is the claim that respondent's act of dismissing
complainant amounts to a breach of contract, meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of prime importance is the fact that the proposed employment
contract, not having been signed by private respondent, lacks consent which is
the first essential requisite of every contract (Art. 1319, Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This lack of consent lends credence to
private respondent's claim that its verbal agreement with complainant was on a
four-month probationary basis, the finalization of which depends on whether or
not after the probationary period, respondent is satisfied with complainant's <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ser</span>vices (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 60-61).</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the claims for unpaid wages, the Regional Director found
