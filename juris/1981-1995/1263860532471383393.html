February 16, 1949 without issue (his wife, Arcadia <span class="SpellE">Ganibo</span>,
having died earlier) -- adjudicated unto themselves the property covered by OCT

went against the SALVAS, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
thereof being as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, a decision is hereby rendered in favor of the
JANDUSAYS and against the SALVAS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the action

<blockquote>No pronouncement as to damages in both cases, R-667 and
R-668."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both the SALVAS and the JANDUSAYS appealed to the Court of
Appeals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
There, their appeals ran an uncertain course; there was no little divergence of
views among the magistrates regarding the merits of their appeals; first,
judgment was rendered in favor of the JANDUSAYS; but in the end, the SALVAS
prevailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three (3) justices of the division to which the appeal was
initially assigned could not agree on a unanimous verdict;<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> hence, a special division of five
(5) had to be constituted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The special
division's joint judgment on the appeals was pronounced on November 8, 1976, on
a vote of three to two:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the <span class="SpellE">ponente</span> was <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>, <i>J</i>.,
with whom concurred Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Domondon</span>, <i>JJ</i>.,
and San Diego and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera, <i>JJ</i>.,
dissented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said judgment affirmed the
decision of the Trial Court <i>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The SALVAS moved for reconsideration on
November 29, 1976.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> Their motion remained unresolved
for about eight (8) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
interim Mr. Justice Fernandez was appointed to the Supreme Court and Mr.
Justice <span class="SpellE">Domondon</span> retired; and Messrs. Justices Hugo
Gutierrez, Jr. and Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> were selected to
take their place, by a re-raffle.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a> Thereafter the special division
("Former Special Fourth Division") deliberated on the SALVAS' motion
for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. Justice <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span> voted to deny the motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the four (4) others, Mme. Justices
San Diego and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera, and Messrs. Justices
Gutierrez and <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, voted to grant the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this basis, a Resolution was drawn up by
Mme. Justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera; but at the time of its
promulgation on February 28, 1978, Messrs. Justices <span class="SpellE">Agcaoili</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> had already presented their candidacies for
the Interim <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
and consequently ceased to be members of the Court of Appeals; hence, the
Resolution was signed only by the three (3) remaining Justices composing the
special division of five, it being pointed out that this number was, by the
way, sufficient for the pronouncement of a judgment in accordance with Section
2, Rule 51 of the Rules of Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Resolution overturned the Decision of November 8, 1976 and
disposed of the appeals as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, granting the Motion for Reconsideration, the
judgment appealed from is hereby set aside, and another one entered 1)
dismissing Civil Case No. 668-R, the suit for Annulment of Title; and 2)
ordering Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Jandusay</span> et <span class="SpellE">als</span>.
to surrender possession of Parcel No. 1 covered by TCT No. T-5420, to <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Salva</span> et <span class="SpellE">als</span>., upon this Decision becoming final.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No costs in both instances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was in due time submitted by the
JANDUSAYS, and one for amendment of the resolution, by the SALVAS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motions were disposed of by a Resolution
dated August 3, 1978,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> as follows:</p>

Motion for Amendment of our Resolution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1978</st1:date>, filed by the SALVAS, the Court
resolves:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

proper receipt;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
petition to include compensatory damages in favor of the SALVAS is denied,
their entitlement to them not having been indubitably established."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The JANDUSAYS are now before this Court, having timely filed a
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> seeking review and reversal of the
Appellate Court's aforementioned Resolutions of <st1:date year="1978" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1978</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their appeal was given due course by Resolution dated November 27,
1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Withal, their appeal must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The JANDUSAYS argue that the challenged resolutions should be set
aside because tainted by several serious errors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their first contestation is that the resolutions reversing, and
sustaining reversal of, a special decision of five (5) -- having been rendered
when there were only three (3) members of that special division, the other two
(2) having in the meantime ceased to be members of the Court of Appeals -- are
"contrary to the letter and spirit of Paragraph 3, of Section 2, Article X
of the 1973 Constitution" which in part states that "no decision
rendered <i>en banc</i> or in division may be modified or reversed except by
the Court sitting <i>en banc</i>." The theory is palpably
unmeritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the cited
paragraph in the context of the others in the Section at once discloses that it
can have no reference except to the Supreme Court, and that indeed it cannot
possibly apply to the Court of Appeals since, in the exercise of adjudicatory
powers, that Court never sits <i>en banc</i> but only in divisions of three
justices (or special divisions of five).</p>

<p class="BODY">The next point that the JANDUSAYS try to make is that the
resolutions (a) wrongly concluded that they had failed to establish by
preponderance of evidence:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">i</span>) the due execution and delivery of the deed of sale of
the lot in question by Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> in 1915 in favor
of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span>, and the deed of sale by the latter
in 1917 of the same property to <span class="SpellE">Dominga</span> Marquez; and
(ii) "the loss and contents of the deed of sale executed in 1915 by Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> in favor of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span>
over the litigated property," and (b) wrongly applied "the
survivorship disqualification rule and ** (disregarded) the rules on admission
by privy and declaration against interest made by Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>"
testified to by <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> Jandusay.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the proceedings before the Trial Court, the JANDUSAYS could
not present in evidence the original of the deed of sale allegedly executed in
1915 by Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> in favor of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span> (from whom, in turn, the <span class="SpellE">Jandusays</span>'
predecessor-in-interest had acquired the land in question).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It apparently had been lost.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They therefore submitted secondary evidence
to establish the sale, consisting of the sworn declarations of Mariano <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span>, <span class="SpellE">Severo</span> Geronimo (<span class="SpellE"><i>bilas</i></span> of <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>), Enrique <span class="SpellE">Morente</span>, <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> <span class="SpellE">Jandusay</span> and Gregorio Jandusay.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
Whether or not this evidence satisfactorily proved the existence of the deed of
sale, its due execution, loss, and contents has been subject of considerable
disagreement and extensive analysis among the parties, of course, as well as
the Trial Court and, as already narrated, the Honorable Justices of the Court
of Appeals themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The correctness
of those conclusions has also still been subject of debate among the parties
before this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is not subject
of disputation is the proposition that whatever deductions are drawn from the
evidence are <i>conclusions of fact</i>, and not of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the findings in the Resolution of February 28, 1978 -- ­to
the effect that the evidence had not satisfactorily established "the loss
of the deed of sale between JORGE and LONTOK,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> or
the contents of the lost document,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> or that it was "the LITIGATED
PROPERTY (which) was, indeed, sold by JORGE to LONTOK, and that it was the
(same) LITIGATED PROPERTY which the latter had sold to DOMINGA,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
and that, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)n the last analysis," the
body of proofs adduced by the JANDUSAYS was not so clear and convincing as to
defeat the rights of the registered owner<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> -- are conclusions of fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These findings are quite clearly reasoned
conclusions, reached only after study and assessment of the proofs, an
appraisal of testimonial credibility of witnesses, and a weighing of
probabilities regarding the conduct and reaction of the parties to the alleged
sales on the basis of proven past acts and in light of human experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cannot thus be said to be grounded
"entirely on speculation or conjecture," or to have been arrived at
whimsically, capriciously or arbitrarily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, by established doctrine, they are binding on this Court and
may not be reviewed by it, as the petitioners would wish, absent, as here, any
of the recognized exceptions to the doctrine.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appealed Resolution correctly applied the so-called <i>Surviving
Party Rule </i>or the<i> Dead Man's Act</i> to exclude the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span> <span class="SpellE">Jandusay</span> relative to the
statement ascribed to Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> that the <span class="SpellE">Jandusays</span> should "not ** insist in having the deed of
sale registered or annotated ** as according to him before he dies he would
sell his property and that in all probability we might as well buy his
remaining property."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> The rule is found in Section 20,
Rule 130 of the Rules of Court and reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 20.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Disqualification
by reason of interest or relationship</i>. - The following persons cannot
testify as to matters in which they are interested, directly or indirectly, as
herein enumerated:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) Parties or assignors of parties to a case, or persons in whose
behalf a case is prosecuted against an executor or administrator or other
representative of a deceased person, * * upon a claim or demand against the
estate of such deceased person * * cannot testify as to any matter of fact
occurring before the death of such deceased person * * ;</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There can be no doubt that the JANDUSAYS' suit in the Trial Court
had for its essential object the enforcement of a deed of sale allegedly
executed by the deceased Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> during his
lifetime; so that in truth, and adapting the language of the "Dead Man's
Act," the JANDUSAYS were <i>parties or persons in whose behalf a case was
being prosecuted upon a claim or demand against the estate</i> of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For that
sale, supposedly executed about 40 years prior to the institution of the
action, was the definitive foundation of the JANDUSAYS' asserted cause of
action, i.e., the cancellation of the title of the collateral heirs of the
vendor and the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the property to them
by said heirs, the theory obviously being that at the time of the vendor's
death, the property no longer formed part of his estate and therefore could not
possibly have been inherited by his heirs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nor can there be any doubt that the suit was being prosecuted against <i>representatives
of the deceased person</i>, i.e., <span class="SpellE">Lingon's</span> collateral
relatives, who had adjudicated the property to themselves as intestate heirs
and who, in the action were asserting a defense (denial of the sale) which the
deceased might have himself set up, if living.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> The heirs of <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>
were not asserting their status as such heirs to defeat the JANDUSAYS' action,
that not being the chief issue, but were basically contending that the property
in question still formed part of the estate of the decedent at the time of his
death and had not been segregated <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> by sale
to the JANDUSAYS' predecessor-in-interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not amiss to state in this connection that the challenged
Resolution refused to accord veracity to the statement attributed to Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> supposedly asking for deferment of registration of
the sale in favor of the JANDUSAYS because it "runs counter to the fact
that the partial sales made by JORGE of Parcel No. 2 were all registered,"
and because the failure of the JANDUSAYS for an unreasonably long period to
resort to readily available legal remedies to compel the delivery of the
certificate of title and have the sale to them annotated thereon militated
against their averment that <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> had indeed sold
the land to them had refused to lend them the title so that the sale could be
registered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The JANDUSAYS also argue that the failure of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> to dispossess them and their
predecessors-in-interest from the litigated property for a period of
thirty-four (34) years, and a like failure by the SALVAS to do so for seven (7)
years, justify the application of the equitable doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
in their (the JANDUSAYS') favor, as well as the ruling in <i>Mejia de Lucas v. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span></i>, 100 Phil. 277; <span class="SpellE"><i>Pabalate</i></span><i>
v. <span class="SpellE">Echavari</span>, Jr.</i>, 37 SCRA 518; and <i>Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Lacamen</span> v. Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Laruan</span></i>,
"65 SCRA".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> The argument is effectively
confuted by the following disquisition in the Resolution of February 28, 1978
to which this Court hereby confers sanction:</p>

<blockquote>"If <span class="SpellE">JORGE's</span> inaction in
dispossessing the JANDUSAYS of the LITIGATED PROPERTY can be alleged against
him in a question of title, the inaction of the JANDUSAYS or their
predecessor-in-interest in not compelling JORGE to formally transfer the title
to the LITIGATED PROPERTY to them for several years can also be alleged against
the JANDUSAYS in this controversy over title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Further, if, as alleged, ‘inaction of the SALVAS from 1949 when JORGE <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> died, up to 1956 when they executed the
extrajudicial partition, betrayed their hesitancy in taking such step knowing
too well the weakness of their claim’ by the same token, the legal inaction,
the failure to take remedial steps of the JANDUSAYS from 1930 when they learned
of the existence of the title, up to JORGE <span class="SpellE">Lingon's</span>
death in 1949, and thence up to 1956 when they filed their counter-suit against
the SALVAS only after the latter had instituted their action for recovery of
possession, could also be interpreted as an awareness on their part of the
weakness of their claim of title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, '<span class="SpellE">Laches</span>' and inaction imputed to the
SALVAS may likewise be laid at the feet of the JANDUSAYS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The '<span class="SpellE">laches</span>' of one
nullifies the '<span class="SpellE">laches</span>' of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One who seeks equity must himself be
deserving of equity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When parties are in
culpability similarly situated ('in <span class="SpellE">eodem</span> loco'), it
is a general principle of law that one may claim no advantage over the other -
a principle consistently applied in the '<span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span>' rule imbedded in our legal system (Arts. 1411,
1412, 100, 453, Civil Code).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The cases of Mejia de Lucas v. <span class="SpellE">Gamponia</span>,
100 Phil. 277 (1956), that of <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Echavari</span>, Jr., ** 37 SCRA 518, which applied it, as well as
that of Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Lacamen</span> v. Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Laruan</span>, ** 65 SCRA 605 cannot be invoked herein to justify
a judgment in favor of the JANDUSAYS on the ground of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>,
due to fundamental differences:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) the
first two cases involved the prohibition against the sale of free patents where
under the pertinent law, an <i>original patentee </i>is given seven years from
conveyance within which to bring an action to recover the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs therein failed to exercise that
right within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period but allowed 37
years (in the Mejia Case) and 32 years (in the <span class="SpellE">Pabalate</span>
Case) to lapse; hence, the Supreme Court ruling that the original owners’ right
to recover the possession of the property and the title thereto from the
defendants had, by patentee's inaction and neglect, been converted into a stale
demand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, an action to
recover possession of a r<i>egistered</i> land, such as that brought by the
SALVAS, <i>never prescribes</i> in view of Section 46 of the Land Registration
Act to the effect that no title to registered land in derogation of that of the
registered owner shall be acquired by prescription or adverse possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, as held in J.M. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>
&amp; Co. Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Macalindong</span>, L-15398, December 29,
1962, 6 SCRA 938, the right to file an action to recover possession based on a
Torrens Title is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span> and is not barred
under the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even if <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
were <span class="SpellE">invocable</span>, and that plaintiffs had 'slept on
their rights,' with equal vigor can it be said that defendants themselves are
chargeable with <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>2) In the three mentioned cases, the fact of
sale of the litigated properties was admitted unlike in this case where such
sale has been <i>challenged</i>, nor has it even been proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>3) In addition, the sale in this case to the
JANDUSAYS was not made by the original registered owner himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is merely alleged that he had sold it to
LONTOK who, in turn, sold it to the JANDUSAYS."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The JANDUSAYS next attack the very title of the SALVAS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend that the property covered by OCT
No. 61 was conjugal property of the spouses Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>
and Arcadia <span class="SpellE">Ganibo</span>; that upon the latter's death, the
widower, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>, inherited only one-half
thereof in usufruct "while the naked ownership could be inherited" by
the decedent's collateral relatives; that the SALVAS are "not collateral
relatives by blood of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>," and could
not therefore have validly inherited from him and in truth acquired nothing by
their execution of a deed of extrajudicial partition of <span class="SpellE">Lingon's</span>
estate, the execution thereof being, in addition, attended by fraud.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
The attack is pointless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if
consistent with the demonstrated facts, a doubtful proposition at best, it
would not enhance the petitioners' cause one whit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absence of title over the property in
question in Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>, or substantial defect
thereof, would not in any manner whatever show valid acquisition of ownership
of said property by the JANDUSAYS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the contrary, it would demonstrate invalidity or defect in their own claim of
title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, absence of the status
of <span class="SpellE">heirship</span> in the SALVAS <span class="SpellE"><i>vis-a-vis</i></span>
Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span> is utterly inconsequential as far as
concerns the JANDUSAYS' claim of conveyance by <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>
to their predecessor-in-interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, being heirs of neither Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>
nor Arcadia <span class="SpellE">Ganibo</span>, they have no personality or
standing to question the succession to the estate of either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any event, the Court is satisfied that the
Appellate Court has properly upheld the SALVAS' title to the property in
question.</p>

year 1930 when my mother was still living, my brother, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Jandusay</span>, went to Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>
requesting him to lend us his title covering the land in question for the
purpose of having our deed of sale registered, to have the sale annotated at
the back thereof, but he told us not to insist in having the deed of sale
registered or annotated at the back of the title as according to him before he
dies he would sell his property and that in all probability we might as well
buy his remaining property." TSN, <st1:date year="1959" day="15" month="12">Dec.
 15, 1959</st1:date>, pp. 82-83.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>N.B.
The declaration implies that it was only Gregorio who had gone to see Jorge <span class="SpellE">Lingon</span>; and so, whatever knowledge <span class="SpellE">Demetria</span>
might have of <span class="SpellE">Lingon's</span> statements to Gregorio could
only have been derived from the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is, too, some implication in <span class="SpellE">Lingon's</span>
supposed statement that the sale was to be perfected at a future time,
"before he dies."</p>
