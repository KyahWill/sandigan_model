<p class="BODY">Four separate informations for estafa under Art. 315, par. 2(a)

fraud, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously defraud one

the offended party that she had connection and capacity to deploy workers for
overseas employment and she could secure employment/placement for said URSILITO
B. MANZANO, and believing said misrepresentation, the offended party was later

<p class="BODY">The three other informations contained basically the same
allegations except for the name of the offended party, the amount involved and
the time of the commission of the crime:  Criminal Case No. Q-89-3277 alleged that in April 1988, appellant
defrauded Norberto Cayabyab of the amount of P16,770.00;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Criminal Case No. Q-89-3278 stated that on March 21, 1988, Hermelina D. de Vera

Criminal Case No. Q-89-3279 inculpated appellant with having defrauded Isidro

was filed against appellant and docketed as Criminal Case No. Q-89-3280.  It states as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty to the charges.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
All five cases were thereafter jointly tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution consisted of the testimonies of
private complainants and the receipts issued them.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Edwin Estabillo<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
testified that in the months of March and April 1988, his officemate, Sally
Valdemina, introduced appellant to him.  Looking for an overseas job, he and Rolly de Guia, Aurora Geronimo, and
Joselito Geronimo went to appellant's residence in Quezon City.  Appellant promised them jobs abroad and
required them to submit their respective filled-up bio-data forms.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the date of his promised departure or on April 27, 1988,
Estabillo gave appellant herself the amount of P6,000.00 for which the latter
signed <span style="">a </span>receipt in his
presence.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
When appellant failed to fulfill her promise, some of the complainants verified
with the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA) and found out
that appellant was not authorized to recruit workers.  The POEA, through Hermogenes C. Mateo, chief of its licensing
branch, issued a certification to that effect.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Estabillo's group thereafter verbally requested appellant several times to
return to them the money they had given her as processing fees but she failed
to do so.  Hence, Estabillo and the
others filed a complaint against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Norberto Cayabyab<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> also
applied for a job abroad through appellant.  In April 1988, he submitted his bio-data form, passport and clearances
to appellant at her residence at No. 32, Moore St., San Francisco del Monte,
Quezon City.  Cayabyab gave appellant in
her house the amount of P15,700.00 and P1,020.00 for "terminal fees"
but she signed and issued a receipt only for P15,750.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Unable to leave for abroad, Cayabyab sought verification from the POEA and
learned that appellant was not a licensed recruiter.  For several times, they demanded that appellant return to them
the amounts they had given her but to no avail.  When their demands remained unheeded, they filed a complaint
against appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Hermelina D. de Vera,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
sometime in February 1988, appellant went to her house in 61-B Ocampo St., U.P.
Diliman, Quezon City and presented to her certain papers purportedly showing
that appellant was a licensed recruiter.  Enticed to work in Australia, de Vera secured the following papers
required by appellant:   NBI clearance,
police clearance and her bio-data.  Appellant also asked her to pay a recruitment fee of P15,000.00 which de
Vera gave appellant in the latter's residence in two (2) payments:   P5,000.00 in the first week of March, 1988
and the balance of P10,000.00 a week later.  She did not demand a receipt for the first payment because appellant
promised her that she would issue a receipt upon her payment of the second
installment.  It was de Vera herself who
prepared the receipt but appellant signed it in her presence.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant kept on promising her that she would leave for abroad soon.  When such promises were not realized, de
Vera went to appellant's house and demanded the return of her money.  Appellant having failed to give her back the
amount, de Vera went to the POEA and found out that appellant was not a
licensed recruiter.  Hence, de Vera and
her companions went to the NBI and lodged a complaint against appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Ursulito Manzano<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
testified that appellant recruited him for a janitorial job abroad.  As with the others, appellant told him to
get a passport and an NBI clearance and to submit his bio-data.  She also asked Manzano for P600.00 for which
no receipt was issued.  The second time
around, appellant asked Manzano for P10,000.00 which he gave and a receipt was
correspondingly issued stating that the amount was "for processing
fee."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It was Manzano's father who gave appellant an additional P5,000.00 on May 20,
1988.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant promised him that he would leave for abroad as soon as
he made the payments.  However, there
were no developments even after giving her the required amounts.  In July 1988, he demanded from appellant the
return of his money but appellant failed to make the reimbursement.  With his companions, they sought
verification from the POEA and was informed that she was not licensed to recruit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Isidro Arias, Jr.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> was
promised a cashier's job in London by appellant sometime in April 1988.  Having complied with the requirements of
submission of passport, quarantine certification, NBI clearance and bio-data,
Arias gave appellant the amount of P12,000.00 on a "staggered basis"
- P6,000.00 on April 30, 1988, P3,000.00 on May 3, 1988 and another P3,000.00
on May 9, 1988.  All these amounts were
covered by receipts signed by appellant in Arias’ presence.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant then told Arias that in one or two weeks’ time, he would be leaving
for abroad.  Arias waited for the
"go signal" from appellant but it never came.  Hence, like the other complainants, he
verified from the POEA about appellant's status as a recruiter and found to his
dismay that appellant was not a licensed recruiter.  Consequently, he filed a complaint with the NBI.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was towards the end of May 1988 that Leticia Quinsay<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
went to appellant's residence looking for an <span style="">overseas </span>job.  Appellant
offered her the job of a personal secretary and asked her to submit the
necessary papers and to pay the processing and placement fees.  Quinsay gave appellant an initial payment of
P5,000.00 and on June 7, 1988, a second payment in the amount of P7,000.00.  She paid appellant the said amounts at the latter's
residence in San Francisco del Monte in Quezon City and appellant issued a
temporary receipt therefor but only for P7,500.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Quinsay followed up her application through telephone calls but after a month,
appellant could not produce the necessary papers for her employment and those
of her friends Aurora and Joselito Geronimo.  Like the rest of the complainants, Quinsay found out that appellant was
not a licensed recruiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also presented Hermogenes C. Mateo, the Chief of
the Licensing Division of the POEA, who authenticated the document he had
issued certifying that appellant was "not authorized in her private
capacity to undertake recruitment."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented appellant<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> as
its sole witness.  She denied that she
had recruited the complainants and asserted that she "was not the one who
got money from them but Rosalina Balbedina and John del Valle" who were
the officemates of the complainants.  Balbedina and del Valle who was her partner in her scrap iron business
in Coto Mines, Zambales were holding office at 2698-B Dominga St., Malate,
Manila so that appellant failed to see the "actual giving of the
money" but del Valle asked her to prepare the receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, however, was unable to explain why Estabillo,
Cayabyab, Manzano, Arias, de Vera and Quinsay would file a complaint against
her.  Appellant insisted that Balbedina
and del Valle were the recruiters.  On
cross-examination, appellant admitted that she did not only prepare the
receipts but that she signed them.  However, she qualified this by stating that Exhibits "D",
"G", "H" and "J" were in Balbedina's handwriting
but she was made to sign the receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 16, 1990, appellant was convicted in a decision
penned by Judge Rodolfo A. Ortiz, the dispositive portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant appeal wherein appellant contends that the
trial court erred in declaring that (a) she received the monies from the
offended parties and (b) she recruited the offended parties for overseas
employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the position of appellant that she did not actually receive
the money from the complainants but was merely instructed by del Valle and/or
Balbedina to <span style="">sign </span>the
receipts.  Because of this, the receipts
do not express the true intent and agreement of the parties.  Therefore, parol evidence consisting of her
testimony should be admitted in accordance with Section 9, Rule 130, of the
Rules of Court.  Moreover, appellant
avers that assuming she issued the receipts and received the money, it is not
conclusive of the fact that she recruited the complainants.</p>

<p class="BODY">We view this position of the appellant as <span style="">a pathetic </span>and belated attempt to extricate herself from the
situation she had single-handedly gotten herself into.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant admitted that she prepared and signed all the receipts
except Exhibits "D", "G", "H" and "J" which
were supposedly in Balbedina's handwriting but were signed by her as instructed
by the former.  That someone else
prepared the receipt is not material as even prosecution witness Hermelina D.
de Vera testified that she wrote the receipt and accused simply signed it.  What is important is that private
complainants were united in stating that appellant personally signed the
receipts in their presence after receiving money from them.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Her allegation that she did not actually receive the monies given
by the complainants is worthless considering that it is based on her own
self-serving testimony.  By her failure
to present the persons who were allegedly responsible for the recruitment of
private complainants, appellant risked the adverse inference and legal presumption
that evidence suppressed would be adverse if produced.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
In <u><span style="">People</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>v</u>. <u><span style="">Bodozo</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the appellants therein similarly
tried to exculpate themselves by passing on the liability to third
persons.  The Court in rejecting such
argument explained:</p>

<blockquote>"Accused-appellants point, to a certain Belen Hernandez, a
manager of Mcgleo International Management and Service Contractor a duly
registered and licensed recruiter, and Jing Evangelista of Ultragen, Inc. as
the persons who were responsible for the recruitment of private
complainants.  If such allegations were
true, why did accused-appellants not present any one of them as witness to
corroborate their claim? For reasons only known to them, they chose to suppress
such testimony as evidence and instead risked the adverse inference and legal
presumption that 'evidence wilfully suppressed would be adverse if produced.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Besides, if it was Belen Hernandez and Jing Evangelista who were
the recruiters, why did accused-appellants issue the receipts acknowledging
payments made by private complainants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused-appellant Nimfa Bodozo alleged that she was forced to issue
and sign receipts marked as Exhibits J and N because private complainants
Prudencio Renon and Fernando Gagtan were mad and refused to leave the
house.  On the other hand,
accused-appellant Joey Bodozo claimed that he, too, was forced to issue and
sign Exhibits L and E at Kalaw Street, Ermita, Manila because private
complainants Angelino Obiacoro and Domingo Obiacoro would kill him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We find accused-appellant's alibi not convincing.  Such allegations are self-serving.  No evidence of force was represented by
accused-appellant Nimfa Bodozo to bolster her claim that she was forced except
to state that she was afraid of private complainants' anger.  In the case of accused-appellant Joey
Bodozo, it will be noted that the alleged force happened in a busy public
street.  Neither did the
accused-appellants file any case against private complainants for forcing them
to sign and issue said receipts.  At
most, their claim of force may be said to be merely an afterthought to
exculpate themselves from the charges levelled against them by private
complainants.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant denied that she ever recruited private complainants to
work abroad.  Such denial will not
prevail over the positive testimony of private complainants that appellant was
the person who promised them employment abroad, who received money from them as
placement fees, processing fees or terminal fees and required them to submit
such documents as NBI clearance, bio-data, passport, etc.  The undisputable fact was that she gave
private complainants the distinct impression that she had the power or ability
to send people abroad for work so that they were convinced to give her the
money she demanded to enable them to be employed abroad.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, appellant was not able to explain what motivated
private complainants in filing the cases against her.  The absence of evidence as to an improper motive actuating the
principal witnesses of the prosecution strongly tends to sustain no improper
motive existed and their testimony is worthy of full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused-appellant's denial cannot prevail over the positive assertions of
complainants who had no motive to testify falsely against her except to tell
the truth.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The dispositive portion of the lower court's decision must be
modified in accordance with the following guidelines.  Firstly, in the charge of illegal recruitment committed in large
scale or involving economic sabotage, the appealed decision sentenced appellant
"to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment or <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>,
and to pay a fine of P100,000.00 ..." Once again, we point out that the
penalty of <u><span style="">reclusion</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>perpetua</u>, not being synonymous
with life imprisonment, is imposable only on crimes committed under the Revised
Penal Code.  The penalty that attaches
to a violation of Article 38 of the Labor Code, as amended, is life
imprisonment and a fine of One Hundred Thousand Pesos (P100,000.00).<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Secondly, the amounts ordered to be reimbursed to private complainants Ursulito
Manzano and Norberto Cayabyab were those stated in the information, i.e.,
P15,660.00 and P16,770.00, respectively.  However, during the trial, they were able to prove that they incurred
only the amounts of P15,600.00 and P16,720.00, respectively.  Thirdly, other discrepancies with respect to
private complainant Joselito Geronimo are:  the information showed that he paid P7,865.00; the lower court ordered
reimbursement of P7,400.00 while the receipt showed he paid P7,500.00</p>

<p class="BODY">Except for the foregoing modifications, the Court finds every
reason to affirm the rulings of the lower court finding appellant guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the charge of illegal recruitment in large scale or
involving economic sabotage under Article 38 in relation to Article 39 of P.D.
No. 442, as amended by P.D. No. 2018, in Criminal Case No. Q-89-3280 and of
four counts of estafa through false pretenses under Article 315, par. 2(a) of
the Revised Penal Code in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-89-3276, Q-89-3277, Q-89-3278 and
Q-89-3279.  The Court accords great
respect to the factual findings of the lower court.  This applies with greater force to criminal cases which generally
hang on the credibility of witnesses and their testimonies, for it is the trial
court which has the fullest opportunity to observe the demeanor of witnesses as
they testify.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
