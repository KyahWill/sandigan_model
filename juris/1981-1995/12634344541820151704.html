doing business under the name of ‘UY TIAM ENTERPRISES &amp; FREIGHT SERVICES,’
Jacinto Uy Diño and Norberto Uy</i>" and docketed as Civil Case No. 82-9303.  They likewise challenge public respondent's
Resolution of 21 August 1989<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
denying their motion for the reconsideration of the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">The impugned Decision of the respondent Court summarizes the
antecedent facts as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It appears that in 1977, Uy Tiam Enterprises and Freight
Services (hereinafter referred to as UTEFS), thru its representative Uy Tiam,
applied for and obtained credit accommodations (letter of credit and trust
receipt accommodations) from the Metropolitan Bank and Trust Company (hereinafter
referred to as METROBANK) in the sum of P700,000.00 (Original Records, p.
333).  To secure the aforementioned
credit accommodations, Norberto Uy and Jacinto Uy Diño executed separate
Continuing Suretyships (Exhibits "E" and "F" respectively),
dated 25 February 1977, in favor of the latter.  Under the aforesaid agreements, Norberto Uy agreed to pay
METROBANK any indebtedness of UTEFS up to the aggregate sum of P300,000.00
while Jacinto Uy Diño agreed to be bound up to the aggregate sum of P800,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having paid the obligation under the above letter of credit in
1977, UTEFS, through Uy Tiam, obtained another credit accommodation from
METROBANK in 1978, which credit accommodation was fully settled before an
irrevocable letter of credit was applied for and obtained by the abovementioned
business entity in 1979 (September 8, 1987, tsn, pp. 14-15).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Irrevocable Letter of Credit No. SN­-Loc-309, dated March 30,
1979, in the sum of P815,600.00, covered UTEFS’ purchase of '8,000 Bags
Planters Urea and 4,000 Bags Planters 21-0-0.' It was applied for and obtained
by UTEFS without the participation of Norberto Uy and Jacinto Uy Diño as they
did not sign the document denominated as 'Commercial Letter of Credit and
Application.' Also, they were not asked to execute any suretyship to guarantee
its payment.  Neither did METROBANK nor
UTEFS inform them that the 1979 Letter of Credit has been opened and that the
Continuing Suretyships separately executed in February, 1977 shall guarantee
its payment (Appellees' brief, pp. 2-3; Rollo, p. 28).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The 1979 letter of credit (Exhibit "B") <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">was </span>negotiated.  METROBANK paid Planters Products the amount
of P815,600.00 which payment was covered by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">a </span>Bill of Exchange (Exhibit "C"), dated 4 June 1979,
in favor of the former, drawn on and accepted by UTEFS (Original Records, p.
331).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pursuant to the above commercial transaction, UTEFS executed and
delivered to METROBANK a Trust Receipt (Exh. "D"), dated 4 June 1979,
whereby the former acknowledged receipt in trust from the latter of the
aforementioned goods from Planters Products which amounted to P815,600.00.  Being the entrustee, the former agreed to
deliver to METROBANK the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">entrusted </span>goods
in the event of non-sale or, if sold, the proceeds of the sale thereof, on or
before September 2, 1979.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">UTEFS did </span>not
acquiesce to the obligatory <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">stipulations
in </span>the trust receipt.  As a
consequence, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">METROBANK </span>sent
letters to the said principal obligor and its sureties, Norberto Uy and Jacinto
Uy Diño, demanding payment of the amount due.  Informed of the amount due, UTEFS made partial payments to the Bank
which were accepted by the latter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answering one of the demand letters, Diño, thru counsel, denied his
liability for the amount demanded and requested METROBANK to send him copies of
documents showing the source of his liability.  In its reply, the bank informed him that the source of his liability is
the Continuing Suretyship which he executed on February 25, 1977.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a rejoinder, Diño maintained that he cannot be held liable for
the 1979 credit accommodation because it is a new obligation contracted without
his participation.  Besides, the 1977
credit accommodation which he guaranteed has been fully paid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having sent the last demand letter to UTEFS, Diño and Uy and
finding resort to extrajudicial remedies to be futile, METROBANK filed a
complaint for collection of a sum of money (P613,339.32, as of January 31,
1982, inclusive of interest, commission penalty and bank charges) with a prayer
for the issuance of a writ of preliminary attachment, against Uy Tiam,
representative of UTEFS and impleaded Diño and Uy as parties-defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">an </span>order,
dated 29 July 1983, granting the attachment writ, which writ was returned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">unserved </span>and unsatisfied as defendant
Uy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Tiam was </span>nowhere to be found
at his given address and his commercial enterprise was already non-operational
(Original Records, p. 37).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 11, 1984, Norberto Uy and Jacinto Uy Diño
(sureties-defendants herein) filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on the
ground of lack of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">cause </span>of
action.  They maintained that the
obligation which they guaranteed in 1977 has been extinguished since it has
already been paid in the same year.  Accordingly, the Continuing Suretyships executed in 1977 cannot be
availed of to secure Uy Tiam's Letter of Credit obtained in 1979 because a
guaranty cannot exist without a valid obligation.  It was further argued that they can not be held liable for the
obligation contracted in 1979 because they are not privies thereto as it was
contracted without their participation (Records, pp. 42-46).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 24, 1984, METROBANK filed its opposition to the motion to
dismiss.  Invoking the terms and
conditions embodied in the comprehensive suretyships separately executed by
sureties-defendants, the bank argued that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">sureties-movants
</span>bound themselves as solidary obligors of defendant Uy Tiam to both
existing obligations and future ones.  It relied on Article 2053 of the new Civil Code which provides:  'A guaranty may also be given as security
for future debts, the amount of which is not yet known; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">x x x.' </span>It was further asserted that the agreement was in full
force and effect at the time the letter of credit was obtained in 1979 as
sureties-defendants did not exercise their right to revoke it by giving notice
to the bank.  (Ibid., pp. 51-54).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, the resolution of the aforecited motion to dismiss was
held in abeyance pending the introduction of evidence by the parties as per
order dated February 21, 1986 (Ibid., p. 71).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Having been granted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a </span>period
of fifteen (15) days from receipt of the order dated March 7, 1986 within which
to file the answer, sureties-defendants filed their responsive pleading which
merely rehashed the arguments in their motion to dismiss and maintained that
they are entitled to the benefit of excussion (Original Records, pp. 88-93).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On February 23, 1987, plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint against defendant Uy Tiam on the ground that it has no information as
to the heirs or legal representatives of the latter who died sometime in
December, 1986, which motion was granted on the following day (Ibid., pp. 180­-182).</blockquote>

<blockquote>After trial, x x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x </span>the
court a quo, on December 2, 1987, rendered its judgment, a portion of which
reads:</blockquote>

<p class="3Q">'The evidence and the pleadings, thus, pose the querry (sic):</p>

<p class="3Q">'Are the defendants Jacinto Uy Diño and Norberto Uy liable for the
obligation contracted by Uy Tiam under the Letter of Credit (Exh. B) issued on
March 30, 1979 by virtue of the Continuing Suretyships they executed on
February 25, 1977?</p>

executed the continuing suretyships, exhibits E and F, on February 25, 1977, Uy
Tiam was obligated to the plaintiff in the amount of P700,000.00 -- and this
was the obligation which both defendants guaranteed to pay.  Uy Tiam paid this 1977 obligation -- and
such payment extinguished the obligation they assumed as guarantors/sureties.</p>

Credit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(Exh. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">B) </span>is different from the 1977 Letter
of Credit which covered the 1977 account of Uy Tiam.  Thus, the obligation under either is apart and distinct from the
obligation created in the other -- as evidenced by the fact that Uy Tiam had to
apply anew for the 1979 transaction (Exh. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">A).  </span>And Diño and Uy, being strangers
thereto, cannot be answerable thereunder.</p>

serve notice to the defendants Diño and Uy when it extended to Uy Tiam the 1979

secure the 1979 transaction of Uy Tiam.</p>

thereon -- ­that they are thereby securing all future obligations which Uy Tiam
may contract with the plaintiff.  On the
contrary, Diño and Uy categorically testified that they signed the blank forms
in the office of Uy Tiam at 623 Asuncion Street, Binondo, Manila, in obedience
to the instruction of Uy Tiam, their former employer.  They denied having gone to the office of the plaintiff to
subscribe to the documents (October 1, 1987, tsn, pp. 5-7, 14; October 15, 1987,
tsn, pp. 3-8, 13-16).' (Records, pp. 333-334).’"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In ruling for the herein private respondent (hereinafter
METROBANK), public respondent held that the Continuing Suretyship Agreements
separately executed by the petitioners in 1977 were intended to guarantee
payment of Uy Tiam's outstanding as well as future obligations; each suretyship
arrangement was intended to remain in full force and effect until METROBANK
would have been notified of its revocation.  Since no such notice was given by the petitioners, the suretyships are
deemed outstanding and hence, cover even the 1979 letter of credit issued by
METROBANK in favor of Uy Tiam.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed a motion to reconsider the foregoing
Decision.  They questioned the public
respondent's construction of the suretyship agreements and its ruling with
respect to the extent of their liability thereunder.  They argued that even if the agreements were in full force and
effect when METROBANK granted Uy Tiam's application for a letter of credit in
1979, the public respondent nonetheless seriously erred in holding them liable
for an amount over and above their respective face values.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Resolution of 21 August 1989, public respondent denied the
motion:</p>

<p class="2Q">"x x x considering that the issues raised were substantially
the same grounds utilized by the lower court in rendering judgment for

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition which hinges on the issue of whether
or not the petitioners may be held liable as sureties for the obligation
contracted by Uy Tiam with METROBANK on 30 May 1979 under and by virtue of the
Continuing Suretyship Agreements signed on 25 February 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners vehemently deny such liability on the ground that the
Continuing Suretyship Agreements were automatically extinguished upon payment
of the principal obligation secured thereby, <i>i.e.</i>, the letter of credit
obtained by Uy Tiam in 1977.  They
further claim that they were not advised by either METROBANK or Uy Tiam that
the Continuing Suretyship Agreements would stand as security for the 1979
obligation.  Moreover, it is posited
that to extend the application of such agreements to the 1979 obligation would
amount to a violation of Article 2052 of the Civil Code which expressly
provides that a guaranty cannot exist without a valid obligation.  Petitioners further argue that even
granting, for the sake of argument, that the Continuing Suretyship Agreements
still subsisted and thereby also secured the 1979 obligations incurred by Uy
Tiam, they cannot be held liable for more than what they guaranteed to pay
because it is axiomatic that the obligations of a surety cannot extend beyond
what is stipulated in the agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 12 February 1990, this Court resolved to give due course to
the petition after considering the allegations, issues and arguments adduced
therein, the Comment thereon by the private respondent and the Reply thereto by
the petitioners; the parties were required to submit their respective

what is the extent of their liabilities for said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Under the Civil Code, a guaranty may be given to secure even
future debts, the amount of which may not be known at the time the guaranty is
executed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
This is the basis for contracts denominated as a continuing guaranty or
suretyship.  A continuing guaranty is
one which is not limited to a single transaction, but which contemplates a
future course of dealing, covering a series of transactions, generally for an
indefinite time or until revoked.  It is
prospective in its operation and is generally intended to provide security with
respect to future transactions within certain limits, and contemplates a
succession of liabilities, for which, as they accrue, the guarantor becomes
liable.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Otherwise stated, a continuing guaranty is one which covers all transactions,
including those arising in the future, which are within the description or
contemplation of the contract of guaranty, until the expiration or termination
thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
A guaranty shall be construed as continuing when by the terms thereof it is
evident that the object is to give a standing credit to the principal debtor to
be used from time to time either indefinitely or until a certain period,
especially if the right to recall the guaranty is expressly reserved.  Hence, where the contract of guaranty states
that the same is to secure advances to be made "from time to time"
the guaranty will be construed to be a continuing one.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In other jurisdictions, it has been held that the use of
particular words and expressions such as payment of "any debt,"
"any indebtedness," "any deficiency," or "any
sum," or the guaranty of "any transaction" or money to be
furnished the principal debtor "at any time," or "on such
time" that the principal debtor may require, have been construed to
indicate a continuing guaranty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing stipulations unequivocally reveal that the
suretyship agreements in the case at bar are continuing in nature.  Petitioners do not deny this; in fact, they
candidly admitted it.  Neither have they
denied the fact that they had not revoked the suretyship agreements.  Accordingly, as correctly held by the public
respondent:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Undoubtedly, the purpose of the execution of the Continuing
Suretyships was to induce appellant to grant any application for credit
accommodation (letter of credit/trust receipt) UTEFS may desire to obtain from
appellant bank.  By its terms, each
suretyship is a continuing one which shall remain in full force and effect
until the bank is notified of its revocation.</p>

from appellant bank, for the purpose of obtaining goods (covered by a trust
receipt) from Planters Products, the continuing suretyships were in full force
and effect.  Hence, even if
sureties-appellees did not sign the 'Commercial Letter of Credit and
Application, they are still liable as the credit accommodation (letter of
credit/trust receipt) was covered by the said suretyships.  What makes them liable thereunder is the
condition which provides that the Borrower <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

otherwise.' And since UTEFS which (sic) was liable as principal obligor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>having failed to fulfill the

obligation, are liable thereunder."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:23.4pt">Petitioners maintain, however, that
their Continuing Suretyship Agreements cannot be made applicable to the 1979
obligation because the latter was not yet in existence when the agreements were
executed in 1977; under Article 2052 of the Civil Code, a guaranty "cannot
exist without a valid obligation." We cannot agree.  First of all, the succeeding article
provides that "[a] guaranty may also be given as security for future
debts, the amount of which is not yet known." Secondly, Article 2052
speaks about a <u>valid</u> <u>obligation</u>, as distinguished from a <u>void</u>
<u>obligation</u>, and not an <u>existing</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">or</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><u>current</u>
<u>obligation</u>.  This distinction is
made clearer in the second paragraph of Article 2052 which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Nevertheless, a guaranty may be constituted to guarantee the
performance of a voidable or an unenforceable contract.  It may also guarantee a natural
obligation."</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:23.4pt">As to the amount of their liability
under the Continuing Suretyship Agreements, petitioners contend that the public
respondent gravely erred in finding them liable for more than the amount
specified in their respective agreements, to wit:  (a) P800,000.00 for petitioner Diño and (b) P300,000.00 for
petitioner Uy.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:23.4pt">The limit of the petitioners'
respective liabilities must be determined from the suretyship agreement each
had signed.  It is undoubtedly true that
the law looks upon the contract of suretyship with a jealous eye, and the rule
is settled that the obligation of the surety cannot be extended by implication
beyond its specified limits.  To the
extent, and in the manner, and under the circumstances pointed out in his
obligation, he is bound, and no farther.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:23.4pt">Indeed, the Continuing Suretyship
Agreements signed by petitioner Diño and petitioner Uy fix the aggregate amount
of their liability, at any given time, at P800,000.00 and P300,000.00,
respectively.  The law is clear that a
guarantor may bind himself for less, but not for more than the principal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">debtor, both as regards the amount and the
onerous nature of the conditions.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> In the case at bar, both agreements provide

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:23.4pt">They further provide that:</p>

<p class="2Q">"In the event of judicial proceedings being instituted by the
BANK against the SURETY to enforce any of the terms and conditions of this
undertaking, the SURETY further agrees to pay the BANK a reasonable
compensation for and as attorney's fees and costs of collection, which shall
not in any event be less than ten per cent (10%) of the amount due (the same to
be due and payable irrespective of whether the case is settled judicially or
extrajudicially)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, by express mandate of the
Continuing Suretyship Agreements which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">they
</span>had signed, petitioners separately bound themselves to pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">interests, </span>expenses, attorney's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">fees </span>and costs.  The last two items are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pegged at </span>not less than ten percent
(10%) of the amount due.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:23.4pt">Even without such stipulations, the
petitioners would, nevertheless, be liable for the interest and judicial
costs.  Article 2055 of the Civil Code
provides:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="2Q">"ART. 2055.  A guaranty
is not presumed; it must be express and cannot extend to more than what is
stipulated therein.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If it be simple or
indefinite, it shall comprise not only the principal obligation, but also all
its accessories, including the judicial costs, provided with respect to the
latter, that the guarantor shall only be liable for those costs incurred after
he has been judicially required to pay."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

term <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">accessories</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.  </span>However,
such interest should run only from the date when the complaint was filed in
court.  Even attorney's fees may be
imposed whenever appropriate, pursuant to Article 2208 of the Civil Code.  Thus, in <i>Plaridel Surety &amp; Insurance
Co., Inc. vs. P. L. Galang Machinery Co., Inc.,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Petitioner objects to the payment of interest and attorney's
fees because:  (1) they were not
mentioned in the bond; and (2) the surety would become liable for <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">more than the amount </span></i>stated in the
contract of suretyship.</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">The objection has to be overruled, because as far back as the year
1922 this Court held in Tagawa <i>vs.</i> Aldanese, 43 Phil. 852, that
creditors suing on a suretyship bond may recover from the surety as part of
their damages, interest at the legal rate even if the surety would thereby
become liable to pay more than the total amount stipulated in the bond.  'The theory is that interest is allowed only
by way of damages for delay upon the part of the sureties in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">making payment </span>after they should have
done so.  In some states, the interest
has been charged from the date of the judgment of the appellate court.  In this jurisdiction, we rather prefer to
follow the general practice, which is to order that interest begin to run from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>date when the complaint was filed
in court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x x.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Such theory aligned with sec. 510 of the Code of Civil Procedure
which was subsequently recognized in the Rules of Court (Rule 53, section 6)
and with Article 1108 of the Civil Code (now Art. 2209 of the New Civil Code).</p>

<p class="2Q">In other words the surety is made to pay interest, not by reason of
the contract, but by reason of its failure to pay when demanded and for having
compelled the plaintiff to resort to the courts to obtain payment.  It should be observed that interest does not
run from the time the obligation became due, but from the <i>filing</i> of the
complaint.</p>

<p class="2Q">As to attorney's fees.  Before the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">enactment </span>of
the New Civil Code, successful litigants could not recover attorney's fees as
part of the damages they suffered by reason of the litigation.  Even if the party paid thousands of pesos to
his lawyers, he could not charge the amount to his opponent (Tan Ti <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">vs. </span>Alvear, 26 Phil. 566).</p>

<p class="2Q">However the New <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Civil </span>Code
permits recovery of attorney's fees in eleven cases enumerated in Article 2208,
among them, 'where the court deems it just and equitable that attorny's (sic)
fees and expenses of litigation should be recovered' or 'when the defendant
acted in gross and evident bad faith <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in
</span>refusing to satisfy the plaintiff's plainly valid, just and demandable
claim'.  This gives the courts
discretion in apportioning attorney's fees."</p>

<p class="BODY">The records do not reveal the exact amount of the unpaid portion
of the principal obligation of Uy Tiam to METROBANK under Irrevocable Letter of
Credit No. SN-Loc-309 dated 30 March 1979.  In referring to the last demand letter to Mr. Uy Tiam and the complaint
filed in Civil Case No. 82-9303, the public respondent mentions the amount of
"P613,339.32, as of January 31, 1982, inclusive of interest commission penalty
and bank charges."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> This

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Since the complaint was filed on 18 May
1982, it is obvious that on that date, the outstanding principal obligation of
Uy Tiam, secured by the petitioners' Continuing Suretyship Agreements, was less
than P613,339.32.  Such amount may be
fully covered by the Continuing Suretyship Agreement executed by petitioner
Diño which stipulates an aggregate principal sum of not exceeding P800,000.00,
and partly covered by that of petitioner Uy which pegs his maximum liability at
P300,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the judgment of the public respondent shall have to
be modified to conform to the foregoing exposition, to which extent the instant
petition is impressed with partial merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is partly GRANTED, but only
insofar as the challenged decision has to be modified with respect to the
extent of petitioners' liability.  As
modified, petitioners JACINTO UY DIÑO and NORBERTO UY are hereby declared liable
for and are ordered to pay, up to the maximum limit only of their respective
Continuing Suretyship Agreement, the remaining unpaid balance of the principal
obligation of UY TIAM or UY TIAM ENTERPRISES &amp; FREIGHT SERVICES under
Irrevocable Letter of Credit No. SN-Loc-309, dated 30 March 1979, together with
the interest due thereon at the legal rate commencing from the date of the
filing of the complaint in Civil Case No. 82-9303 with Branch 45 of the
Regional Trial Court of Manila, as well as the adjudged attorney's fees and
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">All other dispositions in the dispositive portion of the
challenged decision not inconsistent with the above are affirmed.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>
