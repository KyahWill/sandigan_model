the case are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1965</st1:date>,
a petition was filed by the Associacion Benevola de Cebu, Inc. before the Court
of First Instance of Cebu (Land Registration Case No. N-633) praying that a
parcel of land situated in <st1:place><st1:placename>Cebu</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
specifically <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 108 of the Banilad Estate, <span class="GramE">be</span> registered in its name.</p>

the <span class="GramE">court,</span> entered an order of general default as
against the whole world, except for the several groups of oppositors who filed
their opposition to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 22, 1966, or more than one month after the order of
general default was entered, the court received a letter from the Solicitor
General, accompanied by a mimeographed opposition of the Director of
Lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There also appears in the records
of the case, a copy of the letter of the Solicitor General to the Provincial
Fiscal of Cebu requesting the latter to represent the Office of the Solicitor
General at the hearing of the registration case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">appears that the Provincial Fiscal of Cebu never entered his appearance
for the government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On October 29, 1973, the
court rendered a partial decision awarding to the applicant Associacion
Benevola de Cebu Lots 108-C and 108-D, and to oppositor Engracia Urot the
ownership of Lots 108-F, 108-I, 108-Â­G, 108-H-I and 108-B-I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the remaining portion of the land subject matter of the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court further declared the other
oppositors-claimants Victorino Vda. de Ramos, Sebastian Yap, Ana Dondoyano,
Osmundo Novela, Melchor Novela, Pablo Enolpe, Alfonso Londres and Juanita
Herico owners of their family houses erected on the respective lots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claims of the rest of the oppositors were
ordered dismissed for lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Not satisfied with the
decision of the land registration court, the oppositors-appellants Pablo
Enolpe, <span class="GramE">et</span>. al., appealed the decision to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">March 30, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision
which states, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This may well explain the government's disinterest to pursue
the case after filing an initial opposition to the petition for registration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, in the absence of any
gross or patent error committed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in the
appreciation of the evidence submitted, <span class="GramE">We</span> can only

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the appealed decision supported by law and

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid decision of the Court of Appeals was elevated on
appeal to this Court thru a Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> by appellants
Pablo Enolpe, et al. in G.R. No. 67692, entitled "Pablo Enolpe, et al. v.
Intermediate Appellate Court, et al<span class="GramE">.."</span> In a
Resolution dated <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1984</st1:date>,
in said case, this Court denied the petition for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision became final and executory as
per entry of judgment dated <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="9">September
 14, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1985</st1:date>,
the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> granted the issuance of a writ of possession in
favor of the Guivelondo heirs, and ordered the Provincial Sheriff of <st1:place>Cebu</st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1985</st1:date> to
proceed with the writ of possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, other oppositors to the registration case in the
trial court filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with this
Supreme Court, docketed as G.R. No. 72568, entitled, "Monena Almendras, <span class="GramE">et</span> al. v. Judge Ramon AM. <span class="GramE">Torres, etc., et
al."</span> This Court required the respondent Guivelondo heirs, who were
among the awardees of the land in the trial court, to file their comment on the
petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1986</st1:date>, this Court dismissed the
petition for lack of merit in view of the previous denial of a similar petition
in G.R. No. 67692.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1986</st1:date>,
the trial court ordered the Land Registration Commission to issue the decrees
of registration and the certificates of title to private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that such documents have
not yet been issued to private respondents at present.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1986</st1:date>,
the Office of the Solicitor General was furnished by the Branch Clerk of Court,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1986</st1:date>,
the Solicitor General filed a notice of appeal with the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was opposed by private respondents and
the Guivelondo heirs, who were among the adjudicatees in the registration case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1986</st1:date>,
the respondent judge issued an Order denying the government's appeal, the
dispositive portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding that the decisions of the court sought to
be appealed from have long become final and executory, and in fact, have
already been executed, and, therefore, are no longer subject to any appeal, the
court hereby declares that the Notice of Appeal filed by the Solicitor General
cannot and should not be given due course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the same is hereby ordered disregarded and stricken out
from the records.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED" (pp. 35-36, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Rollo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">From these orders, the Solicitor General moved to
reconsider.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1987</st1:date>, respondent judge denied the
said motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1987</st1:date>,
this petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 was filed, assailing
respondent judge's Orders dated <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1986</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="1">January 20,
 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1987</st1:date>, this Court issued
a Temporary Restraining Order enjoining the respondent judge from executing the
said decisions and/or from taking further proceedings thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is
</span>whether or not respondent judge acted with grave abuse of discretion in
disallowing the appeal of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The government thru the Solicitor General alleges that its appeal
on July 16, 1986 was filed on time, which is within the prescribed period of
fifteen (15) days from its receipt of the copies of the decisions; and that
insofar as the government is concerned, the decisions have not yet become final
and executory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition also argues
that the property in question is public land and therefore, substantial justice
requires that such appeal be allowed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing contentions of the petitioner are impressed with
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 39 of BP Blg. 129 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 39.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Appeals.</span> - The
period for appeal from final orders, resolutions, awards, judgments or
decisions of any court in all cases shall be fifteen (15) days <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">counted</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> </span><u>from</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">notice</span></u> of the final order, resolution, award, judgment or
decision appealed from; x x x.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis
ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that it was only on <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1986</st1:date> or more than ten (10) years from the
date of judgments that the Solicitor General became cognizant of the decisions
of the lower court when it was furnished by the Branch Clerk of Court copies of
the two decisions dated <st1:date year="1973" day="29" month="10">October 29,
 1973</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1975" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact was not denied nor refuted by
respondents herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when the
Solicitor General filed its notice of appeal on <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1986</st1:date>, the appeal was perfected well within the
fifteen (15)-day mandatory period to file an appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Sec. 23 of the Interim Rules of Court provides that in
"case where appeal is taken, the perfection of the appeal shall be upon
the expiration of the last day to appeal by any party." As long as any of
the parties may still file his, her, or its appeal, the court does not lose
jurisdiction over the case (Associated Bank v. Gonong, G.R. No. 77353, July 30,
1987, 152 SCRA 478).</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents contend that appeal is no longer possible as the
judgments appealed from, having been rendered more than ten (10) years ago, are
already final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that a judgment becomes final and executory by
operation of law and not by judicial declaration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, finality of judgment becomes a fact
upon the lapse of the reglementary period of appeal if no appeal is perfected
(Munez v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-46010, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="7"><span class="GramE">July 23, 1987</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 152 SCRA 197).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
ever there was an entry <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>judgment
in this case dated September 14, 1984, this had the effect of finally disposing
and putting an end to the controversy with regard to the private respondents
herein as among themselves and not insofar as the government's interest on the
land is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to it, the
judgments have not yet attained finality because its appeal was perfected on
time, before the lapse of the period within which to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also worthy to note at this point that the adjudication of
the land in a registration or cadastral case does not become final and
incontrovertible until the expiration of one year after the entry of the final
decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>As</u> <u>long</u> <u>as</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">the</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
21.0pt"> </span><u>final</u> <u>decree</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u> <u>issued</u>,
and the one year within which it may be revised has not elapsed, the decision
remains under the control and sound discretion of the court rendering the
decree, which court after hearing, may set aside the decision or decree or
adjudicate the land to another party (Afalla v. Rosauro, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-42315, </span><st1:date year="1934" day="19" month="9"><span class="GramE">Sept. 19, 1934</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 60 Phil. 622;

<p class="BODY">The argument of respondents that the appeal should not be allowed
because the judgments granting the registration have already been executed thru
the writ of possession and the order for the issuance of the title, has no
legal basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the
case of Republic v. Mendoza, GR. No.</span> L-49891, October 31, 1983, 125 SCRA
539, We ordered the land registration court to give due course to the appeal of
the government notwithstanding the fact that a decree of registration was
already issued by the Land Registration Commission and a Certificate of Title
was issued by the Register of Deeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such circumstances were not considered to be a bar to the government's
right to appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his order denying the appeal, the respondent judge pointed out
that an order of general default which was issued in the initial hearing of the
registration case, barred all other persons including the government from
pursuing their claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is established that in land registration cases, the
appellant must show that his rights or interests have been prejudiced by the
decision appealed from; and that he challenged the application for
registration, or participated in the proceedings before his appeal may be
properly entertained (Cabanas v. Director of Lands, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-4205,
</span><st1:date year="1908" day="16" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 16,
 1908</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 10 Phil. 393).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This has been complied with in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Records<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>disclose, and this
is admitted by respondent judge in his order, that there was a written
opposition from the government thru the Solicitor General and the Director of
Lands (p. 33, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Although
this was received by the trial court one month after the order of general
default was entered, there was no evidence showing when the opposition by the
government was filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of
such evidence, it is presumed that the opposition was filed on time and was not
covered by the order of general default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear that the government has challenged the application for
registration since the very start of the proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming <u>in</u> g<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ratia</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <u>argumenti</u> </span>that the opposition

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the private respondents also argue in their Comment
that the Provincial Fiscal which represents the Office of the Solicitor General
in land registration cases, had official <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">notice
</span>of the decisions as early as May 28, 1985 when the Asst. Provincial
Fiscal filed a "Manifestation/Omnibus Motion" in court whereby she

<p class="BODY">Thus, the request of the Solicitor General for the fiscal to
represent the former and to appeal did not make the fiscal counsel of the
Republic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have held in many cases
that the reglementary thirty-day period for appeal (now 15 days) should be
reckoned from the time the Solicitor General's Office was <span class="GramE">apprised</span>
of the decision or order and not from the time the special counsel or fiscal
was served with the decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These
representatives of the Solicitor General had no power to decide whether an
appeal should be made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They should have
referred the matter to the Solicitor General (Republic v. Court of Appeals,

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the admission of petitioner government's appeal is more
in keeping with the ends of substantial justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To dismiss the Republic's appeal merely on
the alleged ground of late filing is not proper considering the merits of the
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General alleges
the existence of indubitable evidence of official records showing that the
property subject of the registration is public land, which was covered by
decree 4666 previously issued in favor of the government on <st1:date year="1910" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1910</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To ignore the importance of this alleged
document would defeat the time-honored Constitutional precepts and the Regalian
doctrine that all lands of the public domain belong to the State, and that the
State is the source of any asserted right to ownership in land and charged with
the conservation of such patrimony (Republic v. Intermediate Appellate Court,
G.R. No. 71285, November 5, 1987, 155 SCRA 412).</p>
