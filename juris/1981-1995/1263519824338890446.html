but a man-made creek.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Provincial
Commander however, made it clear to the plaintiffs that the building will be
demolished, but later reconsidered to delay the demolition and called instead,
another meeting of the Ad Hoc Committee, which met on September 18, but
postponed to September 20, 1975, when the plaintiffs, through their counsel,
pre­sented their evidence before the committee and argued that plaintiffs'
building could not be legally demolished for lack of clearance from the PAHRA,
and that clearance could not be validly issued because the body of water
abutting the building is man-made creek not a creek within the meaning of
Presiden­tial Decree 296, and Instruction No. 19.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To bolster <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

order of demolition, the Ad Hoc Committee took into consideration the
revocation on June 15, 1968, of the building permit granted the plaintiff on
May 24, 1968, on the ground that a portion of the building then under

took into consideration the petition of Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>
together with others, with the military authorities (Annex 7), which prompted
the holding of an ocular inspection and the submission of the report by the
Provincial Commander with the Secretary of National Defense (Annex 7), and on
the basis of which the Secretary rendered a decision, the last paragraph of
which reads:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'It is significant to note that the appealed judgment rendered by
the trial court in the present action for prohibition with preliminary injunction,

</span>And more the acts against which the injunction is to be directed cannot
be considered in relation to any right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, when the respondent City Mayor issued the order
decreeing the removal of construction, buildings, structures over public
properties, or along streams etc., he was merely implementing the Letter of
Instructions No. 19 of the President enjoining the public officials concerned
to remove all illegal constructions or buildings on or along <span class="SpellE">esteros</span> and river banks for the protection of public
health, safety and peace and order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering the very aim and purpose of Letter of Instruction No. 19 of
the President, we are prepared not to put up a barrier in form of a restraining
order to the imple­mentation of the aforesaid Letter of Instruction (pp. 3, 4,
and 5, Annex 15).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The facts further show that defendant City Mayor, upon being
officially informed of the resolution of the Court of Appeals on September 28,
1973 sought the City <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span> legal opinion on his
next course of action, and on the basis of said opinion, (Annex 17), defendant
Mayor wrote a demand letter to plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Gaudencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mabutol</span>, (Annex 16), to remove his building within thirty
(30) days from receipt thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Mabutol</span>, instead of objecting to the
demand, or availing of any judicial remedies with the courts or other
administrative or executive authorities to enjoin the Mayor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">from carrying out his order to demolish,
wrote in reply that he be given a period of fifteen (15) days extension within
which to undertake personally the demolition (Annex 20).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further wrote that -</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'My inability to demolish the building within the period granted me
was not a sign of defiance to your orders or the lawful order of the Court but
because of lack of funds to finance the demolition.' (Annex 20).</p>

extension sought for was promptly </span>granted (Annex 21), but plaintiffs'
offer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>undertake the

defendants are deemed to have admitted for purposes of the motion to dismiss
and motion for reconsideration (Lim vs. <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Santos,
8 SCRA, 798), pose the issues as to whether (a) defendants ordered the
demolition in their official capacities as members of the Ad Hoc Committee, (b)
acted in bad faith and abuse of authority, (c) as to whether they are possessed
with a corporate power to sue or be sued, (d) whether defendants acted without
authority when it caused the demolition of the building without prior clearance
from the PAHRA.</blockquote>

complaint further alleged, (par. 6), that defendant Mayor, as Chairman of the
Ad Hoc Committee, notified the plaintiffs of the intended demolition fifteen
(15) days after notice thereof which falls on September 18, 1975, (par. 7;
Complaint).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The authority and power of
the Ad Hoc Committee to implement the law, that is, to order the demolition was
indeed acknowledged and recognized by the plaintiffs when they appeared, by
themselves and counsel, first, before the Provincial Commander as Co-Chairman,
(par. 7, Complaint) and later, before the committee itself, (par. 10 to 19,
Complaint).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court, out of plaintiffs' own admission in their
complaint, therefore, finds that the order of demolition was issued by the
defendants in their official capacities as members of the Ad Hoc
Committee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is supported by the
Committee's resolutions of September 2, 1975 (Annex 28), and its resolution of
September 20, 1975 (Annex 20).</blockquote>

which plaintiff already deposited P9,000.00 with the City Treasurer's Office in
