of National Defense Juan Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> on <st1:date month="1" day="2" year="1974">January 2, 1974</st1:date>, by Ramona L. <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>

Attorney Benito <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>, Sr., charging him with
deceit, malpractice, and professional infidelity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was referred to this Court on <st1:date month="2" day="5" year="1974">February 5, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the complainants had submitted the required number of
copies of their complaint, the respondent was ordered to file his answer

 1974</st1:date>, the Court referred the complaint to the Solicitor General <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for </span>investigation report and
recommendation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="2" day="2" year="1990">February 2, 1990</st1:date>, or after sixteen (16) years,
the Solicitor General submitted his report to the Court, together with the
transcripts of stenographic notes taken at the investigation and folders of
exhibits submitted by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case, as found by the Solicitor General, are the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 16, 1970, Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> engaged
respondent Attorney Benito <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>, Sr., as his
counsel to commence an action to recover his share of the estate of the
deceased spouses Catalina Sales and <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> <span class="SpellE">Gozuma</span> which had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">been
</span>adjudicated to him under the judgment dated <st1:date month="4" day="29" year="1961">April 29, 1961</st1:date> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, in Civil Case No. 4963, because <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> failed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">file
</span>a motion for execution of the judgment in his favor within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> five-year period (Sec. 6, Rule 39, Rules of
Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The salient provisions of the
Contract for Professional Services (Exhibit A) between <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>
and Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span> were the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>That respondent will
decide whether or not to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>file a
suit for the recovery of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span> share or
claim;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>That respondent will
shoulder all expenses of litigations; and</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>As attorney's fees,
respondent will be paid fifty per cent (50%) of the value of the property
recovered.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">On </span><st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1970">April 18, 1970</st1:date>, respondent prepared a
complaint for revival of the judgment in Civil Case No. 4963 but filed it only
on <st1:date month="9" day="12" year="1970">September 12, 1970</st1:date> or
five (5) months later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was docketed
as Civil Case No. 9559, entitled: "Ramon S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Sales, in his own capacity and as Judicial
Administrator of the deceased Pedro Sales." The complaint was signed by
respondent alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, no sooner had
he filed the complaint than he withdrew it and filed in its stead (on the same
day and in the same case) a second complaint dated August 31, 1970, with Ramon
S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> as the lone plaintiff, praying for the same
relief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> were excluded as plaintiffs and were <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> as defendants instead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attorneys Bernardo B. Pablo and Benito <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>, Sr. (herein respondent) signed as counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 8, 1971, an <u>amended</u> complaint was filed
wherein the plaintiffs were: Ramon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">S. </span><span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>, assisted by his judicial guardian, Norberto S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>, and eight (8) others, namely: <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>, Ramona <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>,
Evangeline, <span class="SpellE">Teotimo</span>, Jr., Reynaldo, Elizabeth and <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>, all surnamed <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amended complaint was signed by Attorney
Bernardo B. Pablo alone as counsel of the plaintiffs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1973</st1:date>,
defendant <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Sales filed a Motion to <span class="GramE">Dismiss</span> the complaint on the ground that the action for
revival of judgment in Civil Case No. 4963 had already prescribed (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 21).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs
filed an Opposition to the Motion to Dismiss (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
22).</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 3, 1973, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental dismissed the complaint on the ground of
prescription as the judgment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>Civil
Case No. 4963 became final on May 30, 1961 yet, and, although a complaint for
revival of said judgment was filed by Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> on
September 12, 1970, before the ten-year prescriptive period expired, that
complaint was null and void for Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> was
insane, hence, incompetent and without legal capacity to sue when he instituted
the action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent filing of an
Amended Complaint on <st1:date month="12" day="8" year="1972">December 8, 1972</st1:date>,
after the statutory limitation period had expired, was too late to save the
plaintiff's right of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
nothing more was done by any of the parties in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="2" year="1974">January 2, 1974</st1:date>,
the complainants charged respondent Attorney Benito <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>,
Sr. with having deliberately caused the dismissal of Civil Case No. 9559 and
with having concealed from them the material fact that he had been the former
legal counsel of <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Sales, their adversary in
the probate proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent
filed a general denial of the charges against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Ramon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> </span>engaged the services of Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span> to enforce the decision in Civil Case No. 4963, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>decision was already nine (9)
years old, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">hence, it </span>could no
longer be executed by mere motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec.
6, Rule 39, Rules of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainants had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only </span>about
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>year left within which to
enforce the judgment by an independent action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Ramon </span><span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> was already insane or incompetent when he hired
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span> to file Civil Case No. 9559 for
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>
concealed from <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> the fact that he (Atty. <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>) had been the former counsel of <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Sales in the probate proceedings where <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> and Sales had litigated over their shares of the
inheritance.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, according to Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>,
it was only on <st1:date month="10" day="6" year="1972">October 6, 1972</st1:date>,
when Civil Case No. 9559 was called <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for
</span>pre-trial, that he discovered his previous professional relationship
with Sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time, the ten-year
prescriptive period for revival of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">judgment
</span>in favor of <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> had already expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He thereupon asked <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span>
permission to allow him (<span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>) to withdraw from
the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also informed the court
about his untenable position and requested that he be allowed to retire <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
request was granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his report to the Court, the Solicitor General made the
following observations:</p>

<blockquote>"Evident from the foregoing is the fact that in handling the
case for Ramon S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> which eventually led to its
dismissal, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">respondent </span>committed
several errors, among which are:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>He did not verify the real status of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> before filing the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, his lack of capacity to sue would
not have been at issue.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>He postponed the motion to revive judgment and
gave way instead to a motion to resolve pending incidents in Civil Case
4963.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In doing so, he frittered away
precious time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>He dropped Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span>
co-plaintiffs and <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> them as defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the complaint would have been
defective only in part.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Had not respondent committed the above mistakes, Civil Case
No. 9559 in all probability would not have been dismissed on the ground of
prescription." <span class="GramE">(pp. 9-10, Solicitor General's Report.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the Solicitor General does not believe that Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon's</span> mistakes in handling <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span>
case were deliberate or made with malice aforethought because there is no
"proof of collusion or conspiracy between respondent and those who would
benefit from the dismissal of Civil Case No. 9559 x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> and that, on the other hand, respondent stood to
gain substantially (50% of the amount recovered) if he had succeeded in having
the judgment revived and executed" (pp. 10-11, Solicitor General's
Report), still those errors are so gross and glaring that they could not have
resulted from mere negligence or lack of due care.</p>

<p class="BODY">Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon's</span> pretense that he
did not know before the pretrial that the Sales defendants had been his clients
in the past, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>unbelievable
because:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Before he filed the complaint for revival of
judgment, he had had several interviews with Ramon S. <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span>
and Norberto <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> regarding Civil Case No. 4963.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>He must have done some research on the court
records of Civil Case No. 4963, so he could not have overlooked his own
participation in that case as counsel for <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
Sales, et al.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>To prepare the complaint for revival of
judgment (Civil Case No. 9559), he had to inform himself about the personal
circumstances of the defendants-<span class="SpellE">Carlito</span> Sales, et
al.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that they had been his
clients could not have eluded him.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of his former association with the <span class="SpellE">Saleses</span>,
Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>, as a dutiful lawyer, should have
declined the employment proffered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">by </span><span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> on the ground of conflict of interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had he done that soon enough, the <span class="SpellE">Alisbos</span> (herein complainants) would have had enough time to
engage the services of another lawyer and they would not have lost their case
through prescription of the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">The actuations of respondent attorney violated Paragraphs 1 and
2, No. 6 of the Canons of Professional Ethics which provide:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"6<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>ADVERSE</span> INFLUENCE AND CONFLICTING INTEREST</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is the duty of a lawyer at the time of retainer to
disclose to the client all the circumstances of his relations to the parties,
and in any interest in or with the controversy, which might influence the
client in the selection of counsel.<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is unprofessional to represent conflicting interests,
except by express consent of all concerned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">given </span>after a full disclosure of the facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Within the meaning of this canon, a lawyer
represents conflicting interests when, in behalf of one client, it is his duty
to contend for that which duty to another client requires him to oppose." <span class="GramE">(pp. 14-15, Solicitor General's Report.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The impression we gather from the facts is that Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span> used his position as <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span>
counsel precisely to favor his other client, <span class="SpellE">Carlito</span>
Sales, by delaying <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span> action to revive the
judgment in his favor and thereby deprive him of the fruits of his judgment
which Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>, as Sales’ counsel, had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vigorously </span>opposed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thus,
</span>although Atty. <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span> prepared <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span> complaint for revival <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of </span>judgment on <st1:date month="4" day="18" year="1970">April
 18, 1970</st1:date>, he delayed its filing until <st1:date month="9" day="12" year="1970">September 12, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He postponed filing the action by asking the Court instead to resolve
pending incidents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>said Civil
Case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">No. </span>4963.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By doing that, he frittered away what little
time was left before the action would prescribe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original complaint which he filed in the
names of Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo</span> and his brothers was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">partially</span></u> defective because of Ramon's incompetence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By dropping the other plaintiffs, leaving
alone the incompetent Ramon to prosecute the action, respondent made the second
complaint <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">wholly</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>defective and ineffectual to stop the
running of the prescriptive period.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After filing the complaint, Attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>
sat on the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he allegedly
found out about Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span> insanity on <st1:date month="7" day="17" year="1971"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">July 17,
 1971</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> only, </span>he
amended the complaint to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Alisbo's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>legal guardian <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>plaintiff
on <st1:date month="12" day="8" year="1971">December 8, 1971</st1:date> only,
or almost f<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ive </span>(5) months
later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By that time the prescriptive
period had run out.</p>

<p class="BODY">The surrounding circumstances leave us with no other conclusion
than that attorney <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>, betrayed his client
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Alisbo's</span> trust and did not champion his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cause </span>with that whole-hearted fidelity
care and devotion that a lawyer is obligated to give to every case that he
accepts from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is
</span>more than simple negligence resulting in the extinguishment and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">loss of </span>his client's right of action;
there is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>hint of duplicity and
lack of candor in his dealings with his client, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">call </span>for the exercise of this Court's disciplinary power.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Honorable Solicitor General who conducted the investigation
of this case found respondent Attorney Benito <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span>,
Sr. guilty of serious misconduct and infidelity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the Solicitor General recommended the
suspension of respondent Attorney Benito <span class="SpellE">Jalandoon</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Sr. </span>from the practice of law for a
period of one (1) year, the Court, after due deliberation, decided to suspend

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING">Concurring and Dissenting</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">Feliciano, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree with the conclusion of the Court that respondent Atty.
Benito Jalandoon, Sr. was guilty of serious misconduct and infidelity.  I, however, believe that the penalty of
suspension for period of two (2) years from the practice of law is not
commensurate with the very serious character of the misconduct and infidelity
of which the Court has found him guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">That misconduct was not an ordinary act of placing himself in a
conflict of interest situation.  Respondent attorney in this case not only acted where he had a clear
conflict of interest but also, and worst, so acted as to in effect destroy the
legal rights which pertained to the complainants.  As pointed out by the Court, respondent attorney delayed the
filing of the complaint for the Alisbos for revival of judgment and</p>

<blockquote>“by doing that, he [respondent attorney]
frittered away what little time was left before the action would
prescribe.  The original complaint which
he filed in the names of Ramon Alisbo and his brothers was only <u>partially</u>
defective because of Ramon’s incompetence.  By dropping the other plaintiffs leaving alone the incompetent Ramon to
prosecute the action, respondent made the second complaint wholly defective and
ineffectual to stop the running of the prescriptive period.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, there was here a utilization of the lawyer’s craft and
profession to defeat and dissolve the rights of one client for the benefit of
the other client.  This is infidelity to
a client’s cause in a particularly aggravated form, the use of the professional
knowledge and technique deliberately to harm a client.  Those who deal with members of the legal
profession have the right to expect not just a reasonable amount of
professional learning and competence but also whole-hearted loyalty to the
client’s cause, of course, within the bounds of law.  A client must be able to deal with his attorney free from the
intolerable apprehension that such attorney may, at some other time, turn
around, not just to betray the client’s confidence, but also deliberately to
destroy the very rights that the client went to him in the first place to
defend and prosecute.</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that the penalty justly merited by respondent in this
case is suspension from the practice of law for five (5) years or outright
disbarment and vote accordingly.</p>
