				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition to review the decision of the Court of Appeals
dated <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="6">June <span style="">26, </span>1986</st1:date>, dismissing petitioners’ petition for
prohibition, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, the petition is
hereby DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temporary
restraining order previously issued is hereby lifted, dissolved and set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Briefly, the antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners are residents of <span class="SpellE">Marulas</span>-A,
a parcel of land situated in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, which is owned by the
Philippine National Railways (PNR).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
claim to be long-time legitimate tenants and sub-tenants of the PNR.</p>

<p class="BODY">In August of 1980, fire hit <span class="SpellE">Marulas</span>-A
which rendered a number of families homeless, petitioners included.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, petitioners started
reconstructing their dwellings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said
constructions were allegedly authorized by respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span>,
in his capacity as Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City.</p>

<p class="BODY">In February 1982, PNR sold the lot in question to the City
Government of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter bought the lot <span style="">in </span>coordination with the then Ministry
of Education, Culture and Sports preparatory to the construction of a new
school building thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having learned of the sale of the lots which they have been
occupying to the City Government of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>,
petitioners, in April 1982, sent a letter-petition to respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span> anent their impending eviction from the premises
and asked that they be allowed to continue to occupy the <span style="">same </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p<span style="">. </span>106).</p>

<p class="BODY">In January 1984, petitioners again sent another letter addressed
to respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span> this time expressing their
willingness to purchase the property sold by the PNR at a reasonable price pursuant
to Presidential Decree No. 1517 (proclaiming urban land reform in the
Philippines and providing for the implementing machinery thereof).</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, petitioners received a "<span class="SpellE">Paunawa</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Paglilipat</span>"
sent by respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span> through the City Architect,
<span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> Sadie.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, petitioners requested assistance from the Human Settlements
Regulatory Commission and a dialogue was held between petitioners and
respondent to work out a possible compromise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties failed to reach a compromise so that on <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1985</st1:date>, respondent City
Engineer <span class="SpellE">Uson</span> delivered a final notice to petitioners
requiring <span style="">them </span>to remove and
demolish their respective houses, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to the provisions of the Letter of Instruction No.
19 and its amendment, and the Memorandum of the Office of the President dated
November 13, 1972, you are hereby directed to remove/demolish your house at
above address which has illegally occupied, encroached, obstructed and/or
usurped the road right-of-way, waterways, open space, other government lot or
other private lot in violation of laws, decrees, instructions, order and/or
ordinances within ten (10) days from notice hereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"You are further advised that in the event of your failure to
remove/demolish said structure within the stated period, the city government
will undertake the same at your expense or will undertake other measures
necessary or required under the circumstances." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 120)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioners filed a petition for prohibition before this Court, docketed as
G.R. No. 69790, which was then referred to the Court of Appeals (then
Intermediate Appellate Court) for reception of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1986</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals issued the assailed decision dismissing the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner’s motion for reconsideration was
denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this
instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioners assign the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE IAC ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE PETITION
IS BEREFT OF SUBSTANCE AND DEVOID OF MERIT BECAUSE IT ALLEGES THAT EXCEPT FOR
PETITIONER <st1:city><st1:place>MEDINA</st1:place></st1:city>, ALL THE
PETITIONERS ARE NOT LEGITIMATE TENANTS BUT SQUATTERS WHO BUILT THEIR HOUSES
NEAR OR ALONG THE RAILROAD TRACKS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span class="GramE"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II.</span></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE IAC ERRED IN FINDING THAT THE HOUSES OF
THE PETITIONERS WERE ILLEGALLY CONSTRUCTED AS THEY WERE BUILT ON PUBLIC
PROPERTY AND WITHOUT ANY BUILDING PERMITS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is at once apparent that petitioners' assignment of errors
takes issue with the findings of facts and appreciation of the evidence passed
upon by the Court of Appeals which is now brought before this Court for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of their petition, petitioners seek reliance in the
case of <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lazatin</span>
(74 Phil. 719 [1944]) contending <span style="">that </span>a
question as to whether or not the conclusion drawn <span style="">by </span>the Court of Appeals from proven facts is correct, involves a
question of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find petitioners’ argument devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> case (<u>supra</u>)
relied upon by petitioners speaks of <u><span style="">proven</span></u><span style=""> <u>facts</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the facts are yet to be
proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As held in <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There <span style="">is </span>no
question of facts here because the <u>facts</u> <u>are</u> <u>admittedly</u> <u>proven</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the conclusion drawn by the
Court of Appeals from those facts is correct, is a question of law which this
Court is authorized to pass upon." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The ruling in <span class="SpellE">Cunanan</span> cannot apply to
the case at bar in the absence of proven facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, for a question to be one of law, the same must not involve an
examination of the probative value of the evidence presented by the <span style="">litigants or any of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the distinction is well?known:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is a question of law in a given case
when the doubt or difference arises as to what the law is on a certain state </span>of
<span style="">facts; there is a question of fact when
the doubt or difference arises as to the truth or the falsehood of alleged
facts (II Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1979 Ed., 473; citing Ramos,
et al., v. Pepsi?Cola Bottling Co, of the P.I., et al., 19 SCRA 289
[1967]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' allegation that the Court of Appeals "grossly
disregarded" their Exhibits "A", "B", "C",
"D", and "E", in effect, asks us to re-examine all the
evidences already presented and evaluated - as well as the findings of fact
made - by the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="">in </span>Sotto v. <span class="SpellE">Teves</span>
(86 SCRA 154 [1978]), <span class="GramE">We</span> held that the appreciation of
evidence is within the domain of the Court of Appeals<span style=""> because its findings of fact are not <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span>
by the this Court (<span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> v. CA, 147 SCRA 236
[1987]; <span class="SpellE">Knecht</span> v. CA, 158 SCRA 80 [1988] and a long
line of cases).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not the function of this Court to analyze or weigh such
evidence all over again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
jurisdiction is limited to reviewing <span style="">errors
</span>of law that may have been committed by the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Nicolas et al., v. CA, 154
<span style="">SCRA 635 [1987]; <span class="SpellE">Tiongco</span>
v. de la Merced, 58 SCRA 89 [1974]).</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a well-settled rule in this jurisdiction that only questions
of law may be raised in a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 45 of the
Rules of Court, this Court being bound by the findings of fact made by the
Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rule, however, is
not without exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, findings of
fact by the Court of Appeals may be passed upon and reviewed by this Court in
the following instances, none of which obtain in the instant petition:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) When the conclusion is a finding grounded entirely on
speculation, surmises or conjectures (Joaquin v. <span style="">Navarro, </span>93 Phil. 257 [1953]); (2) When the inference made is
manifestly mistaken, absurd or impossible (Luna v. <span class="SpellE">Linatok</span>,
74 Phil. 15 [1942]); (3) Where there is a grave abuse of discretion (<span class="SpellE">Buyco</span> v. People, 95 Phil. 453 [1955]); (4) When the
judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts (Cruz v. <span class="SpellE">Sosing</span>,
L-4875, Nov. 27, 1953); (5) When the findings of fact are conflicting (<span class="SpellE">Casica</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Villaseca</span>, L-9590 <span class="SpellE">Ap</span>. 30, 1957; <span class="SpellE">unrep</span>.);* (6) <span style="">When the Court of </span>Appeals, in making
its findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same is contrary to
the admissions of both appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
(Evangelista v. Alto Surety and Insurance Co., 103 Phil. 401 [1958]); (7) The
findings of the Court of Appeals are contrary to those of the trial court
(Garcia v. Court of Appeals, 33 SCRA 622 [1970]; <span class="SpellE">Sacay</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 142 SCRA 593 [1986]);<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> (8) When the findings of fact are conclusions
without citation of specific evidence on which they are based (Ibid.,); (9)
When the facts set forth in the petition as well <span style="">as </span>in the petitioners' <span class="GramE">main</span> and reply
briefs are not disputed by the respondents (Ibid.,); and (10) The finding of
fact of the Court of Appeals is premised on the supposed absence of evidence
and <span style="">is </span>contradicted by the
evidence on record (Salazar v. Gutierrez, 33 SCRA 242 [1970]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Essential to the resolution of petitioners' assignment of errors
is the issue of whether or not they are legitimate tenants of PNR entitled to
the benefits provided under Sec. 6, PD 1517, which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 6.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Land Tenancy in Urban Areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the Urban Zones legitimate tenants who
have resided on the land for ten years or more who have built their homes on
the land and residents who have already occupied the lands by contract,
continuously for the last ten years shall not be dispossessed of the land and shall
be allowed the right of first refusal to purchase the same within a reasonable
time and at reasonable prices, under terms and conditions to be determined by
the Urban Zone Expropriation and Land Management Committee created by Section 8
of this Decree."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Invoking Presidential Decree No. 1517, petitioners claim to be
legitimate tenants and sub-tenants of PNR for more than ten (10) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, they contend that under said decree,
they cannot be evicted from the premises they are currently occupying and have
the right of first refusal to purchase the same within a reasonable time and at
a reasonable price.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals found otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It said:</p>

<blockquote>"The records, however, disclose that only petitioners <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> Medina, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>, Rosario <span class="GramE">Band(</span>z)<span class="SpellE">uela</span>, Antonia de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and
Antonia Gonzales appear to be lessees of the PNR while the rest appear to be <u>squatters</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the <span style="">five
</span>lessees, only petitioner <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span> Medina,
however, was able to renew his contract of lease with the PNR under Contract No.
8603 which will expire on <st1:date year="1985" day="31" month="12">December
 31, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also appears
that the houses of <st1:city><st1:place>Medina</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> and <span class="SpellE">Banzuela</span> are
situated within the territorial jurisdiction of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
while that of Antonia de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and Antonia
Gonzales are within the jurisdiction of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>."
<span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 18).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that <span class="SpellE">Marulas</span>-A is a
priority development area under Proclamation 1967 (1980), petitioners' alleged
right of first refusal and the consequent prerogative to stay thereon never
existed <span style="">in </span>the absence of
contract over the disputed land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
Bermudez v. Intermediate Appellate Court (143 SCRA 351 [1986]), we held:</p>

<blockquote>'It is a proved fact that the disputed land is in an area already
proclaimed for priority development, and that the petitioners have occupied the
premises for more than ten (10) years.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that they cannot take
advantage of the <span class="SpellE">beneficient</span> provisions (e.g. right
of first refusal) granted by Presidential Decree No. 1517, because among other
things they are not bona fide tenants of the property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sections 3 (f) and 6 of PD 1517 provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(f) <u>Tenant</u> <u>refers</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>rightful</u>
<u>occupant</u> <u>of</u> <u>land</u> <u>and</u> <u>its</u> <u>structure</u>, <u>but</u>

<u>without</u> <u>the</u> <u>benefit</u> <u>of</u> <u>contract</u>, those who
enter the land by force or deceit, or those whose possession is under
litigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="GramE">xxx</span> <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 6.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Land Tenancy in Urban Areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Within the Urban Zones <u>legitimate</u> <u>tenants</u>

</span>within a reasonable time and at <span style="">reasonable
prices, under terms and conditions </span>to be determined by the Urban Zone
Expropriation and Land Management Committee created by Section 8 of this
Decree." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Based on the afore-quoted provision, only legitimate tenants may
be extended the protective mantle of the decree cited to the exclusion of all
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the petitioners do not
have contracts with the PNR to qualify <span style="">them
as legitimate tenants, the protection afforded therein cannot be rightfully
invoked (<span class="SpellE">Zansibarian</span> Residents <span class="SpellE">Ass'n</span>.
v. Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, 135 SCRA 239 [1985]; cf. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> v. Intermediate Appellate Court, 132 SCRA 377
[1984]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, petitioners
cannot also be </span>granted the right of first <span style="">refusal to purchase the </span>property involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that petitioners <span class="SpellE">Osmundo</span>
Medina, <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span>,
Rosario <span class="SpellE">Banzuela</span>, whose houses are within the limits
of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, and Antonio
de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and Antonia Gonzales are registered
lessees of PNR (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 97).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the house <span style="">of</span> the above-named three (3) petitioners fall outside the
jurisdiction of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, respondents are without
authority to order the demolition of their dwellings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the appealed decision must be
modified in this respect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, petitioners de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes and Gonzales failed to
adduce any evidence showing legitimate occupancy of the disputed property for
the last ten (10) years by virtue of a contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their bare assertions sans substantive proof
militate against their cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that they have been religiously paying the
rentals, <span style="">only </span>that the receipts
issued <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by PNR were either lost or burned by
the August fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Records of the PNR
submitted by petitioners indicate, however, that latest payments made by
petitioners date back as far as 1971 and 1962 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 100-102).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to what they
claim, petitioners have been remiss in the payment of rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that PNR instituted no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceedings against petitioners only amounted to
tolerance and cannot legitimize their occupancy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners likewise deny that their houses are built near or
along railroad tracks because a memorandum issued <span style="">by </span>the Gen. Manager of PNR (Annex "Q") allowed them to
build their houses within five (5) meters from the outer rail tracks (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
note an overt mischief in their denial.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, a perusal of the memorandum (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"Y", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 133) adverted to reveals no
such authorization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it makes
demands that the PNR right-of-way "be cleared immediately of all houses
and other structures built and existing within 5-meters from the outer rail
tracks."</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be <span class="SpellE">gleanded</span> from the foregoing
that petitioners have indeed been occupying restricted areas.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, illegal constructions thereon may be
demolished by respondents pursuant to Letter of Instruction No. 19, as amended
and the Memorandum of the Office of the President dated <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1972</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further contended that petitioners were issued building
permits <span style="">b</span>y respondent <span class="SpellE">Asistio</span> as proven by the fact that they were able to secure
water and electrical connection since the agencies concerned, <span style="">MWSS </span>and MERALCO, respectively, require
prior presentation of said permits (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 5).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If building permits were actually issued as claimed by petitioners, <span class="GramE">We</span> see <span style="">no </span>reason
why not even a single permit was presented <span style="">in </span>evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting
that the alleged permits were either lost or burned, a duplicate copy thereof
could have been secured from either MWSS or MERALCO, or from the city government
of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:place></st1:city>
itself which issued the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
being none, it cannot be presumed that petitioners were possessed of the
requisite building permits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE">Zanzibarian</span>
Residents <span class="SpellE">Ass'n</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">v</span>. <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
<span style="">(<u>supra</u>), </span>we upheld the
authority of municipal mayors to remove illegal constructions along railroad
tracks, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the authority of respondent to demolish
the houses or shanties of the petitioners is mandated by P.D. 772 and LOI No.
19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of LOI No. 19 orders
certain public officials, one of whom is the municipal mayor to remove all
illegal <span style="">construction, </span>including
buildings, on and along <span class="SpellE">esteros</span> and river banks;
those along railroad tracks and those built without permits on public or
private property."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, reliance is placed on Presidential Decree No. 2016
(1986) which prohibits the eviction of occupant families from lands identified
and proclaimed as Areas for Priority Development or Urban Land Reform Zone, the
General Moratorium on Eviction and Demolition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 121-122) and Resolution No. 2-87 of the Presidential Commission for the
Urban Poor (PCUP) providing policies and guidelines on squatting, otherwise
known as "<span class="SpellE">Tigil</span> <span class="SpellE">Tayuan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tigil</span> <span class="SpellE">Gibaan</span>" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 123-127).</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4 of PCUP Resolution No. 2-87 states that "subject
to existing laws", all urban <span style="">poor </span>occupants
of dwelling structures built on or before February 25, 1986 shall be extended
the necessary assistance and protection on their dwelling; whereas, par. (f) <span class="GramE">of</span> the same section provides, among others, that "Court
orders to evict squatters shall be respected" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
