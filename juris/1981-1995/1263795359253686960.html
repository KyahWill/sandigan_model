<p class="BODY">On October 13, 1986, the petitioner wrote the public respondent a
request for reconsideration of the above Final Order for Compliance on two
grounds, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) The respondent's
lack of jurisdiction to entertain money claims which properly fall within the
jurisdiction of the National Labor Relations Commission; and (2) denial of due
process for the alleged failure of the public respondent to furnish the
petitioner with copies of the affidavits of the thirteen claimant workers and
the narrative report dated September <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">2, </span>1986

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1986</st1:date>,
the public respondent denied the petitioner's motion for reconsideration and
ruled that there was no lack of jurisdiction considering that the public
respondent had validly assumed jurisdiction over the subject matter under
Article 128(b) of the Labor Code in the exercise of his enforcement
powers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The public respondent further
ruled that there was no denial of due process owing to the fact that the
petitioner was given five days to present his employment records and another
ten days to comply with the subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span> but still he failed to do as required under Section

from employer-employee relationship are within the exclusive jurisdiction of
the Labor Arbiter as provided under Article 217 of the Labor Code, as
amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleges that the public
respondent acted without or in excess of his jurisdiction amounting to grave
abuse of discretion in taking cognizance of the private respondents'
claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the petitioner
contends that if ever the public respondent is empowered to award a money
judgment, his authority is limited to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">claims

and neither was he given the opportunity to present any evidence to refute the
findings of the inspectors who visited his business establishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents, on the other hand, rely on the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement powers granted to the public
respondent under Art. <span class="GramE">128 of the Labor Code.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that the petitioner, after
having defied the repeated requests of the public respondent to submit his
employment records, could not validly claim that he was not given the chance to
be heard and to present his side.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General agrees with the petitioner and submits that
under Art. 128 of the Labor Code, the public respondent <span class="GramE">is</span>
not empowered to adjudicate money claims because such authority is reposed in
the Labor Arbiter and the National Labor Relations Commission as provided under
Art. <span class="GramE">127 of the same Code, as amended.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General further adds that the <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement powers of the public respondent

with merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Article 217 of the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, with respect to the money claims of
workers such as those relating to the under-payment of the minimum wage rate
and 13th month pay and the non-payment of the emergency cost of living
allowance and 5-day incentive leave pay, as in the case at bar, the original
and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving said claims
pertains to the labor arbiters alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Original jurisdiction means jurisdiction to take cognizance of a
cause at its inception, try it and pass judgment upon the law and facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Exclusive jurisdiction precludes the idea of
co-existence and refers to jurisdiction possessed to the exclusion of others."
(pp. 673 and 1251, Black's Law Dictionary) Article 217 of the Labor Code does
not empower the regional director to share in the "original and exclusive
jurisdiction" conferred on the labor arbiters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> Base
Metals, Inc. v. Minister of Labor, 146 SCRA 50).</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the submission made by the Solicitor General that
under Article 128 of the Labor Code, the regional director's power to visit the
establishment of the employer extends only insofar as checking compliance with
labor standard laws is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
inspection results in a finding that the employer has violated certain labor
standard laws, then, the regional director must order the necessary
rectifications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this does not
include adjudication of money claims clearly within the ambit of the labor
arbiter's authority under Article 217 of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the regional director, in the exercise of his <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement powers under Art. 128 of the
Labor Code, has definitely no authority to award money claims properly falling
within the jurisdiction of the labor arbiter as provided in Art. 217 of the
same Code, the provision in MOLE Policy Instructions No. 7 which limits the
regional director's authority to amounts not exceeding P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
refers to the enforcement of labor standards laws by the regional director in
the exercise of his <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement
powers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
limit grants no implied power to adjudicate claims for monetary benefits filed
by the complainant workers of an establishment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the <span class="SpellE">corrollary</span> issue of whether or
not there was denial of due process in the exercise of the regional director's <span class="SpellE">visitorial</span> and enforcement powers the records belie the
claim that the petitioner was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">given
the chance to present his side and to refute the findings of the inspectors who
visited his </span>establishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During
the initial on-the-spot inspection made by the public respondent on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">petitioner's business premises, the
petitioner's inability to present his business records was a clear violation of
Book III, Rule X, <span class="GramE">Section</span> II of the Implementing Rules
and Regulations of the Labor Code which provides that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Sec. II.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Place</u> <u>of</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span><u>records</u>. -- All employment

understood to mean the main or branch office or establishment, if any,
depending upon where the employees are regularly assigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The keeping of the employee's records in
another place is prohibited."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Notwithstanding<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span> the violation, the public respondent gave the
petitioner five days to produce his </span>employment records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the second visit made by the public
respondent, the petitioner still failed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">present the required records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, when a subpoena <span class="SpellE">duces</span> <span class="SpellE">tecum</span> was issued, the petitioner, instead of complying,
sent a letter for clarification regarding the </span>basis of the
inspection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The letter was obviously a
dilatory tactic because on the very face of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">authority presented to the petitioner by the representatives of the
public respondent during the on-the-spot inspection, it was stated that the
inspection was being made pursuant to a letter-request of one of his employees,
Rowena <span class="SpellE">Reteracion</span>, as president of the </span>labor
union in his business establishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is settled that there is no denial of due process where the petitioner was
afforded an opportunity to present his case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
