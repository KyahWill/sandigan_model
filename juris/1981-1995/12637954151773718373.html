<p>The judgment of the former Circuit Criminal Court of Rizal in Criminal Case 
No. CCC-VII-2505 finding Ruben Manalo guilty of murder and imposing the death 
penalty, is before us on automatic review.<br><br>The record discloses that in 
the morning of 23 May 1977, appellant Ruben Manalo, a prisoner serving sentence 
in the National Bilibid Prison, was at the visiting area of the prison waiting 
for transfer to the San Ramon Penal Colony.&nbsp; Alfredo de la Cruz, Jolly Hilario 
and Reynaldo Cariso, all convicted prisoners serving their respective sentences, 
were similarly waiting in the same visiting area for transfer to the same penal 
colony.&nbsp; While at the visiting area, appellant engaged another convict in a 
betting game called "<em>honkiang</em>", after which appellant and dela Cruz 
indulged in speculation concerning their prospective life in the penal colony.&nbsp; 
During this conversation, appellant attacked dela Cruz with a knife, inflicting 
two fatal stabwounds on the latter's back.&nbsp; Immediately after the stabbing, 
appellant voluntarily surrendered to the prison authorities and handed over the 
fan knife (<em>balisong</em>) he used in killing dela Cruz.<br><br>Immediately 
after the killing and the appellant's surrender, the appellant was investigated 
by the prison authorities.&nbsp; During this investigation, Ruben Manalo readily 
admitted verbally having stabbed the victim and nonchalantly advised that the 
fan knife he used had been bought by him for P25.00 a month ago and had been 
concealed inside his right rubber shoe and so was not discovered by the prison 
guard who had searched him before entering the Visiting Shed.<br><br>The 
investigation also revealed that the victim was a member of the BCJ (<em>Batang 
City Jail</em>) gang from prison Dormitory 3-D while Ruben Manalo is a member of 
the <em>Sigue-sigue Sputnik</em> gang from prison Dormitory 2-B.&nbsp; These two 
gangs have had a serious, ongoing feud for a long time, which had recently been 
aggravated by the fatal stabbing of a member of the Sigue-sigue Sputnik gang by 
members of the BCJ gang.<br><br>On 6 February 1978, Ruben Manalo was charged 
with murder in an information which read as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"That on or about the 23rd day of May 1977 in the municipality of Muntinlupa, 
and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, 
who is a convict confined and serving his sentence in the new Bilibid Prison by 
virtue of final judgment rendered against him by courts of competent 
jurisdiction, with intent to kill, evident premeditation and treachery did then 
and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and stab with a 
bladed weapon one Alfredo dela Cruz, also a covict, thereby inflicting upon him 
stab wounds on the vital parts of his body which directly caused his 
death.<br><br>Contrary to law, with the aggravating circumstance of 
quasi-recidivism, the accused having committed the offense while serving his 
sentence in the New Bilibid Prison." </p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<blockquote></blockquote>Upon arraignment, and with the assistance of counsel, 
appellant pleaded guilty.&nbsp; The trial court nonetheless ordered the mandatory 
presentation of evidence.&nbsp; After trial, in a decision dated 7 December 1978, the 
trial court concluded that the killing of Alfredo dela Cruz by Ruben Manalo had 
been attended by treachery and evident premeditation and aggravated by 
quasi-recidivism.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of the judgment read:
<p></p>
<blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<em>DAHIL SA GAYON, dahil sa kusang loob na pag-amin nang 
kasalanan nang nasasakdal sa paglabag sa Artikulo 248 nang Binagong Kodigo Penal 
na naayon sa sakdal, napatunayan nang Hukumang ito na siya ay nagkasala at siya 
ay hinahatulan nang parusang KAMATAYAN.&nbsp; Pagbabayaran din niya ang mga 
tagapagmana nang nasawi nang halagang P12,000.00 at P10,000.00 bayad pinsalang 
moral, P10,000.00 bayad pinsalang di dapat pamarisan at ang gastos ng usaping 
ito.<br><br>IPINAGUUTOS</em>."
<p></p></blockquote>In his brief, appellant does not question the finding of the 
trial court that he had killed Alfredo dela Cruz.&nbsp; Instead, the appellant 
assigns two distinct errors:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; the proceedings in the trial court were 
null and void since certain constitutional rights of the appellant had been 
disregarded therein; and<br><br>(2)&nbsp; the trial court erred in finding that the 
killing of dela Cruz had been attended by the qualifying circumstances of 
evident premeditation and treachery.<br><br>In respect of the first assigned 
error, it is the contention of the appellant that he was deprived of his 
constitutional right to due process, to be presumed innocent until the contrary 
is proved, to an impartial trial and to counsel, by reason of the lower court's 
partiality, bias and lack of objectivity during the trial.&nbsp; The appellant urges 
that since the trial court was not an impartial tribunal, all the proceedings 
before it should be set aside as null and void.<br><br>Appellant maintains that 
lack of impartiality and of objectivity on the part of the trial judge was 
clearly shown when he intervened in the cross-examination of Dr. Virgilio 
Hernale (the physician who had carried out the autopsy of the victim dela Cruz) 
and of Jolly Hilario, both being witnesses for the prosecution.&nbsp; Upon 
termination of the cross-examination of Dr. Hernale by defense counsel, the 
trial judge raised the following questions which Dr. Hernale answered in the 
following manner:<br><br>

<p><br>The appellant claims that the above interventions of the trial court show 
that, at the very outset, the judge had already concluded that appellant was 
guilty of murder and had resolved to convict him; that the trial court had 
functioned "both as judge and prosecutor" asking questions of witnesses 
"calculated to establish treachery, premeditation and motive"; that the 
questions raised by the trial court were exceptionable ones, being "leading, 
misleading, called for opinions or were objectionable on the ground of the 
witness' incompetence"; and that therefore, appellant "never had a fair 
chance".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>We are not persuaded 
by the appellant's contention.&nbsp; As long ago as 1915, this Court held 
that:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A severe examination by a trial judge of some of the witnesses 
for the defense in an effort to develop the truth and to get at the real facts 
affords no justification for a charge in counsel's brief on appeal that he has 
assisted the prosecution with an evident desire to secure a conviction, or that 
he had intimidated the witnesses for the defense.&nbsp; We have had occasion to hold 
(<em>U.S. vs. Hudieres</em>, 27 Phil. Rep., 45) that it is not only the right 
but<em> ofttimes</em> the duty of a trial judge to examine witnesses when it 
appears to be necessary for the elucidation of the record.&nbsp; Under the system of 
legal procedure in vogue in this jurisdiction, where the trial court is judge of 
both the law and the facts, it is <em>ofttimes</em> expedient or necessary in 
the due and faithful administration of justice for the presiding judge in the 
exercise of a sound discretion to reexamine a witness in order that his judgment 
when rendered may rest upon a full and clear understanding of the facts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>We must accord to a trial judge 
reasonable leeway in putting such questions to witnesses as may be essential to 
elicit relevant facts and to make the record speak the truth.&nbsp; In such an 
effort, a judge may examine or cross-examine a witness.&nbsp; He may seek to draw out 
relevant and material testimony though that testimony may tend to support or 
rebut the position taken by one or the other party.&nbsp; In the first instance, the 
Court has pointed out, "the extent to which such examination may be conducted 
rests in the discretion of the judge, the exercise of which will not be 
controlled unless his discretion has clearly been abused to the prejudice of 
either party".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> In the present case, we 
do not believe that the trial judge transgressed the permissible limits of 
judicial inquiry.&nbsp; It appears to us that the judge merely sought to clarify to 
himself whether or not treachery and evident premeditation had indeed attended 
the killing of Alfredo dela Cruz, as alleged by the prosecution.&nbsp; All that the 
questions propounded by the judge indicates to us is that he was not 
particularly skillful in cross-examination and that he found it difficult to 
operationalize words which themselves imported conclusions.&nbsp; Finally, we would 
note that the questions posed by the trial judge, quoted above, did not 
ultimately impose any prejudice upon the appellant, for reasons that will become 
clear shortly.&nbsp; The questions raised by the trial judge sought to draw forth 
answers which did not relate to whether or not the appellant had in fact killed 
dela Cruz.&nbsp; The appellant had not only entered an intelligent and valid plea of 
guilty; that he had killed his fellow convict dela Cruz was established by 
independent and overwhelming evidence.<br><br>The appellant also claims that he 
was denied his constitutional right to counsel.&nbsp; The appellant admits that he 
was assisted by counsel <em>de oficio</em> from the time of arraignment and 
throughout the trial of the case.&nbsp; Appellant, however, deplores the fact that 
several different counsel <em>de oficio</em> assisted him during the different 
hearings held in his case.&nbsp; Atty. Galvan appeared for Manalo at the arraignment 
and at the second and sixth hearings; Atty. Sardillo assisted him during the 
first and the third hearings; at the fourth and fifth hearings, Manalo was 
represented by Atty. Agoot.&nbsp; At the fifth hearing, the appellant claims, the 
prosecution was already "mid-stream" in its direct examination of the 
prosecution witness of whom 27 questions had already been asked, when the 
prosecution suddenly commented that "I think there is no lawyer for the accused 
[present]".&nbsp; The trial court forthwith appointed Atty. Agoot there physically 
present as counsel <em>de oficio</em> (apparently forgetting that he had already 
been appointed counsel <em>de oficio</em> and had acted as such, at the previous 
[fourth] hearing) and thereupon proceeded with the trial of the 
case.<br><br>Appellant raises the entertaining, if rhetorical, question of how 
ably his counsel <em>de oficio</em> could defend him since they were "playing 
musical chairs — hearing after hearing".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Thus, the appellant asserts that his right 
to counsel was "but a sham", that by appointing multiple counsel <em>de 
oficio</em> the trial court did not effectively provide him with the assistance 
and protection required by the Constitution.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The appellant's argument is novel 
and interesting but, once more, we are not persuaded that there has here been a 
deprivation of a constitutional right which requires annulment of all the 
proceedings before the trial court.&nbsp; We do not believe that the fact that a 
particular counsel <em>de oficio</em> did not or could not consistently appear 
in all the hearings of the case, is effectively a denial of the right to 
counsel, especially so where, as in the instant case, there is no showing that 
the several appointed counsel <em>de oficio</em> in any way neglected to perform 
their duties to the appellant and to the trial court and that the defense had 
suffered in any substantial sense therefrom.&nbsp; Fairness to the several counsel 
<em>de oficio</em> requires us to note the record which reveals that each of 
them had conscientiously performed their duties in assisting the appellant and 
protecting his interest by, for instance, making the necessary objections in a 
timely manner during the examination of the prosecution witnesses to test their 
credibility and freedom from bias or evil motive.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Contrary to the suggestion of the 
appellant, Atty. Agoot was not entitled to a recess of two days to prepare to 
defend the appellant after Atty. Agoot was re-appointed counsel <em>de 
oficio</em> at the fifth hearing.&nbsp; That lawyer had previously been designated 
counsel <em>de oficio</em> during the preceding (fourth) hearing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Both the appellant and the court had 
therefore the right to expect that that counsel <em>de oficio</em> was familiar 
with the facts of the appellant’s case and that he had prepared himself for the 
fifth hearing since his prior appointment as counsel <em>de oficio</em> had not 
been revoked by the trial court.&nbsp; In point of fact, his designation once more as 
counsel <em>de oficio</em> during the fifth hearing was totally unnecessary.&nbsp; In 
any case, Rule 116, Section 5 of the Rules of Court gives the trial judge 
discretion to shorten or extend the time given to an attorney <em>de oficio</em> 
to prepare his defense.<br><br>We turn to the appellant's second assignment of 
error:&nbsp; that relating to the finding of the lower court that the killing of 
convict dela Cruz was attended by the qualifying circumstances of evident 
premeditation and treachery.&nbsp; We note at once that the Solicitor General has 
concurred with the view taken by the appellant on this point.<br><br>The lower 
court had found that dela Cruz was sleeping when attacked by Ruben Manalo 
(citing, in this connection, the Necropsy Report)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and thus, concluded that treachery was 
present.&nbsp; The Solicitor General, however, concedes that there was absolutely no 
evidence in the record to show that dela Cruz was stabbed while asleep.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The Necropsy Report only described the 
injuries and the cause of death of the victim.&nbsp; No statement is found there that 
the victim was asleep at the time of the stabbing.&nbsp; Neither the physician who 
carried out the autopsy and prepared the Necropsy Report nor the two 
eyewitnesses to the stabbing had testified that the fatal wounds had been 
administered while the victim was asleep.&nbsp; On the contrary, both eyewitnesses to 
the killing explicitly stated that the appellant had stabbed dela Cruz while the 
two were conversing with each other.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Treachery cannot be presumed.&nbsp; It 
must be proven as conclusively as the act of killing itself.&nbsp; The fact that the 
fatal wounds were found at the back of the deceased does not, by itself, compel 
a finding of treachery.&nbsp; Such a finding must be based on some positive proof and 
not be merely an inference drawn more or less logically from hypothetical 
facts.&nbsp; This Court has ruled that the suddenness of an attack is not, of itself, 
enough to constitute treachery when the method of killing does not positively 
show that the assailant thereby knowingly intended to ensure the accomplishment 
of his purpose without risk to himself from any defense which the victim might 
put up.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> In other words, to sustain a 
finding of treachery, the means, method or form of attack must be shown to have 
been deliberately adopted by the appellant.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> There was no such showing here.&nbsp; On the 
contrary, the evidence indicated that the killing of dela Cruz was not 
pre-planned by the appellant and that the decision to kill was an impulse of the 
moment.&nbsp; Appellant was in the visiting area with dela Cruz not because the 
appellant had deliberately planned to be there at the same time as dela Cruz.&nbsp; 
Rather, appellant was there because he, along with others, had been chosen by 
the prison authorities for transfer to the penal colony.&nbsp; Thus, appellant found 
himself with dela Cruz that morning by accident and not by design.&nbsp; Further, 
dela Cruz was stabbed while lying on a table, engaged in a conversation with the 
appellant.&nbsp; Appellant could not have forseen that dela Cruz would lie down on a 
table and present such an attractive victim; thus, the resolve to stab him while 
dela Cruz was in a prone position, must have been taken impulsively.&nbsp; Finally, 
if the appellant had planned the killing, the probability was that he would not 
have planned to carry it out in broad daylight while dela Cruz's gangmates and 
dormitory mates (Hilario and Cariso) were close by.<br><br>The Solicitor General 
has also agreed with the appellant that the trial court's finding of evident 
premeditation was erroneous because of lack of support in the record.&nbsp; The 
Solicitor General said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[To show evident premeditation] it is necessary to establish (a) the time 
when the offender determined to commit the crime, (b) a notorious act manifestly 
indicating that he has clung to his determination, and (c) a sufficient lapse of 
time between the determination and the execution, to allow him to reflect upon 
the consequences of his act.&nbsp; (Padilla, Criminal Law, 1979 ed., p. 
449).<br><br>None of these requisites was proven in the case at bar.&nbsp; The 
evidence presented at the trial was limited to events that transpired 
immediately prior, during and after the attack.&nbsp; No one testified on any 
incident that occurred an hour or more before the attack.&nbsp; Hence, there is no 
proof on (a) when appellant resolved to kill the victim, (b) what external acts 
demonstrated that he stuck to his resolution and (c) whether he had sufficient 
time to reflect upon the consequences of his act.<br><br>In fact, there is no 
evidence to show that appellant and de la Cruz knew each other prior to the 
killing.&nbsp; They belonged to different gangs, were assigned to different brigades 
and lived in different dormitories.&nbsp; Prosecution witnesses Hilario and Cariso, 
who were gangmates, dorm-mates and close friends of de la Cruz, did not know 
appellant's name.&nbsp; Thus, it is highly probable that appellant was not even 
acquainted with de la Cruz and so there was no reason for appellant to resolve 
before hand to kill de la Cruz.&nbsp; The qualifying circumstance of premeditation 
may be properly taken into account only when the intention to kill has been 
planned in the mind of the offender and carefully meditated.&nbsp; It is not enough 
that it arose at the moment of the aggression, as in the present case.<br><br>In 
the absence of clear proof of any circumstance that would qualify as murder the 
killing of the deceased, we submit that appellant committed no more than 
homicide."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br></p></blockquote>
<p>We agree with the Solicitor General.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the 
decision of the lower court is modified and Ruben Manalo is found guilty beyond 
reasonable doubt of the crime of homicide for which, in view of the presence of 
the special aggravating circumstance of quasi-recidivism under Article 160 of 
the Revised Penal Code, the correct imposable penalty is <em>reclusion temporal 
</em>in its maximum period.&nbsp; Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, Ruben 
Manalo is hereby sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of ten (10) years and one 
(1) day of <em>prision mayor</em> as a minimum and seventeen (17) years, four 
(4) months and one (1) day of <em>reclusion temporal </em>as a maximum.&nbsp; The 
civil indemnity due to the heirs of Alfredo dela Cruz is increased to Thirty 
Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00).&nbsp; The balance of the judgment of the lower court is 
AFFIRMED.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p>

<p align="center"><em>SEPARATE OPINION</em><br><br></p>
<p><strong><em>CRUZ, J.</em></strong>:<br><br>While concurring in the conviction 
based upon the plea of guilty made by the accused-appellant, I must express 
misgivings over the manner he was accorded his right to counsel, which is one of 
the most important rights of the accused under the Constitution.<br><br>So 
important is this right that the first duty of the court before even arraigning 
the accused is to ascertain whether or not he is assisted by counsel and, if 
not, to give him a chance to retain counsel <em>de parte</em> or, if he cannot, 
to appoint counsel <em>de oficio</em> for him.&nbsp; No less importantly, the court 
must see to it that the counsel <em>de oficio</em> shall not merely make the 
motions in defense of the accused but must exert all efforts for the protection 
of his client's rights with the same sincerity and spirit as when he is acting 
as counsel <em>de parte</em>.<br><br>The records of this case show that no 
counsel <em>de oficio</em> was appointed for the defendant on a permanent basis, 
that is, for the entire duration of the case.&nbsp; On the contrary, new counsel 
<em>de oficio</em> was appointed for each hearing, when and as it was held, the 
choice presumably falling on whoever was available in the courtroom at the 
time.&nbsp; Thus, one lawyer was appointed for the arraignment and the second and 
sixth hearings; a second for the first and third hearings; and a third for the 
fourth and fifth hearings, belatedly at that during the fifth hearing, when it 
was noticed after some time that the defendant had no counsel.<br><br>Such 
tentative, <em>ad hoc</em> and impromptu appointments of counsel <em>de 
oficio</em> could not have provided the defendant-appellant with the adequate 
representation he was entitled to for the protection of his rights.&nbsp; The several 
counsel <em>de oficio</em> tapped for the nonce apparently acted extempore only, 
without the motivation of a considered strategy or a long-range theory of the 
case.&nbsp; As a result, lacking continuity, cohesiveness and direction, the defense 
became <em>pro forma</em> and predictably ineffective, to the prejudice of the 
accused-appellant.&nbsp; I do not think this is the kind of protection envisioned in 
the Bill of Rights when it unequivocally assures the accused that he shall have 
the right to be heard by himself and counsel. </p>

<p align="center"><em>DISSENTING</em></p>
<p><strong>MELENCIO-HERRERA,<em> J.</em></strong>, </p>
<p>It is my view that teachery attended the commission of the crime. The victim 
was stabbed while lying on his back on a table conversing with appellant, 
unarmed. He was unware of appellant's criminal intention; he was stabbed all of 
a sudden, without warning; he was full unprepared at the time of the attack and 
was in no position to defend himself. The fact that the killing was not 
pre-planned did not make the offense any less treacherous. Admittedly, appellant 
was "attracted" by the prone position of the victim. Thereupon, he consciously 
employed a mode of attack which tended directly and specifically to insure his 
criminal objective without risk to hinself arising from any defense which the 
offended party might have made. </p></div>
