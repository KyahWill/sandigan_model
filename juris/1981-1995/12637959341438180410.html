were charged in the Regional Trial Court, 4th Judicial Region, BRANCH XXXIV, <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna, with murder, in <span class="GramE">an
information</span> which reads:</p>

San <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, the

<p class="BODY">The accused <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumanglas</span> eluded arrest and is at large.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, trial proceeded only as against the
accused <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> <span class="SpellE">Petil</span> who is
now appealing from the decision finding him guilty and sentencing him to suffer
the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and

the front of them, stabbed <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> several times,

<p class="BODY">The records of the case show that the findings of facts of the
trial court are supported by convincingly credible evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant has failed to show reversible
error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense is one of alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He passes the blame to his co-accused <span class="SpellE">Lumanglas</span> who is at large.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He also narrates a story of torture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to <span class="SpellE">Petil</span>, as foreman-carpenter, on <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1979</st1:date>, he was at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bitin</span>, Bay, Laguna, supervising the work at the Philippine
Infrastructure, Inc. (PII).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started
to work at <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 A.M.</st1:time>, and stayed up to
<st1:time minute="0" hour="6">6:00 A.M.</st1:time>, the following day, working
overtime, because the Ministry of Energy needed the place as a landing pad for
helicopters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="20" hour="8">8:20</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1979</st1:date>, while he was supervising work
inside the batching plant of the PII, the deceased <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> Valle came and inquired from him about the form
lumber he was asking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
allegedly told him to see Engineer <span class="SpellE">Luinario</span> as the
form lumber is not his and he cannot decide on the request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> then
cursed <span class="SpellE">Donato</span>, and holding the latter's shirt collar,
pushed him, causing him to fall to the ground face down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> then
challenged him to a fight which he did not accept.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the two were separated, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span> arrived telling the appellant that his
brother-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumanglas</span>,
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="GramE">del</span>
Valle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>
also advised him to leave and go home for fear that the relatives of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> might retaliate against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Petil</span> rode on a
truck together with Antonio <span class="SpellE">Maranan</span> and proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, where he
alighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He spent the night at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> San Felix, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas,
and then proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, where he took a truck
to <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span> City and then boarded another vehicle to <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> City arriving at <span class="SpellE">Kumintang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> at about
4:30 A.M., of February 5, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While

a jeep, wherein Sgt. Angel <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle, Cesar <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Pugela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dondon</span> Arellano were on board, arrived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle
hog-tied him to a post of the jeep and brought him to the Constabulary
Headquarters at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the way Sgt. <span class="GramE">del</span>
Valle poked a gun at his temple and pressed the trigger but it failed to fire,
so Sgt. del Valle hit him with the same gun in the chest and he lost
consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He regained consciousness

where Sgt. <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle inquired from his father whether <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> was already dead.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The father, mother, wife and sister of <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
ganged up on him, dealing blows and hitting his head against the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> post.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle again hit him with his gun and he lost
consciousness a second time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He regained
consciousness only when they were already at <span class="SpellE">Maraoy</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lipa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was brought to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sto</span></span><span style="">. </span>Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
where he was mauled by CAT students at the prod­ding of Sgt. <span class="GramE">del</span>
Valle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, he was taken to the house
of <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle at San
Felix, <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Batangas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
where he was threatened with death, intimidated and later paraded around the
barrio by relatives of the de­ceased announcing him as a criminal before he was
turned over to the Bay Police authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is already a settled rule that alibi is a weak defense for it
is easy of fabrication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v.
Ragas, 44 SCRA 152; People v. Mori, 55 SCRA 382; People v. <span class="SpellE">Dereje</span>,
56 SCRA 554; People v. <span class="SpellE">Zapatero</span>, 58 SCRA 450; and
People v. Coronado, G.R. No. 68932, Oct. 28, 1986).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the defense of alibi to prosper, it is
not enough to prove that the accused was somewhere when the crime was committed
but that he must likewise demonstrate that it was physically impossible for him
to have been at the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Benaraba</span>, 129 SCRA 266; People v. <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, 37 SCRA 601; People v. Diaz, 55 SCRA 178; People v.
<span class="SpellE">Turalba</span>, 55 SCRA 697; People v. <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>,
57 SCRA 114; People v. Cortez, 57 SCRA 308; and People v. Coronado, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, taking into consideration the distance of 250
meters (trial court's finding) from the batching plant, where the appellant
claims he was supervising his men when the stabbing incident happened, to the
scene of the crime, the possibility of his physically being at the latter site
is beyond question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, alibi cannot prevail over the positive
identification of prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, 135 SCRA 84; People v. <span class="SpellE">Nepomuceno</span>, 136 SCRA 556; People v. Jones, 137 SCRA 166;

138 SCRA 221; People v. <span class="SpellE">Gani</span>, 139 SCRA 301; and
People v. Coronado, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
appellant was distinctly and positively identified by eyewitnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cesar <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> saw
appellant stabbing the victim and was so surprised by the suddenness of the
attack that he exclaimed, "<span class="SpellE">Bakit</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyo</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span> <span class="SpellE">sinaksak</span>?"</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged beatings and <span class="SpellE">maulings</span> he
claims to have received from a peace officer, students, and other per­sons have
nothing to do with the credibility of the wit­nesses who testified against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also faults the trial court's conclusion of conspiracy
between him and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Lumanglas</span>
despite an alleged absolute lack of proof.</p>

<p class="BODY">A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement
to commit a crime and decide to commit it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(Revised Penal Code, Art. 8; People v. Rojas, G.R.
Nos.</span> L-46960-62, Jan. 8, 1987; People v. <span class="SpellE">Ogapay</span>,

122 SCRA 815; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Veloso</span>, G.R. Nos.
38551-53, Feb. 27, 1987).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is
desirable that the conspiracy be proved by direct evidence, like an express
understanding among the plotters affirming their commitment and defin­ing their
respective roles, it may nevertheless be established at times by circumstantial
evidence only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Rojas, <u>supra</u>;

<span class="SpellE">Lumanglas</span> are brothers-in-law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attack by <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lumanglas</span> on the victim was simul­taneous with the
appellant's holding and stabbing <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle from
behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the stabbing incident,
there was an altercation between the appellant and <span class="GramE">del</span>
Valle where­in the latter pushed the appellant causing him to fall to the
ground, face down, yet, the appellant did not accept the challenge of del Valle
to a fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's bold attack
on <span class="GramE">del</span> Valle was only made later when the assurance of
assistance from his brother-in-law was pre­sent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances indicate conspiracy
