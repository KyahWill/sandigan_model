penalty provided for by law and to pay the costs."</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant and his brothers Jose and <span class="SpellE">Pludino</span>,
likewise surnamed Romero, were charged with murder for the death of the
deceased Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">gravamen</span> of the
accusation is set forth in the information thus:</p>

Honorable Court, the above-named accused, confederating together and helping
each other, with evident <span class="SpellE">premiditation</span> and treachery,
did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously
attack, assault and stab with their bolos, one <span class="SpellE">Charlito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Relano</span>, who was then sleeping, thereby inflicting
upon the latter serious wounds on the right chest and at the left wrist, which
injuries directly caused his death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On April 27, 1966, the municipal court of Milagros, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> issued the corresponding warrants of arrest against
the Romero brothers, but only Jose Romero was taken into custody on May 2,
1966, his co-accused having eluded arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial of Jose Romero was then commenced with the prosecution
presenting the testimony of Dr. Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Garde</span>,
municipal health officer of Milagros, who con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

witness for the prosecution, is succinctly summarized by the Solicitor General
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon of April 25, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Laguerta</span>, mother-in-law
of the deceased Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>, was in their house
located in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calawanan</span>,
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bangad</span>, Municipality of Milagros, <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that
time, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Laguerta</span> was
lying awake on the floor upstairs, while <span class="SpellE">Ena</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagunsan</span>, mother of her son-in-law, was picking lice from
her (<span class="SpellE">Filomena's</span>) hair (pp. 10, 14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, July 5, 1972, <span class="SpellE">Zurbito</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two women were just outside the room
where Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> and his wife Elena <span class="SpellE">Prasmo</span> (<span class="SpellE">Filomena's</span> daughter) were
then sleeping, the door to which room was open because the house had no locks
(pp. 7, 8, 11, 14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Elena was then a newly-delivered mother (pp.
6, 11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moments later, the two accused, <span class="SpellE">Pludino</span>
Romero and <span class="SpellE">Welmo</span> Romero, entered the aforesaid house,
both armed with bolos, known as '<span class="SpellE">talibong</span>'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two men proceeded upstairs, entered the
room of the couple Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> and Elena <span class="SpellE">Prasmo</span> and then <span class="SpellE">Pludino</span> stabbed
Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>, who was still sleeping, on the left
breast just above the nipple (pp. 11-12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.),
followed by <span class="SpellE">Welmo</span> Romero who also stabbed Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> in the right breast (pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

again hit him on the left wrist (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> shouted:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>'Mother, you get away, you might be included' (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Elena <span class="SpellE">Prasmo</span> was still asleep as
her husband was being assaulted by the two accused, and it was only when she
woke up that she noticed that her husband's assailants had left the house (pp.
6, 9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The three women, <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>, Elena
and <span class="SpellE">Ena</span>, then tried to carry the wounded Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> down the house, and in so doing, their clothes were
covered with blood coming from his wounds (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">managed to bring the wounded man to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>
of Milagros, but it was too far for them to reach any doctor, <span class="SpellE">Relano's</span> wife just tried to treat her husband with local
medicine, thinking that his wounds were not too serious (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> died that same day, at about 6 p.m.
(pp. 8, 11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, July 5, 1972).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, the three women went to the
municipal building of Milagros, and asked the help of the municipal judge for
the purpose of filing the charge against the assailants of Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

Romero, fetched <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Laguerta</span>
and Elena <span class="SpellE">Prasmo</span> from their residence in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Bangad</span>, informing them that they were to sign an affidavit,

the office of Vice-Governor Jesus C. <span class="SpellE">Almero</span>, where an
affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. '1', p. 188, Records) was read to
them, partly in English and partly in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span>
dialect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
claimed she did not understand the portion of the affidavit read to her in
English because she never went to school, while as to the portion read to her
in the <span class="SpellE">Visayan</span> dialect, she understood the same as
having to do with the promise of <span class="SpellE">Welmo</span> Romero to give
her the amount of P500.00 (pp. 16-18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused, <span class="SpellE">Welmo</span>
Romero, admitted his promise to give <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Laguerta</span> P500.00 in the presence of the provincial guard,
Labastida (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.), for which he signed and
issued to the two women the receipt, Exhibit 'C' (pp. 175-176, Records; pp.
18-19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the signing of said affidavit, <span class="SpellE">Welmo</span>,
however, gave the two women only P150.00 (pp. 17, 19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the office of the
Vice-Governor, the two women were brought down to the office of Special
Counsel, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Duquino</span>, before whom they subscribed
to the said affidavit, Exhibit '1' (p. 19, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
id.)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">For his part, appellant
denied any participation in the slaying of Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Setting up the defense of alibi, he stated

clinic of Dr. Castro in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of Milagros,
Arturo having been stabbed earlier that morning by the brothers Charlie and <span class="SpellE">Joselito</span>, both surnamed <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>;
and that appellant and his mother kept watch over Arturo in said clinic until
the latter died three days later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Ragasa</span>, who corroborated her

stabbed by the <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> brothers, she and her son <span class="SpellE">Welmo</span> brought Arturo to the clinic of Dr. Castro in

that while he was in the house of Charlie in the afternoon of April 25, 1966, <span class="SpellE">Pludino</span> Romero, appellant's brother, arrived at said house,
entered the room where Charlie was sleeping and there and then stabbed the

appellant were <span class="SpellE">barrio<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">mates</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">; </span>and they had known each other for a

<p class="BODY">The appellant's contention that the trial court erred in
predicating his conviction solely on the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Laguerta</span>, the lone eye-witness presented by the

the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">But while appellant had succeeded in convincing the relatives of
the deceased to compromise the case, it appears that the charge was not
ultimately dismissed because appellant, after having made an initial payment of
P150.00, failed to pay the balance of the amount indicated in his promissory
note.</p>

<p class="BODY">It seems needless to add that in criminal cases which are not

In the case at bar, it appears that the victim and the appellant were residents
of barrio <span class="SpellE">Bangad</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Milagros</st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Masbate</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The short distance between their houses and the clinic of Dr. Castro in
the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of Milagros does not obviate the
possibility of the appellant being at the scene of the crime at the time of its
commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Asuncion <span class="SpellE">Ragasa</span>
corroborating her son's alibi deserves little probative value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is undeniably tainted with bias for it
springs from the natural desire of a mother to exculpate her son from criminal
liability.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Likewise, We entertain
serious doubt as to the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Florido</span> <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>, Charlie's brother who testified for the
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It took him more than six (6)
years to tell his story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the tragic
day of </span><st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 14.0pt">April 25, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">
up to the time he testified in open court on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">July 5, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> he had not informed either his relatives or
the police authorities of his alleged presence at the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly observed by the trial court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The court cannot give weight to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Florido</span> <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>, brother of the
deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he claimed to be pre­sent
at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission, such is not supported
by the evidence before this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Laguerta</span> and Elena <span class="SpellE">Prasmo</span> who were there never mentioned <span class="SpellE">Florido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Relano</span> as being present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent events did not show that he
ever took any interest as would be expected of a brother for another brother in
dire straits, as Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> was at that
time."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Garde</span>
is inadmissible in evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support
thereof, it is argued that, since Dr. <span class="SpellE">Garde's</span>
testimony was given during the trial of his co-accused Jose Romero, the
admission thereof by the trial court violated his constitutional right to be
confronted by the witnesses against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We find no necessity to dwell at length on the issue thus raised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It suffices to state that even if Dr. <span class="SpellE">Garde's</span> declarations were discarded, as urged by appellant,
the nature and location of the injuries sustained by the deceased<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as the fact of his death<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
had been sufficiently established by <span class="SpellE">Filomena</span> <span class="SpellE">Laguerta</span> and Elena <span class="SpellE">Prasmo</span>, who
testified and were cross-examined during the appellant's trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The admission of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Garde's</span>
testimony did not, therefore, materially affect the appellant's constitutional
right.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the crime committed by the appellant
was murder, qualified by treachery, the fatal injuries having been inflicted
while the victim was asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">The </span>Solicitor General however
recommends the imposition of the death penalty as the offense was perpetrated
in the victim's dwelling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree that
the crime was aggravated by "dwelling." It is, however, undisputed
that in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">early morning of the
incident, Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span> and his brother <span class="SpellE">Joselito</span> inflicted serious injuries on Arturo </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Romero, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">appel­lant's brother</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> and that as a result thereof the latter died
three (3) days later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In attacking
Charlie <span class="SpellE">Relano</span>, appellant doubtless acted in
vindication of a grievous offense committed by the deceased against the
appellant's brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance,
which must be appreciated in favor of appellant, offsets the aggravating
circumstance of "dwelling."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
