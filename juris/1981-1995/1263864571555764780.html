<p class="BODY">On March 5, 1982, the National Federation of Labor (NFL) of which
<span class="SpellE">Estioca</span> was president, filed a petition for direct

administrative and supervisory <span class="SpellE">personnels</span> which is an
appropriate bargaining" unit (See petition in G.R. No. 67343).</p>

<p class="BODY">Over the Company's opposition, the Med Arbiter on <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1982</st1:date>, directly certified
the NFL as the sole and exclusive bargaining representative of all the
monthly-salaried employees of the Company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Company appealed but it was dismissed by the Bureau of Labor
Relations (BLR).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It filed a petition for

boycott the sports event.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
announcement authored by him, reads:</p>

that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion in holding that the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Estioca</span> was illegal; that the company committed unfair
labor practice; that the strike on May 23, 1982 was lawful, and that hence, the
Company should reinstate the strikers including <span class="SpellE">Estioca</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complying with Our resolution ordering the respondents to comment
on the petition, the private respondents filed a comment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General filed no comment for

<p class="BODY">After carefully considering the pleadings of both parties, <span class="GramE">We</span> are not persuaded to grant the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's allegation that <span class="SpellE">Estioca's</span>
position as personnel supervisor was <span class="GramE">managerial</span> in
nature was not denied by <span class="SpellE">Estioca</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As next-in-rank to the personnel manager, he
performed, in the latter's absence, the duties and functions of that
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was authorized to sign and
approve sick leaves and vacation leaves of the employees, to hire employees (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 12 and 14), discipline them, give them assignments,
and prepare their work schedules, special trips, and operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had no less than 17 employees under his
direct supervision (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 22).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of <span class="SpellE">Estioca's</span> managerial
position, the Company contends that its loss of trust and confidence in him was
a lawful cause for his dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
argues that <span class="SpellE">Estioca's</span> act of posting a scathing and
hostile announcement in the Company's cafeteria, falsely denouncing the Company
for its supposed extravagance and fomenting discontent and resentment among the
employees on account of the Company's supposed indifference to their claim for
increased living allowance, were acts of disloyalty to the management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Although
<span class="SpellE">Estioca</span> later apologized for his "intemperate
language" and "impetuous action," which he admitted exceeded
"the bounds of tolerable dissent which management has the right to reprove
or correct," and expressed regret for "the difficult situation that I
have created for the management" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 23, p.
19, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), the company was not appeased.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other issue that addresses itself to this Court is whether

<p class="BODY">The rationale of this <span class="GramE">prohibition,</span> is
that once jurisdiction over the dispute has been properly acquired by competent
