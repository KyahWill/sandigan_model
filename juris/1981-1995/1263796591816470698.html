Midland Courier, a weekly newspaper published and edited in the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> and which is of wide

8781.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The complaint alleged, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that both the petition for foreclosure and the notice of public auction sale
published in the '<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Midland Courier' have
neither legal nor factual bases, because (1) while the credit line was availed
of from time to time in different amounts by promissory notes, the credits and
loans obtained were dully paid in 1968 and since then no further loans were
availed of under the credit line secured by mortgage of the plaintiffs' properties;
(2) the plaintiffs' alleged indebtedness mentioned in the defendant's petition
for foreclosure and in the consequent notice of public auction sale was the
balance due on a 'clean loan' granted by the defendant to Antonio Co Kit,
although admittedly the promissory note was cosigned by plaintiff Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>, and the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>same
was a distinct and separate transaction from the plaintiffs' credit line, and
was not covered nor secured by the plaintiffs' properties mortgaged to the
defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint further <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">alleged that the publication of the notice of
public auction sale in the '<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Midland Courier'
was malicious and/or with deliberate intent, or was due to gross negligence,
causing the plaintiffs, who are respected members of the community of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, untold mental and moral anguish, serious
anxiety, besmirched reputation and social humiliation; that as a result of his
social humiliation, anxiety, mental and moral anguish, plaintiff Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> suffered serious heart attack and was hospitalized
and confined in bed for a period of one year, causing him to incur hospitalization
and medical expenses, and resulting in the loss of his income from his medical
practice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs ask for actual
or compensatory, moral and exemplary damages, as well as attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In its answer with <span class="SpellE">conterclaim</span>, the
People's Bank and Trust Company contended that in filing the petition for
extra-judicial foreclosure of the mortgage with the consequent publication of
notice of public auction sale, it merely exercised its legal right as
creditor-mortgagee after plaintiff Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> had
defaulted, despite repeated demands, in the payment of the indebtedness or
obligation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">contracted by him </span>jointly
and severally with Antonio <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">Co Kit; that
</span>in exercising such right, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">it
acted lawfully, in </span>good faith and with full <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">justificatio</span>n<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt"> to protect
</span>its interest; and, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">affirmative
defense, alleged that, </span>contrary to plaintiffs' allegations, the
Commercial Credit Agreement and Mortgagee provides that the mortgage shall
continue as security for the payment of the indebtedness therein contracted by
the mortgagors, 'as well as security for the repayment of any other sums x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (then or thereafter) owing to
the said mortgagee in addition to or aside from the credit facilities (therein)
granted by the Mortgagee to the Mortgagors; and that plaintiff Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao's</span> <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> obligation upon
the promissory note signed by him as co-maker jointly and severally with
Antonio Co Kit constitutes a further obligation secured by the aforementioned
mortgage, in addition to the indebtedness arising from the commercial credit
line, which additional obligation was subsisting at the time the extrajudicial
foreclosure proceeding was commenced.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the issues had been joined upon the filing of the
answer to the counterclaim and reply to answer, the case was set for pre-trial.</blockquote>

Manila rendered a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of
which read as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The creditor bank insists that the promissory note co-signed by

mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, he may pursue
either of the two remedies, but not both.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As explained by the Court, the rule is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"For non-payment of a note secured by mortgage, the creditor
has a single cause of action against the debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This single cause of action consists in the
recovery of the credit with execution of the security.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the creditor in his action
may make two demands, the payment of the debt and the foreclosure of the
mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But both demands arise from
the same cause, the non-payment of the debt, and, for that reason, they
constitute a single cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Though the debt and the mortgage constitute separate agreements, the latter
is subsidiary to the former, and both refer to one and the same obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently there exists only once cause of
action for a single breach of that obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Plaintiff, then, by applying the rule above stated cannot split up his
single cause of action by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">filing </span>a
complaint for payment of the debt, and thereafter another complaint for
foreclosure of the mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he does
so, the filing of the first complaint will bar the subsequent complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By allowing the creditor to file two separate
complaints simultaneously or successively, one to recover his credit and
another to foreclose his mortgage, we will, in effect, be authorizing him
plural redress for a single breach of contract at much cost to the courts and
with so much vexation and oppression to the debtor.</blockquote>

v. Enriquez, 24 Phil. 584) and obnoxious to law and equity (Osorio v. San
Agustin, 25 Phil. 404), but also in subjecting the defendant to the vexation of

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the prior recourse of the creditor bank in filing a
civil action against the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> spouses and
subsequently resorting to the complaint of foreclosure proceedings, are not
only a demonstration of the prohibited splitting up of a cause of action but
also of the resulting vexation and oppression to the debtor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the lower court and the Court of Appeals found that the
People's Bank and Trust Co. (succeeded by the Bank of the Philippine Islands)
acted unlawfully and without justification in extra-judicially foreclosing the
disputed mortgage and hence the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> spouses are
entitled to damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">basis </span>for
actual damages, the lower court relied on the testimonies of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> and Dr. Rodolfo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Perez
</span>and the medical certificates of the various doctors and came out with
the award of actual and compensatory damages in the total amount of P14,290.00
in favor of the same spouses, computed as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) P1<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">,290.00
representing </span>medical and hospitalization expenses of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> while confined at the Manila Medical Center from
October 1 to October 12, 1972; (2) P7,000.00 as costs for various examinations;
and (3) P6,000.00 supposed to be the amount of income lost by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> from his medical practice because of this incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the evidence as correctly appreciated by the Court of Appeals
shows that the first mild heart attack suffered by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>
occurred in October 1977 or more than seven months after the initial
publication of the notice of foreclosure sale and the second heart attack <span class="SpellE">occured</span> in October 1978 or more than 19 months after said
publication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No less important is the
fact that Dr. Rodolfo Perez, the regular attending physician of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> and the latter's own witness, testified to the
effect, that aforesaid heart attacks were the natural result or outgrowth of a
chronic rheumatic heart disease of long standing which developed over a period
of years, possibly even before 1966.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Decision D.A. G.R. No. 59865-R; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">The second item was found to be unsupported by evidence while as
to the third item, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> did not testify to
prove the alleged lost income.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<u>Ibid</u>, p. 37).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> v. Court of Appeals (131
SCRA 127 [1984]) the Court ruled that an alleged loss of income is not recoverable
for being speculative if no receipt or any kind of evidence on the matter is
presented to prove it.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has ruled that actual or compensatory damages are
"those recoverable because of pecuniary loss in business, trade, property,
profession, job or occupation and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">the
same must be proved, otherwise if the proof is flimsy and non-substantial, no
damages will be given.</span>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> <span class="GramE">(Perfecto v. Gonzales, 128 SCRA 640 [1984]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">More specifically in
point to the case at bar, the Court has said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the rule that even if the complaint filed by one against the other is clearly
unfounded this does not necessarily mean, in the absence of specific facts
proving damages, that said defendant really suffered actual damages over and
above attorney's fees and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court cannot rely on its speculations as to the fact and amount of
damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must depend on actual proof
of the damages alleged to have been suffered." </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">(<u>Ibid</u>, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, moral damages may be recovered if they are the
proximate result of the defendant's wrongful act or omission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assessment of such damages, except liquidated
ones, is left to the discretion of the court, according to the circumstances of
the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Baylon</span>, 129 SCRA 63 [1984]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, the filing alone of the foreclosure
application should not be a ground for an award of moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, however, the main bone of contention is not
only the filing of the petition for foreclosure proceedings but the manner in
which the same was carried out, such as the publication of the notice of
extrajudicial foreclosure and sale at public auction in a Sunday edition of the
<span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Midland Courier in the society page, instead
of in the "legal notices" or "classified ads" sections as
usual in these types of notices, in extraordinarily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">large and boxed advertisements, which allegedly bespoke the bank's
malicious intent to embarrass and harass the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>
spouses which actuations are contrary to the canons of conduct provided for in
Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Comment, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 67)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both the lower court and the Court of Appeals took cognizance of
the spouses' mental anguish, serious anxiety and besmirched reputation
traceable to the unfortunate publication (Record <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on </span>Appeal, p. 79; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 38).</p>

<p class="BODY">For moral damages, the lower court awarded P100<span class="GramE">,00.00</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span>but the Court of Appeals reduced said
amount to P30,000.00 and attorney's fees from P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">20,000.00 </span>to P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have laid down the rule that the fairness of the award of
damages by the trial court also calls for appellate determination (Luzon
Concrete Products Inc. v. Court of Appeals, 135 SCRA 456 [1985]), such that
where the award of moral damages is far too excessive compared to the actual
losses sustained by the claimants, the former may be reduced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Siguenza</span> v. Court
of Appeals, 137 SCRA 577-579).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="GramE">We</span> have held that reduction of moral damages <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">is </span>justified where the negligence of
