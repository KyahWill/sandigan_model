<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The sole issue to be

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petition must be

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is firmly settled that
in an unlawful dismissal case, the employer has the burden of proving the

did show that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> was not in his
workplace on 17 May 1982, the day the strike was declared and went into effect,
as well as on 24 May 1982, </span>the day the return-to-work order became
effective; actually, petitioner himself so stated in his pleadings before the
POEA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>able to make out (even if only
by petitioner's own statements) <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> case that petitioner had joined in the strike and had failed to
comply with the return-to-work order of Director <span class="SpellE">Imson</span>,
which constituted grounds for holding petitioner liable for breach of his
contract of employment and hence for dismissing him from his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted, however, that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> showed, by a letter dated 4 January 1983 of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Consunji's</span> project-nurse, that he had been
afflicted with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">severe </span>skin rashes for sometime and that he had reported at the
Company clinic thrice <u>before</u> 17 May 1982 and visited the same clinic
five (5) times <u>after</u> 21 May 1982, for treatment and medication.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> denied participation in the strike
and disclaimed any intent to defy the return-to-work order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated that on 17 May 1982, he went to the
Company clinic and thereafter returned to his quarters but that the
project-nurse had failed to include 17 May 1982 among the dates he had gone to
the Company clinic.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">while </span>petitioner's
evidence (as distinguished from his pleadings) did not show affirmatively that
he had indeed visited the Company clinic on 17 May 1982, it appears to the
Court that petitioner submitted on at least a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> basis
an adequate explanation for his absence from his work station on the day the
strike began <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and the day the
return-to-work order went effective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner, in other words, offset or <span class="SpellE">negatived</span>
the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> case made out by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span> for a lawful dismissal:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the balance of evidence thus moved to
equipoise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But equipoise is not enough; the employer must <u>affirmatively</u>
show rationally adequate evidence that the dismissal was for a justifiable
cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The burden of proof in effect
moved back to and once again rested on respondent <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>,
the employer asserting the existence of a just cause for dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This burden of proof <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>
did not discharge.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>large and
well organized company, <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span> may be presumed to
have kept personnel records showing, e.g., which employees were present or
absent for work on particular days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No
records were submitted in evidence to show whether or not petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> reported for work or went on sick call on or between
the dates he went to the clinic for treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is contended that <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> skin rashes were
not debilitating and not sufficient to explain his failure to report for work;
but no certificate or statement relating to the medical or physiological nature
and effect of those rashes, or to the cause thereof, was presented by employer <span class="SpellE">Consunji's</span> counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, even should competent proof of the
"non-debilitating" character of <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
skin rashes have been put into the record, such would not necessarily have
shown intent to participate in the strike to defy Director <span class="SpellE">Imson's</span>
order; such proof would have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">consistent
with, for instance, laziness and gold-bricking on <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The list of the strikers' names
made on the project site while the strike was in progress was similarly, and
conspicuously, not submitted in evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span> to discharge
the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">onus <span class="SpellE">probandi</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>resting on it, must be taken <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>conjunction
with its conceded failure to conduct an investigation on the project site
before serving <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> his notice of termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be supposed that the carrying out of
such an investigation on site before <span class="GramE">repatriation,</span>
would not have been easy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="GramE">petitioner was entitled under our law to an investigation where he
would be informed of the charges against him and have</span> an opportunity to
present his defense or explanation before being dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is at stake in such a case is not simply
a property right but also the employee's means of livelihood.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Besides, if an investigation had been conducted, <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>
might well have been convinced by <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span>
explanation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that private respondent <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>
had failed to show that justifiable cause had attended petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dizon's</span> dismissal and that public respondent <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> decision relieving <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>
of liability for such dismissal was not supported by <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">susbtantial</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>evidence of record and hence
