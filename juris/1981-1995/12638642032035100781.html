				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These consolidated cases relate to various incidents in the long
running dispute between the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Eufrocino</span> and
Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> regarding the operation of a restaurant
within the Hidden Valley Springs Resort in <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>,
Laguna.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the instant petitions filed by the petitioners arise from
the <span class="SpellE">the</span> same factual antecedents and are bound by
petitioners' singular intent of enjoining private respondents from operating
the restaurant at the Hidden Valley Springs Resort.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be clear, however, that the issue as
to who has the legal right to operate the subject restaurant is not for this
Court to decide in these petitions, for such issue is the crux of the appeal
pending before the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
the present, the Court is only called upon to determine whether or not grave
abuse of discretion as would vitiate the jurisdiction of the public respondents
and would warrant the annulment of their assailed resolutions and/or orders,
was committed.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">FACTS OF THE CASE</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner corporation, Heirs of Eugenia V. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
Inc. (hereinafter referred to as HEVR), was incorporated on December 4, 1962 by
the late <span class="SpellE">Eufrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
and his seven children (Pedro, <span class="SpellE">Benigna</span>, <span class="SpellE">Julita</span>, Antonio, Ramon, Victoria and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span>),
with the primary purpose of owning and developing the properties of <span class="SpellE">Eufrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and the estate of
his late wife, Dona Eugenia V. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, located in the
Province of Laguna.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Benigna</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Julita</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, Victoria R.
Vallarta, Juanita <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> and Margarita R. <span class="SpellE">Tioseco</span> are some of the surviving heirs of <span class="SpellE">Eufrocino</span> and Eugenia <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1971, its articles of incorporation were amended to include
the operation of a resort among its purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In early 1972, it opened to the public the Hidden Valley Springs Resort,
situated in <span class="SpellE">Calauan</span>, Laguna.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Eufrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
was Chairman of the Board of Directors and President of HEVR until the time of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">his </span>death on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>One of his sons, <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span>, a director, was
manager of the resort until his death in 1980.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also succeeded his father as President upon the latter's demise.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents are the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rebecca
Boyer-<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, his wife; Guillermo Luis and Maria <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, his children; and Judith <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
his daughter-in-law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
and his family had been exclusively operating the restaurant and liquor
concession at the resort under an "Agreement" dated May 27, 1975
executed between <span class="SpellE">Eufrocino</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
as President of HEVR, and <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, in his behalf and that of his family.</p>

<p class="BODY">When <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
was taken ill a few months before his death, Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
took it upon himself to take over all the corporate duties and assume the
authority of his father pertaining to the resort.</p>

<p class="BODY">After <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>'
death on <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1980</st1:date>,
private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondents </span>continued
the operations of the restaurant and liquor concession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1981, they incorporated under the name
"Hidden Valley <span class="SpellE">Agri</span>-Business and Restaurant,
Inc." (<span class="GramE">hereinafter</span> referred to as HVABR), and
through this entity they continued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>carry
on the concession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The HEVR held <span class="GramE">a stockholders</span>' and Board
of Directors' meeting on <st1:date year="1981" day="31" month="1">January 31,
 1981</st1:date>, elected members of the Board and appointed officers of the
corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Board then set up <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>management committee and commenced
an inquiry into the financial status of the resort, requiring Guillermo <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> to submit documents relative to its earnings and
expenditures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Steps were subsequently
taken to restrict private respondents' previously unlimited access to the
corporate funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not surprisingly,
private respondents were defiant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Board meeting of <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1981</st1:date>, the treasurer of HEVR reported that the income of the
resort could not satisfy its payroll requirements and loan amortizations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appeared that the resort's financial
difficulty was due to the fact that the biggest profit center, the restaurant
therein, was not managed and operated by HEVR itself and that the concession
fee paid by private respondents was not even enough to pay for the interest and
amortizations on the loan secured by HEVR to upgrade the restaurant and kitchen
facilities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was suggested that HEVR
should take over the operation of the restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Board of Directors adopted
Resolution No. 3-81 authorizing the President to notify HVABR of its intent to
take over the operation of the restaurant, and in the event the latter refuses
or fails to peaceably vacate the premises within thirty (30) days from notice,
to close the resort for an indefinite period of time to prevent further losses
to the corporation, and finally to order a financial, legal and management
audit of the operations of the resort [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, G.R.
No. 67195, p. 99.] The President then sent a letter dated <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1981</st1:date> to private respondents informing
them of the above resolution, and asking them to vacate the restaurant premises
and to turn over possession thereof to HEVR.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents consequently filed on <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="9">September 18, 1981</st1:date> an action for injunction with
a prayer for preliminary injunction and/or restraining order against HEVR and
the other petitioners, including Rafael J. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, in
the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of <st1:city><st1:place>San Pablo</st1:place></st1:city>,
Laguna, docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">SP-1920, to prevent the
closure of the resort and the unilateral termination by HEVR of the concession
agreement.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, in their answer, prayed for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the dismissal of </span>the complaint, the
declaration of the nullity of the concession agreement, and for an order
requiring private respondents to vacate and surrender the restaurant premises.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, HVABR filed with the Bureau of Tourism Services
of the Ministry of Tourism (MOT) a petition to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">increase </span>the food and beverage prices at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">resort restaurant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>HEVR, being <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the ho</span>lder of a license to operate the resort, contested this
petition by impugning the authority of HVABR to file the petition and to
continue operating the restaurant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending resolution of <span class="SpellE">HVABR's</span> petition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span>the MOT, the RTC, on <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="6">June 13, 1983</st1:date>, dismissed private
respondents' complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The concession
agreement between <span class="SpellE">Eriberto</span> and <span class="SpellE">Eufrocino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> was declared null and void for being <b><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ultra</span></u></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">With the decision of the trial court to support them, HEVR
immediately caused the temporary closure of the resort.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that the implication of this restraining order
was to prohibit private respondent from operating the subject restaurant and to
affirm the right of petitioner to operate the restaurant, pending resolution of
G.R. No. 67195.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is unsound.</p>

respondents' prayer to enjoin petitioner from closing the restaurant,
disturbing the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><u>status</u></b> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><u>quo</u></b> and frustrating, impeding,
obstructing, disturbing or interfering with private respondent's right to
operate the restaurant and liquor concession.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, this Court's restraining order had the effect of
staying the writ of preliminary injunction and permitting petitioner to close
the resort over and above the protests of private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did not <b><u>ipso</u></b> <b><u>facto</u></b>
create and affirm a right on the part of petitioner to operate the restaurant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, considering the thrust of the above holding, it is
appropriate at this point to declare petitioner's motion to cite private
respondent in contempt filed in G.R. No. 67195, charging as contumacious the
act of private respondent in applying for a restaurant license with the DOT
under the business name MJBFS (in order to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
