 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>, he was
already at the cockpit to bet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
cockfight had started at <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He bet once only and he
won.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased received his (<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>) bet of P10.00, the former being the collector <span style="">(<u>'<span class="SpellE">tenedor</span>’</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The deceased was a gaffer and at the
same time, a bet collector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
winning, he asked the money he won from the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the deceased said to him, "You did
not give anything to me." He insisted in asking the amount that he
won.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased got angry and boxed
him hitting him in the abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon when he was boxed
by the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He felt the pain and
walked away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased is robust and
a big man while he is very thin and weak.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he went towards the nearby restaurant and got a kitchen
knife for self-protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, he
proceeded to the deceased reiterating his demand for the bet <span style="">that he </span>had allegedly won.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased <span style="">got </span>something from his pocket and the accused thought that it
was the money he won.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it turned out
to be a “<span class="SpellE"><u>tari</u></span>” (gaff).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased told <span style="">him that this ("<span class="SpellE"><u>tari</u></span>") </span>will
be the one he would give the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Then, the deceased <span class="SpellE">thrusted</span> that gaff towards
his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, he was able to
evade said thrust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got his knife and <span class="SpellE">thrusted</span> it against the deceased's body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There were many persons when he stabbed the
deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stabbed the deceased only
in self-defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not stab the
deceased while the latter was squatting.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not stab the deceased from behind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not stab the deceased because the
latter testified before the Fiscal that he (accused) gave his knife to one <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Luga</span> to kill the son of <span style="">Luz </span><span class="SpellE">Gudito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stabbed the deceased just once in the <span style="">left </span>abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After stabbing the deceased, he ran towards
the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> councilman of <span class="SpellE">Luyo</span>
in order to surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not
surrender directly to the police <span style="">for
fear of </span>being mauled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He has no
other case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing appears that the mode of attack adopted by
appellant insured the accomplishment of his purpose without risk to
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court therefore

surrendering to the police <span style="">authorities </span>and
<span style="">he actually turned our appellant to </span>them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="">fact,
the trial court made this finding:<span style="">&nbsp;

should be credited the mitigating circumstance of "voluntary
