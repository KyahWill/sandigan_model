				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition against the resolution of the NLRC da<span style="">t</span>ed <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1985</st1:date>, was dismissed by the Court for failure
to show that the <span style="">public </span>respondent
had acted with grave abuse of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
On the petitioner's motion for reconsideration, we eventually gave due course
to the petition and required the parties to submit simultaneously their
respective memoranda.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
After re-examining the issues and the arguments of the petitioner and the
respondents in the light of the pertinent record, we find no reason to grant
the reconsideration sought or to reverse our original dismissal of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised are essentially factual and therefore within
the competence of the NLRC and the POEA to <span style="">assess </span>an<span style="">d resolve, </span>subject
to review and reversal by this Court only if the findings thereon are tainted
with arbitrariness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that
this Court is not <span style="">a <span class="SpellE">trier</span>
</span>of facts and must ordinarily rely for the determination thereof <span style="">on </span>the proceedings below.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the resolution by the public respondent of
the factual issues in the case at bar has not been demonstrated to be flawed,
it must be affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the POEA, private respondent Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> was hired by Taihei Company, Ltd., the herein
petitioner, as a Group A Chief Engineer for its vessel, the Yanbu-16.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His contract was for 18 months with a monthly
salary of US$800 plus a fixed monthly overtime pay of <span style="">US$300.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>The Crew Agreement signed by the
parties included the following provision:</p>

<blockquote>(c) all claims,
complaints or controversies relative to this Contract shall be <u><span style="">exclusively</span></u><span style=""> </span>resolved through the established grievance procedure, the
National Seamen Board; and the Philippine Court of Justice, in that order.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The term of the contract began on <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1983</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span>
left for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Saudi Arabia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to assume his duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was terminated
on <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1984</st1:date>, when he
received a notice of his dismissal from Operations Manager <span class="SpellE">Ko</span>
Sasaki of the petitioner company for various offenses enumerated in the notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The offenses included insubordination, disrespect, disobedience,
laziness, incompetence, gross misbehavior, and poor personal relations with his
co-workers, among other shortcomings.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The dismissal was based on several reports of <span class="SpellE">Grampa's</span>
superiors and complaints filed by his crew-mates, some of whom threatened to
resign if he was not replaced or transferred.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> refuted the charges against him
in his letter to Sasaki dated <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="4">April
 11, 1984</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
but he was nevertheless repatriated on <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="4">April
 21, 1984</st1:date>, after working for only 6 months and 6 days for the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon </span>his return to
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
he filed a complaint for illegal dismissal against the petitioner, which filed
its own complaint for his expatriation expenses and for attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two cases were consolidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the position papers submitted by the parties,
the POEA held in favor of the complainant and awarded him damages in "the
amount of US$12,440.14, or its equivalent in Philippine currency at the
prevailing foreign exchange rate of payment, representing unearned salaries
corresponding to the unexpired portion of the employment contract."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
On appeal, this decision was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
by the NLRC in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="12">December
 2, <span style="">1985</span></st1:date><span style="">.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We also affirm.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, in the first place, that the ruling of the POEA and the
NLRC regarding the illegality of the manner of <span class="SpellE">Grampa's</span>
dismissal cannot be faulted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not
denied that the petitioner has not complied with the above-quoted provision in
the Crew Agreement nor has it proved that there was any kind of formal
investigation of the charges against <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> or at
least <span style="">a </span>report of such
investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Independently of such stipulation, there were also the pertinent
provisions in our labor laws that were equally disregarded by the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The procedure for terminating
employment is set forth in the rules implementing BP 130 <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Notice of
Dismissal</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Any employee who seeks
to dismiss a worker shall furnish him a written notice stating the particular
acts or omission constituting the grounds for his dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases of abandonment of work, the notice
shall be served at the worker's last known address.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Answer and
Hearing</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The worker may answer the
allegations stated against him in the notice of dismissal within a reasonable
period from receipt of such notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
employer shall afford the worker ample opportunity to be heard and to defend
himself with the assistance of his representative if he so desires.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sec. 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Decision to
dismiss</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The employer shall
immediately notify a worker in writing of a decision to dismiss him stating
clearly the reasons <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner stresses that <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> was
duly notified of the charges against him in the letter dated <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1984</st1:date>, of Captain James <span class="SpellE">Milhench</span>, Chief Superintendent,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and that it was only on <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1984</st1:date>,
that the private respondent submitted his explanation to Mr. Sasaki.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no indication on the face of the
letter of the date it was received by the private respondent and of the period
within which he should answer the charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">We may suppose from the composition and grammar of his letter
that it took <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> some difficulty to write it, let
alone the fact that he apparently had no one to consult or help him, much less
a counsel to advise him at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
any rate, it is clear that <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> was not given an
opportunity to be heard and that, on the contrary, it was simply assumed, as
the letter threatened, that his silence was an admission of his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the decision to dismiss
him had already been reached on <st1:date year="1984" day="4" month="4">April
 4, 1984</st1:date>, as the action memo of that date shows,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
before <span class="SpellE">Grampa's</span> explanation was received.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the factual nature of the charges against <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span>, the least the petitioner could have done was to
remind him of the need to submit his explanation before unilaterally
pronouncing his guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The long
explanation he made clearly showed that the charges required no less than a <span style="">formal </span>investigation where he could
confront the witness against him <span style="">and </span>refute
their accusations face to face.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner now argues that even if <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span>
was not allowed such formal investigation before his dismissal, the defect was
cured when he was allowed the opportunity to be heard in the proceedings before
the POEA and the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Wenphil</span> Corporation v. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court still held the employer liable for dismissing the employee without a
formal investigation although the employee was not denied due process in the
proceedings held later before the labor arbiter and the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent compliance with procedural due
process did not wipe out the defect of its earlier denial by the employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the grounds for <span class="SpellE">Grampa's</span>
dismissal, we find that the assessment thereof by the POEA and the NLRC was
based on the copious evidence submitted by the parties and on their arguments
in their position papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with
the observation that the petitioner should not have taken 6 months to dismiss
the private respondent if his services were really unsatisfactory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That delay could have been justified if a
formal investigation was being held in the meantime, but no such investigation
was made at all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner would
have acted more swiftly if indeed <span class="SpellE">Grampa's</span>
"continued presence on board (would) endanger the machinery under his
control and adversely affect the work of other crew members."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that the charges were made by the petitioner's
employees also casts some doubt on their credibility although it is conceded
that such complaints could not have come except only from them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the nature of things, we think it is not
unlikely for an employee to defer to the requests of his employer to testify in
its favor, if only to protect his own employment, if not actually to improve
it.</p>

<p class="BODY">That is why we find especially noteworthy the certification made
by Capt. <span class="SpellE">Gemidel</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Ibabao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Grampa's</span> immediate superior, attesting that the
private respondent was a "<span class="SpellE">hardworker</span>, sincere to
his duties and <span style="">is </span>able to
maintain a harmonious relationship with his co-workers."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This was handwritten and dated <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="4">April
 11, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true
that he was one of those who signed the petition to dismiss <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span>
on <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1984</st1:date>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Ibabao</span> retracted this on <st1:date year="1984" day="2" month="5">May 2, 1984</st1:date>, and reiterated his original certification.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
This stance of <span class="SpellE">Ibabao's</span> appears to be more credible
because it was made against the interests of the petitioner at risk of his own
employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In striking contrast to the complaints against <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> are the testimonials of his qualifications submitted
by disinterested persons who did not have to be in the good graces of the
petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that they referred to his services before his employment with the
petitioner company did not mean that he had changed suddenly and drastically to
become the odious person the petitioner would portray him to be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If <span class="SpellE">Grampa</span> had
indeed acted differently later, the cause might have come from the conditions
of his new employment and the treatment he received from his superiors and
co-workers.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully considered the decision of then POEA Administrator
Patricia A. <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas (who has since been promoted
to Chairman of the Civil Service Commission) and find that her evaluation of
the evidence submitted in this case is not tainted with grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it is quite
judicious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
under Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, the factual findings in the challenged
decision are conclusive on this C<span style="">ourt </span>except
only where it is clearly shown that they were arrived <span style="">at </span>arbitrarily or in disregard of the evidence on record.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there is no such showing here, the
proceedings below must be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the motion for reconsideration is DENIED with
finality and the challenged resolution of the NLRC dated December 2, 1985, is
again AFFIRMED, with costs against the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Narvasa</span>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Griño-Aquino</span>,<span style="font-style: normal;"> and</span> <span class="SpellE">Medialdea</span>, JJ.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>
