</span>To bolster the defenseâ€™ claim of alibi, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>

met the two offended parties going towards <span class="SpellE">Itis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This piece of evidence tries to justify the
defense or alibi of the accused; that it would have been impossible for them to
have sexual intercourse with the offended parties because at the time that the

if <span class="SpellE">Tanedo</span> harbored a grudge against the company, will
he bother with the two accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has
no motive.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

an examination of her private parts if her motive was not to bring to justice
