</span>To bolster the defense’ claim of alibi, <span class="SpellE">Leopoldo</span>

met the two offended parties going towards <span class="SpellE">Itis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This piece of evidence tries to justify the
defense or alibi of the accused; that it would have been impossible for them to
have sexual intercourse with the offended parties because at the time that the

an examination of her private parts if her motive was not to bring to justice
