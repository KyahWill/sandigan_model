<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="4">17 April 1979</st1:date>,
Complaint hitched a ride in the jeep of the Accused to go to <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, to spend the
summer vacation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Accused was actuall<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">y</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>distant uncle, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">being </span>a

</span>He was a businessman, who usually made trips to <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> with his helper, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>,
to deliver eggs for sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The group left
<span class="SpellE">Lambaken</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Jaen</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30</st1:time> in the afternoon with
the three of them sitting on the front seat of the jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was seated between the two men
because the back of the jeep was filled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with
</span>egg boxes.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the diversion road <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">at </span><span class="SpellE">Echague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>
near the <span class="SpellE">Echague</span> cemetery, the Accused told
Complainant that they would spend the night there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They slept <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">in </span>the jeep, the <span class="GramE">Accused</span> lying down on
the front seat behind the steering wheel while <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span>
slept in a sitting position at the other end of the front seat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legs of the Accused dangled outside the
jeep.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While Complainant was thus asleep, she was awakened when she felt
someone, who turned out to be the Accused, holding her hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant struggled and fought to free
herself when the Accused started embracing her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She cried for help from Al, who happened to be at the back of the front
seat, but instead of helping her, Al assisted the accused by holding her
hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, the Accused gave
Complainant a fist blow<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>in the
abdomen, which rendered her unconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She later regained consciousness when she felt pain in her private part
as the Accused succeeded violating her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She noticed that her pants and panty were already removed and she was in
a lying position on the front seat with her left leg hanging from the seat and
the Accused was on top of her doing the push-and-pull movement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was shocked and cried for help but
none was forthcoming.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The act
consummated, the Accused threw her pants and torn panty at her and threatened
her not to make any revelation otherwise he would kill her and her mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon thereafter they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
arriving thereat at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="18">6:30</st1:time> in
the morning at her uncle <span class="SpellE">Antolin's</span> place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately, Complainant mailed a letter to
her mother (Exhibit "B") narrating the offense on her person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not disclose the incident to her
uncle because of the threats made to her by the Accused.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> Santiago, Complainant's
mother, received her daughter's letter on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="4">28 April 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately, she sent a telegram to her brother-in-law, Alex Bautista,
at <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
requesting the latter to bring Complainant home to <span class="SpellE">Lambaken</span>
so that she could verify the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
day after <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> had sent the telegram, Alex and
the Complainant arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter
recounted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">how </span>she was taken
advantage of by the Accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was a </span>widow
and financially hard-up, she decided to ask for help from her brother, <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paynor</span>, who was staying
in <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span>,
Complainant and Alex immediately went to <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, that same afternoon, and on 7 May 1979,
Complainant signed and filed a criminal complaint for Rape with the Municipal
Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">thereat </span>(Exhibit
"C").</p>

<p class="BODY">The corresponding Information was thereafter filed with the Court

<p class="BODY">It is the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> submission that
they left Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lambaken</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jaen</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, at 5:00 P.M.
and not at 4:30 P.M. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>alleged
by Complainant; that considering the physical distance of 267 kilometers from
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Lambaken</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jaen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span><span class="SpellE">Echague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, the scene <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of
</span>the alleged incident, they could not have arrived at <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the evening of the same day
inasmuch as the passenger <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was fully loaded
with eggs up to the top and they were <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> at a
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">speed </span>of only 30 kilometers or
less per hour besides making several stops on the way; that added to this, the
bad condition of the barrio road from <span class="SpellE">Lambaken</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jaen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> a</span>n<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">d t</span>he treacherous zigzag from Dalton Pass, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> to Sta. Fe, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, compelled them to drive slowly with great caution
thereby rendering it improbable f<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">or </span>them
to have been at the diversion road near the cemetery at <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, in the evening of 17 April 1979 as
Complainant contended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing defense does not impress us.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under normal road conditions, 267 kilometers
can be negotiated by car in four (4) to five (5) hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Add another one (1) or two (2) hours taking
into consideration that the vehicle used was a jeep and the alleged poor
condition of the roads as well as the zigzag from Dalton Pass, and the
aforesaid distance could have been negotiated in seven (7) hours, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">up </span>to approximately 12 midnight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant's testimony, therefore, that she
was abused in the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="4">17 April
 1979</st1:date> is sufficiently credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And even if it were past <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>,
it would still be dark "in the evening" to a 13-year old barrio lass
who was not said to have been wearing a watch to tell the time by.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Losada's</span> testimony
corroborating the <span class="SpellE">Accused’s</span> theory that they never
stopped at the diversion road at <span class="SpellE">Echague</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>, is not deserving of credence not only because it
is biased considering that as a helper of the Accused, he would naturally be
beholden to the latter, but more so because Complainant's declarations
sufficiently rebut it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> assertions,
Complainant's story is not "utterly incredible".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, the circumstance of force and
intimidation attending the abuse on Complainant's person is proven not only by
her testimony but also by the medico-legal report of Dr. Corazon <span class="SpellE">Lappay</span>, the examining physician.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter attested <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>the existence of recently healed lacerations at 3, 6, 9, <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12 o'clock</st1:time> positions of the hymen, t<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hus </span>confirming the fact of forced
sexual intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That physical
evidence is of the highest order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
speaks more eloquently than a hundred witnesses (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Bardaje</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-29271, </span><st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="8"><span class="GramE">29 August 1980</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
99 SCRA 388).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's posture that the lacerations in complainant's hymen
were intentionally induced through the use of fingers to simulate a rape case
was refuted by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lappay</span> who testified that fingers
could not cause the multi-lacerations sustained by complainant (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="12">December
 18, 1979</st1:date>, pp. 19-20).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of bruises, contusions and abrasions in the body of
the complainant is neither inconsistent with her claim that she was ravished by
the accused in the manner she described.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be recalled that Complainant was boxed in the abdomen as a
result of which she lost consciousness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was thus unnecessary to inflict other injuries on her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of any discernible trace of a fist blow on
Complainant's abdomen is of no moment either, especially since the medical
examination on her was conducted seventeen (17) days after the incident, at
which time no visible signs of such injury might be expected any long<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">er</span> (People
vs. <span class="SpellE">Rouben</span> Corral y Hernandez, G. R. No. 73604, 29
January 1988, 157 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">673).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The non-presentation of Complainant's torn panty was due to the
fact that she had thrown the same in the garbage can upon reaching <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A simple
barrio girl like her could not be expected to realize its evidentiary value in
the event of <span class="GramE">a court</span> litigation.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Complainant lost no time in denouncing the wrong
done to her upon arrival at <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> by writing a letter
to her mother at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Jaen</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact immediately negates any alleged
voluntary submission of Complainant to the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span>
sexual advances (People vs. Isaac, G. R. No. 36136, 16 March 1988, 158 SCRA
725).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, Complainant, a thirteen-(13)-year old girl, could not be
expected to personally report to the police without the knowledge of her
elders.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Accused makes much of the alleged inconsistency in the
prosecution evidence in that while Complainant testified that she wrote her
mother upon her arrival on <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="4">18 April
 1979</st1:date> the postmark stamped on the envelope shows that it was
received in "<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Jaen</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1979</st1:date>." The records
show, however, that the latter postmark had been crossed out and initialed to
correct the mistake in the dates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
conclusion is supported by two other entries in the envelope which read:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Jaen</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>

(Exhibit "B-I-C") and "<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> P.O. 19
IV 79 <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>" (Exhibit "B-I-A").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These entries show that the letter was
actually mailed at <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>,
on <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="4">19 April 1979</st1:date> and

<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> Post Office on <st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="4">27 April 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidently, if the letter was mailed at <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span> on 19 April 1979,
it would be impossible for it to reach the Postal Office of <span class="SpellE">Jaen</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, 267 kilometers
away on 17 April 1979 or two (2) days before it was mailed (Section 1, Rule
129, Rules of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, as to whether
Complainant's mother sent the telegram to her brother-in-law via the Bureau of
Telecommunications or RCPI is actually inconsequential.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span>defense also
sought to establish that it was impossible to commit Rape on the front seat of

thin and short, as can be seen from the photographs (Exhibits "3" and
"3-D").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant even
demonstrated to the Court that she could lie flat on the front seat, her feet
to the right side thereof (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1980</st1:date>, pp. 35-36).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither is the Accused a very big man; he is
5' 5" in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">heig</span>ht<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and weighs 116 lbs. as disclosed by
the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not impossible then
for Complainant to have lain flat on the front seat with the Accused on top of
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be recalled that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Complainant was unconscious at the beginning
of the commission of rape because the Accused had boxed her </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the abdomen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When she was thus rendered unconscious, it was a simple matter for the
accused to have positioned her so that he could abuse her with ease.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A rapist, however, rarely considers the position his victim
may have in the sexual act, his purpose is to be sated and that alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not his victim is contorted is the
least of his concern.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">It
is not improbable therefore, that the appellant could have violated the
complainant in the manner she described" (People vs. Salazar, 93 SCRA 796,
807).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In a last-ditch effort at
exculpation, the Accused further contends that he was charged with the offense
because he refused to lend money to <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Paynor</span>, brother of Complainant's mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He avers that this case was filed in order
that they could extract money from him as shown by the fact that his helper,
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, was not included as a co-accused
although Complainant testified that said helper held her hand while the Accused
was abusing her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The contention is
preposterous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">highly improbable for Complainant's mother
and close relatives to sacrifice the honor, dignity and future of an innocent
young girl for such mercenary motives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the evidence amply supports the commission of the crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The non-inclusion of
Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Lozada</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Accused's</span>
helper, in the criminal Complaint can be explained by the fact that his participation
was not brought up during the </span>police investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only during the cross-examination of
Complainant that “Al's” participation was disclosed.</p>

the conscience resting easy on a finding of guilt.</p>
