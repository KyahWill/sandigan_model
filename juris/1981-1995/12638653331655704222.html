				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">To say the least, the Court views with regret the adamant refusal
of petitioner Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span> Sugar Central to recompense the
private respondent for the death of Julio <span class="SpellE">Famoso</span>,
their main source of support, who was killed in line of duty while in its
employ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not only a matter of law
but also of compassion on which we are called upon to rule today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We shall state at the outset that on both
counts the petition must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 22, 1980, <span class="SpellE">Famoso</span> was riding
with a co-employee in the caboose or "<span class="SpellE">carbonera</span>"
of Plymouth No. 12, a cargo train of the petitioner, when the locomotive was
suddenly derailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and his companion
jumped off to escape <span style="">injury, </span>but
the train fell on its side, caught his legs by <span style="">its </span>wheels and pinned him down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was declared dead on the spot.<sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;">1</span></sup><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The claims for death and other benefits having been denied by the

Court of <span class="SpellE">Bago</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judge Marietta <span class="SpellE">Hobilla-Alinio</span> ruled in her

<blockquote><span style="">SO </span>ORDERED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The widow appealed, claiming that the deductions were
illegal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So did the petitioner, but on
the ground that it was not negligent and therefore not liable at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its own decision, the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">2</span></span></a> sustained
the rulings of the trial court except as to the contributory negligence of the
deceased and disallowed the deductions protested by the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the respondent court
declared:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is MODIFIED by ordering the
defendant-appellant to pay the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the
following amounts:</blockquote>

<blockquote>P30,000.00,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for the death of Julio <span class="SpellE">Famoso</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>P30,000.00,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for actual, exemplary and moral damages</blockquote>

<blockquote>P10,000.00,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for loss of earnings for twenty (20) years</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">P<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>3,000.00,<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for funeral expenses</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>P<span style="">&nbsp; </span>3,000.00,</u><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for
attorney's fees</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>P76,000.00</u><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Total Amount</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, the respondent court is faulted for finding the
petitioner guilty of negligence notwithstanding its defense of due diligence
under Article 2176 of the Civil Code and for disallowing the deductions made by
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Investigation of the accident revealed that the derailment of the
locomotive was caused by protruding rails which had come loose because they
were not connected and fixed in place by fish plates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fish plates are described as strips o<span style="">f iron 8" </span>to 12" long and 3
1/2" thick which are attached to the rails by 4 bolts, two on each side,
to keep the rails aligned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although they
could be removed only with special equipment, the fish plates that should have
kept the rails aligned could not be found at the scene of the accident.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the maintenance of the rails, for the
purpose <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>
of preventing derailments, was the responsibility of the petitioner, and that
this responsibility was not discharged.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to Jose <span class="SpellE">Treyes</span>, its own witness, who
was in charge of the control and supervision of its train operations, cases of
derailment in the milling district were frequent and there were even times when
such derailments were reported every hour.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">3</span></span></a> The
petitioner should therefore have taken more prudent steps to prevent such
accidents instead of waiting until a life was finally lost because of its
negligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that no one had been hurt before because of such
derailments is of course not acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And neither are we impressed by the claim that the brakemen and the
conductors were required to report any defect in the condition of the railways
and to fill out prescribed forms for the purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For what is important is that the petitioner
should <u>act</u> on these reports and not merely receive and file them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that it is not easy to detect if the
fish plates are missing is no excuse either.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it should stress all the more the need for the responsible
employees of the petitioner to make periodic checks and actually go down to the
railroad tracks and see if the fish plates were in place.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that the locomotive that was derailed was on its way
back and that it had passed the same rails earlier without accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The suggestion is that the rails were
properly aligned then, but that does not necessarily mean they were still
aligned afterwards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is possible that
the fish plates were loosened and detached during its first trip and the rails
were as a result already <span class="SpellE">mis</span>-aligned during the
return trip.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Court feels that
even this was unlikely, for, as earlier noted, the fish plates were supposed to
have been bolted to the rails and could be removed only with special
tools.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the fish plates
were not found later at the scene of the mishap may show they were never there
at all to begin with or had been <span class="SpellE">been</span> removed long
before.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the absence of the fish plates - whatever the cause
or reason - is by itself alone proof of the negligence of the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>ipsa</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>loquitur</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine was described recently in <span class="SpellE">Layugan</span> v. Intermediate Appellate Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">4</span></span></a> thus:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Where the thing which causes injury is shown to be under the
management of the defendant, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course
of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it
affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of an explanation by the defendant,
that the accident arose from want of care.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also disclaims liability on the ground of Article
2176 of the Civil Code, contending it has exercised due diligence in the
selection and supervision of its employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court cannot agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
record shows it was in fact lax in requiring them to exercise the necessary
vigilance in maintaining the rails in good condition to prevent the derailments
that sometimes happened "every hour." Obviously, merely ordering the
brakemen and conductors to fill out prescribed forms reporting derailments -
which reports have not been acted upon <span style="">as
</span>shown by the hourly derailments - is not the kind of supervision
envisioned by the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also do not see how the decedent can be held guilty of
contributory negligence from the mere fact that he was not at his assigned
station when the train was derailed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That might have been <span style="">a </span>violation
of company rules but could not have directly contributed to his injury, as the
petitioner suggests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is pure
speculation to suppose that he would not have been injured if he had stayed in
the front car rather than at the back and that he had been killed because he
chose to ride in the caboose.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contributory negligence has been defined as "the act or omission
amounting to want of ordinary care on the part of the person injured which,
concurring with the defendant's negligence, is the proximate cause of the <span class="SpellE">the</span> injury."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">5</span></span></a> It has
been held that "to hold a person as having contributed to his injuries, it
must be shown that he performed an act that brought about his injuries in
disregard of warnings or signs of <span style="">an </span>impending
danger to health and body."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">6</span></span></a> There is
no showing that the caboose where <span class="SpellE">Famoso</span> was riding
was a dangerous place and that he recklessly dared to stay there despite
warnings or signs of impending danger.</p>

<p class="BODY">The l<span style="">ast </span>point
raised by the petitioner is easily <span style="">resolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Citing
the case of <span class="SpellE">Floresca</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Philex</span>
Mining Corporation,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span></a> it argues that the respondent
court erred in <span class="SpellE">disauthorizing</span> the deduction from the
total damages awarded the private respondent of the amount of P41,367.60,
representing the pension to be received by the private respondent from the
Social Security System for a period of five years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument is that such deduction was quite
proper because of Art. 173 of the Labor Code, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This article provides that any amount
received by the heirs of a deceased employee from the Employees Compensation
Commission, whose funds are administered by the SSS, shall be exclusive of all
other amounts that may otherwise be claimed under the Civil Code and other
pertinent laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amount to be paid by the SSS represents the usual pension
received by the heirs of a deceased employee who was a member of the SSS at the
time of his death and had regularly contributed his premiums as required by the
System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pension is the benefit
derivable from such contributions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not represent the death benefits payable under the Workmen's Compensation
Act to an employee who dies as a result of a work-connected injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the certification from the SSS<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> submitted by the petitioner is simply to the effect
that:</p>

<blockquote>TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is to certify that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Famoso</span> is a recipient of
a monthly pension from the Social Security System arising from the death of her
late husband, Julio <span class="SpellE">Famoso</span>, <u>an SSS member with SSS
No. 07-018173-1</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>This certification is issued to Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span>
Sugar Central for whatever legal purpose it may serve best.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Issued this 8th day of April 1983 in <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span>
City, Philippines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>GODOFREDO S. SISON</blockquote>

<blockquote>Regional Manager</blockquote>

<blockquote>By:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(SGD.) COSME Q. BERMEO, JR.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Chief, Benefits
Branch</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It does not indicate that the pension is
to be taken from the funds of the ECC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The certification would have said so if the pension represented the
death benefits accruing to the heirs under the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">This conclusion is supported by the express provision of Art. 173
as amended, which categorically states that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Art. 173.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Exclusiveness
of liability</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Unless otherwise
provided, the liability of the State Insurance Fund under this Title shall be
exclusive and in place of all other liabilities of the employer to the
employee, his dependents or anyone otherwise entitled to receive damages on
behalf of the employee or his dependents.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The payment of compensation under <span style="">this
</span>Title <u>shall not bar the recovery of benefits as provided for</u> in
Section 699 of the Revised Administrative Code, <u>Republic Act Numbered Eleven
hundred sixty-one, as amended</u>, Commonwealth Act Numbered One hundred eighty-six,
as amended, Republic Act Numbered Six hundred ten, as amended, Republic Act
Numbered Forty-eight hundred sixty-four, as amended and other laws whose
benefits are administered by the System or by other agencies of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Rep. Act <span style="">No. </span>1161,
as amended, <span style="">is
</span>the Social Security Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">As observed by Justice J.B.L. Reyes in the case <span style="">of </span>Valencia v. Manila Yacht Club,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> which is still controlling:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>. . .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By their nature and purpose, the sickness or disability benefits to
which a member of the System may be entitled under the Social Security law
(Rep. Act No. 1161, as amended by Rep. Acts Nos. 1792 and 2658) are not the
same as the compensation that may be claimed against the employer under the
Workmen's Compensation Act or the Civil Code, so that payment to the member
employee of social security benefits would not wipe out or extinguish the
employer's liability for the injury or illness contracted by his employee in
the course of or during the employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It must be realized that, under the Workmen's Compensation Act (or the
Civil Code, in <span style="">a </span>proper case),
the employer is required to compensate the employee for the sickness or injury
arising in the course of the employment because the industry is supposed to be
responsible therefore; whereas, under the Social Security Act, payment is being
made because the hazard specifically covered by the membership, and for which
the employee had put up his own money, had taken place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court had said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">. . . To deny payment of social security benefits because the death
or injury or confinement is compensable under the Workmen's Compen­sation Act
would be to deprive the employees members of the System of the statutory
benefits bought and paid for by them, since they contributed their money to the
general common fund out of which benefits are paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the benefits provided for in
the Workmen's Compensation Act accrues to the employees concerned due to the
hazards involved in their employment and is made a burden on the employment itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, social security benefits are paid to
the System's members, by reason of their membership therein for which they
contribute their money to a general common fund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>. . .</p>

<p class="2Q">It may be added that whereas social security benefits are intended
to provide insurance or protection against the hazards or risks for which they
are established, e.g., disability, sickness, old age or death, irrespective of
whether they arose from or in the course of the employment or not, the
compensation receivable under the Workmen's Compensation law is in the nature
of indemnity for the injury or damage suffered by the employee or his
dependents on account of the employment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Rural Transit Employees <span class="SpellE">Asso</span>. vs. <span class="SpellE">Bachrach</span> Trans. Co., 21 SCRA 1263 [1967])</p>

<p class="BODY">And according to Justice Jesus G. Barrera in <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>
Consolidated, Inc. v. Social Security System:<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>The philosophy underlying the Workmen's Compensation Act is to make
the payment of the benefits provided for therein as a responsibility of the
industry, on the ground that it is industry which should bear the resulting
death or injury to employees engaged in the said industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, social security sickness
benefits are not paid as a burden on the industry, but are paid to the members
of the System as a matter of right, whenever the hazards provided for in the
law occurs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deny payment of social
security benefits because the death or injury or confinement is compensable
under the Workmen's Compensation Act would be to deprive the employees-members
of the System of the statutory benefits bought and paid for by them, since they
contribute their money to the general common fund out of which benefits are
paid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the benefits
provided for in the Workmen's Compensation Act accrues to the employees concerned,
due to the hazards involved in their employment and is made a burden on the
