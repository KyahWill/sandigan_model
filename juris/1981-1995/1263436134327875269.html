				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Life ended abruptly for the victim in this case.  Every wound inflicted on her is indicium of
brutality.  One cannot help but wonder
what could have motivated the assailants in committing the gory deed; however,
in the light of their positive identification by the prosecution's eyewitness,
motive becomes irrelevant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants, Ronnie Cortes y Duano and Domingo Lajos y
de la Cruz, were charged with the crime of rape with homicide in Criminal Case
No. 422 before the Regional Trial Court, Fifth Judicial Region, Branch 50, San
Jacinto, Masbate.  The information filed
in said case reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“That on or about September 17, 1990 in the afternoon thereof at
Sitio Cawayan, Barangay Macarthur (sic), Municipality of Monreal, Province of
Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, said
accused, conspiring together and mutually helping one another, by means of
violence and intimidation did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously have sexual intercourse with NONIETA LEPITIN, against the latter's
will and with intent to kill, taking advantage of their superior strenght
(sic), did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack,
assault, stab and hack with bladed weapons said NONIETA LEPITIN, inflicting
upon her mortal wounds on different parts of the body which directly caused her
death moments thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on January 22, 1991, both accused-appellants
entered a plea of not guilty.  Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued and on October 21, 1991, a
decision was rendered by the lower court, the dispositive portion of which
reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds both accused, RONNIE CORTES and
DOMINGO LAJOS guilty of the crime of Rape With Homicide established by proof
beyond reasonable doubt and hereby sentences each of the accused, Ronnie Cortes
and Domingo Lajos, the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua and to pay the heirs of
the late Nonita (sic) Lepitin the amount of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) pesos
without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case, as culled from the records are, as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Fructoso Dignos, farmer, testified that on September 17, <span style="">1990, at about </span>5:00 o'clock in the
afternoon while grazing his carabao, he saw behind some bushes
accused-appellants holding the struggling victim.  He was <span style="">about </span>ten
(10) meters away from them.  With
accused-appellant Domingo Lajos holding her hands, accused-appellant Ronnie
Cortes tore off the victim's panty and forced sexual intercourse with her.  Thereafter, Cortez momentarily released the
victim to get up, and in that instant the victim was able to stand up only to
be stabbed by accused-appellant Cortes with his ten (10) inch long machete, about
seven (7) times on the breast, abdomen and other parts of her body.  Accused-appellant Lajos likewise pulled out
his bolo and hacked the victim three (3) times until she fell on the
ground.  He did not know whether or not
the accused-appellants saw him because he was hiding in the bushes.  Afterwards, he went home.  He reported the incident to the father of
the victim upon the latter's return from Cataingan, or after three (3) days,
and to barangay councilor Ronnie Piket-piket.  He knows both accused-appellants because they have been neighbors at
Sitio Cogon, Barangay MacArthur, Monreal, Masbate since 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">Manuel Lepitin, father of the victim, testified that his daughter
was a second year nursing student at Cebu Roosevelt Memorial College.  She was the muse of the school.  In the afternoon of September 17, 1990, he
told the victim to fetch water from the well.  From said errand, his daughter never returned.  He was to be informed later by eyewitness Dignos that his daughter
was raped and killed by the accused-appellants.  Ironically, before the victim's death, accused-appellant Cortes
was courting her and had visited her at their house at least five (5) times.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Florendo Granado in conducting a <i>post mortem</i>
examination of the body of the victim found twelve (12) wounds thereon, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  Hacking wound,
Naso-frontal area exposing the frontal and nasal bones, devoid of skin and
muscles tissues.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Stab Wound, 6 1/2 cm.,
Right hypochondriac region, penetrating abdominal cavity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Stab wound, 4 cm., Left
hypochondriac region, penetrating abdominal cavity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Stab wound, 4 cm.,
Chest, Left, Level of the 9th anterior rib about 10 cm. below the nipple.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  Hacking wound, 15 cm.,
Right Lumbar region with eviceration of the omentum and intestines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.  Stab Wound, 4 cm.,

<blockquote>10. Stab Wound, 3 1/2 cm., Forearm, Right, Proximal 3rd Volar area.</blockquote>

<blockquote>11. Incised Wound, 2 cm., Hand, Left, Base of the thumb, palmar
surface.</blockquote>

<blockquote>12. Laceration 3 cm., 6:00 o'clock Vagina."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both accused-appellants proffered the usual defense of
alibi.  According to accused-appellant
Cortes, on September 17, 1990, he was in their house located at Sitio Cawayan,
Barangay McArthur, Monreal, Masbate, sick, suffering from headache and fever
which started the day before, September 16, 1990 and lasted up to September 18,
1990.  Accused-appellant L<span style="">aj</span>os was also in their house on
September 18, 1990 making copra, but does not know where he was on the day of
the incident.  He denied courting the
victim as he did not know her.  Sitio
Cawayan and sitio Cogon are adjoining sitios of Barangay MacArthur.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Lajos testified that he was in the house of
accused-appellant Cortes who was lying in bed sick on September 17, 1990 at
around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon since he was smoking copra and did not
leave the place.</p>

<p class="BODY">Bernita Espinosa, on the other hand, the adoptive mother of
accused-appellant Lajos, testified that on September 17, 1990, Lajos was in
their house located at Togoron, Monreal, Masbate.  She requested him to go fishing and L<span style="">aj</span>os stayed in their house up to September 20, 1990 when he left
to make copra with the Cortes family.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their appeal, the accused-appellants assign <span style="">as </span>errors committed by the trial court
the following:  (1) in upholding the
prosecution's evidence notwithstanding the insufficiency thereof; and (2) in
finding them guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape with
homicide.  They anchored their acquittal
on the following grounds:</p>

<p class="NUM">1) Dignos was the only eyewitness to the crime.  The Holy Scripture, particularly Deuteronomy
19:15, states that one witness is not enough to convict a man of a crime; at
least two witnesses are necessary to prove that a man is guilty.  Dignos is an unreliable eyewitness because
he reported the incident to the father of the victim and the barangay councilor
only after three (3) days;</p>

<p class="NUM">2) Their defense of alibi was never rebutted by the prosecution;</p>

<p class="NUM">3) Dr. Granado himself was not sure whether or not rape was
committed on the victim (citing pages 40 and 41 of the TSN dated May 23, 1991);</p>

<p class="NUM">4) Their decision not to flee despite an opportunity to do so is
not characteristic of guilty persons; and</p>

<p class="NUM">5) Considering that the incident happened in the month of
September, which was already rainy season and the afternoon of the incident
being gloomy, it would be difficult to identify clearly any person committing a
wrongdoing.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the testimony of Dignos, there were no houses at the
scene of the incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> The
distance of the nearest house is more or less one-fourth (1/4) of a kilometer.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, the discovery of the victim's body and the identity of the
culprits might have remained unknown were it not for the eyewitness account of
Dignos who chanced upon the accused-appellants with Cortez raping the victim
and subsequently, with Lajos, took turn stabbing and hacking the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dignos was then lying on the cogon<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> while
grazing his carabao when he saw the struggling victim who was supposed to fetch
water.  He has known her for a long time
because she grew up in their place.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> He

when the entire incident took place.  He
did not know whether or not the victim and the accused-appellants saw him
because he hid in the bushes.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">And from his position, </span>he was able to

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The efforts of defense counsel to
discredit the testimony of prosecution witness Fructoso Dignos on
cross-examination was a dismal failure.  Instead of discrediting the witness, it gave the latter an opportunity
to elucidate on his testimony given on direct examination, videlicet:</p>

<blockquote>"q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
about the accused Ronnie Cortes, how was he able to rape the girl?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
tore the panty of the girl and he was not wearing pants and went on top of the

<blockquote>q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
said that Ronnie Cortes was not wearing pants, what was he wearing then?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
took-off his pants and have (sic) sexual intercourse with the girl.</blockquote>

<blockquote>q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
the pants that Ronnie Cortes removed was a short pants or a long pants?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
was wearing a long pants and a short pants and took-off both.</blockquote>

<blockquote>q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
Ronnie Cortes was removing his pants, why was the girl not able to run away?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
somebody was holding her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Who
was holding her?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Domingo
Lajos.  (At the same time witness was
pointing to accused Domingo Lajos)</blockquote>

<blockquote>q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
Ronnie Cortes was removing his pants, where was Domimgo Lajos holding the girl?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the hands of the victim.</blockquote>

Lajos?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
removed her panty immediately and have (sic) sexual intercourse with the

<p class="BODY">On the basis of Dignos' testimony, we find defense counsel's
arguments not only untenable but puerile.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards defense counsel's first argument, the testimony of a
single witness, if positive and credible, is sufficient to support a conviction
even in the absence of corroboration.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> The trial
court gave full faith and credit to the testimony of Dignos.  We can do no less.  Appellate courts have accorded the highest respect to the
evaluation of the testimony of eye-witnesses by the trial court because of its
opportunity of observing on the stand their demeanor and manner of testifying
and detecting if they were telling the truth or lying on their teeth.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused-appellant Cortes could not think of any reason why Fructoso Dignos
would testify against him.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> The
reason is simply because he was telling the truth.  Absence of improper motive enhanced his credibility.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The delay of three (3) days in reporting the incident, does not
in any way detract from the veracity of Dignos' testimony,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
because it was satisfactorily explained.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> It
was his fear, that if reported the accused-appellants might go to his place.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the father of the victim was then not in their house but in
Cataingan, Masbate.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> At
any rate, it is not uncommon for a witness to a crime to show some reluctance
about getting involved in a criminal case.  Indeed, the natural reticence of most people to get involved in a
criminal case is of judicial notice.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second argument, it was not necessary for the
prosecution to rebut the accused-appellants' defense of alibi.  The burden of proving the same lies with
appellants.  Justifiably, courts have
always looked upon the defense of alibi with suspicion and have received the
same with caution, not only because it is inherently weak and unreliable but
also because of its easy fabrication.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> It
cannot prevail over the clear, direct and positive testimony of prosecution
witness Dignos identifying appellants as the perpetrators <span style="">of the crime.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Domingo Lajos alibi </span>is <span style="">even contradicted by the testimony of his </span>adoptive
mother.  Moreover, it is not enough to
prove that they were somewhere else when the crime was committed, but that it
was physically impossible for them to have been at the scene of the crime,
which is not so in the case at bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> The
place where the accused-appellants stayed at the time of the incident, Sitio
Cogon, is just adjacent to Sitio Cawayan, the <i><span style="">locus criminis.</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the third argument that Dr. Granado was not sure
whether or not rape was committed, we quote his testimony on direct
examination:</p>

<blockquote>"q: <span style="">&nbsp; </span>With these findings of yours, could we say that before the (sic)
Nonieta Lipitin (sic) was killed, she was sexually abused?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a:  I could not say because during the examination, there was a falling of
hair and sloughing of skin and I could not be so sure that the laceration in
the vagina maybe (sic) sexually caused because slight friction or movement of
the lower extremities may cause laceration in the other parts of the
body."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Clarifying this point, the prosecution's
counsel asked:</p>

<blockquote>"q: <span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I am asking you doctor about the possibility, is it possible
that the laceration in the vagina, 6:00 o'clock, could had been caused by
sexually abused? (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Already answered.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, the same testimony was reiterated by Dr.
Granado:</p>

<blockquote>"q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The testimony of Dr. Granado coupled with
that of eye-witness Dignos proved the crime of rape with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fourth argument, the accused-appellants' simulated
innocence is clearly <i>non sequitur</i> to their decision not to flee.  There is no case law holding that non-flight
is conclusive proof of innocence.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The last argument of the accused-appellants as to the gloominess
of the afternoon when the incident took place, poscribing clear identification
of the accused-appellants, suffice it to say, that the same is simply
conjectural.  There was no testimony
from either side regarding the weather condition at the time of the
incident.  What is vital is the testimony
of Dignos that he saw the victim being raped<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> and
killed.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that accused-appellant Cortes was the only one
who raped the victim, this fact did not exculpate accused-appellant Lajos.  He is as much guilty as Cortes for the crime
of rape.  As distinctly found by the
trial court:</p>

<blockquote>"Although Domingo Lajos has not committed rape on the victim;
nevertheless he is liable as co-conspirator by indispensable cooperation -
having cooperated in the rape of the victim by holding her hands to prevent her
escape while Ronnie Cortes was removing his long pants and short pants.  Moreover, when the victim was lying on the <span style="">ground </span>and being raped by Ronnie
Cortes, Domingo Lajos held the hands of the victim without which rape would not
have been accomplished.  The fact that
Ronnie Cortes tore the panty of the victim and the victim sustained multiple
hematoma, thighs, Bilateral, medial and worst the victim had laceration (of) 3
cm., 6:00 o'clock (in the) Vagina were unmistakable proof (sic) of the struggle
and resistance offered by the victim."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A person may be convicted for the
criminal act of another, where between them, there has been conspiracy or unity
of intention in the commission of the offense charged.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
Of course, with respect to the death of the victim, both accused-appellants are
likewise equally liable therefor.  By
their concerted action, they showed that they acted in unison and cooperated
with each other towards the accomplishment of a common felonious purpose.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>
