<p class="BODY">Because one<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> of its 
projects caused the inundation of some 18,552 square meters of land (part of 
registered 46,431 square meter parcel located at <span class="SpellE">Guimba</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, owned by private 
respondent (with a Torrens Title granted by virtue of a PATENT from the 
Government) rendering said inundated portion virtually useless for the purposes 
of said respondents, the herein petitioner, the National Power Corporation (NPC, 
for short) was asked for damages by the owners of the land.<span>&nbsp; </span>To 
simplify matters, the NPC decided to file expropriation proceedings before the 
Regional Trial Court, which after hearing the report of the Commissioners 
appointed to ascertain the "just compensation" of the land fixed the same at the 
rate recommended by the Commissioners namely twelve (P12.00) pesos a square 
meter.<span>&nbsp; </span>On appeal to the Intermediate Appellate Court (IAC) the 
tribunal affirmed the judgment of the trial court, hence this Petition for 
Review before Us, assailing the decision of the IAC (now the Court of Appeals) 
on the ground that the twelve (P12.00) pesos rate was excessive and that the 
rate of three (P3.00) pesos per square meter, fixed by the City Assessor of 
<span class="SpellE">Marawi</span> City as the fair market value of the property 
should be the "just compensation" contemplated by the law, more specifically 
P.D. 76 as amended.<span>&nbsp; </span>We gave due course to the Petition.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The respective memoranda of the parties having been filed, We now proceed 
to decide the case, and Our decision is in favor of the herein private 
respondents.</p>
<p class="BODY">We rule that to pay only three (P3.00) pesos per square meter is 
unjust and inequitable, considering the true market value <span>of </span>the 
land.<span>&nbsp; </span>Be it noted that even the City Assessor himself as member of 
the Board of Commission who were tasked with the duty of fixing the "just 
compensation" agreed on this Twelve (P12.00) pesos rate.<span>&nbsp; </span>This in 
effect amended his previous assessment of Three (P3.00) pesos per square 
meter.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the assailed decision is hereby AFFIRMED.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>No costs.</p><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Feria</span>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> Gutierrez, Jr., JJ., <span style="font-style: normal;">concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br><br><br><br>
