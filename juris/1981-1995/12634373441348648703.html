<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution as to the factual background of
this case is as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 February 1991, at about five o'clock in the afternoon and
while Beronio Tagayon, Dominador Salinda, Jr., and Jolito Helaos were preparing
to go to their respective houses after cutting the grass on the land cultivated
by Tagayon, accused Eugenio Resuma, Kupad Angias, and Romeo dela Cruz, all
armed with shotguns, positioned themselves on an elevated portion of a hill
about four (4) fathoms away from where Tagayon, Salinda, Jr., and Helaos were
standing.  As Salinda, Jr. and Helaos
started to walk, they heard one gunshot coming from the hill.  As they turned around towards the direction
of the gunshot, they saw the tip of Resuma's shotgun still smoking.  Then they heard three (3) more
gunshots.  They saw Tagayon slumped on
the ground.  And as two (2) shotgun
pellets grazed the outer garments of Helaos, he and Salinda, Jr. scampered in
different directions to take cover.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tagayon's wife, Delia, who was about one hundred (100) meters
away watching her husband approach their house, heard the first gunshot as well
as the three (3) succeeding gunshots.  She looked at the direction of the gunshots and saw the three (3)
accused holding their weapons and withdrawing from their elevated position.  Then she saw her fallen husband, and rushed
to his aid.  Antonio Ticmon, who was one
hundred fifty (150) meters away from where Tagayon fell, also heard the
gunshots and saw the accused withdrawing.  Then he approached the fallen Tagayon and helped Delia carry Tagayon's
wounded body to the latter's house.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly after Delia and Ticmon reached Tagayon's house carrying
the wounded Tagayon, the latter died.  The next day, 7 February 1991, Dr. Alfredo Calingin, accompanied by a
policeman, autopsied the body of Tagayon.  He thereafter accomplished the autopsy report containing the details of
the cause of death of Tagayon.  The
police authorities took the respective statements of Helaos, Salinda, Jr.,
Ticmon, and Delia Tagayon regarding the circumstances surrounding the alleged
attack on the victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense, in turn, presented the following witnesses:  Romeo dela Cruz,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The defense adopted by the accused was basically denial of the
crimes charged against them.  To
substantiate their defense, each of the accused attempted to negate the
prosecution's theory on the existence of conspiracy among the accused, and
their direct participation in the crimes charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the accused denied having any knowledge whatsoever of the
alleged attack on Tagayon, Salinda, Jr., and Helaos.  Accused dela Cruz averred that he did not have any
misunderstanding with the victims.  Accused Angias denied having known the victims and accused Resuma
invoked alibi in support of his denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, to counter the prosecution's theory of conspiracy,
dela Cruz claimed that he did not know his co-accused Angias, and that he only
knew his co-accused Resuma as a buyer of the former's (de la Cruz) corn.  Accused Angias likewise denied knowing dela
Cruz although he admitted to knowing Resuma but only as the husband of Angias'
niece.  Finally, Resuma alleged that he
could not have participated in the alleged crimes as he was scaling corn for
Carlos Bautista in Camp Apeco in Barangay Ragandang at the time of the alleged
attack on Tagayon.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arriving at its judgment, the trial court found the evidence
presented by the prosecution credible and sufficient to convict all the accused
of the crimes charged beyond reasonable doubt.  In finding that all the accused directly participated in the attack on
the victims, the trial court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Evidently, the prosecution relied heavily on the testimonies
of the surviving offended victims, Dominador Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito
Helaos, who allegedly identified the accused, Eugenio Resuma, Kupad Angias, and
Romeo dela Cruz, as the persons who ambushed them on their way going home at
about past 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of February 6, 1991, and who fired
gunshots at them which caused the death of their companion, Beronio Tagayon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no dispute that Beronio Tagayon was with Dominador
Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito Helaos, when they were ambushed on their way
and firedupon [sic], which caused the death of Beronio Tagayon of gunshot
wounds.  Undoubtedly, at 5:00 o'clock,
more or less, in the afternoon of February 6, 1991, it was still bright when
the incident in question took place.  Carlos Bautista, who testified for the defense, had in fact declared in
court that at 6:00 o'clock in the evening of February 6, 1991, it was still
bright, and that at 6:30 o'clock in the evening of the same day, it was not yet
very dark.  Indubitably, there was no
dispute as to the identification of a person at about 5:00 o'clock in the
afternoon of February 6, 1991.  Evidently, it was still very bright at that time of the day.  x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x.  Consequently,
the Court feels that the defense of alibi of the accused in these cases
deserves no credence, not only for being uncorroborated but also for being
incredible, as it generates the impression that it is fabricated.  x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, on the basis of the foregoing considerations,
the Court is morally convinced that, through conspiracy, it was the three
accused in theses [sic] cases who are responsible for the death of the deceased
victim, Beronio Tagayon, and of shooting at the offended private complainants,
Dominador Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito Helaos, in the afternoon (5:00
o'clock p.m.) of February 6, 1991, in Sitio Daligdig, Ragandang, Lebak, Sultan
Kudarat."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court also discredited the defense posited by the
accused.  It observed, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  There is no
doubt that the testimonies of the accused, Kupad Angias and Romeo dela Cruz, in
denying involvement in the commission of the crimes imputed against them, were
uncorroborated.  On the other hand,
while the accused Eugenio Resuma presented Rolando Pillado, apparently, to
corroborate his testimony; their testimonies, however, resulted to serious
contradictions and inconsistencies as disclosed somewhere in the preceding
paragraphs hereof.  In effect, accused
Eugenio Resuma had only shown falsehoods in his testimony.  x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The testimony of Carlos Bautista is definitely unconvincing,
and does not easily inspire confidence, belief and credence.  How could you believe that for only fourteen
(14) sacks of corn, it took him the whole day of February 6, 1991, until 5:00
o'clock in the afternoon to haul them to Camp Apeco, Ragandang, Lebak, from
Erland, Ragandang, Lebak, covering a distance of only one (1) kilometer, and
using a sledge pulled by a six-year old carabao?  Can we believe that a sledge with a dimension of 3 1/2 feet in
length by 3 feet in width could only load two sacks of corn?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Admittedly, the defense put up by the accused in these cases
is alibi, a defense which is said to be the weakest, seldom believed or given
weight, as it is easy of fabrication, except when the identity of the accused
has not been positively made, and when the evidence of alibi is airtight, which
means that there was physical impossibility for the accused to be in the place
where the incident took place because they were in another place which makes it
physically impossible for them to be at the place of the incident.  The Court is not, however, impressed by the
alibi put up by the accused.  It is far
from being airtight.  Considering,
therefore the distance of the place, where the accused were at the time of the
incident, which was not more than five (5) kilometers at most, it is not
improbable that they could have been in the place of the incident, committed
the acts imputed against them, then returned in the place where they claimed
they were, by negotiating the distance in a short time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Undoubtedly, the denial of the accused, Eugenio Resuma, Kupad
Angias, and Romeo dela Cruz, in the commission of the crimes imputed against
them, is unworthy of credence, and apart from being uncorroborated, it cannot
stand above prosecution's clear and satisfactory evidence.  x x x."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in qualifying the acts of all the accused as
constituting the crimes of Murder and Attempted Murder, respectively, the trial
court made the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court is further convinced that conspiracy was
satisfactorily established by positive and conclusive evidence as shown by the
community of purpose on the part of the three accused as they were seen going
together to the scene of the occurrence of the ambush with firearms and, later,
seen firing with their guns at the deceased victim, Beronio Tagayon, and the
two offended victims, Dominador Salendab, Jr. [sic], and Jolito Helaos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With the nature of the evidence presented by the prosecution,
were the qualifying aggravating circumstances of treachery and evident
premeditation, as alleged in the Informations filed against the accused in
these cases, duly established to qualify the crimes committed to Murder and
Attempted Murders?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court honestly believes that on the basis of the method
or way that the accused had committed the crimes, there was deliberate planning
of the act before its execution.  The
evidence of the prosecution, no doubt, had established the existence of evident
premeditation.  Moreover, conspiracy
generally presupposes premeditation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Unquestionably, the victims in these cases were shot upon,
causing the death of one, without them having put up any resistance and/or
defense, as the attack on them was so sudden and unexpected.  Indubitably, the accused had consciously
adopted the form of attack employed by them, in a manner that would insure the
execution of the crimes, without risk to themselves coining from the intended
victims.  Treachery, no doubt, was duly
established by the evidence of the prosecution in these cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the prosecution has successfully established the
guilt of the accused in each of the above-entitled cases beyond reasonable
doubt."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, accused-appellants raised a lone assignment of
error, namely:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"<u>ASSIGNMENT
OF ERROR</u><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING
ACCUSED-APPELLANTS OF THE CRIMES CHARGED DESPITE THE FAILURE OF THE PROSECUTION
TO PROVE THEIR GUILT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In support of their lone assignment of error, accused-appellants
claim as uncontroverted three (3) submissions of the defense:  First, the testimony of accused Resuma that
he was scaling corn in Camp Apeco at the time of the ambush.  Second, the testimony of prosecution witness
Carlos Bautista corroborating the alibi of accused Resuma.  And third, the testimony of Barangay
Councilman Ramon Pillado regarding the alleged statements of complaining
witnesses Salinda, Jr., and Helaos given to him (Pillado) to the effect that
nobody witnessed the alleged ambush, and that nobody knew the identities of the
perpetrators.  As for the other accused
Angias and dela Cruz, they insist on their innocence which they anchor upon
their alleged lack of knowledge of the crimes.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find the arguments of accused-appellants to be untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants fault the trial court for relying on the
direct and positive evidence of the prosecution consisting of the testimonies
of four (4) eyewitnesses to the crimes.  Prosecution witnesses Dominador Salinda, Jr., Jolito Helaos, Delia
Tagayon, and Antonio Ticmon all testified that they saw the accused?appellants
standing, each of them wielding shotguns with barrels still smoking from the
earlier gunshots and aimed at the direction of where Tagayon, Salinda, Jr., and
Helaos were standing.  Furthermore, they
testified as to the subsequent acts of the accused-appellants in retreating
from their location after shooting at their victims.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the face of this direct and positive evidence of the
prosecution, the defense could only interpose denial and alibi.  Yet, the accused-appellants would want this
Court to rule that it was error for the trial court to disregard their
substantially uncorroborated defense of denial and alibi.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can not grant such improvident prayer of the
accused-appellants, lest we set at naught overwhelming jurisprudence, a
reiteration of which is found in the Court's recent pronouncement in the case
of <u>People</u>­<u> of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Sulpicio</u>
<u>Pajares</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein we held:</p>

<blockquote>"In sum, the lame defense of bare denial by accused-appellant
cannot overcome the evidence presented by the prosecution proving him guilty
beyond reasonable doubt.  The solid
testimony of Reynaldo de Vera who witnessed the entire incident; the testimony
of police corporal Regalado that accused-appellant was positively identified by
the victim Alberto Pilapil before his death; accused-appellant's positive identification
from among other inmates at the Police Headquarters by de Vera; and lastly, the
damaging testimony of defense witness Hilario Candido who admitted that he saw
a similar if not the same weapon in the possession of the accused the day
before the criminal incident occurred are enough indicators to an unprejudiced
mind that the crime of murder perpetrated by accused-appellant has been
established with moral and legal certainty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the other ground of accused-appellants' appeal - that both
complaining witnesses Salinda, Jr. and Helaos had stated to defense witness
Pillado that nobody witnessed the attack, and that nobody could identify the
perpetrators thereof - this Court can consider such testimony of Pillado as, at
best, inaccurate, and at worst, of no probative value.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that prosecution witness Salinda, Jr. testified
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing testimonies belie the accuracy of Pillado's own
testimony.  Such inaccuracy, however,
can be explained.  It is true that
Salinda, Jr. and Helaos did not actually witness the first attack.  But that is because the attack was so sudden
and was, shortly afterwards, continued for another brief period by the
accused-appellants, that Salinda, Jr. and Helaos could not have managed to get
even a momentary glimpse of the actual attack as they themselves were in the
midst of their own frantic effort to take cover.  Moreover, their alleged statements to Pillado as testified to by
the latter, that they could not identify the attackers, referred not to the difficulty
in ascertaining the actual identities of the accused-appellants but, rather, to
the difficulty of ascertaining with precision the intended target of each
assailant, in view of the type of weapons used - shotguns which have the
capacity of hitting multiple targets with just a single shotgun shell - and the
proximity of the intended victims from each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, the portion of the testimony of defense witness
Pillado regarding the alleged subject statements of Salinda, Jr. and Helaos can
be considered as nothing more than hearsay evidence.  Precisely, Pillado had no personal knowledge of whether there
were witnesses to the crimes as well as to the identities of the
perpetrators.  He only obtained, and
later confused, such information from Salinda, Jr. and Helaos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Rule 130, Section 36 of the Rules of Court, it is provided:</p>

A witness can testify only to those facts which he knows of his personal
knowledge; that is, which are derived from his own perception, except as
otherwise provided in these rules.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch as the related portion of the testimony of defense
witness Pillado has no probative value - it being hearsay - it cannot sustain
accused-appellants' arguments and prayer for the reversal of the trial court's
decision, and their consequent acquittal of all the crimes for which they were
correctly convicted.</p>
