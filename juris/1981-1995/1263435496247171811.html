Cabatuan St., Deparo, Kalookan City, gun-wielding men barged into the residence
of Leoncio Flores while the occupants therein were about to take their
supper.  The intruders threatened and
hogtied the occupants, ransacked the house, and carried away several appliances
and personal effects; they loaded the items on a Ford Fiera truck belonging to
Leoncio Flores which they had taken from the garage.  Leoncio Flores, who was not home at the time, came to know of the
incident when told an hour later by his nephew Elmo Flores.  The former immediately notified the police
and was given assistance.  The truck,
already cannibalized, was recovered the next day in a vacant lot in Barrio
Capri, Novaliches, Quezon City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eight (8) days later, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>on
11 May 1989, another robbery took place at the residence of Reynaldo Punzalan
in Jordan Heights Subdivision, Kalookan City.  Reynaldo and his wife Marissa drove home early that evening from their
store in Novaliches.  When they reached
their gate at around 8:00 o'clock, Reynaldo blew the car horn to signal any of
their three (3) household helpers to open the garage gate.  As none responded despite his continuous
blowing, Marissa had to alight from the car and open the gate.  When the car entered the driveway, two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(2) </span>armed men suddenly emerged from
the house and grabbed Marissa; one leveled a gun at her while the other
grappled for the possession of her bag.  Reynaldo, who was about to get off from the car, was also attacked.  He was able to run outside and shout for
help from male neighbors who immediately gave succor.  In the commotion that ensued, shots were fired as Marissa's
attackers ran off with her bag; three (3) other armed companions rushed towards
the street and escaped.  Later, the
Punzalans discovered that their household helpers had been hogtied and were
lying face down under the beds, that their two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">(2) </span>minor children were hiding in the comfort room, and that
several personal belongings, including antique jewelry, cash, clothing and a
car stereo, were missing.  Several
appliances like their Betamax recorder, television set and electric fans were
also found piled up at the back of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
house, </span>ready to be carted away.  Reynaldo Punzalan immediately informed the police and gave a statement
at the headquarters.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 May 1989, following a tip from an informer, police
operatives from the Urduja Police Sub-Station III in Kalookan City
reconnoitered Miranda subdivision for a possible engagement with the
suspects.  Accompanied by Reynaldo
Punzalan, the lawmen chanced upon Felimon Ramos, who was then pointed to by
Reynaldo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as one of the five (5) armed
men whom he encountered during the robbery.  When accosted and frisked by the lawmen, Ramos yielded in his waistline

evening of May 11, 1989, Reynaldo Punzalan and his wife arrived at their
residence at Da-ang Liit Novaliches, Kalookan City on board their car. Reynaldo
blew his carhorn to alert his household help to open the gate but despite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">continued horn--blowing nobody responded
forcing Reynaldo's wife to alight from the car and to personally open the
gate.  Thereafter, Reynaldo entered and
drove the car into the garage.  But as
Reynaldo stepped out of the car and about five arms length away he saw two
armed men approaching him menacingly (whom he later identified as Felimon Ramos
and Antonio Contreras) while a third man was holding his wife.  Reynaldo ran outside the house to seek his
neighbor's assistance and was pursued by Ramos and Contreras.  Suddenly, a shot rang out from inside the
house and immediately five armed men came rushing out some of whom Reynaldo saw
holding something.  As the group
approached Reynaldo and his neighbors, Ramos fired at them (pp. 8-13, tsn, June
19, 1989).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Reynaldo and his neighbors then rushed inside the house where
Reynaldo saw his household help lying face down under the bed, his two children
in the corner of the comfort room and his wife hiding under the steering wheel
of his car.  Reynaldo saw that some of
their household appliances were piled at the back of their house, ready to be
carried out.  Subsequently, Reynaldo
also discovered that some of their personal belongings like jewelry, cash,
clothing, make-up kit, tachometer, car stereo with a total money value of
P58,500.00 were missing (pp. 14-16, supra).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Reynaldo immediately reported this incident to the police
authorities and on the morning of May 17, 1989, Reynaldo in the company of a
police team, proceeded to a house at the Miranda Subdivision where appellant
Ramos, per the police informant, was residing (pp. 16-17, supra).  Thereat, Reynaldo saw a man at the gate of
the house whom he recognized as one of the robbers (pp. 8, 16 tsn, July 17,
1989) and accordingly informed Pat. Rodillas, a member of the police team who
then alighted from the police vehicle, talked to the man and afterwards frisked
him.  Pat. Rodillas found a gun tucked
at the man's waist (p. 7, supra).  At
the police sub-station, the man who was identified as Felimon Ramos named a
certain Contreras as one of his companions in robbing the house of Reynaldo.  On May 18, 1989, the police team,
accompanied by Ramos, proceeded to a shop somewhere in Doña Rosario
Subdivision, Novaliches where they found Contreras fixing a vehicle.  Contreras was invited to the police station
for investigation.  Thereat, he was
pointed to by Reynaldo as one of the robbers (pp. 9-11, supra).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The gun recovered from Ramos, which was a Danao Paltik revolver,
snub nose, contained two (2) live bullets (p. 12, supra).</blockquote>

evening of May 3, 1989, Elmo Flores, his family and his co-employees were at
the residence of their employer, Leoncio Flores at Cabanatuan St., Deparo,
Kalookan City where they reside.  As
Elmo and his co-employees were about to take their supper, three armed men with
their faces covered with handkerchiefs suddenly entered the house through the
kitchen door.  One of the armed men
poked a gun at Noel Flores, Elmo's cousin, and ordered them to be silent and to
lie down.  As Elmo was not able to
immediately comply, he was kicked but in the process the armed man's face cover
dropped.  Elmo recognized the man who he
later identified in court and in the police station as Felimon Ramos.  The other two ransacked the </span>house and
got several articles like wristwatches, pants, silverwares (pp. 19-22, tsn,
July 17, 1989).</blockquote>

the armed men loaded the articles they took from the house to the vehicle (Ford
Fiera) parked beside the kitchen and owned by Leoncio Flores.  Two members of the armed group returned to
the kitchen and tied Elmo and his companions.  At this time, the faces of these two men were not covered (pp. 29,
tsn).  In court, Elmo Flores identified
these men as Ramos and Contreras.  Thereafter, the armed group boarded the </span>vehicle and speeded
away.  The vehicle was later found
abandoned somewhere in Novaliches and 'cannibalized' (p. 7, tsn, June 7, 1989).</blockquote>

In their own petition in CA-G.R. SP No. 20242 and in G.R. No. 95524, the
accused do not even claim to have paid the premium on the bail bonds.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, it is beyond dispute that the
questioned bail bonds are, as correctly described by the trial court,
"fake," and even granting for the sake of argument that they were in
fact approved by Judge Luna, such approval did not render them valid and
binding.  Moreover, the so-called orders
of release, signed by Branch Clerk of Court Josefino A. Corpus, were void <i>ab
initio </i>not only because he has no authority to do so, but also because he
issued them before the bail bonds were allegedly approved by Judge Luna.  Being the parties directly benefited by the
issuance of the bail bonds and the orders of release, the accused were then
co-conspirators in the irregular and illegal procurement of the bail bonds and
the issuance of the orders of release.  The conclusion is inevitable that the accused submitted fake bail bonds
to gain freedom from detention.  Thus,
the accused did not merely "jump" bail; for all legal intents and
purposes, they <u>escaped</u> from detention.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:2.5in">Only accused Felimon Ramos was
re-arrested after the cancellation of the bail bonds.  Accused Antonio Contreras has successfully eluded re-arrest.  Despite the issuance by the trial court of
an alias warrant of arrest on 26 March 1991, Contreras has remained at
large.  He has clearly made a mockery of

credibility of prosecution witness P/Sgt. Lardizabal because of material
inconsistencies in his testimony.  Moreover, since it was Pat. Rodillas who frisked him and found the subject
handgun in his person and possession, Ramos argues that it is Rodillas and not
Lardizabal who should have been presented since the former was a material
witness who could identify the handgun and testify about it.  Ramos imputes to the prosecution a sinister

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records of the cases and the
testimonies of the witnesses, We find no cogent reason to disturb the factual
findings of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of Reynaldo Punzalan, Elmo Flores and Noel
Flores, who identified the accused as among the perpetrators of the crimes,
were credible and consistent with common human experience.  The discrepancies alleged by the defense in
the said testimonies, such as the color of the pants or hats the perpetrators
wore, whether they wore watches or not, or whether they had scars on their
faces or not, refer to minor or even inconsequential particulars which do not
invalidate the positive identification of the accused.  In fact, the said minor inconsistencies even
tend to strengthen rather than weaken the credibility of the prosecution
witnesses because they erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is not true, as insinuated by the
accused, that Punzalan could not have properly identified his attackers while
he was chased by them.  He had already
recognized them when they were menacingly approaching him as he was about to
alight from his car.  When Punzalan saw
Ramos on 17 May 1989 at the Miranda Subdivision, he immediately pointed him out
to the police team as one of the robbers.  As to the identification of accused Ramos by Elmo Flores and Noel
Flores, the former conveniently forgets that the handkerchief which covered his
face dropped and his identity was thus unmasked.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the prosecution witnesses were coached by the policemen
during the confrontation is plain speculation; nothing in the evidence supports
it.  No ulterior motive was shown for
the policemen to do so, if indeed they did, and no irregularity in their
conduct of the investigation was proved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the records are bereft of any evidence which would show
any ill motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to testify against the
accused.  It is settled that where there
is no evidence to indicate that the principal witnesses for the prosecution
were actuated by any improper motive, the presumption is that they were not so
actuated and that their testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent Criminal Case No. 32861(89), We are not persuaded by the
contention of Ramos that the frisking and seizure of the gun tucked on his
waistline were illegal for having been done without a valid search warrant and
that, as a consequence, the gun is inadmissible in evidence pursuant to
Sections 2 and 3(2), Article III of the 1987 Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that a search may be conducted by law enforcers only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">o</span>n the strength of a search warrant
validly issued by a judge.  This is
enshrined in the Bill of Rights.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn48" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a> Such
a rule, however, is not without exceptions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn49" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a> For
instance, a warrantless search may be validly made as an incident to a lawful
arrest<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn50" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

or in stop and search situations.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn51" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
Another recognized exception is when the accused himself waives his right
against unreasonable search and seizure.  As this Court stated in <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People
vs</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<i> Malasugui</i>:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn52" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"When one voluntarily submits to a search or consents to have
it made of his person or premises, he is precluded from later complaining
thereof (Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, 8th ed., vol. I, page 631.) The
right to be secure from unreasonable search may, like every right, be waived
and such waiver may be made either expressly or impliedly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution clearly discloses that accused
Ramos voluntarily allowed himself to be frisked and that he gave the gun to
Pat. Alfredo Rodillas.  This evidence
remained unrebutted by Ramos because his testimony on cross-examination was, as
earlier noted, stricken off from the records.  Moreover, his counsel did not object to any of the questions asked
during the direct examination of witness Lardizabal concerning the frisking of
Ramos and the recovery from him of the gun.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn53" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a> On
cross-examination, counsel for Ramos did not suggest or insinuate, even
obliquely, that Ramos did not voluntarily allow himself either to be frisked or
dispossessed of the gun by Pat. Rodillas.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn54" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That the prosecution did not present Pat. Rodillas as a witness
despite the fact that he was the one who frisked Ramos is not fatal to the
prosecution's cause.  Lardizabal was
himself an eyewitness to the frisking and seizure of the gun.  Hence, the testimony of Rodillas may be
dispensed with for being merely corroborative.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn55" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree, however, with accused Ramos that in Criminal Case No.
C-32861 (89), the prosecution failed to prove that he has no license or permit
to possess the firearm subject thereof.  The information therein specifically alleges that the said accused:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x without any lawful authority did then and there
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have in his possession, custody and
control one (1) .38 caliber Revolver marked S&amp;W without Serial Number,
(Paltik), 5 Shooters, Snub Nose, with two (2) live cartridges in its cylinder,
without first securing the necessary license or permit, to possess the
same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Yet, the prosecution presented no
evidence, oral or documentary, that Ramos had no license or permit to possess
the subject firearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">People </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vs. Tiozon</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Section 1 of P.D. No. 1866 (under which accused Ramos is charged in Criminal
Case No. C-32861(89)), the lack or absence of a license is an essential
ingredient of the offense which the prosecution must allege and prove; hence,
for failure of the prosecution therein to prove that Tiozon had no such
license, he could not be held guilty of illegal possession of a firearm.  We held therein thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Undoubtedly, there is unlawful possession under the foregoing
section if one does not have the license to possess the firearm.  Even if he has the license, he cannot carry
the firearm outside his residence without legal authority therefor.  It follows then that the lack or absence of
a license is an essential ingredient of the offense which the prosecution must
allege and prove.  Every element <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the crime must be alleged and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">proved.</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In <i>People vs</i>.<i> Pajenado</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn58" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a>
We said:</p>

<blockquote>"It is true that People vs. Lubo, 101 Phil. 179 and People vs.
Ramos, 8 SCRA 758 could be invoked to support the view that it is incumbent
upon a person charged with illegal possession of a firearm to prove the
issuance to him of a license to possess the firearm, but We are of the
considered opinion that under the provisions of Section 2, Rule 131 of the
Rules of Court which provide that in criminal cases the burden of proof as to
the offense charged lies on the prosecution and that a negative fact alleged by
the prosecution must be proven if ‘it is an essential ingredient of the offense
charged,’ the burden of proof was with the prosecution in this case to prove
that the firearm used by appellant in committing the offense charged was not
properly licensed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It cannot be denied that the lack or absence of a license is an
essential ingredient of the offense of illegal possession of a firearm.  The information filed against appellant in
Criminal Case No. 3558 of the lower court (now G.R. No. 27681) specifically
alleged that he had no ‘license or permit to possess’ the .45 caliber pistol mentioned
therein.  Thus it seems clear that it
was the prosecution's duty not merely to allege that negative fact but to prove
it.  This view is supported by similar
adjudicated cases.  In U.S. <i>vs</i>.<i>
</i>Tria, 17 Phil. 303, the accused was charged with having criminally
inscribed himself as a voter knowing that he had none of the qualifications
required to be a voter.  It was there
held that the negative fact of lack of qualification to be a voter was an
essential element of the crime charged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and
should be proved by the prosecution.  In
another case (People vs. Quebral, 68 Phil. 564) where the accused was charged
with illegal practice of medicine because he had diagnosed, treated and
prescribed for certain diseases suffered by certain patients from whom he
received monetary compensation, without having previously obtained the proper
certificate of registration from the Board of Medical Examiners, as provided in
Section 770 of the Administrative Code, this Court held that if the subject of
the negative averment like, for instance, the act of voting without the
qualifications provided by law is an essential ingredient of the offense
charged, the prosecution has the burden of proving the same, although in view
of the difficulty of proving a negative allegation, the prosecution, under such
circumstance, need only establish a </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">prima facie </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">case from
the best evidence obtainable.  In the
case before Us, both appellant and the Solicitor General agree that there was
not even a </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">prima facie </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">case upon which to hold appellant guilty of
the illegal possession of a firearm.  Former Chief Justice Moran upholds this view as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘The mere fact that the adverse party has the control of the better
means of proof of the fact alleged, should not relieve the party making the
averment of the burden of proving it.  This is so, because a party who alleges a fact must be assumed to have
acquired some knowledge thereof, otherwise he could not have alleged it.  Familiar instance of this is the case of a
person prosecuted for doing an act or carrying on a business, such as, the sale
of liquor without a license.  How could
the prosecution aver the want of a license if it had acquired no knowledge of
that fact? Accordingly, although proof of the existence or non-existence of
such license can, with more facility, be adduced by the defendant, it is
nevertheless, incumbent upon the party alleging the want of the license to
prove the allegation.  Naturally, as the
subject matter of the averment is one which lies peculiarly within the control
or knowledge of the accused <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">prima
facie </span></i>evidence thereof on the part of the prosecution shall suffice
to cast the onus upon him.' (6 Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1963
edition, p. 8).’”</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Hence, there being no proof that Ramos
did not have a license or permit to possess the firearm in question, he could
not be convicted of illegal possession of a firearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the contention of the Solicitor General that
since a <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paltik </span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>a homemade gun, is illegally
manufactured as recognized in <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">People

permit, it is no longer necessary to prove that it is unlicensed.  This appears to be, at first blush, a very
logical proposition.  We cannot,
however, yield to it because <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Fajardo
</span></i>did not say that <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paltiks </span></i>can
in no case be issued a license or a permit, and that proof that a firearm is a <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">paltik </span></i>dispenses with proof that
it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is<i> </i></span>unlicensed.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, We agree with the Office of the Solicitor General that
the penalty of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reclusion perpetua </span></i>imposed
by the trial court on accused Ramos in Criminal Case No. C-32860 (89) for
robbery in band is erroneous.  The
robbery committed is that defined and penalized in subdivision 5 of Article 294
(simple robbery) in relation to Articles 295 and 296 of the Revised Penal
Code.  The circumstances or conditions
in subdivisions 1 to 4 of Article 294 are not present in the said case.  The penalty imposable in subdivision 5 is
"<i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prision correccional </span></i>in
its maximum period to <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prision mayor </span></i>in
its medium period." Since the crime was committed by a band, and the
accused and his co-accused Antonio Contreras undoubtedly appear to be the
leaders of the band, the penalty imposable should, pursuant to the last
paragraph of Article 295 of the Code, be "the penalty next higher in degree,"
or <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prision mayor </span></i>in its
maximum period to <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reclusion temporal
</span></i>in its medium period.  The
offender shall, pursuant to Article 295, be "punished by the maximum
period of the proper penalties." Applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law,
and further appreciating against him the generic aggravating circumstance of
nighttime which, although not alleged in the information, was duly established
without objection on his part, accused Ramos shall then be meted with an
indeterminate penalty ranging from six (6) years of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">prision correccional </span></i>maximum as MINIMUM to seventeen (17)
years of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reclusion temporal </span></i>medium
