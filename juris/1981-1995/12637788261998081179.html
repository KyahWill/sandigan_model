				<H3>TEOFILO FINEZA AND VALENTINA FINEZA, COMPLAINANTS, VS. ELIAS ANACLETO, DEPUTY PROVINCIAL SHERIFF OF ILIGAN CITY, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The spouses <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span> filed the
instant case against Elias <span class="SpellE">Anacleo</span>, deputy provincial
sheriff of the Regional Trial Court at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged harassment and dereliction of
duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that in Civil Case No. V-70 of the de足funct
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte, the <span class="SpellE">Finezas</span> prevailed but upon appeal to the then Court of
Appeals the de足cision was reversed and the <span class="SpellE">Finezas</span>
were ordered, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, to pay the
opposing parties attorney's fees in the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000</span>.
00.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the appellate court's decision was remanded to the lower
court for execution of the judgment, the respondent addressed a letter to the
complainants to "settle" the payment of the attorney's fees or
"make some sort of arrangement" not later than April 15, 1985
otherwise their residential lot at <span class="SpellE">Pala</span>-o, <span class="SpellE">Iligan</span> City, would be sold at public auction on May 21,
1985 in order to satisfy the obligation. </p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1985</st1:date>
the complainants deposited P3<span class="GramE">,015.00</span> with the Regional
Trial Court at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> under O.R. No. 2919216 in
payment of the attorney's fees adjudged against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the payment, the property of the <span class="SpellE">Finezas</span> was advertised for sale at public auction in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lanao</u></span> <u>Mail</u> issues of April 22, April 29, and <st1:date year="1985" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainants now claim that the
publication of the sale in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lanao</u></span> <u>Mail</u>
and in other public places despite the payment already made was an act of
harassment which embarrassed, humiliated and destroyed their good name.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense the respondent states that it was only on April
24, 1985 that he came to know that the complainants had made the deposit
"when Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Valentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span>,
one of the complainants herein appeared at the respondent's office and was very
angry because, as according to her, why was the Notice of Sheriff's Sale of
their property still appeared in the LANAO MAIL, one of the City's local
newspaper, when they already paid the amount?" He also states that on the
same day he wrote a letter to the publisher of the <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>
Mail which was handed to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span> for delivery.</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter was worded thus:</p>

<blockquote>"May I request that the publication of the legal Notice in re:
<span class="SpellE">Fineza</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Badelles</span> be
stopped con足sidering that the plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span> have
already paid the judgment on the 12th yet so that this Notice could not have
been published.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The bearer, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span>, will
arrange with you as to the cost the one issue or I will just arrange with our
office that you will be compensated to the notice being stopped or suspended<span class="GramE">. "</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the letter, the publication of the sale in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lanao</u></span> <u>Mail</u> was not discontinued because,
according to the res足pondent, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span> did not
deliver the letter and his claim is confirmed by Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>
I. Jove, a stenographic reporter of the Regional Trial Court in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We dismiss the charge for utterly lacking in merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span> is a government auditor who holds office
"barely about 10 meters away from the Office of the Clerk of Court."
It would have been a simple matter for him to have informed the respondent who
had given the complainants ample time to pay the fees adjudged about the
deposit which he had made on <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="4">April 12,
 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he did not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when the respondent wrote a letter to the
publisher of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lanao</u></span> <u>Mail</u> to discontinue
the publication of the notice of sale, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fineza</span>
did not deliver the letter alleging later: "Why should I be the one to
stop the publication when I was not the one who have it published? Why should
we be the one to pay the cost of publication when we were not the one who <span class="GramE">have</span> it published?"</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant administrative case is dismissed
for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
