 June 2, 1991, at around 9:00 p.m., Elyboy So met his lady friend, 
Teresita Domingo, in a jeep in Quiapo bound for Pasig.&nbsp; Since Elyboy's 
house which is located in 2969-D Ramon Magsaysay Boulevard, Sta. Mesa, 
Manila, is walking distance to Teresita's house located in 2050 Abad 
Santos Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila, Teresita requested Elyboy to bring her
 home (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, pp. 6-7; Nov. 12, 1991, p. 7).<br><br>While
 walking along Araullo Street on their way to Teresita's house, they 
passed by the house of Elyboy's first cousin, Esteban, Edgar, and Emy, 
all surnamed So (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, pp. 8-9).<br><br>When they 
passed by his cousins' house, he saw his cousin Edgar with Ronnie Tan 
and three (3) others and noticed that a drinking spree was taking place 
in front of the house (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, pp. 9-10).<br><br>Upon 
seeing Elyboy, Edgar greeted him by saying: "Bingbong Crisologo is 
coming" (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, p. 10).&nbsp; He then invited Elyboy to have a
 drink and requested that his lady companion be introduced to them 
(t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, p. 11).&nbsp; Elyboy answered: "I cannot introduce 
her to you because she is mine" (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, p. 12).<br><br>Elyboy then proceeded to bring Teresita directly to her house (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, p. 12).<br><br>Immediately
 after bringing Teresita to her house, Elyboy passed by his cousins' 
house to honor their invitation (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, p. 12).<br><br>After
 an exchange of pleasantries, Edgar offered Elyboy a bottle of beer 
which the latter declined because it was already past 10:00 p.m. and he 
was on his way home already.&nbsp; Edgar convinced him to drink just a little
 and to stay awhile so he could also meet his future brother-in-law, 
Mario Tuquero, who will arrive later with his sister Emy.&nbsp; Elyboy was 
prevailed upon to stay on as he was also interested in meeting Mario 
(t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, p. 14).<br><br>Before Emy and Mario arrived, 
Edgar invited Elyboy and Ronnie to watch the dance in the playground 
which was part of the fiesta celebration.&nbsp; At the playground, Esteban 
met Edgar, Elyboy and Ronnie and informed them that Emy and Mario had 
arrived and instructed them to buy beer (t.s.n., October 23, 1991, pp. 
15-18).<br><br>Edgar, Elyboy and Ronnie proceeded to buy beer while Esteban went home ahead of them (t.s.n., October 23, 1991, p. 19).<br><br>After
 buying beer, they proceeded to the house.&nbsp; Upon arriving in the house, 
Emy introduced Elyboy to her boyfriend Mario (t.s.n., Oct. 23, 1991, pp.
 14-20).<br><br>Mario Tuquero worked as a manager of a restaurant in 
Paris, France, and arrived in the Philippines on March 7, 1991.&nbsp; Emy So,
 who is a registered nurse, met Mario sometime in March, 1991 and they 
started living in as husband and wife in her parents' house at 1920, 
Araullo Street, Sta. Mesa, Manila, also in the same month until June, 
1991.&nbsp; However, Mario was legally married to a certain Evelyn Tuquero 
and this fact was not known to Emy (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, pp. 37-39, 
42-43, 54-55).<br><br>The group, consisting of Esteban, Edgar, Elyboy, 
Ronnie, Mario and Emy resumed their drinking spree. However, after the 
group consumed four (4) cases of beer and before 3:00 a.m.,&nbsp; Emy felt 
sleepy and went inside (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, p. 52; Oct. 23, 1991, p. 
21).<br><br>While Emy was sleeping inside the house, she was awakened by
 the noise coming from the group outside their house (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 
1991, p. 59).<br><br>It turned out that Elyboy had a misunderstanding 
and altercation with somebody and he was shouting loudly, disturbing the
 neighbors in the process (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, pp. 59, 63).<br><br>After
 pacifying the protagonists, Mario advised Elyboy to go home because his
 loud voice was disturbing the neighbors (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, pp. 
62­-63).<br><br>After he was pacified and advised to go home, Elyboy ran towards home (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, pp. 62-63).<br><br>At
 around 4:00 a.m. of June 3, 1991, Mario and Emy decided to leave for 
Fairview Subdivision, Quezon City, in order to get papers of a vehicle 
owned by Mario that they will bring out of the Bureau of Customs 
(t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, pp. 30-31, 60).<br><br>While Mario and Emy were 
waiting for a taxi at the corner of Magsaysay Avenue and Pureza Street, 
Elyboy suddenly appeared from behind and stabbed Mario at the back 
several times with an eleven inch fan knife with a white handle (t.s.n.,
 Sept. 4, 1991, pp. 30, 32, 67; Sept. 9, 1991, p. 25).<br><br>Emy shouted for help (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, p. 33).<br><br>When
 Mario was about to run, he slid and fell to the ground lying on his 
back.&nbsp; Elyboy took advantage of this circumstance and repeatedly stabbed
 Mario on the front part of his body (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, p. 33).<br><br>Emy
 pleaded to Elyboy to stop stabbing Mario but Elyboy ignored her and 
continued delivering stabbing blows at Mario (t.s.n., Sept. 4, 1991, p. 
34).<br><br>Elyboy fled from the scene of the crime and ran to a dark alley (tsn., Sept. 4, 1991, p. 34; Oct. 23, 1991, p. 40).<br><br>Emy
 called for a taxi that passed by and brought Mario Tuquero to the 
University of the East - Ramon Magsaysay Memorial Hospital (tsn., Sept. 
1991, p. 34).<br><br>Elyboy stayed in the alley for about thirty (30) 
minutes until the policemen arrived at the scene of the crime and 
shouted at him to surrender.&nbsp; After a while, Elyboy went out of hiding 
and shouted at the policemen not to fire because he is surrendering.&nbsp; 
When Elyboy surrendered, he was blushing and uneasy and naked from the 
waist up because he removed his shirt to wipe the blood on his face 
(tsn., Sept. 9, 1991, pp. 6, 13; Nov. 12, 1991, p. 3).<br><br>Elyboy was
 then brought by the policemen to Precinct No. 8 of the Western Police 
District and the fan knife used was surrendered by Barangay Chairman 
Aida de los Santos to the police authorities (tsn., Sept. 9, 1991, pp. 
7, 25).<br><br>As a result of the stabbing incident, Mario suffered 
several stab wounds numbering eighteen (18) on the different parts of 
his body with at least four (4) fatal wounds causing his death (tsn., 
Sept. 4, 1991, pp. 8-23).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Appellant
 vehemently opposed the version of the prosecution.&nbsp; According to him, 
while they were drinking and talking about France, Esteban So suddenly 
stood up and said that the reason he was not able to work in France is 
because his surname was "So."&nbsp; Appellant felt aggrieved as he recalled 
the time when he lived with Esteban So and his family and was driven out
 by them.&nbsp; He was told that his only link to them is the surname "So."&nbsp; 
Then when Esteban So pulled a knife and Edgar So broke bottles of beer 
and Mario Tuquero pulled out "something" from his socks, appellant, 
fearing for his life, fled.&nbsp; Appellant claims that Esteban So and Mario 
Tuquero chased him but were not able to catch him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Appellant
 further narrated that when he tried to go back to his cousin's house 
and talk to them, he met Mario Tuquero and Emy So at the corner of 
Pureza and Magsaysay Streets. Suddenly Mario Tuquero attacked him with a
 knife but because Tuquero's thrust was slow, he was able to evade it. 
He grabbed the knife and proceeded to stab Tuquero repeatedly.&nbsp; He 
ignored the pleas of Emy So but finally stopped when four (4) persons in
 a jeep passed by and shouted at him.&nbsp; He ran into a dark alley until 
the police came and brought him to the police precinct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Appellant claimed self-defense and in the instant appeal assigned the following errors:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">I<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT OVERRULED SELF-DEFENSE IN THE INSTANT CASE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">II<br></div><br>THE
 LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT HELD THAT THE TESTIMONY OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT 
ELYBOY SO IS UNDESERVING OF CREDIT, IMPROBABLE AND IMPLAUSIBLE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">III<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT FOUND THAT THERE WAS TREACHERY IN THE INSTANT CASE.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">IV<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT DISREGARDED THE EXEMPTING CIRCUMSTANCE OF INSANITY ON THE PART OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT ELYBOY SO.<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">V<br></div><br>THE LOWER COURT ERRED WHEN IT CONVICTED ACCUSED-APPELLANT OF THE CRIME OF MURDER.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></blockquote><br>We deny the appeal.<br><br>Appellant's
 second assigned error, in essence, raises the issue of credibility of 
witnesses.&nbsp; Whose testimony is more believable and reliable, prosecution
 witness Emy So's narration or appellant's version? Appellant would like
 us to believe that Emy So's testimony was biased in favor of her 
brothers and the victim who was her common-law-husband<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> and aggravated by an alleged grudge harbored by her family against appellant's family.<br><br>We
 give no credence to appellant's argument.&nbsp; Long settled in criminal 
jurisprudence is the rule that when the issue is one of credibility of 
witnesses, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of 
the trial court, considering that the latter is in a better position to 
decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed 
their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial, unless it 
has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if 
considered, might affect the result of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>&nbsp;
 In the instant case, although Emy So readily admitted that her 
relationship with appellant was "not close," she explained that it was 
appellant who had ill-feelings against her family and bore a grudge.&nbsp; 
The defense has not shown such degree of partiality on the part of 
prosecution witness Emy So as would cast doubt on her credibility and 
impeach her testimony, especially when said testimony is "not inherently
 improbable in itself."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>&nbsp; Emy So testified thus:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">You
 mentioned of a grudge between your family and that of the Accused and 
this referred to the surname, So.&nbsp; What was the trouble all about?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Actually, there was no grudge with respect to the family name So. They really have grudge in our family, Your Honor.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">What was that grudge all about?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Their
 family is a broken family and ours is intact, Your Honor. And they live
 only from hand-outs from relatives and also from us, Your Honor.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">So, what was the grudge about? You even help them.&nbsp; You even helped the Accused.&nbsp; What was the grudge all about?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I just do not know really why they have such ill feelings towards us.&nbsp; I think it's jealousy "inggit," Your Honor.<br><br></div><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br></div>ATTY. DELOS SANTOS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">You are not concerned with Elyboy he being not a resident in your community?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">No, ma'am.<br></div><br>ATTY. DELOS SANTOS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">That is because you have grudge over this person.&nbsp; Referring to the Accused, is that correct?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">No, maam, we are not so close that's why.<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Another question.&nbsp; Is it your habit not to be concerned with the welfare of your relatives?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I have concerned to my other relatives, Your Honor.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">How about the Accused, you are not concerned with him?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">No, Your Honor.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Why, because of the fact between your family and their family?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">It
 could be said that way, Your Honor, because since then, he is a problem
 child that's why my feelings towards him is not so intimate anymore.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></div></blockquote><br>The
 fact alone that the victim was Emy So's live-in partner does not impair
 her testimony.&nbsp; The Court has time and again ruled that mere 
relationship of the witness to the victim does not automatically impair 
his credibility and render the testimony less worthy of faith and 
credit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>&nbsp; In <i>People v. Estrellanes, Jr. and Manolo,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> we put it thus:<br><br>...
 It is settled that the relationship of the key witness to the victim 
does not necessarily disqualify him for being biased and interested.&nbsp; A 
son or a wife is not incompetent to testify simply because of his or her
 relationship to the victim.&nbsp; In other words, the relationship of the 
witnesses to the victim does not <i>per se</i> affect their 
credibility.&nbsp; Their testimony must be evaluated and assessed according 
to its own merit and if not otherwise offset by more credible evidence 
on record or any other revealed intrinsic defect should be given credit.<br><br>Appellant's
 strategy to discredit Emy So on ground of bias and interest to 
exculpate himself from criminal liability cannot succeed.<br><br>Appellant
 maintains that he stabbed the victim in legitimate self-defense and 
invokes in his favor the constitutional presumption of innocence 
claiming that, despite his plea of self?defense, the prosecution retains
 the burden of proving his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup>&nbsp;
 This argument deserves no credit in light of the established and 
time-honored rule that when self-defense is invoked, the burden of 
evidence shifts to the appellant to show that the killing was justified 
and that he incurred no criminal liability therefor.&nbsp; He must rely on 
the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of the 
prosecution's evidence, for, even if the latter were weak, it could not 
be disbelieved after his open admission of responsibility for the 
killing.&nbsp; He must prove the essential requisites of self-defense, to 
wit: (a) unlawful aggression on the part of the victim, (b) reasonable 
necessity of the means employed to repel the aggression, and (c) lack of
 sufficient provocation on the part of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v</i>. <i>Jotoy</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> we stated:<br><br>It
 is oft-repeated that in criminal cases, the burden rests on the 
prosecution to establish the guilt of the accused by proof beyond 
reasonable doubt.&nbsp; However, when the accused invokes self-defense, the <i>onus probandi</i>
 is shifted and he is duty bound to prove the elements of the plea by 
clear and convincing evidence otherwise, conviction is inescapable.<br><br>We
 shall now proceed to determine whether or not appellant has completely 
and satisfactorily proven the elements of self-defense.&nbsp; The initial and
 crucial point of inquiry is whether there was unlawful aggression on 
the part of the victim for absent this essential element, no claim of 
self-defense can be successfully interposed.&nbsp; If there is no unlawful 
aggression, there is nothing to prevent or to repel and the second 
requisite of self-defense would have no basis.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>Appellant's
 claim that the victim, Mario Tuquero, attacked him with a knife fails 
to convince us.&nbsp; The record reveals glaring and serious inconsistencies 
in appellant's testimony that makes it totally unworthy of credence.<br><br>Appellant
 testified that he was able to wrest the knife from Tuquero because the 
latter's thrust was slow. However, this contradicts his statement during
 the same cross-examination, that the incident happened so fast and that
 Tuquero's attack was sudden.<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br></div><br>FISCAL PERALTA:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">And
 the first time that you saw Mario near the corner of Magsaysay and 
Pureza, how far were you in relation to him the first time that you saw 
him?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I 
think about 1 and 1/2 armslength, sir, because I was on the other side 
and Mario was also on the other side and we exactly met at the corner, 
sir.<br></div><br>FISCAL PERALTA:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">And the first time that you saw bringing out something from his waistline, what did you do?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The
 incident happened so fast, sir.&nbsp; After pulling out something from his 
waistline, immediately thereafter, he made a thrust on me but I was able
 to grab the knife from him, sir. (Underscoring ours.)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx</div></blockquote><br>Further, we share the incredulity of the trial court that the victim stabbed appellant in slow motion:<br><br>Even
 the testimony of the Accused denigrated his claim that he acted in 
self-defense.&nbsp; For, when he testified before the Court, the Accused 
claimed that Mario Tuquero stabbed him but that Mario Tuquero failed to 
hit the accused because Mario Tuquero stabbed the accused slowly and the
 Accused was able to evade the thrust and that the latter, thereupon, 
wrested the knife from Mario Tuquero.&nbsp; It is sheer lunacy for the 
Accused to asseverate that Mario Tuquero stabbed the Accused in slow 
motion...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>Even if 
we allow appellant's contention that Tuquero was the initial unlawful 
aggressor, we still cannot sustain his plea of self-defense.&nbsp; After 
appellant successfully wrested the knife from Tuquero, the unlawful 
aggression had ceased.&nbsp; After the unlawful aggression has ceased, the 
one making the defense has no more right to kill or even wound the 
former aggressor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>As correctly pointed out by the trial court:<br><br>...More,
 there is no evidence in the record that, after the Accused wrested the 
knife from Mario Tuquero, the latter still did any overt act to indicate
 that he still tried to grab or wrest back the knife from the Accused 
or, in any manner, persist in inflicting any harm on the Accused.&nbsp; On 
the contrary, after the Accused wrested the knife from Mario Tuquero, 
the Accused repeatedly stabbed Mario Tuquero in the front portions of 
his body even after Mario Tuquero embraced the Accused to hang on for 
dear life.&nbsp; At the time the Accused stabbed Mario Tuquero, the latter's 
initial unlawful aggression had already ceased and that there was, 
therefore, no more need for the Accused to still stab Mario Tuquero and 
stab him with impunity...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>We reiterated the same rule in <i>People v. Jotoy</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>But
 even if We assume that it was the deceased who attacked the accused 
with a knife, as the latter would make Us believe, We still hold that 
there was no self-defense because at that point when accused was able to
 catch and twist the hand of the deceased, in effect immobilizing him, 
the unlawful aggression had already ended.&nbsp; Thus, the danger having 
ceased, there was no more need for the accused to start stabbing the 
deceased, not just once but five (5) times.<br><br>and in <i>People v. Gomez</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>There
 was no self-defense where the accused was able to obtain possession of 
the weapon from the deceased and there was no necessity to stab the 
latter for aggression had already ceased.<br><br>Appellant's claim of 
self-defense is, likewise, contradicted and negated by the physical 
evidence on record. The victim sustained eighteen (18) stab wounds on 
different parts of his body.&nbsp; Of the eighteen (18), four (4) were fatal 
stab wounds.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup>&nbsp; The presence
 of a large number of wounds on the part of the victim, their nature and
 location disprove self-defense and instead indicate a determined effort
 to kill the victim.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>We quote with favor the observations of the trial court in this regard:<br><br>In
 this case, the evidence in the record buttresses the testimony of Emie 
So, on the one hand, and belied and deprecated the testimony of the 
Accused on the other.&nbsp; As can be gleaned from the Necropsy Report of Dr.
 Florante Baltazar, (Exhibits "B" and "C"), the deceased sustained no 
less than eighteen (18) stab wounds.&nbsp; Four (4) of the stab wounds 
sustained by the deceased were on the posterior aspects of his body, 
namely, stab wounds No. 4 (Exhibit "C-4"), stab wound No. 13 (Exhibit 
"B-13"), stab wound No. 15 (Exhibit "C-15") and stab wound No. 18 
(Exhibit "C-18") and the rest of the stab wounds sustained by the victim
 were on the anterior portions of his body.&nbsp; These jibe with the 
testimony of Emie So that the Accused suddenly darted from behind Mario 
Tuquero and stabbed him on the posterior aspects of his body and, when 
Mario Tuquero slipped because his shoe slid, and fell on the ground, 
face up, the Accused then stabbed Mario Tuquero anew successively on the
 anterior aspects of his body.<br><br>On the other hand, if the Accused 
acted merely on self-defense, it is incomprehensible that he would stab 
Mario Tuquero no less than eighteen (18) times (Exhibits "B" and "C"), 
not only on the anterior but also on the posterior aspects of his body.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup><br><br>Considering
 the number and nature of the wounds inflicted by appellant on the 
victim, the testimony of the prosecution witness Emy So that appellant 
unexpectedly and suddenly attacked the victim from behind and the fact 
that appellant suffered not a single injury, we agree with the trial 
court that the killing was attended by treachery. This clearly 
illustrates that appellant, in the commission of the crime, employed 
means, methods and form in its execution which tended directly, and 
especially to ensure its execution without risk to himself arising from 
the defense which the victim might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Not
 content with a self-defense plea the defense likewise seeks to exempt 
appellant from criminal liability by claiming that appellant was insane 
at the time he stabbed the victim.<br><br>The claim is unmeritorious.<br><br>The
 law presumes every man to be sane. A person accused of a crime who 
pleads the exempting circumstance of insanity has the burden of proving 
it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup><br><br>In order that 
insanity may be taken as an exempting circumstance, there must be 
complete depreciation of intelligence in the commission of the act or 
that the accused acted without the least discernment.&nbsp; Mere abnormality 
of his mental faculties does not exclude imputability.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>The
 testimony of Dr. Omer Galvez, Chief of the Child &amp; Adolescent 
Service of the National Center For Mental Health (NCMH) and attending 
physician of appellant when he was confined at the National Center for 
Mental Health from June 8, 1985 to December 2, 1985, only established 
the previous confinement of appellant at the NCMH and that appellant 
showed signs of psychosis or insanity at the time. The rest of his 
testimony consisted merely of assumptions, possibilities and 
generalities:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>ATTY.

 you said that this patient per your record was discharged on December

already healed or recovered from that kind of insanity?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">I
 can only say that at the time of the last check up he was doing well 
three (3) months after that, he was discharged because he failed to come
 back for his check-up, maam.&nbsp; (Underscoring ours.).<br></div><br>ATTY. DELOS SANTOS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">You mentioned that this will be for the rest of his life.<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">For

be able to recover or completely cured from it, maam.&nbsp; (Italics ours.)<br></div><br>ATTY. DELOS SANTOS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">When you say for the rest of his life, do we understand that this will be recurrent?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes, maam.<br></div><br>ATTY. DELOS SANTOS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">What are the causes that will trigger the recurrency of this kind of illness?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Generally,
 the main characteristic of this patients who are suffering from this 
illness is, they are very sensitive to any kind of social censures and 
criticisms.<br></div><br>ATTY. DELOS SANTOS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Could you enlighten what do you mean by social censures?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">If
 they were told about a behaviour that they are showing that is 
inacceptable, they will react to that in a disproportionate way, maam.<br></div><br>ATTY.

 and more importantly, the testimony of Dr. Galvez is bereft of any 
evidence that appellant was completely deprived of intelligence or 
discernment at the time or at the very instant when he stabbed the 
victim.<br><br>Well-settled is the rule that an inquiry into the mental 
state of appellant should relate to the period immediately before or at 
the very moment the act was committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup>&nbsp; In the present case, the testimony of Dr. Galvez refers to appellant's treatment six (6) years before the incident happened.<br><br>Moreover,
 Dr. Galvez admitted that after appellant's last check-up sometime in 
1985, or six (6) years before the crime was committed, he was doing well
 and relieved from psychosis:<br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">When he came back, after his discharge, was he given medication?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes, Your Honor.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">How did you find his behaviour when he came back for medication?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">As per record, he was doing well, Your Honor. (Underscoring ours.)<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">When you say doing well, what exactly do you mean by that?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">He was relieved from psychosis at that time, Your Honor.&nbsp; (Underscoring ours.)<br></div><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>FISCAL PERALTA:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">If
 the patient was discharged in 1985 and finished his college degree in 
four (4) years, do you think that by that time he was already cured of 
his sickness?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">It will look like that, sir. (Italics ours.)<br></div><br>FISCAL PERALTA:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">What do you mean it will look like that?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">It
 will look that while there are various types of clinical courses, 
meaning, the development of an illness in a patient and if the patient 
was able to finish college, then the outcome of the treatment that was 
given to him in 1985 was quite good.<br></div><br>FISCAL PERALTA:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">And
 do you think doctor that could have been the reason why he already 
failed to report on a monthly basis considering that he was already in 
college and actually finished his college degree?<br></div><br>ATTY. DELOS SANTOS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">That
 might be misleading, Your Honor, considering that the testimony of the 
doctor, he said that he should report six (6) months after the discharge
 but he took his college degree for several years thereafter.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">The
 only point of the fiscal is that, is that an indication of having been 
cured.&nbsp; If he was able to take and finished even college.&nbsp; Go ahead.<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">It
 would look that during that period, he would have been cured and there 
are some also who although that they may not be entirely cured would be 
able to get a degree, make the standards of education and there are some
 who could also get the standard of employment despite their craziness.&nbsp;
 "Medyo naitatago or nakakaya."&nbsp; Psychosis is something in many patients
 it is very obvious.&nbsp; You could see that they are really grossly 
disorganized "talagang sira."&nbsp; But there are some who has some ability 
to keep it just there and maintain a proper social behaviour and be able
 to achieve socially acceptable functioning in society.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">In other words, that illness is dormant.<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes, Your Honor.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">And it emerges in some point of time?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes, Your Honor.<br></div><br>COURT:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">So, it is possible doctor that the decease is there but at the same time, the patient is able to study?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes,
 Your Honor.&nbsp; The possibilities are these, he was cured, entirely cured 
during the period or the decease is just there and it is not affecting 
his behaviour. So there are two (2) possibilities. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> (Italics ours)</div></blockquote><br>A
 perusal of appellant's testimony further negates his plea of insanity.&nbsp;
 His recall of the events that transpired before, during and after the 
stabbing incident, as well as the nature and contents of his testimony, 
does not betray an aberrant mind.&nbsp; His memory conveniently blanks out 
only as to the number of wounds he inflicted on the victim.&nbsp; This, 
appellant attributes to insanity but we are far from convinced.&nbsp; A man 
may act crazy but it does not necessarily and conclusively prove that he
 is legally so.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup><br><br><blockquote><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br></div><br>FISCAL PERALTA:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Afterwards, when you got hold of the knife, you repeatedly stabbed him?<br></div><br>WITNESS:<br><br><div style="margin-left: 40px;">Yes,

Renegado</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> we held thus:<br><br>By
 his testimony appellant wants to convey that for one brief moment he 
was unaware or unconscious of what he was doing, that he 'regained his 
senses' when he heard the voice of Mrs. Tan telling him: 'Loreto, don't 
do that,' and only then did he realize that he had wounded Lira.&nbsp; That, 
to Us, is incredible.&nbsp; For it is most unusual for appellant's mind which
 was in a perfect normal state on Monday morning, August 29, to suddenly
 turn blank at that particular moment when he stabbed Lira.&nbsp; Appellant 
himself testified that he was acting very sanely that Monday morning, as
 shown by the fact that he went to the canteen in a jovial mood 
'singing, whistling, and tossing a coin in his hand'; he saw the persons
 inside the canteen namely, Venecia Icayan, Lolita Francisco, Benita 
Tan, Felipe Tingzon and a guest of the latter (all of whom, except the 
last one, testified for the prosecution); he noticed the arrival of Lira
 who banged his folders on the table, elbowed him, and said in a loud 
voice: 'ano ka', he saw Lira put his right hand inside his pocket and 
with the other hand push a chair towards him; he became 'confused' 
because he remembered that Lira threatened to kill him if he would see 
him again; <i>at this point he 'lost his senses'</i> and regained it 
when he heard the voice of Mrs. Tan saying: 'Loreto, don't do that', and
 he then found out that he had wounded Lira.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">If
 appellant was able to recall all those incidents, We cannot understand 
why his memory stood still at that very crucial moment when he stabbed 
Lira to return at the snap of a finger as it were, after he accomplished
 the act of stabbing his victim.</span>..&nbsp; (Italics our.)<br><br>and in the later case of <i>People v. Aquino,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup>&nbsp; we ruled:<br><br>The
 clinical case report also shows that appellant, when interviewed upon 
his admission to the mental institution, recalled having taken 120 cubic
 centimeters of cough syrup and consumed about 3 sticks of marijuana 
before the commission of the crime. This admission substantially affirms
 his prior extrajudicial confession that he was under the influence of 
marijuana when he sexually abused the victim and, on the occasion 
thereof, killed her. It is, therefore, beyond cavil that assuming 
appellant had some form of mental illness, it did not totally deprive 
him of intelligence.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">The presence of 
his reasoning faculties, which enabled him to exercise sound judgment 
and satisfactorily articulate the aforesaid matters, sufficiently 
discounts any intimation of insanity of appellant when he committed the 
dastardly felonies.&nbsp; </span>The annals of crime are replete with 
documented records, and we are not without our share in this 
jurisdiction, where mental illness has been feigned and invoked to 
provide a defense for the accused in a criminal prosecution. (Italics 
ours.)<br><br>In the present case, the defense has failed to adduce 
sufficient evidence to overthrow the presumption of sanity.&nbsp; The State, 
thus, continues, its guard against sane murderers who seek to escape 
punishment through a general plea of insanity.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is DISMISSED and the assailed decision is AFFIRMED <i>in toto</i>, with costs against appellant.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Padilla, (Chairman), Davide, Jr., Bellosillo,</i> and <i>Hermosisima, Jr., JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Original Records, p. 1.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Rollo, </i>p. 12.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Id</i>., p. 29.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>,<i> </i>pp. 92-99.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> TSN, October 23, 1991, pp. 26-31; TSN, November 12, 1991, pp. 7-10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> TSN, October 23, 1991, pp. 32-36, 38-40; TSN, November 12, 1991, p. 4.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 64.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Brief for the Accused-Appellant, pp. 18-19.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> People <i>v</i>.
