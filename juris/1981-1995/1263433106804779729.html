				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It was revolting enough that the accused-appellant forced his animal
lust upon a girl who was only thirteen years old.  What made his acts especially nauseating was that the victim of
his lasciviousness was his own daughter.</p>

<p class="BODY">And there was not only one attack.  There were three.  They
became the subject of separate informations, which were tried jointly in the
Regional Trial Court of Cavite.  The
cases resulted in the conviction of the accused-appellant, who was sentenced to
<u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> for each of the three rapes and required to
pay P50,000.00 moral damages to his victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As established by the testimony of Jenny Telio, the first rape
was committed on May 12, 1984, at about 2 o'clock in the afternoon at their
house.  She was alone with her
father.  While she was washing dishes in
the kitchen, he <span style="">pulled </span>her to the
bedroom, forced her to remove her clothes and then deflowered her.  She felt extreme pain.  However, she told no one about the attack
because her father threatened to kill her mother if she complained.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The second rape was committed on June 4, 1984, under practically
the same circumstances as the first.  Jenny again made no outcry or resistance because she was afraid of her
father.  Neither did she complain to her
mother because her father had repeated his earlier threat.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 11, 1984, the accused-appellant raped her again except
that now he boxed her in the thigh when she refused to submit to him.  He pointed a knife at her when he again
threatened to kill her mother.</p>

<p class="BODY">But this time the threat did not work because she could no longer
contain her outrage.  While her father
slept, she went to their neighbor, Erlinda Morales, and revealed that her
father had abused her.  Erlinda advised
her to tell her mother everything despite her father's threats.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Jenny returned to her house only after her brother fetched
her.  Erlinda Telio arrived home at
about five o'clock in the afternoon and found her daughter crying.  Upon being questioned, Jenny told her how
the accused-appellant had raped her three times.  The accused-appellant was in the bedroom while they were talking
in the kitchen.  The mother then took
her daughter to Erlinda Morales's house, where Jenny gave further details of <span style="">the </span>three times she was violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">That same evening, Jenny, accompanied by her mother and Erlinda
Morales, reported the incidents to the police and made a sworn statement of her
charges against her father.  The
accused-appellant was picked up from his house for investigation and
subsequently signed a sworn <span style="">confession.  Jenny was subjected to </span>a <span style="">medical </span>examination <span style="">two days later at the </span>PC Crime
Laboratory and <span style="">was </span>found to be
in a “non-virgin state.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Erlinda Telio and Erlinda Morales also testified for the
prosecution as corroboration witneses.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, the accused-appellant challenged his alleged
confesion as coerced and pleaded the defense of alibi.  He claimed that he was working on a fence in
Marikina from 7 o'clock <span style="">in </span>the
morning to 5 o'clock in the afternoon of May 12, 1984.  On June 4, 1984, he was at the same hours
painting <span style="">a </span>roof, also in
Marikina.  On June 11, 1984, he conceded
he was in their house but added that only his son Jimmy was there with
him.  He admitted he was drunk when the
police arrested him that night.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Andres E. Matias was correct in finding the
accused-appellant guilty as charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged <span style="">sworn </span>confession
should be disregarded <span style="">because </span>it
was obtained in violation of the accused-appellant's right to counsel.  But the telling testimonial evidence against
him, coupled with the weakness of his own defense, was sufficient to overcome
the constitutional presumption of innocence in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has repeatedly stressed its reliance on the trial
court in assessing the credibility of the witnesses whom it has <span style="">the opportunity </span>to observe at close
hand to ascertain from the manner they testify whether they are telling the
truth or falsifying it.  There being no
showing that the findings of the trial court in the case at bar were reached
arbitrarily, they are here affirmed.  We
particularly note with approval the following observations of Judge Matias on the
testimony of Jenny Telio and <span style="">her </span>mo<span style="">ther:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The manner in which they answered the questions propounded to them
on their direct examination and cross examination, their obvious sincerity and
readiness to disclose the facts inquired of them, of course characterized by
noticeable timidity and hesitancy as to the <span style="">delicate matters intimately linked to deflowering of the young child,
Jenny Telio, their naturalness and candor - singly and collectively - impressed
the </span>Court <span style="">with the truthfulness
of their testimonies. </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Alibi is an inherently weak defense, and it is not at all
persuasive in the instant case.  For one
thing, the accused-appellant did not present any witness to corroborate
him.  For another, he has not shown the
impossibility of his committing the rapes although he was allegedly working in
Marikina at the time, given the distance of that place from his own house in
Imus.  No less importantly, the trial
judge was also unimpressed by his manner on the stand which did not suggest
that he was telling the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">His other submission, to wit, that the charges were concocted by
his wife because he had a paramour, is ridiculous.  It is not natural for a mother to punish a husband's infidelity
by dishonoring her own daughter, <span style="">or </span>for
the daughter to voluntarily expose herself to shame simply to gratify her
mother's desire for vengeance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The choice here was between the sincere and straightforward
testimony <span style="">of </span>the victim as she
related <span style="">how </span>she was repeatedly
ravished by her own father and the lame excuses of her father who had the
temerity to suggest that it was not credible that a father would rape her own
daughter.  The choice was obvious, and
the trial court did not err in making it.</p>

<p class="BODY">  In one case, Justice
Vicente Abad Santos remarked that there should be "a special place in hell
for child molesters."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> The
accused-appellant deserves a deeper pit because the child he molested was his
own daughter.  More than any one else,
it was he to whom the child would have looked up for the protection of her
chastity.  He cynically betrayed that
faith with his unnatural lechery.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is fitting to conclude this opinion with the following words
of the Court in People v. Ramos:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>Rape is <span style="">a </span>nauseating
crime that deserves the condemnation <span style="">of
</span>all decent persons who recognize that a woman's cherished chastity <span style="">is </span>hers alone to surrender of her own
free will.  <span style="">Whoever violates that will descends to the level of the odious
beast.  The act becomes doubly repulsive
where the outrage is perpetrated on one's own flesh and blood for the culprit
is reduced to lower than the lowly animal.  The latter yields only to biological impulses and is unfettered by
social inhibitions when it mates with its own kin, but the man who rapes his
own daughter violates not only her purity and her trust but also the mores of
his society which he has scornfully defied.  By inflicting his animal greed on her in a disgusting coercion of
incestuous lust, he forfeits all respect as a human being and is justly spurned
by all, not least of all by the fruit of his own loins whose progeny he has
forever stained with his shameful and shameless lechery.</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>
and the appeal DISMISSED, with costs against the accused-appellant.  It is so ordered.</p>
