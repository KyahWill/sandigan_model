WHILE EUSEBIO DIONES WAS TESTIFYING:  'THIS IS THE SECOND TIME HE IS TELLING A LIE,' AND ADMONISHING HIM:  'WHY DO YOU COME HERE TO TELL A LIE, MR.
WITNESS?' TO WHICH NO LESS THAN THE PROVINCIAL PROSECUTOR REMARKED:  'WE ARE SADDENED ABOUT THIS.  x x x'.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Myrna Diones y Nitcha, the lone survivor of the crimes committed,
narrated the circumstances which led to the deaths of Vivian Gonzalez Diones,
Zenaida Diones Ragadi and Laurita Diones Nitcha, and which circumstances also
nearly caused her own demise.  Her
testimony was clearly and concisely summarized by the trial court as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On June 17, 1992, she (Myrna), together with her parents
Eusebio and Jaunita Diones and her sister, Zenaida Diones Ragadi were at their
home in Binalonan, Pangasinan.  At
around 9:00 o'clock in the morning, she and her sister, Zenaida Diones Ragadi, boarded
a vehicle to go to Urdaneta, Pangasinan, to fetch Laurita Diones Nitcha and
Vivian Gonzales Diones.  In Urdaneta
Pangasinan, the four girls rode a bus and went to San Fernando, La Union, each
with a purpose in mind.  Myrna Diones
was to meet her brother, Toribio Diones, who was working in San Fernando, La
Union, as her brother would give her money to spend for her uniform as she was
enrolled in the first year at the National High School in Binalonan,
Pangasinan.  Laurita Diones Nitcha hoped
to collect a debt from her mother-in-law in La Union, Vivian Gonzales Diones
wanted to see the child of Toribio Diones and Zenaida Diones Ragadi just went
along for the ride.  Upon reaching La
Union, they got off the bus at Pagdalagan, San Fernando, La Union.  At the waiting shed, they met Virginia
Manzano, Toribio Diones' wife who was on her way to the market.  She informed Myrna and her group that her
(Myrna's) brother, Toribio Diones, was out of town on a trip.  Since her purpose in going to La Union was
rendered naught, Myrna and her companions decided to go along with her
sister-in-law to the market.  At the
market they parted ways.  Virginia
Manzano went inside the market while Myrna's group went to the dry goods
section.  Myrna's companions Zenaida
Ragadi, Vivian Diones and Laurita Nitcha then went to a place along the
sidewalk where pants were being displayed while Myrna went across the street to
a drugstore to buy Cortal as she was suffering from headache which she
attributed to the long trip.  After
buying her pain reliever, and while she was still inside the drugstore, she
noticed a male person standing just around two feet away from her.  This male person who was four meters away
from where Myrna's companions were, appeared to be observing them as they were
still looking at the pants on display at the sidewalk.  When asked to identify this male person,
Myrna Diones pointed to accused Edwin Tubiera.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Myrna's companions then left the pant display and started walking
away.  Accused Edwin Tubiera followed
the girls and so Myrna also followed the group.  She saw her companions stop at the parking space for jeeps bound
for Lingsat, San Fernando, La Union.  She also stopped and there she saw accused Edwin Tubiera with an old man
whom she identified as accused Jose Flores.  While she and her companions were about to board a tricycle to go to her
Aunt's place, accused Tubiera told them not to leave.  Zenaida Ragadi asked what was their fault and why were they not
allowed to leave and accused Tubiera answered that they were thieves.  Zenaida Ragadi retorted that they could not
be thieves because they did not steal anything.  Accused Tubiera did not reply.  As the girls remained where they were, accused Flores used his hand-held
radio and after a while, three policemen arrived in a vehicle.  One of them alighted from the vehicle and
Myrna overheard accused Flores tell him to bring the girls to 'Station B'.  The girls were then told to board the
vehicle.  Another policeman whom Myrna
identified as accused Leonito Macapagal boarded the vehicle at the back and sat
beside the door of the vehicle.  The
vehicle left the place and soon, Myrna read a sign which said 'Airport San
Fernando'.  The vehicle then stopped at
a place near said signpost, which Myrna presumed to be Station B.  The girls were made to alight and enter the
station where they were detained in a small cell.  Myrna then saw three other male persons inside the station whom
she identified in open court as accused Amado Merca, Manuel Corpuz and Romeo
Artienda.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As it was<b><i> </i></b>already lunch time on June 17, 1992 when
they were brought to the station, the girls were fed by accused Tubiera.  Accused Leonito Macapagal and the other
policemen who brought them to the station had already left.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The cell where they were detained was small measuring 112 inches by
48 inches and contained four folding beds.  The girls were kept detained there until dinner time and again it was
accused Tubiera who fed them their dinner.  They were made to sleep in their cell that night and the following day,
June 18, 1992, they were still being detained.  Again it was accused Tubiera who fed them their breakfast and
lunch.  When the men inside the station
went outside, the cook, an old short man approached the girls in their cell and
told them to tell the truth as the men who detained them were killers.  But they replied that there was nothing to
tell.  The girls then cried and they
were still crying when the men returned inside.  The night of June 18, 1992, at around 11:30 o'clock [sic] in the
evening, a tall male person arrived at the station, looked at them and went to
sleep on a folding bed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At 12:45 o'clock [sic] in the early morning of June 19, 1992,
accused Leonito Macapagal came to the station and told them that they were
going to see the mayor.  However, on
cross examination, Myrna admitted that it was not accused Macapagal who came to
their cell at 12:45 o'clock [sic] that early morning but accused Jose
Flores.  Outside the station, Myrna saw
a white Ford Fiera and a red car.  She,
Zenaida Diones Ragadi and Vivian Gonzales Diones were made to board the white
Ford Fiera with accused Jose Flores, Romeo Artienda, Amado Merca, Manuel Corpuz
and Edwin Tubiera following them inside.  Laurita Diones Nitcha was placed inside the red car with the tall man
who arrived at 11:30 o'clock [sic] that evening.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Inside the Ford Fiera, accused Jose Flores occupied the front seat
and accused Romeo Artienda took the driver's seat.  At the back of the vehicle, Tubiera sat beside Myrna who was
seated at the back of the driver.  Occupying the seat opposite Myrna and accused Tubiera were Vivian
Gonzales Diones and Zenaida Diones Ragadi.  Seated beside Zenaida was accused Merca and accused Corpuz took the seat
beside Vivian.  When everybody was
seated, the vehicle took off with the red car following closely behind.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While the vehicle was moving, Myrna saw the sign 'Municipality of
Naguilian'.  As the vehicle went on and
further away, Myrna saw another sign which read 'Welcome to Burgos'.  She noticed that the red car where Laurita
was boarded was still following them as she could see the car's
headlights.  It was at this point that
accused Flores ordered his co-accused to handcuff the girls.  The girls' hands were then placed behind
their backs and accused Tubiera handcuffed Myrna, accused Corpuz handcuffed
Vivian while accused Merca handcuffed Zenaida.  As they drove on, Myrna noticed that inside the vehicle were a tire,
rope and a piece of rounded wood with pointed ends.  She was able to notice these things as there was a light inside
the Ford Fiera.  The vehicle continued
moving and soon Myrna read a sign which said 'Welcome to Cordillera'.  When Myrna saw this sign, she noticed that
the red car was still following behind the vehicle where she and the other
girls were.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was at this juncture that accused Flores directed his co-accused
to tie the girls.  Accused Tubiera then
tied a rope around Myrna's neck.  She
saw accused Merca tie a rope around Zenaida's neck while accused Corpuz tied a
rope around Vivian's neck.  Subsequently, Myrna saw accused Merca and Corpuz start mauling Zenaida
and Vivian, respectively.  Accused
Tubiera then stabbed her left eyebrow with the pointed piece of wood she saw
inside the vehicle.  Then with the same
piece of wood, accused Tubiera hit her head three times until she fell
unconscious."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At around 8:00 in the morning of 19 June 1992, the Sablan Police
Station, Sablan Benguet received a report of an alleged "salvage"
(summary execution) victim found at Sitio Dakes, Banangan, Sablan, Benguet
about twenty (20) feet below the level of Naguilian Road.  An investigation team from the Sablan Police
Station initially found the body of a dead female victim which bore what
appeared to be strangulation marks around the neck and stab wounds on different
parts of the body.  The police team also
found two (2) different colored sandals and a shoe about two (2) to three (3)
meters away from the victim.  This
prompted the police to look for other victims.  The police team, together with employees from the Ilagan Funeral Homes
who were requested by the police to assist them, later found a second female
body about fifty (50) feet from the first body.  The second victim had a nylon rope tied around her neck and bore
several stab wounds.  A third victim was
then found about thirty (30) feet from the second body.  The third victim turned out to be Myrna
Diones, who was alive but unconscious and had various injuries similar to those
of the first two (2) victims.  Myrna
Diones was brought to the Baguio General Hospital where she later regained
consciousness.</p>

<p class="BODY">SPO1 Edward L. Esperanza, Chief Investigator of the Sablan Police
Station, who heard about the discovery of "salvage" victims near
Naguilian Road and that one victim, who was still alive, was brought to the
Baguio General Hospital (BGH), immediately proceeded to the BGH.  He arrived at the hospital before 2:00 in
the afternoon of 19 June 1992 and he was able to interview Myrna Diones who had
just regained consciousness and could hardly talk.  Myrna was able to relate to him how she, together with her
sister, sister-in-law and cousin, were picked up by persons who they believed
to be members of the San Fernando Police force.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 June 1992, another female body was recovered about a kilometer
away from the place where the three (3) victims were found on 19 June
1992.  The fourth victim, later
identified as Laurita Diones, likewise bore several stab wounds and signs of
strangulation.<span style="font-size: 17pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Myrna Diones was also interviewed by SPO4 Mariano Rabaja III,
Chief Investigator of the Criminal Investigation Service (CIS) Cordillera
Regional Command Office (CRECOM) on 20 June 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Major Mario San Diego, Regional Chief of the CIS-CRECOM, upon
being informed by SPO4 Rabaja of Myrna's statements, <span style="">got </span>in touch with Colonel Amado Espino, Provincial Director of
the Philippine National Police (PNP), La Union<span style=""> </span>Provincial Command and informed him of the possible involvement
of some of his (Espino's) men in the crimes.  Col. Espino furnished the CIS with a copy of the Disposition of Troops
of the San Fernando Police Station for the month of June 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The CIS also secured photographs of all policemen in San Fernando, La
Union.  These photographs, which were
pasted on separate sheets of paper, were later shown to Myrna Diones so she
could identify the policemen who allegedly abducted, detained and attacked
them.  From the set of about 35
pictures, Myrna was able to single out five (5) photographs of policemen.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 24 June 1992, Myrna was taken to Camp Diego Silang, San
Fernando, La Union.  Members of the San
Fernando, La Union police force were then made to line-up and Myrna was
instructed to point to their attackers, if they were present.  The line­-up was conducted under the
supervision of Colonel Espino and Major San Diego.  Myrna was made to stand behind a one-way mirror and she readily
identified five (5) of the policemen, SPO1 Jose Flores, PO1 Amado Merca, PO3
Manuel Corpuz, PO3 Romeo Artienda, Jr. and PO3 Edwin Tubiera.  Myrna was then taken to the Canaoay Police
Substation where she was able to verify that it was the place where they were
detained by the accused-appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 July 1992, Myrna was again shown photographs of policemen
of San Fernando, La Union.  She was able
to recognize one (1) other alleged attacker.  Another line-up was conducted where she identified SPO4 Leonito
Macapagal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was on the basis of these identifications made by Myrna Diones
that the aforequoted informations for murder of the three (3) victims and
frustrated murder of Myrna were filed with the Regional Trial Court of La
Trinidad, Benguet.</p>

<p class="BODY">The five (5) accused-appellants presented their individual
defenses as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">SPO1 Jose Flores testified that on 17 June 1992, he reported for
duty at 8:00 in the morning at the Canaoay Police Substation where he stayed
until 6:00 in the morning of 18 June 1992.  He admitted being alone at his post until accused-appellants Edwin
Tubiera and Amado Merca reported for duty at 7:00 in the evening of 17 June
1992.  He further stated that he went home
to change clothes and have breakfast and then returned to the substation at
8:00 in the morning of 18 June 1992, where he stayed until 6:00 in the morning
of the following day.  At 7:00 in the
evening of 18 June 1992, he was joined at the substation by accused-appellant
Manuel Corpuz and a certain Police Officer Robert Cabrera.  Flores stated that the three (3) of them
stayed at the substation the whole night and that none of them ever left their
posts.  Flores denied ever seeing Myrna
Diones or any of the three (3) other victims at the substation on the
above-mentioned dates.</p>

<p class="BODY">To corroborate his testimony, Flores presented Rodolfo Flores, a
barangay councilor of Canaoay, San Fernando, La Union and Mariano S. Lete, the
barangay captain of Canaoay, San Fernando, La Union.</p>

<p class="BODY">Flores (no relation to accused-appellant Jose Flores) testified
that at about 3:00 in the afternoon of 17 June 1992, he went to the Canaoay
police substation to take shelter from the heat of the sun.  He stated that he saw SPO1 Jose Flores alone
at the substation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lete in turn testified that at about 4:00 in the afternoon of 18
June 1992, he dropped by the Canaoay police substation and saw SPO1 Flores
alone manning his post.</p>

<p class="BODY">Flores and Lete testified that neither of them saw any girls
detained at the Canaoay police substation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Edwin Tubiera testified that at 6:30 in the
morning of 17 June 1992, he reported for traffic duty at the intersection of
Gen. Luna and P. Gomez streets in San Fernando, La Union, and that he never left
his traffic post until his duty ended at 6:00 in the evening except when he
took his lunch at a nearby eatery at around 1:00 until about 1:30 in the
afternoon.  He further testified that
after his traffic duty, he proceeded to the Canaoay police substation where he
arrived before 7:00 in the evening.  He
stated that his co-accused, Flores was already at the substation when he
arrived and another co-accused, Amado Merca, arrived a short while later.  Tubiera corroborated SPO1 Flores' testimony
that only the three (3) of them were at the substation in the evening of 17
June 1992, and that none of them left the station that night.  Tubiera further stated that after his duty
ended at 8:00 in the morning of 18 June 1992, he proceeded home to San Vicente,
San Fernando, La Union where he stayed until he reported for duty at 6:30 in
the morning of 19 June 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">To support his story, Tubiera presented his mother, Juana D.
Tubiera, and the barangay secretary of San Vicente, San Fernando, La Union,
Helen F. Pimentel.   Mrs. Tubiera
testified that her son stayed home the whole day of 18 June 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pimentel, on the other hand, testified having talked to
accused-appellant Edwin Tubiera for thirty (30) minutes in the evening of 18
June 1992 when she went to the latter's house to borrow a typewriter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Amado Merca testified that at 6:30 in the
morning of 17 June 1992, he reported for traffic duty at the intersection of P.
Gomez and Don Pacoy Ortega Streets in San Fernando, La Union and that he never
left his traffic post until his duty ended at 6:00 in the evening, except when
he took his lunch at around 12:00 noon, returning to his post before 1:00 in
the afternoon.  When his traffic duty
ended at 6:00 in the evening, he ate dinner at a canteen near his traffic post
and he thereafter proceeded to the Canaoay police substation since he was on
night duty until 8:00 in the morning of 18 June 1992.  He stated that his co-accused Flores and Tubiera were already at
the station when he arrived and he likewise contended that all three (3) of
them remained at the station the whole evening.  Merca further testified that at 8:00 in the morning of 18 June
1992, he proceeded to the house of his common-law wife at Damortis, La Union.  He arrived there at about 10:00 that same
morning and he stayed there until 5:00 in the morning of 19 June 1992 when he
left to report for traffic duty at his assigned post.  Merca added that at around 12:00 midnight on 19 June 1992, a
neighbor requested him to accompany him in fetching the latter's son who was
involved in a fight at a dance in a nearby barrio.  Merca stated that he returned at around 1:00 in the morning.</p>

<p class="BODY">Merca's neighbor, Enrique Abril, corroborated the former's
testimony that Merca accompanied him to fetch his son.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Romeo Artienda, Jr. testified that on 17 June
1992, he reported for duty at the Santiago Police Substation at San Fernando,
La Union at 8:00 in the morning and he stayed at said sub-station until 8:00
the next morning after which he went home to Barangay Ilocanos Norte, San
Fernando, La Union since it was his day off.  He allegedly stayed home the entire day and at about 10:00 in the
evening, his neighbor Sergio Boado came to his house and the two (2) of them played
chess until 2:30 in the morning of 19 June 1992.  He denied having anything to do with the crimes.</p>

<p class="BODY">SPO3 Benjamin J. Dumaguing, Commander of the Santiago Police
Substation, testified that Romeo Artienda, Jr. reported for duty at 8:00 in the
morning of 17 June 1992 until 8:00 in the morning of the following day.  He further stated that Artienda never left
the station during that period.</p>

the day playing mahjong at a neighbor's house.  The game ended at 3:00 in the afternoon after which he went home to
sleep.  At 6:30 in the morning of 18
June 1992, Corpuz stated that he reported for traffic duty at Saint Louis
College, Barangay Lingsat, Quezon Avenue, San Fernando, La Union.  He stayed at his post until 6:00 in the
evening of the same day, leaving his post only to take lunch at a store a few

<p class="BODY">The crimes committed against Myrna Diones and the three (3)
deceased victims were widely publicized and sensationalized immensely.  The records of this case show that various
human rights groups, legal aid organizations and the media have shown
extraordinary interest in these cases.  The story of Myrna Diones has even become the subject of a full-length
movie, which was shown despite these cases being <i>sub judice</i>.  The trial court, in its decision in these
cases, found it necessary to state that:</p>

<blockquote>"These cases have attracted nationwide attention probably by
the very fact that those who are called to enforce the law are being charged
with very serious offenses.  It has
become so sensationalized that the media, in its enthusiastic desire to widen
their readership, have always alluded to the accused not only the crimes of
murder but rape as well.  Almost all
newspaper articles and radio commentaries about these cases have indicated that
the victims have not only been murdered but raped as well.  To remove all nagging doubts as to the crime
of rape, the Court will digress to set the record straight once and for all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From all the evidence presented by the prosecution, there has never
been any talk of rape.  The lone
survivor, Myrna Diones, did not testify that there was any rape.  Both doctors who testified did not make any
statement that any of the victims were raped.  There clearly is no evidence that any of the girls were raped".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is unfortunate that some groups have caused the real story of
Myrna Diones to become muddled with accounts that the victims had been
raped.  There was, we repeat, no
evidence to support such a conclusion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motives of these groups can only be surmised but the possible
consequences are easily ascertained.  While the Court recognizes the role of media in preventing any possible
"whitewash" of this type of cases, it should be remembered that
media's role is to report only the established facts of the cases, in short,
the truth.  Conjectures and inferences
unsupported by evidence should be avoided not only because the injured parties
and the accused may be unduly embarrassed or prejudiced but more importantly,
since it may prevent a fair and unbiased trial of the case.  Moreover, it should be noted that publicity
can work like a double-edged weapon.  It
can insure that the guilty are punished but it can also, if used by the
insidious, create the reasonable doubt which can result in the acquittal of the
real perpetrators.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, a responsible media has an important role in the war
against criminality.  However, it should
be made clear that any conduct of media, or any other party for that matter,
which tends to, directly or indirectly, impede, obstruct or degrade the
administration of justice, is subject to the contempt powers of the
courts.  The courts should and will not
hesitate to use this power when acts inimical to the speedy and impartial
dispensation of justice are committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants' grounds for the present appeal can be
classified into:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">1.  The issue of the credibility of Myrna
Diones;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">2.  The issue of the identification of the
bodies of the victims; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">3.  The issue of whether or not
accused-appellant's respective alibis deserve credence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants contend that Myrna Diones' testimony contains
inconsistencies, infirmities and contradictions which allegedly affect her
entire credibility as a witness.</p>

<p class="BODY">More specifically, according to accused-appellants, Myrna Diones'
testimony should be rejected for the following reasons:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.  Myrna initially identified Leonito
Macapagal as one of the persons who went with them to Naguilian Road on 19 June
1992 but she later withdrew the identification of Macapagal, saying that she
was confused.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.  Myrna failed to describe the vehicle used
in allegedly taking their group from the market to the Canaoay Police
Substation but she readily identified and described the Fiera-type vehicle
which took the group to Naguilian Road.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.   It is highly improbable for Myrna to have
read the road signs along Naguilian Road in complete darkness.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4.  Myrna was inconsistent in answering
questions regarding her enrollment in school.  She first denied being admitted to any school but later admitted being
already enrolled at the National High School of Binalonan, Pangasinan and
further stated that the reason she went to San Fernando, La Union on 17 June
1992 was<b> </b>to borrow money from her brother so she could buy her school
uniform.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants also challenge the identification of the three
(3) female bodies made by Eusebio Diones, Myrna Diones' father.  It is argued that Eusebio is a perjured
witness since his inconsistent and contradicting statements even elicited an
observation by the trial court that he was lying.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Accused-appellants further argue that the prosecution should have presented the
persons who, according to Eusebio Diones, were with him when he identified the
bodies of the victims at the funeral parlor, since his credibility has been put
into question by his inconsistent statements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants further argue that identification of the
bodies became extremely difficult since the bodies were in an advanced stage of
decomposition when recovered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellants argue that the trial court erred in
failing to appreciate their respective alibis which were corroborated by
credible witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised by accused-appellants basically concern the
trial court's findings of fact and on the credibility of the witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is settled that this Court does not generally disturb
the findings of the trial court on the issue of credibility of witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court having observed the manner, conduct and demeanor of the
witnesses while on the stand is clearly in a better position to determine the
weight to be given to their respective testimonies.  Absent clear showing that the trial court overlooked certain
facts and circumstances which might alter the result of the case, the Court
accords respect, even finality, to these findings of fact made by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of the entire records of this case,
including the transcripts of the testimonies of the witnesses covering almost
1,200 pages, the Court finds no reason to modify much less reverse the judgment
of conviction rendered by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Myrna Diones, the lone survivor of the heinous crimes committed,
was able to positively identify each of the accused-appellants not only once
but thrice.</p>

<p class="BODY">She first picked out their photographs from the photographs of
policemen assigned to San Fernando, La Union.  She then pointed to each accused from a line-up of several
policemen.  The line-ups were conducted
under the supervision of Major Mario San Diego, the Regional Chief of the
Criminal Investigation Service-Cordillera Regional Command and Colonel Amado
Espino, the Provincial Director of the Philippine National Police, La Union
Provincial Command, thus negating any insinuation that Myrna Diones was coached
or coerced to point to the accused-appellants.  Finally, Myrna Diones, while testifying in open court, positively
identified each of the five (5) accused-appellants as the perpetrators of the
crimes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her (Myrna's) testimony may not be consistent on all details but
it should be considered that she was made to recount her ordeal less than six
(6) months after the actual incident.  To a girl barely sixteen (16) years of age, the experience was
undoubtedly terrifying, to say the least.  It is to be noted that Myrna shed tears while she narrated her experience
before the trial court.  On at least two
(2) occasions, her testimony had to be reset to a later date since the court
observed that she could not continue her testimony because she was crying.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
No ill motive was ever imputed to Myrna to falsely implicate
accused-appellants.  To be sure, Myrna
realized how close she was to death and having survived, the natural thing was
to make sure that those who had wronged her and her companions are convicted.  The discrepancies in her testimony can be
attributed to several factors among which are the mental and psychological
strain of having to recall the details of the harrowing incident and the fact
that she testified for eight (8) days, five (5) of which were on rigorous
cross-examination by defense counsel.  Nothing in her testimony, covering almost 350 pages of transcripts, even
slightly indicates any doubt as to the identities of the assailants.  Instead of being discredited, her testimony
should be upheld for being clear, spontaneous and unwavering.  The minor inconsistencies are indications
that her testimony was truthful and unrehearsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against Myrna Diones' positive identification of
accused-appellants as the authors of the crimes, the latter interposed their
individual alibis.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>People v. Salveron</i><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"The alibi itself, although corroborated x x was not
convincing enough in the face of the positive identification x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>People v. Cortes</i><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
it was ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"Justifiably, courts have always looked upon the defense of
alibi with suspicion and have received the same with caution, not only because
it is inherently weak and unreliable but also because of its easy
fabrication.  It cannot prevail over the
clear, direct and positive testimony of prosecution witness Dignos identifying
appellants as the perpetrators of the crime."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the cases at bench, the alibis presented do not clearly show
that it was impossible for the accused-appellants to be at the <i>locus
criminis </i>at the time the crimes were committed.  It is of note that a certain police officer, Robert Cabrera, who
could have corroborated the alibis of Manuel Corpuz and Jose Flores, if the
defense version were to be given credence, was never presented.  The presumption therefore is that his testimony
would be adverse to the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The other defense witnesses who tried to establish the alibis of the other
accused-appellants can hardly be con­sidered to be disinterested
witnesses.  Against Myrna Diones'
positive identification that the five (5) accused-appellants were the
perpetrators, the alibis would have to fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument that there is no evidence to show that the dead
bodies recovered were those of Myrna Diones' three (3) companions deserves
scant consideration.  Eusebio Diones
positively identified the bodies of all the dead victims as being those of his
daughter Zenaida Diones and his two (2) nieces Vivian Diones and Laurita Nitcha<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><b>
</b>The trial court upheld his identification of the victims despite the
observation that he may have been lying about his meetings with a certain Atty.
Pablito Sanidad.  In this regard, it can
be said that it is the prerogative of the trial court to reject only a part of
a witness' testimony while upholding the rest.  Furthermore, notwithstanding the testimony of Dr. Judith Codamon that
the bodies had bloated to about twice their normal size and identification
would be extremely difficult,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
it should be remembered that Eusebio Diones was closely related to all the
victims as to make identification of the victims feasible despite their
advanced stage of decomposition, and even Dr. Codamon never made any statement
that identification was impossible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants in their Reply brief also argue that since
Myrna Diones admitted having fallen unconscious after she was struck in the head,
she could not have testified to the actual commission of the crimes.  Hence, accused-appellants conclude that the
findings of the trial court that they committed the crimes are really without
basis.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is specious.  What occurred subsequent to Myrna Diones' becoming unconscious is
adequately established by the other circumstances testified to by Myrna.</p>

<p class="BODY">As previously discussed, Myrna Diones was able to convincingly
testify to the participation of the five (5) accused-appellants in taking her
and her three (3) female companions to Naguilian Road in the early hours of 19
June 1992.  Myrna testified that her two
(2) companions in the Fiera­-type vehicle were handcuffed, tied around the neck
with rope and mauled by the accused-appellants.  Myrna testified that she, herself, was stabbed and hit three (3)
times with a wooden club by accused-appellant Edwin Tubiera before she fell
unconscious.  The acts of
accused-appellants clearly show that there was a conspiracy to inflict
potentially fatal injuries on the four (4) women.  Myrna and the three (3) deceased victims sustained injuries
consistent with Myrna's account of how they were mauled, stabbed and strangled
with ropes.</p>

<p class="BODY">That accused-appellants were the authors of the crimes committed
is adequately established by circumstantial evidence which proves with moral
certainty that accused-appellants not only conspired in inflicting injuries on
Myrna Diones and the three (3) deceased victims but that they also conspired in
committing the crimes of Murder with Unintentional Abortion, Double Murder and
Frustrated Murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the offer of accused-appellants to compromise, which was
never denied, constitutes additional evidence against their innocence.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the constitutional presumption of innocence in favor of
accused-appellants has been overcome by proof which to a moral certainty
establishes their guilt for the crimes of Double Murder, Murder with
Unintentional Abortion and Frustrated Murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The five (5) accused-appellants are still fortunate that the
court could not then impose the penalty of death upon them, for undoubtedly
they would have been sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of death for
having violated, so heinously at that, the laws which they had sworn to uphold
as members of the police force.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<b> </b>the joint decision rendered by the trial
