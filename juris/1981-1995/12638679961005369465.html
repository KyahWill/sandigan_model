<p class="BODY">Of all the seven accused, only CPL. CONRADO DE LA CRUZ and
SPOUSES CRISOSTOMO GALAW-EY and CRESENCIA GALAW-EY were arraigned and tried;
all three pleaded "not guilty." The four co-accused soldiers, namely,
Eduardo Castillo, <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Poquiz</span>,
Tito <span class="SpellE">Seguin</span>, and Fidel Bravo were, and still are, at
large after having been discharged from the military service because of their
alleged involvement <span style="">in </span>the
massacre <span style="">of </span>August 10,
1984.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter the six cases <span style="">were </span>tried jointly against the three
accused <span class="SpellE">abovenamed</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In proving the guilt of the three accused-appellants, the
prosecution relied solely on circumstantial evidence, as it did not present
anybody who actually saw the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
other words, there was no eyewitness to the crime who testified at the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution theorizes that a pistol-whipping incident that
happened on April 10, 1984, involving <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span>, one of the accused, and Roberto <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>, one of the victims, who, however, survived,
provided the motive for the despicable massacre.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that sometime <span style="">in </span>March 1984, <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>
had an altercation with <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey's</span> uncle in the Western Valley Restaurant where <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span> was moonlighting as a security guard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that altercation, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
punched <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span> on the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, or in the evening of <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1984</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> decided to patch up their differences
inside the same restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However,
before they could talk, a stranger suddenly appeared, pulled out a gun and
pistol-whipped <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> on the face, causing him
injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This incident, the prosecution
proffers, is the reason why <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> nursed a grudge against <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>
and wanted to get even with the latter that night of <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is the motive of this ghastly killing rampage accepted by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution would also have us believe that there was
conspiracy among all the seven accused ostensibly based on the following facts
as testified to by the prosecution's witnesses:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All five co-accused soldiers, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, Tito <span class="SpellE">Seguin</span>, Fidel
Bravo, Eduardo Castillo and <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Poquiz</span> arrived together in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
from <span class="SpellE">Bontoc</span>, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Mt.</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype></st1:place> carrying with them their
respective <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span> Rifles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before they could arrive in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
three of them, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de la Cruz, Tito <span class="SpellE">Seguin</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Poquiz</span> alighted
at <span class="SpellE">Tomay</span>, La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>
and met with spouses <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> at their
residence at <span class="SpellE">Tomay</span>, La Trinidad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(One of the soldiers, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
de la Cruz, is the brother-in-law of <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span>; he being the brother of the latter's wife, <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span>)</blockquote>

vicinity of the Western Valley Restaurant, the scene of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were seen with their Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> jitney with Plate No. AVC 778;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Near the Western Valley Restaurant and

and <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span>
rifles were later taken by three men from <span style="">said </span>Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> jitney;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three men with <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span>
rifles were seen near the door of the Western Valley Restaurant immediately
before and after gunshots rang out <span style="">in </span>said restaurant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the three men was identified as
accused <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de la Cruz;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Twenty one (21) of the thirty empty shells
recovered from the crime scene were fired from one of the five <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span> rifles of the five co-accused soldiers,

issued to Eduardo Castillo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
two of the slugs recovered from the body of Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Walsie</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bulasao</span> and one of the slugs recovered from the body
of Pfc. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span> were fired from the same <span class="SpellE">Armalite</span> Rifle;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Spouses <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> arrived at the wake of <span class="SpellE">Comising</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bogatan</span>, their neighbor, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00 P.M.</st1:time>, <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="8">August

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused put up the defenses of denial and
alibi, which may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> denies that there is "bad blood" between
him and Robert <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span> because whatever
misunderstanding they had was settled amicably on the night of <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1984</st1:date>, four months before
the killings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, they
even drank together up to <st1:time minute="0" hour="1">1:00 o'clock <span style="">a.m.</span></st1:time><span style=""> with </span><span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> paying for the
drinks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, they greeted each
other whenever they met in the streets.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense does not deny the arrival of the five accused PC
soldiers in La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It, however, avows that the three of the five soldiers went to the house
of the <span class="SpellE">Galaw-eys</span> to borrow fare money from <span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span>, the older
sister of one of the soldiers, <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de la
Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>,
upon request of <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>, his brother-in-law, brought
him and his companions to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, with <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
riding in <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo's</span> jitney back to the <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey's</span> house in <span class="SpellE">Tomay</span>, La
Trinidad, to meet his wife there.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> spouses admitted that they
were sitting in their Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> jitney which was
parked in front of the Morris Restaurant, which is near the Western Valley
Restau­rant, more or less an hour before the shooting incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But they explained their presence at that
place <span style="">as </span>part
of their daily routine as vegetable merchants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Cresencia</span> explained, however, that in the
afternoon of <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1984</st1:date>,
they were to meet vegetable suppliers in <span class="SpellE">Acop</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tublay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While passing by <st1:place><st1:placename>Morris</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Restaurant</st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
realized that he did not have enough gasoline, so, he decided to go back to the
family residence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the process of
making a U-turn, a front wheel of the jitney got stuck in <span style="">a </span>canal
near the <st1:place><st1:placename>Morris</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Restaurant</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two male teen-agers, one of them the
prosecution witness Johnson Milo, helped push the jitney out of the canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
and his wife proceeded homeward to join the wake of a deceased neighbor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span>
denied <span style="">that </span>the two teen-agers,
Johnson Milo and his companion, Marcos <span class="SpellE">Recana</span>, rode
with them in his Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> jitney that late
afternoon of August 10, 1984; not having gotten inside the jitney at all, they
could not have stepped on what Milo testified <span style="">as </span>"scrap <span style="">irons"
</span>that turned out to be <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He <span style="">also
</span>denied carrying soldier-passengers, emphasizing that it was only he and

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> also testified that he and

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>find both appeals meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the avowed policy of the law that "before an accused
is convicted of a crime, his guilt must be proved beyond reasonable doubt and
until thus proven guilty, he <span style="">is </span>presumed innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
burden of proof rests upon the prosecution and unless the State succeeds in
proving his guilt, the presumption of innocence in favor of the accused
applies."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
This policy is embodied in the Bill of Rights, Sec. 14 (2) of the 1987
Constitution, which states that "in <span style="">all
</span>criminal prosecutions, the accused shall be presumed innocent until the
contrary is proved." Only by proof beyond reasonable doubt which requires
moral certainty--a "certainty that convinces and satisfies the reason and
conscience of those who are to act upon it," – may the presumption of
innocence be overcome.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution relied solely, in all these six cases, on
circumstantial evidence <span style="">to </span>prove
the guilt of the accused-appellants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing wrong with that.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order, however, to sustain a conviction by bare circumstantial
evidence, three requisites explicitly provided by law must concur, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is more than one
circumstance;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts from which the inferences are
derived are proven; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The combination of all the circumstances is
such as to produce a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">All these requisites must be complied
with if circumstantial evidence is to be the <span style="">basis </span>for proof beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every circumstance in favor of innocence must
be considered in a criminal case; the strongest suspicion must not be allowed
to sway judgment against the accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">F</span>or the hard and fast rule in evidence
is that "before conviction can be had upon circumstantial evidence, the
circumstances proved should constitute an unbroken chain which leads to one
fair and reasonable conclusion pointing to the defendant, to the exclusion of
all others, as the author of the crime."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, only one witness, <span class="SpellE">Meriam</span>
<span class="SpellE">Agbuya</span>, identified <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
de la Cruz as one of the three persons <span style="">­</span>with
"long guns" at the scene of the shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that the testimony of only
one witness, if credible and positive, and satisfies the court beyond
reasonable doubt, is sufficient to convict,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
this is not so in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The narration of <span class="SpellE">Meriam</span> does not meet
the requirements of the testimony of a true eyewitness as the trial court
ruled, finding only as it did a circumstantial case against the
appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But whatever it is, be that
of an eyewitness or that of a mere vital witness, on the circumstances of the
shooting leading to the identification of the "soldier" who held the
"smoking gun," so to speak, <span class="SpellE">Meriam's</span>
testimony at the trial loses weight and importance when we consider the other
evidence on record.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, <span class="SpellE">Meriam</span> <span class="SpellE">Agbuya</span>
did not mention that she recogni<span style="">z</span>ed
one of the accused when the police took her statement<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
barely three days after the incident, her reason being that "I (she) was
not asked." It was only during the trial, or on <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1985</st1:date>, that she implicated appellant <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> in the killing of <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This suppression for more than eight months of her obligation to speak
out to the police authorities the whole truth renders her subsequent
identification of <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> dubious, to say the
least.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have held that the silence of
an alleged eyewitness for several weeks renders his credibility doubtful x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The long delay in reporting a crime or
its author to the authorities not caused by threat, intimidation, or coercion,
renders the testimony untruthful.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="SpellE">Meriam</span> was never threatened, intimidated, nor coerced
not to divulge the identity of accused de la Cruz as one <span style="">of </span>the three soldiers at the scene of
the massacre immediately before and after it happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She simply was not asked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But this is not a valid reason to withhold
the identity of <span style="">a </span>probable
perpetrator of such slaughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
behooves an eyewitness to the crime to report to the authorities not only its
commission but more importantly, the identity of all the criminals, so that the
ends of justice may be served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
especially so when said "eyewitness" is being investigated by the
police authorities regarding the same.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Failure to make such a full disclosure renders the later revelation or
sworn statement doubtful, at best, and can not, of course, serve as a basis of
guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, during the hearing on <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1985</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Meriam</span> <span class="SpellE">Agbuya</span> testified on matters that happened immediately

<p class="BODY">The lower court disregarded the above inconsistencies in the

the ground of her being of tender age, i.e., 18 years old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But 18 years of age is not a tender age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, 18 is now the age of majority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, even if some of the
above-mentioned inconsistencies may be considered minor, they nevertheless put
in doubt not only the honesty and candor of the said witness, but her
believability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said, such
testimony fails to satisfy the criterion of moral certainty.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can not <span style="">also </span>discount the fact that, according to Patrolman Joseph <span class="SpellE">Basquial</span>, a prosecution witness and a brother-in-arms of

<p class="BODY">Without the positive identification of the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de la Cruz as one of the perpetrators of the crime,
the constitutional presumption of innocence in his favor, stands <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we
have earlier emphasized, a defendant in a criminal case must always be presumed
innocent until the contrary is proven.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When his culpability is not satisfactorily shown, or in case of
reasonable doubt, he shall have the right to be acquitted, though his innocence
be doubted.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
It is better to acquit a dozen guilty criminals than let an innocent person
suffer unjustly, so it has been said and rightly so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the ideal would be for everyone to
get his or her just deserts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the criminal conspiracy found by the trial court, the paucity
of evidence is glaring.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prove the alleged conspiracy by and among the <span class="SpellE">Galaw-eys</span> and their co-accused five soldiers, the
prosecution would rely so much on the fact that the former and their Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span> jitney were "sighted" near the Western
Valley Restaurant a few minutes before and after the shooting incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the presence of the <span class="SpellE">Galaw-eys</span> and their Ford <span class="SpellE">Fiera</span>

we said that "presence at the scene of the crime, without more, does not
imply conspiracy." Well?settled is the rule that conspiracy
presupposes the existence of <span style="">a </span>pre-conceived plan or agreement and in order to establish the
existence of such circumstance, it is not enough that the persons supposedly
engaged or connected with the same be present when the crime was
perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a logical
relationship between the commission of the crime and the supposed conspirators,
evidencing a clear and more intimate connection between and among the latter,
such as by their overt acts committed in pursuance of a common design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

would indicate his and the <span class="SpellE">Galaw-eys</span>' participation
in the criminal design.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More is required
to fully support the prosecution's theory that the three appellants were united
in pursuing a common unlawful purpose and that they, or any one of them fired
the fatal fusillade that killed four victims and seriously wounded two
others.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing indicia of an
alleged conspiracy relied upon by the prosecution, even all together, do not
constitute proof beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;

conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every circumstance favoring
their innocence must be duly taken into account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof against the appellants must survive
the test of reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conscience must

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's case against the appellants is cracked by the
actual ballistic examinations (Exhibits "C" and "D") of the
firearms, slugs, and empty shells submitted to the National Bureau of
Investigation (NBI).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of
that government office known for its competence, reliability, and fairness
indubitably showed that the <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifle belonging
to <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> de la Cruz did not fire any of the shells
and slugs submitted in evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead, it was the firearm belonging to accused Eduardo Castillo
(Exhibit "G") bearing Serial No. 163677 that was found to have been
the gun used in the shooting where four (4) men died and two (2) others were
seriously injured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The NBI so declared
positively and definitely.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming ex <span class="SpellE">gratia</span> <span class="SpellE">argumenti</span>
that Eduardo Castillo fired the fatal shots, such fact would be of no moment

be held liable for the act or acts of his co-accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court has also declared that "a motive has indeed,
been established by the prosecution." To this end, it sustained the
conclusion of the prosecution that </p>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the accused were moved
by vengeance in committing the criminal acts for which they stand charged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was too hurting for the <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> couple, most especially to <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span> to be pistol whipped and injured at a time

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>do not agree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it was, indeed,
true that <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span>
wanted to exact vengeance from Robert <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span> that
fateful night of August 10, 1984, why the massacre of several people, including
innocent bystanders, among them highly respected members of the community, one
a town mayor and another <span style="">a </span>school district supervisor?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Why was <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span> not killed, but only wounded
not even very seriously, if indeed, he was the apple of <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo's</span>
vengeful eyes?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>
could have been an easy target by any of the soldiers-accused especially with
the use of an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifle which is an accurate
firing weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And to think that there
were three soldiers firing simultaneously at him (<span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>)
each with an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> rifle, how could have they
missed shattering <span class="SpellE">Bakidol's</span> body and "blowing
him to Kingdom come" if he was really the target?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Moonlighting" as a security guard
in the Western Valley Restaurant (where he even has his own quarters, he said
he was a boarder), it would have been easy to isolate <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>

officials, innocent ones <span style="">at </span>that,
were included in the carnage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Could
either, or both, of them be the real targets for a variety of reasons?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution has not provided the missing
pieces that would successfully weave its theory of revenge against <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
even <span class="SpellE">Bakidol</span> who pistol-whipped <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galaw-ey</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So,
why should the latter harbor rancor in his heart against the former?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although proof of motive is not indispensable
