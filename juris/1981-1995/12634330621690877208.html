				<H3>JUDGE ADORACION G. ANGELES COMPLAINANT, VS. EMMANUEL BANTUG AND SYLVIA M. GUERRERO, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This </span>is an administrative
complaint filed by Judge Adoracion G. Angeles in her capacity as Presiding
Judge of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 121, Caloocan City against two (2) of
the court personnel assigned in her sala, namely: Emmanuel Bantug, Legal
Researcher and Acting Branch Clerk of Court and Sylvia Guerrero, Court
Stenographer for falsification of judicial records.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of this case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 19, 1988, the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City
submitted a manifestation with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 121 of Caloocan
City stating his inability to comply with the order of the trial court dated
November 17, 1985, directing him to issue new titles, in view of the absence of
a statement from which subsisting titles they are to be derived.  The questioned order was that allegedly
issued by the former Presiding Judge Salvador J. Baylen in Civil Case No. 11974
entitled “Arturo Q. Salientes in his capacity as Court Receiver in Civil Case
No. C-424 v. Phil-Asia Realty Development Corporation, et al.,” which directed
the Register of Deeds of Caloocan City to issue a new certificate of title in
favor of intervenor Roqueta Dimson.</p>

<p class="BODY">Because she had the <span style="">impression
</span>that the signature of Judge Baylen is a forgery, the incumbent Presiding
Judge Adoracion Angeles issued an order on October 5, 1988 directing the
Register of Deeds to defer action on the questioned order dated November 17,
1985, considering that the signature of Judge Baylen in the said order will be
referred to this Court for investigation to the NBI as to the genuineness
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 7, 1988, Judge Angeles submitted a letter informing
the Court Administrator of her findings.  She alleged that she believed that the signature of Judge Baylen in the
order of November 17, 1985 is a forgery, in view of the fact that the latter
admitted the motion for leave of court to intervene filed by Roqueta Dimson
only on November 15, 1985 and that the complaint in intervention was actually
filed later on December 5, 1985.  She
likewise stated that upon comparison, the signatures in the November 15, 1985
order and in the questioned order dated November 17, 1985 are different; that
upon examination of the records of the case, the order of November 15, 1985 is
page 153 of the records and the complaint-in?intervention being page 154;
that the questioned order of November 17, 1985 as well as the return cards
attached thereon and the stenographic notes of respondent stenographer Guerrero
were merely inserted into the records without page numbers.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 12, 1988, Judge Angeles requested the Court
Administrator to include in the investigation her Acting Branch Clerk of Court
Emmanuel A. Bantug who signed the “Certificate of Finality” of the questioned
order of November 17, 1985 allegedly upon the request of intervenor Roqueta
Dimson.</p>

<p class="BODY">The letter-complaint of Judge Angeles was endorsed by the Court
Administrator to the Secretary of Justice who directed the National Bureau of
Investigation to investigate the circumstances surrounding the questioned order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 19, 1989, the Court Administrator, thru Executive Judge
Manuel Serapio required Sylvia Guerrero and Emmanuel Bantug to comment on the
complaint (p. 11, <u>Rollo</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Emmanuel Bantug in his comment (pp. 19­-22) alleged
among others that:</p>

<blockquote>a)   Sometime in August 1988, intervenor Roqueta
Dimson filed a letter requesting the issuance of a certificate of finality of
the order dated November 17, 1985;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)   Respondent Sylvia Guerrero prepared the
certificate of finality which was signed by him in his capacity as Acting
Branch Clerk of <span style="">Court;</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>c)   Before signing the certificate, he
scrutinized the records to determine whether the order had become final and
executory;</blockquote>

<blockquote>d)   He never questioned the genuineness of the
signature of Judge Baylen on the presumption that it was issued in the regular
business of the court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>e)   The certificate of finality signed by him was
not officially released for failure of respondent Guerrero to produce the
records of the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>f)    He
signed the said certificate in utmost good faith.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 24, 1989, respondent Guerrero filed her Comment (p. 26)
admitting that the stenographic notes were taken by her but stating that
anybody could have typewritten the same with her initials on it.  She also alleged that the stenographic notes
do not formally form part of the records and she has no knowledge how the same
were inserted in the records of the civil case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 8, 1990, this Court, acting on the recommendation of
the Court Administrator in his Memorandum dated December 7, 1989, referred this
case to the Executive Judge of Caloocan City for investigation, report and
recommendation (p. 31, <u>Rollo</u>).  Per resolution dated May 30, 1990 of this Court, Judge Zenaida N.
Elepaño of RTC, Branch 128 of Kaloocan City was designated to continue the
investigation vice Executive Judge Manuel J. N. Serapio.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 2, 1991, the investigating judge filed her report
with the following observations and findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The following facts are undisputed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A. <u>The</u> <u>contents</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Case</u> <u>Record</u> <u>of</u> <u>Civil</u> <u>Case</u>
<u>No</u>. <u>C-11974</u> (<u>supra</u>), <u>numbered</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Rollo</u>
<u>as</u> <u>Page</u> <u>1</u> <u>to</u> <u>Page</u> <u>207</u>, <u>inclusive</u>.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The pleadings, orders, notices, etc. constituting the entire
records of the Salientes case are bound together by <span style="">a </span>paper fastener, with a piece of soft brown cardboard as its cover.  At present, there are 207 pages found
inside, from the first page of the main complaint bearing page no. 1 up to the
last page which is a Certification that the case was already dismissed on
December 10, 1988 requested by one Restituta Rosales, bearing page no. 207.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contents of this case record show that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.   The reinvindicatory action was filed by
Arturo Salientes on July 3, 1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 24, 1985, one Roqueta R. Dimson
filed’ a Motion for Leave to Intervene.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.  On November 15, 1985, the Court through the
then Presiding Judge Salvador J. Baylen granted the Motion to Intervene, as
shown by its Order of the same date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Order bears the page number 153.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.   Following this November 15 Order is the
disputed Order, dated November 17, 1985.  <u>It</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>carry</u> <u>any</u> <u>page</u> <u>number</u>.  Pasted at the back of this Order are four
pieces of return cards, bearing in handwriting the names of Register of Deeds
of Kalookan City on one, Arturo Salientes on the next, Phil-Asia, on the third
and Roqueta Dimson on the fourth, purportedly showing that copies of this
November 17, 1985 Order were received by these four persons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5. The next
page following this Order is a yellow pad paper, <u>also</u> <u>without</u> <u>a</u>
<u>page</u> <u>number</u>, containing handwritten shorthand notes on the front
page and back, with the letters SJB/SG scribbled at the bottom end of the
notes.  The front page of this yellow
pad bears a stamped date, November 17, 1985, purportedly to show that the notes
were taken on said date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6. The
succeeding page is page 1 of a Complaint-in-Intervention filed on December 5,
1985 by Roqueta Dimson.  <u>This</u> <u>complaint</u>
<u>bears</u> <u>the</u> <u>page</u> <u>numbers</u> <u>154</u> <u>to</u> <u>182</u>
<u>inclusive</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"7.  Following page 182 of the said Rollo is the
Order of Judge Adoracion G. Angeles (succeeding Judge Baylen) dated December
10, 1986 dismissing the case without prejudice for lack of interest to
prosecute.  This is marked as <u>page</u>
<u>183</u> of the Rollo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"8.   On December 29, 1986, intervenor Roqueta
Dimson filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the Order dismissing the
case.  In the Rollo, said Motion bears
the <u>page</u> <u>number</u> <u>184</u>.  This Motion was denied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"9.   On August 15, 1988, Roqueta Dimson wrote a
letter to the Branch Clerk of Court requesting for a Certificate of Finality of
the Order of November 17, 1985.  This
letter is attached to the records and marked as page 185.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10. On
September 19, 1988, the Kalookan Register of Deeds filed in Court his
Manifestation (supra) regarding his inability to comply with the November 17,
1985 Order filed with ‘his Office on August 19, 1988 together with a
Certificate <span style="">of </span>Finality.  This Manifestation is attached to the
records as pages 186 and 187 thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"B. <u>The</u> <u>Fact</u><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>of</u> <u>Discovery</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>November</u> <u>17</u>, <u>1985</u> <u>Order</u> <u>and</u> <u>Related</u> <u>Documents</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Emma Carreon is the Clerk-in-Charge for Civil Cases for
Branch 121, RTC-Kalookan City.  She
started the pagination of the records of all the civil cases assigned to this
sala on November 20, 1986, and this included the records of Salientes Case,
Civil Case No. C-11974.  When she did
the numbering of the pages of this particular case record in November 1986, the
Order of November 17, 1985, the stenographic notes on yellow pad paper, and the
four return cards were not found in nor were part of the said case record.  Neither were these documents attached
thereto when the Complaint, Counterclaim, and the Complaint-in-Intervention
were dismissed by Judge Angeles on December 10, 1986.  When Emma Carreon received for the Court the Manifestation filed
by the Kalookan City Register of Deeds on September 19, 1988, and subsequently
looked for the record of the case so that she could attach the Manifestation
thereto and present it to Judge Angeles for action, she could not immediately
locate the same.  It was only on October
3, 1988 or two weeks after that she found the records in the possession of
court stenographer respondent Sylvia Guerrero who retrieved the same from under
her (Guerrero) typewriter and handed it over to her.  Sylvia Guerrero is not and has never been assigned the duty of
keeping such record in her custody.  It
was on this date and before the records in her custody.  It was on this date and before the records
of the case and the written Manifestation of the Register of Deeds were turned
over to Judge Angeles that Carreon <u>first</u> came to know of the existence
of the questioned documents, i.e. Order of November 17, 1985, return cards, and
<span style="">stenographic notes, </span>inserted
between pages 153 and 154 of the records, as she had never <span style="">seen </span>them before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"C. <u>Authorship</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Questioned</u> <u>Order</u>, <u>the</u> <u>Signature</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Judge</u> <u>Baylen</u> <u>thereon</u>, <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>Certificate</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Finality</u> <u>dated</u> <u>August</u> <u>15</u>, <u>1988</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.   Sylvia Guerrero admitted that she herself
wrote in shorthand the notes contained in the yellow pad found next to the
questioned 0rder, and that she also typed the questioned Order of November 17,
1985.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.   Despite the sworn protestations <span style="">of </span>Sylvia Guerrero (Affidavit, p. 318,
Rollo) that the Order was typewritten by her ‘upon the instructions of former
presiding judge Salvador J. Baylen <u>who</u> <u>signed</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u>,’
the signature alleged to be that of Judge Salvador J. Baylen affixed on the
questioned Order of November 17, 1985 however was found by the handwriting
examiner of the National Bureau of Investigation to be a forgery (Exhs. ‘L’ to
‘L-6’ inclusive and ‘N’ to ‘N­-12’ inclusive).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.   The day the Order was signed, i.e., November
17, 1985 was <span style="">a </span>Sunday (Exh.
‘P-3’), hence it was not a regular working day for court employees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.  While the NBI has not pronounced on who in
particular affixed the signature on the questioned Order, having merely
declared that the signature is not that of Judge Baylen, since Guerrero
admitted she prepared the stenographic notes and type the Order herself, her acts
were not ‘upon instructions of Judge Baylen,’ and that she participated to <span style="">a </span>great extent in the falsification of
such Order and in the forgery of the signature in concert with others, as will
be shown later on.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.   On August 15, 1988 at 9:00 <span style="">o'clock </span>in the morning Emmanuel Bantug
received from Sylvia Guerrero a Certificate of Finality in three copies (one
original, and two duplicate originals) for his signature as OIC&gt; The copies
of the Certificate were prepared and typed by Guerrero, and Bantug signed the
same.  Of the three copies, two
including the original were retained by Bantug who did not attach the same to
the records of the case (statement of Bantug at the NBI dated January 26, 1989,
Exhibit ‘Z’).  One copy was furnished
Roqueta Dimson (p. 96, Rollo, and Exhibit ‘O’).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.   On August 19, 1988, one Vidal S. Gregorio of
Lagundi, Morong, Rizal presented to the Register of Deeds of Kalookan City <span style="">a </span>copy of the questioned Order of
November 17, 1985 with copy of <span style="">a </span>Certificate
of Finality allegedly <span style="">a </span>true copy
of the original as attested to by Sylvia Guerrero through her signature
appearing at the bottom of the typed words ‘<span style="">A </span>True Copy’.  This
alleged true copy however differs from the one signed previously by Emmanuel
Bantug in that it now had an additional sentence not found in the original,
reading  ‘This Order is final and
executory.’  Additionally, it does not
bear the signature <span style="">of </span>Bantug, but
merely contains the stamped words Original Signed (Exh. ‘J-­6’)."  (pp. 393-396, <u>Rollo</u>)<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We can infer from the entire records of this case that the
questioned order and stenographic notes on yellow pad were inserted after
December 10, 1986, the date Judge Angeles dismissed the case, but before
September 19, 1988, the date the Register of Deeds of Kalookan City filed his
manifestation in court alleging his inability to comply with said order.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is clearly supported by the sworn affidavit (Exh. FF) of
Emma Carreon, Clerk-in-Charge of the civil case, stating that when she did the
paging of the records, the questioned documents were not yet attached to or
inserted in the records, for which reason she marked the page found before the
questioned order as 153 and that immediately following the stenographic notes
as 154.  The order issued on December
10, 1986 which dismissed the case was marked as page number 182.  Since all the previous pages were numbered
consecutively from page 1 and 182, it therefore follows that page 153 and 154
were numbered before December 10, 1986.  The logical conclusion therefore, is that on or before the aforesaid
date, the questioned documents do not form part of the records.  Otherwise, these would have been marked with
the corresponding numbers and intervenor Roqueta Dimson would not have bothered
to file a Complaint-in-Intervention on December 5, 1985 as she had already been
benefited in the order of November 17, 1985.  When Dimson filed on December 29, 1986 a motion for reconsideration of
the order dated December 10, 1986 dismissing the civil case, it can be readily
concluded that the questioned order is not yet in existence.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the authorship of the forged signature of Judge Baylen has
not been fully determined, the participation of respondent Sylvia Guerrero <span style="">is </span>beyond<span style=""> </span>any aura of doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sworn statement of Guerrero that it was Judge Baylen himself
who signed the order was refuted by the NBI, which by scientific examination
found the signature not to be that of Judge Baylen.  No amount of persuasion can show that Judge Baylen would go to
the court on a Sunday to dictate an order which practically decided the case in
favor of intervenor Roqueta Dimson despite the fact that the latter had not yet
filed her complaint-in-intervention.  With her admission that the stenographic notes attached to the questioned
order was hers and that she was the one who typed the disputed order, there is
no doubt that respondent Guerrero is responsible for the existence of the
questioned order and for the forgery of the signature of Judge Baylen.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to respondent Emmanuel Bantug, the investigating
judge found that his statements are not consistent throughout his testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his <span style="">July </span>12,
1989 statement, he stated that before signing the certificate of finality, he
carefully scrutinized the records of Civil Case No. C­-11794, found therein
proofs of notices to the parties and that “no where in the records of Civil
Case No. C-­11794 could be found any motion <span style="">for </span>reconsideration of the Order or appeal filed by any of the
parties to the case.  x x x Based on and
guided by the records x x x showing clearly that the order of November 17, 1985
had long become final and executory, the undersigned had no other choice but to
x x x issue a Certificate of Finality being requested by Roqueta Dimson.” (p.
20).  However, upon further examination,
respondent Bantug changed his testimony and declared he only verified if there
was an order of Judge Baylen and that there was no motion for reconsideration
or appeal taken by the parties but, did not verify all pleadings filed after
the order was issued allegedly by Judge Baylen.  Again he changed this statement and reverted to his original
claim that he examined all the pleadings filed with the Court after the
November 17,1985 order, examined the pages one by one and because no motion for
reconsideration was found, he signed the certificate of finality (TSN of
January 24, 1991, pp. 21-23).  Then, on
February 8, 1991, he averred that he signed the certificate on the basis of the
information given by Sylvia Guerrero that no motion for reconsideration was
filed and that he did not verify from the records the existence of the order
the finality <span style="">of w</span>hich he was to
certify (TSN, February 8, 1991).</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigating judge further concluded that if respondent
Bantug had carefully scrutinized the records of the case to determine if the
questioned order of November 17, 1985 had really become final and executory
before he signed the certificate of finality, then, he would have noticed that
there are other additional papers attached to the records after the date of the
questioned order, namely, the complaint-in-intervention dated December <span style="">5, </span>1985, the order of December 10,
1986 dismissing the case and a motion for reconsideration filed by Roqueta
Dimson dated December 29, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although<span style="">&nbsp; </span>it is true that
the testimony of respondent Bantug during the investigation is replete with
inconsistencies, there is no substantial evidence which can point to his
participation in the falsification of the order.  The inconsistent statements made by respondent Bantug merely
refer to the issue of whether respondent Bantug truly examined all the
pleadings and orders in the records of the case before issuing the certificate
of finality.  This alone is not <span style="">a </span>sufficient basis for this Court to
conclude that resondent Bantug had indeed conspired with respondent Guerrero in
falsifying a court order and forging the signature thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The clerk of court of a court of justice is an essential officer
in any judicial system.  The office is
the hub of activities both adjudicative and administrative.  The clerk of court keeps its records and
seal, issues processes, enters judgments and orders, and gives upon request,
certified copies from the records.  While an officer of the court, a public officer and an officer of the
law, the position is not that of a judicial officer, nor is it synonymous with
the court.  The office is essentially a
ministerial one (Manual for Clerks of Court, July, 1991, pp. 2-3).  Hence, in entering judgments and orders, the
clerk of court acts in a purely ministerial capacity and exercises no judicial
functions (Manual, <u>supra</u>, p. 79).  Respondent Bantug as acting clerk of court <span style="">is </span>thus not expected to determine the validity and truth of the
contents set forth in every judgment or order issued by the court before
entering them as final and executory.   Nevertheless, it cannot be gainsaid that as custodian of the
records of the court, it is the duty of the clerk to maintain the correctness
of the records by making the proper entries and corresponding certificates of
final and executory judgments or orders.  He must be assiduous in performing his official duties and in
supervising and managing court dockets and records.  The failure of respondent Bantug to prove that he had exercised
this duty before issuing the certificate of finality as can be shown by his
testimony before the investigating judge, is gross negligence on his part which
warrants disciplinary action.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had said before, and reiterates it here, that the
conduct and behavior of every one connected with an office charged with the
dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowest clerk, should
be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.  Their conduct at all times, must not only be
characterized by propriety and decorum but above all else must be above
suspicion (Jereos Jr. v. Reblando Sr., Adm. Matter No. P-141, May 31, 1976, 71
SCRA 126).  Indeed, every employee of
the Judiciary should be an example of integrity uprightness and honesty
(Ablanida v. Intia. A.M. No. R-770-P, May <span style="">17,
</span>1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="">is </span>no iota
of doubt, on the basis <span style="">of </span>the
evidence presented, that respondent Guerrero is guilty of the detestable act
complained of.  She does not deserve to
stay any longer in the Judiciary.  With
regard to respondent Bantug, a fine equivalent to one month salary shall be
imposed upon him by this Court for such negligence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, respondent Sylvia Guerrero is hereby ordered
DISMISSED from the service with forfeiture of all retirement benefits and with
prejudice to reinstatement in the national and local governments, as well as in
any governmental instrumentality or agency including government owned or
controlled corporations.  Respondent
Emmanuel Bantug is hereby ordered to pay a fine in the amount of P5,000.00
within thirty (30) days from notice.  This resolution is immediately executory.  Let a copy of this resolution be entered in the personal records
of respondents.</p>
