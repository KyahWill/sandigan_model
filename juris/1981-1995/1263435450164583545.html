				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision dated November 28, 1990, rendered by the National Labor Relations
Commission in NLRC Case No. 00-10-04282-88 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">which </span>reversed the decision of the Labor Arbiter dated July 28,
1989, and declared the dismissal of petitioner Antonio M. Corral legal and
valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is a yardman of respondent Pepsi Cola with a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>monthly salary of P2,500.00.  He began as an ordinary laborer in December
1982.  His task was to clean the yard
and route trucks of Pepsi Cola, arrange the company's products in the yard and
in the trucks, load and unload the company's products from the yard to the
route trucks and vice-versa, and perform such other manual tasks as he may be
ordered to perform by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">his immediate  superiors</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 8, 1988, the petitioner was arrested and forcibly taken
by police officers to the Taguig Police Station where he was detained, over his
protest, without being informed of the charge against him.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 10, 1988, an amended information for Qualified Theft was
filed against him and others (Crim. Case No. 73619 of the Regional Trial Court
of Pasig, Metro Manila) upon the complaint of respondent R.J. Manago, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>behalf <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of </span>respondent Pepsi Cola.  During his detention and investigation at the Taguig Police Sta­tion,
petitioner was not allowed counsel of his choice and he was released only after
posting bail <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for </span>his provisional
liberty.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He was not allowed to return to his job at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Pepsi </span>Cola plant.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 6, 1988, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or one
(1) month later, he re­</span>ceived a memorandum from Pepsi Cola terminating
his employment.  On October 12, 1988, he
filed a complaint for illegal dismissal in the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC), National Capital Region, and prayed for reinstatement with
backwages, damages, and attor­ney's fees.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had filed their position papers, Labor Arbiter
Isabel P. Ortiguerra rendered a decision in his favor on July 28, 1989, the
dispositive portion of which reads:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, premises considered the respondents are hereby
declared guilty of illegal dismissal and are hereby ordered to reinstate
complainants (sic) to his former position without loss of seniority rights and
with full backwages to be computed from the time complainant was dismissed up
to the time he is actually reinstated.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The respondents are further ordered to pay complainant attor­ney's
fees equivalent to 10% of the entire judgment award.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The claim for moral and exemplary damages is hereby dismissed
for lack of merit." (p. 54, Rollo.)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pepsi Cola appealed to the NLRC on November 28, 1990.  The NLRC reversed the Labor Arbiter and
ordered the dismissal of the complaint for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Expectedly, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> was filed by
Corral, who alleges that he was dismissed without due process.  His employer allegedly did not furnish him
with written notice of the charges against him, but summarily discharged him on
June 10, 1988, when he reported for work.  He received a notice of dismissal on July 6, 1988 only, or almost one
(1) month after he had been discharged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner denied that he committed theft against Pepsi
Cola.  His only participation in the
transaction of June 4, 1988 was that at 5:00 p.m. when he was about to leave
the Pepsi Cola FTI Warehouse for his home, another yardman, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Victor Abundo, and Ignacio Patal, </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">salesman, </span>requested him to help them
in loading 330 cases of Pepsi Cola products from route truck 228 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">assigned </span>to salesman Patal and to
deliver them to a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">customer </span>who
had ordered them.  Patal promised to ar<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">range for his </span>services in acting as a truck
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">helper, a practice allowed </span>by
the company.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">After </span>he had
completed unloading 330 cases of Pepsi Cola products at the store of Patal's
customer, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">whom he did </span>not even
know, he separated from Patal and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Abundo,
</span>and headed home.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Four days later, or on June 8, 1988, he was ar­<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">rested by </span>Taguig policemen while
performing his chores as a yardman at the Pepsi Cola FTI Warehouse.  He was <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">taken </span>to the Taguig Police Station without being in<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">formed </span>of the offense he supposedly
had committed, until <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a series </span>of
intimidating questions on his alleged par­ticipation in the theft of Pepsi
which occurred on June <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">4, 1988 were </span>propounded
to him by the police investiga­tors.  They threatened to detain him unless he would <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">admit </span>his participation in the heist.  He was included <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in an
amended </span>information as one of the accused in Crim. Case No. 73619 of the
Regional Trial Court in Pasig.  However,
a month later or on July 8, 1992, the case was provisionally dismissed at the
instance of the prosecution.  Nevertheless, Pepsi Cola refused to take Corral <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the record, we find merit in the
petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that Corral was dismissed from the service on
July 6, 1988, the date he received a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">memorandum </span>from Pepsi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>Cola accusing him of having "acted as accomplice to
consummate a crime of theft perpetuated by Abundo of carting away 330 cases of
PCD products amounting to P31,530.00 using company truck No. 228" (p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">29, </span>Rollo).  Prior thereto, he was neither informed why
his services were being terminated, nor given a chance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to defend himself.  </span>His summary dismissal violated the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">following </span>procedure to be observed by
employers desiring to dismiss employees:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Sec. 2.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Notice of Dismissal.  </span>Any employer who seeks to dismiss a
worker shall furnish him a written notice stating the particular acts or
omission constituting the grounds for his dismissal.  In cases of abandonment of work, the notice shall be served at
the worker's last known address.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Sec. 5.  Answer and
hearing.  The worker may answer the
allega­tions stated against him in the notice of dismissal within a reasonable
period from receipt of such notice.  The
employer shall afford the worker ample opportunity to be heard and to defend
himself with the assistance of his representative, if he so desires."
(Rule XIV, Book V, Rules and Regulations Implementing the Labor Code.)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In
Century Textile </span>Mills, Inc. vs. NLRC, 161 SCRA 528, 535, the Court
defined the essential elements of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">due </span>process:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"The twin requirements of notice <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">and hearing</span> constitute essential elements of due process in cases
of employee dismissal:  the requirement
of notice is intended to inform the employee concerned of the employer's intent
to dismiss and the reason for the proposed dismissal; upon the other hand, the
requirement of hearing affords the employee an opportunity to answer his
employer's charges against him and accordingly to defend himself therefrom
before dismissal is effected.  Neither
of these two requirements can be dispensed with without running afoul of the
due process requirement of the 1987 Constitution."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pepsi Cola did not comply with the above guide­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lines </span>for the dismissal of its
employee.  The procedure prescribed by
law is mandatory.  Unless followed, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">employee's r</span>ight to due process of law
is breached and vitiates management's decision to terminate the employ­ment
(Rutty vs. NLRC, 182 SCRA 365).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had stated in an earlier case that while it is the prerogative
of management to dismiss or lay-off an employee, the exercise of that
prerogative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">must</span> be made without
abuse of discretion, for what is at stake is not only the employee's position
but also his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">means of livelihood.  </span>Basically, the right of an employer
to dismiss an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">employee </span>differs
from, and should not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>confused
with, the manner in which that right is exercised.  It must not be oppressive and abusive for a worker's right to his
job is a property right (Remerco Garments Mfg. vs. Min. of Labor, et al., 135
SCRA 167).</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigation and trial of the criminal charge against the
petitioner could not take the place of the notice and hearing required under
the Labor Code.  In any event, since the
criminal action was provisionally dismissed on July 8, 1992, at the instance of
the prosecution, that circumstance bolsters the petitioner's claim of innocence
or lack of lawful cause for the termination of his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.  The decision of the National Labor Relations
Commission was rendered with grave abuse of discretion, hence, it should be SET
ASIDE.  The decision dated July 28, 1989
of Labor Arbi­ter Isabel P. Ortiguerra is hereby reinstated with modification
of the award for backwages which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">shall not exceed three (3) years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
