				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>Probation is a special privilege granted by the state to a penitent
qualified offender.  It essentially
rejects appeals and encourages an otherwise eligible convict to immediately
admit his liability and save the state of time, effort and expenses to jettison
an appeal.  The law expressly requires
that an accused must not have appealed his conviction before he can avail of
probation.  This outlaws the element of
speculation, on the part of the accused - to wager on the result of his appeal
- that when his conviction is finally affirmed on appeal, the moment of truth
well-nigh at hand, and the service of his sentence inevitable, he now applies
for probation as an &quot;escape hatch&quot; thus rendering nugatory the
appellate court's affirmance of his conviction.  Consequently, probation should be availed of at the first opportunity
by convicts who are willing to be reformed and rehabilitated, who manifest
spontaneity, contrition and remorse.</p>

<p class=BODY>As conceptualized, is petitioner entitled to probation within the
purview of P.D. 968, as amended by P.D. 1257 and P.D. 1990?</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner's woes started when as President and General Manager
of ASPAC Trans.  Company he failed to
control his outburst and blurted -</p>

<blockquote>You employees in this office are all <i>tanga, </i>son of a bitches
(sic), bullshit.  <i>Puro kayo walang
utak . . . . Mga anak ng </i>puta . . . . <i>Magkano ba kayo . . . </i>God damn
you all.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Thus for humiliating his employees he was
accused of multiple grave oral defamation in five (5) separate Informations
instituted by five (5) of his employees, each Information charging him with
gravely maligning them on four different days, i.e., from 9 to 12 April 1980.<span
style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>On 2 January 1990, after nearly ten (10) years, the Metropolitan
Trial Court of Makati, Br. 61, found petitioner guilty of grave oral defamation
in four (4) of the five (5) cases filed against him, i.e., Crim. Cases Nos.
105206, 105207, 105209 and 105210, sentenced him to a prison term of one (1)
year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months of <i>prision</i> <i>correccional</i>
<u>&quot;in each crime committed on each date of each case, as alleged in the
information(s),&quot;</u> ordered him to indemnify each of the offended
parties, Victoria Gatchalian, Rowena Ruiz, Linda Marie Ayala Pigar and Marie
Solis, P10,000.00 as exemplary damages, and P5,000.00 for attorney's fees, plus
costs of suit.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
He was however acquitted in Crim. Case No. 105208 for persistent failure of the
offended party, Edgar Colindres, to appear and testify.</p>

<p class=BODY>Not satisfied with the Decision of the MeTC, and insisting on his
innocence, petitioner elevated his case to the Regional Trial Court.</p>

<p class=BODY>On 5 August 1991 the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Br. 59,
affirmed his conviction but appreciated in his favor a mitigating circumstance
analogous to passion or obfuscation.  Thus -</p>

<blockquote>x x x (he) was angry and shouting when he uttered the defamatory
words complained of x x x x he must have been angry and worried ‘about some
missing documents x x x as well as the letter of the Department of Tourism

</b>After he failed to interpose an appeal therefrom the decision of the RTC
became final.  The case was then set for
execution of judgment by the MeTC which, as a consequence, issued a warrant of
arrest.  But before he could be arrested
petitioner filed an application for probation which the MeTC denied &quot;in the
light of the ruling of the Supreme Court in <i>Llamado v. Court of Appeals,</i>

<p class=BODY>Forthwith he went to the Court of Appeals on <i>certiorari</i>
which on 2 July 1992 dismissed his petition on the following grounds -</p>

<blockquote>Initially, the Court notes that the petitioner has failed to comply
with the provisions of Supreme Court Circular No. 28-91 of September 4,
1991.  Violation of the circular is
sufficient cause for dismissal of the petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Secondly, the petitioner does not allege anywhere in the petition
that he had asked the respondent court to reconsider its above order; in fact,
he had failed to give the court an opportunity to correct itself if it had, in
fact, committed any error on the matter.  He is, however, required to move for reconsideration of the questioned
order <u>before</u> filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> <i>(Sy It v.
Tiangco, </i>4 SCRA 436).  This failure
is fatal to his cause.  It is a ground
for dismissal of his petition <i>(Santos v. Vda. de Cerdenola, </i>5 SCRA 823; <i>Acquiao
v. Estenso, </i>14 SCRA 18; <i>Del Pilar Transit, Inc. v. Public Service

petitioner's application for probation x x x x<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Fourthly, the petition for probation was filed by the petitioner
out of time x x x x<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>Fifthly, the Court notes that Section 4 of PD 968 allows the trial
court to grant probation after conviction, upon an application by the defendant
within the period of appeal, upon terms and conditions and period appropriate
to each case, but expressly rules out probation where an appeal has been taken

<p class=BODY>The motion for reconsideration was likewise denied.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the present recourse, petitioner squirms out of each ground
and seeks this Court's compassion in dispensing with the minor technicalities
which may militate against his petition as he now argues before us that he has
not yet lost his right to avail of probation notwithstanding his appeal from
the MeTC to the RTC since “[t]he reason for his appeal was precisely to enable
him to avail himself of the benefits of the Probation Law because the original
Decision of the (Metropolitan) Trial Court was such that he would not then be
entitled to probation.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn7' href="#_ftn7"

style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
He contends that &quot;he appealed from the judgment of the trial court
precisely for the purpose of reducing the penalties imposed upon him by the
said court to enable him to qualify for probation.&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn8' href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The central issue therefore is whether petitioner is still
qualified to avail of probation even after appealing his conviction to the RTC
which affirmed the MeTC except with regard to the duration of the penalties
imposed.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner is no longer eligible for probation.</p>

<p class=BODY><b><u>First</u>.  Probation is a mere privilege, not a right.</b><a style='mso-footnote-id:

style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><b>
Its benefits cannot extend to those not expressly included.</b>  Probation is not a right of an accused, but
rather an act of grace and clemency or immunity conferred by the state which
may be granted by the court to a seemingly deserving defendant who thereby
escapes the extreme rigors of the penalty imposed by law for the offense of
which he stands convicted.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn10' href="#_ftn10"
name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a special prerogative granted by law to a person or group of persons not
enjoyed by others or by all.  Accordingly, the grant of probation rests solely upon the discretion of
the court which is to be exercised primarily for the benefit of organized
society, and only incidentally for the benefit of the accused.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn11' href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The Probation Law should not therefore be permitted to divest the state or its
government of any of the latter's prerogatives, rights or remedies, unless the
intention of the legislature to this end is clearly expressed, and no person
should benefit from the terms of the law who is not clearly within them.</p>

<p class=BODY>Neither Sec. 4 of the Probation Law, as amended, which clearly
mandates that &quot;no application for probation shall be entertained or
granted if the defendant has perfected the appeal from the judgment of
conviction,&quot; nor <i>Llamado v. Court of Appeals</i><a style='mso-footnote-id:

</i>which interprets the quoted provision, offers any ambiguity or
qualification.  As such, the application
of the law should not be subjected to any to suit the case of petitioner.  While the proposition that an appeal should
not bar the accused from applying for probation if the appeal is solely to
reduce the penalty to within the probationable limit may be equitable, we are
not yet prepared to accept this interpretation under existing law and
jurisprudence.  Accordingly, we quote
Mr. Justice Feliciano speaking for the Court <i>en</i> <i>banc </i>in <i>Llamado
v. Court of Appeals -<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>x x x we note at the outset that Probation Law is not a penal
statute.  We, however, understand
petitioner's argument to be really that any statutory language that appears to favor
the accused in a criminal case should be given a 'liberal interpretation.'
Courts x x x have no authority to invoke 'liberal interpretation' or 'the
spirit of the law' where the words of the statute themselves, and as
illuminated by the history of that statute, leave no room for doubt or
interpretation.  We do not believe that
‘the spirit of the law' may legitimately be invoked to set at naught words
which have a clear and definite meaning imparted to them by our procedural
law.  The 'true legislative intent' must
obviously be given effect by judges and all others who are charged with the
application and<span style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'> </span>implementation
of a statute.  It is absolutely
essential to bear in mind, however, that the spirit of the law and the intent
that is to be given effect are derived from the words actually used by the
law-maker, and not from some external, mystical or metajuridical source
independent of and transcending the words of the legislature.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court is not here to be understood as giving a 'strict
interpretation' rather than a 'liberal' one to Section 4 of the Probation Law
of 1976 as amended by P.D. No. 1990.  'Strict' and 'liberal' are adjectives which too frequently impede a
disciplined and principled search for the meaning which the law-­making
authority projected when it promulgated the language which we must apply.  That meaning is clearly visible in the text
of Section 4, as plain and unmistakable as the nose on a man's face.  The Court is simply reading Section 4 as it
is in fact written.  There is no need
for the involved process of construction that petitioner invites us to engage
in, a process made necessary only because petitioner rejects the conclusion or
meaning which shines through the words of the statute.  The first duty of the judge is to take and
apply a statute as he finds it, not as he would like it to be.  Otherwise, as this Court in <i>Yangco v.
Court of First Instance </i>warned, confusion and uncertainty will surely
follow, making, we might add, stability and continuity in the law much more
difficult to achieve:<b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class=2Q><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>'</span>x x x [w]here
language is plain, subtle refinements which tinge words <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'>as </span>to give them the color of a particular judicial theory are
not only unnecessary but decidedly harmful.  That which has caused so much confusion in the law, which has made it so
difficult for the public to understand and know what the law is with respect to
a given matter, is in considerable measure the unwarranted interference by
judicial tribunals with the English language as found in statutes and
contracts, cutting the words here and inserting them there, making them fit
personal ideas of what the legislature ought to have done or what parties
should have agreed upon, giving them meanings which they do not ordinarily have
cutting, trimming, fitting, changing and coloring until lawyers themselves are
unable to advise their clients as to the meaning of a given statute or contract
until it has been submitted to some court for its interpretation and
construction.'</p>

<blockquote>The point in this warning may be expected
to become sharper as our people's grasp of English is steadily attenuated.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Therefore, that an appeal should not bar the accused from
applying for probation if the appeal is taken solely to reduce the penalty is
simply contrary to the clear and express mandate of Sec. 4 of the Probation
Law, as amended, which opens with a negative clause, &quot;no application for
probation shall be entertained or granted if the defendant has perfected the
appeal from the judgment of conviction.&quot; In <i>Bersabal v. Salvador,</i><a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn14' href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>we said -<span style='font-size:3.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>By its very language, the Rule is mandatory.  Under the rule of statutory construction,
negative words and phrases are to be regarded as mandatory while those in the
affirmative are merely directory x x x x the use of the term 'shall' further
emphasizes its mandatory character and means that it is imperative, operating
to impose a duty which may be enforced.<span style='font-size:9.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>And where the law does not distinguish the courts should not
distinguish; where the law does not make exception the court should not except.</p>

<p class=BODY><b><u>Second</u>.  At the
outset, the penalties imposed by the MeTC were already probationable.  Hence, there was no need to appeal </b><b><span
style='font-size:11.0pt'>if<i> </i></span>only to reduce the penalties to
within the probationable period.</b>  Multiple prison terms imposed against an accused found guilty of several
offenses in one decision are not, and should not be, added up.  And, the sum of the multiple prison terms
imposed against an applicant should not be determinative of his eligibility
for, nay his disqualification from, probation.  The multiple prison terms are distinct from each other, and if none of
the terms exceeds the limit set out in the Probation Law, i.e., not more than
six (6) years, then he is entitled to probation, unless he is otherwise
specifically disqualified.  The number
of offenses is immaterial as long as all the penalties imposed, taken
separately, are within the probationable period.  For, Sec. 9, par. (a), P.D. 968, as amended, uses the word <u>maximum</u>,
not <u>total</u>, when it says that &quot;[t]he benefits of this Decree shall
not be extended to those x x x x sentenced to serve a <u>maximum</u> term of
imprisonment of more than six years.&quot; Evidently, the law does not intend
to sum up the penalties imposed but to take each penalty separately and
distinctly with the others.  Consequently, even if petitioner was supposed to have  served his prison term of one (1) year and
one (1) day to one (1) year and eight (8) months of <i>prision</i> <i>correccional</i>
<u>sixteen (16) times</u> as he was sentenced to serve the prison term for
&quot;each crime committed on each date of each case, as alleged in the information
(s),&quot; and in each of the four (4) informations, he was charged with having
defamed the four (4) private complainants on four (4) different, separate days,
he was still eligible for probation, as each prison term imposed on petitioner
was probationable.</p>

<p class=BODY>Fixing the cut-off point at a maximum term of six (6) years
imprisonment for probation is based on the assumption that those sentenced to
higher penalties pose too great a risk to society, not just because of their
demonstrated capability for serious wrongdoing but because of the gravity and
serious consequences of the offense they might further commit.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn15' href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The Probation Law, as amended, disqualifies only those who have been convicted
of grave felonies as defined in Art. 9 in relation to Art. 25 of The Revised
Penal Code,<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn16' href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and not necessarily those who have been convicted of multiple offenses in a
single proceeding who are deemed to be less perverse.  Hence, the basis of the disqualification is principally the
gravity of the offense committed and the concomitant degree of penalty
imposed.  Those sentenced to a maximum
term not exceeding six (6) years are not generally considered callous, hard
core criminals, and thus may avail of probation.</p>

<p class=BODY>To demonstrate the point, let us take for instance one who is convicted
in a single decision of, say, thirteen (13) counts of grave oral defamation
(for having defamed thirteen [13] individuals in one outburst) and sentenced to
a <u>total</u> prison term of thirteen (13) years, and another who has been
found guilty of mutilation and sentenced to six (6) years and one (1) day of <i>prision</i>
<i>mayor</i> minimum as minimum to twelve (12) years and one (1) day of <i>reclusion</i>
<i>temporal</i> minimum as maximum.  Obviously, the latter offender is more perverse and is disqualified from
availing of probation.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner thus proceeds on an erroneous assumption that under
the MeTC Decision he could not have availed of the benefits of probation.  Since he could have, although he did not,
his appeal now precludes him from applying for probation.<span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>And, even if we go along with the premise of petitioner, however
erroneous it may be, that the penalties imposed against him should be summed
up, still he would not have qualified under the Decision rendered by the RTC
since if the &quot;STRAIGHT penalty of EIGHT (8) MONTHS imprisonment&quot;
imposed by the RTC is multiplied <u>sixteen (16) times</u>, the total imposable
penalty would be ten (10) years and eight (8) months, which is still way beyond
the limit of not more than six (6) years provided for in the Probation Law, as
amended.  To illustrate:  8 months multiplied by 16 cases = 128
months; 128 months divided by 12 months (in a year) = 10 years and 8 months,
hence, following his argument, petitioner cannot still be eligible for
probation as the total of his penalties exceeds six (6) years.</p>

<p class=BODY>The assertion that the Decision of the RTC should be multiplied
only four (4) times since there are only four (4) Informations thereby allowing
petitioner to qualify for probation, instead of sixteen (16) times, is quite
difficult to understand.  The penalties
imposed by the MeTC cannot be any clearer  -  &quot;one (1) year and one (1)
day to one (1) year and eight (8) months of <u>prision correccional, in each
crime committed  on each date of each
case, as alleged in the information(s</u>).&quot; Hence, petitioner should
suffer the imposed penalties sixteen (16) times.  On the other hand, the RTC affirmed the judgment of conviction
and merely reduced the duration of each penalty imposed by the MeTC &quot;in
each case to a STRAIGHT penalty of EIGHT (8) MONTHS imprisonment&quot; on
account of a mitigating circumstance for each case, count or incident of grave
oral defamation.  There is no valid
reason therefore why the penalties imposed by the RTC should be multiplied only
four (4) times, and not sixteen (16) times, considering that the RTC merely <u>affirmed</u>
the MeTC as regards the culpability of petitioner in each of the sixteen (16)
cases and <u>reducing only the  duration
of the penalties</u> imposed therein.  Thus -</p>

<blockquote>Premises considered, the judgment of conviction rendered by the trial
court is AFFIRMED with modification, as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the Court hereby finds the accused Pablo C. Francisco
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt in each of the above entitled cases and
appreciating in his favor the mitigating circumstance which is analogous to
passion or obfuscation, the Court hereby sentences the said accused in each
case to a straight penalty of EIGHT (8) MONTHS imprisonment, with the accessory
penalties prescribed by law; and to pay the costs.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn17' href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Nowhere in the RTC Decision is it stated or even hinted at that
the accused was acquitted or absolved in any of the four (4) counts under each
of the four (4) Informations, or that any part of the judgment of conviction
was reversed, or that any of the cases, counts or incidents was dismissed.  Otherwise, we will have to account for the
twelve (12) other penalties imposed by the MeTC.  Can we?  What is clear is
that the judgment of conviction rendered by the MeTC was affirmed with the sole
modification on the duration of the penalties.</p>

<p class=BODY>In fine, considering that the multiple prison terms should not be
summed up but taken separately as the totality of all the penalties is not the
test, petitioner should have immediately filed an application for probation as
he was already qualified after being convicted by the MeTC, if indeed
thereafter he felt humbled, was ready to unconditionally accept the verdict of
the court and admit his liability.  Consequently, in appealing the Decision of the MeTC to the RTC, petitioner
lost his right to probation.  For, plainly,
the law considers appeal and probation mutually exclusive remedies.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn18' href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><b><u>Third</u>.  Petitioner appealed to the RTC not to reduce or even correct the
penalties imposed by the MeTC, but to assert his innocence.  Nothing more</b>.  The cold fact is that petitioner appealed his conviction to the
RTC not for the sole purpose of reducing his penalties to make him eligible for
probation - since he was already qualified under the MeTC Decision - but rather
to insist on his innocence.  The appeal
record is wanting of any other purpose.  Thus, in his Memorandum before the RTC, he raised only three (3)
statements of error purportedly committed by the MeTC all aimed at his
acquittal:  (a) in finding that the
guilt of the accused has been established because of his positive
identification by the witness for the prosecution; (b) in giving full faith and
credence to the bare statements of the private complainants despite the absence
of corroborating testimonies; and, (c) in not acquitting him in all the cases.”<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, petitioner insisted that the trial court committed an error in
relying on his positive identification considering that private complainants
could not have missed identifying him who was their President and General
Manager with whom they worked for a good number of years.  Petitioner further argued that although the
alleged defamatory words were uttered in the presence of other persons, mostly
private complainants' co-employees and clients, not one of them was presented
as a witness.  Hence, according to
petitioner, the trial court could not have convicted him on the basis of the
uncorroborative testimony of private complainants.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn20' href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>Certainly, the protestations of petitioner connote profession of
guiltlessness, if not complete innocence, and do not simply put in issue the
propriety of the penalties imposed.  <u>For
sure, the accused never manifested that he was appealing only for the purpose
of correcting a wrong penalty - to reduce it to within the probationable range</u>.  Hence, upon interposing an appeal, more so
after asserting his innocence therein, petitioner should be precluded from
seeking probation.  By perfecting his
appeal, petitioner <i>ipso facto </i>relinquished his alternative remedy of
availing of the Probation Law the purpose of which is simply to prevent
speculation or opportunism on the part of an accused who although already
eligible does not at once apply for probation, but doing so only after failing
in his appeal.</p>

<p class=BODY>The fact that petitioner did not elevate the affirmance of his
conviction by the RTC to the Court of Appeals does not necessarily mean that
his appeal to the RTC was solely to reduce his penalties.  Conversely, he was afraid that the Court of
Appeals would increase his penalties, which could be worse for him.  Besides, the RTC Decision had already become
final and executory because of the negligence, according to him, of his former
counsel who failed to seek possible remedies within the period allowed by law.</p>

<p class=BODY>Perhaps it should be mentioned that at the outset petitioner, in
accordance with Sec 3, par. (e), Rule 117 of the Rules of Court,<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn21' href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
should have moved to quash as each of the four (4) Informations filed against
him charged four (4) separate crimes of grave oral defamation, committed on
four (4) separate days.  His failure to
do so however may now be deemed a waiver under Sec. 8 of the same Rule<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn22' href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
and he can be validly convicted, as in the instant case, of as many crimes
charged in the Information.</p>

<p class=BODY><b><u>Fourth</u>.  The
application for probation was filed way beyond the period allowed by law</b>.  This is vital and crucial.  From the records it is clear that the
application for probation was filed &quot;only after a warrant for the arrest
of petitioner had been issued x x x (and) almost two months after (his) receipt
of the Decision&quot;<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn23' href="#_ftn23"
name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
of the RTC.  This is a significant fact
which militates against the instant petition.  We quote with affirmance the well-written, albeit assailed, <i>ponencia</i>
of now Presiding Justice of the Court of Appeals Nathanael P. De Pano, Jr., on
the specific issue - <span style='mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x x x the petition for probation was filed by the petitioner out of
time.  The law in point, Section 4 of
P.D. 968, as amended, provides thus:</blockquote>

<p class=2Q>'SEC. 4. Grant of Probation. -- Subject to the provisions of this
Decree, the trial court may, after it shall have convicted and sentenced a
defendant, and upon application by said defendant within the period for
perfecting an appeal x x x x place the defendant on probation x x x x'</p>

<blockquote>Going to the extreme, and assuming that an application for
probation from one who had appealed the trial court's judgment is allowed by
law, the petitioner's plea for probation was filed out of time.  In the petition is a clear statement that
the petitioner was up for <u>execution of judgment</u> before he filed his
application for probation.  P.D. No. 968
says that the application for probation must be filed &quot;within the period
for perfecting an appeal;&quot; but in this case, such period for appeal had
passed, meaning to say that the Regional Trial Court's decision had attained
finality, and no appeal therefrom was possible under the law.  Even granting that an appeal from the <u>appellate</u>
court's judgment is contemplated by P.D. 968, in addition to the judgment
rendered by the trial court, that appellate judgment had become final and was,
in fact, up for actual execution before the application for probation was
attempted by the petitioner.  The
petitioner did not file his application for probation before the finality of
the said judgment; therefore, the petitioner's attempt at probation was filed
too late.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>  Our minds cannot simply
rest easy on the proposition that an application for probation may yet be
granted even if it was filed only after judgment has become final, the
conviction already set for execution and a warrant of arrest issued for service
of sentence.</p>

<p class=BODY>The argument that petitioner had to await the remand of the case
to the MeTC, which necessarily must be after the decision of the RTC had become
final, for him to file the application for probation with the trial court, is
to stretch the law beyond comprehension.  The law, simply, does not allow probation after an appeal has been
perfected.<span style='font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, considering that prevailing jurisprudence
treats appeal and probation as mutually exclusive remedies, and petitioner
appealed from his conviction by the MeTC although the imposed penalties were
already probationable, and in his appeal, he asserted only his innocence and
did not even raise the issue of the propriety of the penalties imposed on him,
and finally, he filed an application for probation outside the period for
perfecting an appeal granting he was otherwise eligible for probation, the
instant petition for review should be as it is hereby DENIED.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=OTHERHEADING>DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class=PONENTE>MENDOZA, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class=BODY align=left style='text-align:left'>I vote to reverse the judgment
of the Court of Appeals in this case.<b><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>I.</p>

<p class=BODY>The principal basis for the affirmance of the decision of the
Court of Appeals denying probation is the fact that petitioner had appealed his
sentence before filing his application for probation.  Reliance is placed on the literal application of § 4 of the
Probation Law of 1976, as amended, which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 4.  <i>Grant of
Probation.</i>  - Subject to the
provisions of this Decree, the trial court may, after it shall have convicted
and sentenced a defendant, and upon application by said defendant within the
period for perfecting an appeal, suspend the execution of the sentence and
place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and
conditions as it may deem best; <i>Provided, </i>That no application for
probation shall be entertained or granted if the defendant has perfected the
appeal from the judgment of conviction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Probation may be granted whether the sentence imposes a term of
imprisonment or a fine only.  An
application for probation shall be filed with the trial court.  The filing of the application shall be
deemed a waiver of the right to appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An order granting or denying probation shall not be appealable.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Thus, under § 4 the accused is given the choice of appealing his
sentence or applying for probation.  If
he appeals, he cannot later apply for probation.  If he opts for probation, he can not appeal.  Implicit in the choice, however, is that the
accused is not disqualified for probation under any of the cases mentioned in §
9, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 9.  <i>Disqualified
Offenders.</i>  - The benefits of this
Decree shall not be extended to those:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)  sentenced to serve a maximum term of
imprisonment of more than six years;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  convicted of subversion
or any crime against the national security or the public order;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)  who have previously been convicted by final
judgment of an offense punished by imprisonment of not less than one month and
one day and/or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)  who have been once on
probation under the provisions of this Decree; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span>who are already serving sentence at the time
the substantive provisions of this Decree became applicable pursuant to Section
33 hereof.</blockquote>

<p class=BODY style='text-indent:0in'>Consequently, if under the sentence given
to him an accused is not qualified for probation, as when the penalty imposed
on him by the court singly or in their totality exceeds six (6) years but on
appeal the sentence is modified so that he becomes qualified, I believe that
the accused should not be denied the benefit of probation.</p>

<p class=BODY>Before its amendment by P.D. No. 1990, the law allowed — even
encouraged — speculation on the outcome of appeals by permitting the accused to
apply for probation after he had appealed and failed to obtain an acquittal.<a
style='mso-footnote-id:ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It was to change this that §4 was amended by P.D. No. 1990 by<span
style='font-size:9.0pt'> </span>expressly providing that &quot;no application
for probation shall be entertained or granted if the defendant has perfected
the appeal from the judgment of conviction.&quot; For an accused, despite the
fact that he is eligible for probation, may be tempted to appeal in the hope of
obtaining an acquittal if he knows he can any way apply for probation in the
event his conviction is affirmed. <a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2' href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>There is, however, nothing in the amendatory Decree to suggest
that in limiting the accused to the choice of either appealing from the
decision of the trial court or applying for probation, the purpose is to deny
him the right to probation in cases like the one at bar where he becomes
eligible for probation only because on appeal his sentence is reduced.  The purpose of the amendment, it bears
repeating, is simply to prevent speculation or opportunism on the part of an
accused who, although eligible for probation, does not at once apply for
probation, doing so only after failing in his appeal.</p>

<p class=BODY>In the case at bar, it cannot be said that in appealing the
decision of the MeTC petitioner was principally motivated by a desire to be
acquitted.  While acquittal might have
been an alluring prospect for him, what is clear is that he had a reason for
appealing because under the sentence given to him he was disqualified to apply
for probation.  The MeTC had originally
sentenced him to 1 year and 1 day to 1 year and 8 months of <i>prision</i> <i>correccional</i>
for &quot;each crime committed on each date of each case, as alleged in the
information[s].&quot; This meant, as the majority opinion points out, that
petitioner had to suffer the prison term of 1 year and 1 day to 1 year and 8
months <u>sixteen times</u>, since he was found guilty of <u>four crimes</u> of
grave oral defamation <u>in each</u> of four cases.  The totality of the penalties imposed on petitioner (26 years and
8 months) thus exceeded the limit of six (6) years of imprisonment allowed by §
9(a) and disqualified him for probation.  It was only after this penalty was reduced on appeal to a straight
penalty of eight months imprisonment in each case or to a total term of 2 years
and 8 months in the four cases that petitioner became eligible for
probation.  Then he did not appeal
further although he could have done so.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Court of Appeals, while acknowledging that &quot;there may be
some space not covered by the present law on probation . . . where in its
original state, the petitioner was disqualified from applying for probation
under Sec. 9 of the Decree, becoming eligible for probation only under the
terms of the judgment on appeal,&quot; nevertheless felt bound by the letter of
§ 4: &quot;No application for probation shall be entertained or granted if the
defendant has perfected the appeal from the judgment of conviction.&quot; The
majority opinion, affirming the ruling, states that to allow probation in this
case would be to go against the &quot;clear and express mandate of sec. 4 of
the Probation Law, as amended.&quot; (p. 9)</p>

<p class=BODY>To regard probation, however, as a mere privilege, to be given to
the accused only where it clearly appears he comes within its letter is to
disregard the teaching in many cases that the Probation Law should be applied
in favor of the accused not because it is a criminal law — it is not — but to
achieve its beneficent purpose.  (Santos
To v. Paño, 120 SCRA 8, 14 (1983)).  The
niggardly application of the law would defeat its purpose to &quot;help the
probationer develop into a law-abiding and self-respecting individual&quot;
(Baclayon v. Mutia, 129 SCRA 148, 149 (1984), per Teehankee, <i>J</i>.) or
&quot;afford [him] a chance to reform and rehabilitate himself without the
stigma of a prison record, to save government funds that may otherwise be spent
for his food and maintenance while incarcerated, and to decongest the jails of
the country.&quot; (Del Rosario v. Rosero, 126 SCRA 228, 232 (1983), per
Makasiar, <i>J</i>.)<i><span style='font-size:11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class=BODY>The approach followed by the Court in <i>Atienza v. Court of
Appeals, </i>140 SCRA 391, 395 (1985) instead commends itself to me:</p>

<blockquote>Regarding this, it suffices to state that the Probation Law was
never intended to limit the right of an accused person to present all relevant
evidence he can avail of in order to secure a verdict of acquittal or a
reduction of the penalty.  Neither does
the law require a plea of guilty on the part of the accused to enable him to
avail of the benefits of probation.  A
contrary view would certainly negate the constitutional right of an accused to
be presumed innocent until the contrary is proved.<span style='mso-bidi-font-family:
Tahoma'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>As already stated, petitioner did not appeal primarily to seek acquittal.  Proof of this is that after the penalty
imposed on him by the MeTC had been reduced by the RTC so that he thereby
became qualified for probation, he did not appeal further.  The majority says that this was because he
was afraid that if he did the penalty could be increased.  That possibility, however, was also there
when he appealed from the MeTC to the RTC.  For by appealing the sentence of the MeTC, petitioner took as much risk
that the penalty would be raised as the chance that he would be acquitted.<span
style='font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>It is true that in appealing the sentence of the MeTC petitioner
professed his innocence and not simply questioned the propriety of his
sentence, but no more so does an accused who, upon being arraigned, pleads
&quot;Not Guilty.&quot; And yet the latter cannot be denied probation if he is
otherwise eligible for probation.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is argued that there is a difference because an accused who
pleads &quot;not guilty&quot; in the beginning, later acknowledges his guilt
and shows contrition after he is found guilty.  So does an accused who appeals a sentence because under it he is not
qualified for probation, but after the penalty is reduced, instead of appealing
further, accepts the new sentence and applies for probation.</p>

<p class=BODY>This case is thus distinguishable from <i>Llamado v. Court of
Appeals, </i>174 SCRA 566 (1989), in which it was held that because the
petitioner had appealed his sentence, he could not subsequently apply for
probation.  For, unlike petitioner in
the case at bar, the accused in that case could have applied for probation as
his original sentence of one year of <i>prision correccional </i>did not
disqualify him for probation.  That case
fell squarely within the ambit of the prohibition in § 4 that one who applies
for probation must not &quot;have perfected an appeal from the judgment of
conviction.&quot;</p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>II.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is contended that petitioner did not have to appeal because
under the original sentence meted out to him he was not disqualified for
probation.  The issue here is whether
the multiple prison terms imposed on petitioner are to be considered singly or
in their totality for the purpose of § 9(a) which disqualifies from probation
those &quot;sentenced to serve a maximum term of imprisonment of more than six
years.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>I submit that they should be taken in their totality.  As the sentence originally imposed on
petitioner was for &quot;one (1) year and one (1) day to one (1) year and eight
(8) months of <i>prision correccional </i>in each crime committed on each date
of each case&quot; and as there are four offenses of grave oral defamation
against petitioner in each of the four cases, the total prison term which he
would have to serve was 26 years and 8 months.  This is clearly beyond the probationable maximum allowed by law.</p>

<p class=BODY>It is said, however, that even if the totality of the prison
terms is the test, the modified sentence imposed by the RTC would not qualify
the petitioner for probation because he has to suffer imprisonment of eight
months sixteen times.  That is not
so.  The RTC only &quot;sentence[d] the
said accused in each case to a STRAIGHT penalty of EIGHT (8) MONTHS
imprisonment.&quot; This means eight (8) months times four (4), since there are
four cases, or 32 months or 2 years and 8 months.</p>

<p class=BODY>The policy of the law indeed appears to be to treat as only one
multiple sentences imposed in cases which are jointly tried and decided.  For example, § 9(c) disqualifies from
probation persons &quot;who have previously been convicted by final judgment of
an offense punished by imprisonment of not less than one month and one day
and/or a fine of not less than Two Hundred Pesos.&quot; It was held in <i>Rura
v. Lopena, </i>137 SCRA 121 (1985) that the accused, who had been found guilty
of estafa in five criminal cases, was qualified for probation because although
the crimes had been committed on different dates he was found guilty of each
crime on the same day.  As this Court
noted, &quot;Rura was sentenced to a <u>total prison term</u> of seventeen (17)
months and twenty-five (25) days.  In
each criminal case the sentence was three (3) months and fifteen (15)
days.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>That the duration of a convict's sentence is determined by
considering the totality of several penalties for different offenses committed
is also implicit in the provisions of the Revised Penal Code on the
accumulation of penalties.  <i>(See,
e.g., </i>arts. 48 and 70)</p>

<p class=BODY>It is said that the basis of disqualification under § 9 is the
gravity of the offense committed and the penalty imposed.  I agree.  That is why I contend that a person who is convicted of multiple grave
oral defamation for which the total prison term is, say, 6 years and 8 months,
is guilty of a graver offense than another who is guilty of only offense of
grave oral defamation and sentenced to a single penalty of 1 year and 8
months.  The relevant comparison is
between an accused convicted of one offense of grave oral defamation and
another one convicted of the <u>same offense</u>, say four or more times.  The relevant comparison is <u>not</u>, as
the majority says, between an accused found guilty of grave oral defamation
four or more times and another one found guilty of mutilation and sentenced to
an indeterminate term of 6 years and 1 day of <i>prision mayor </i>to 12 years
and 1 day of <i>reclusion temporal.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=NUMROMANS style='margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in'>III.</p>

<p class=BODY>Finally, it is said that there is a more fundamental reason for
denying probation in this case and that is that petitioner applied for probation
only after his case had been remanded to the MeTC for the execution of its
decision as modified.  But that is
because § 4 provides that “an application for probation shall be filed with the
trial court.&quot; In the circumstances of this case, petitioner had to await
the remand of the case to the MeTC, which necessarily must be after the
decision of the RTC had become final.</p>

<p class=BODY>The decision of the Court of Appeals should be REVERSED and
respondent judge of the Metropolitan Trial Court of Makati, Metro Manila should
be ORDERED to GRANT petitioner's application for probation.</p>

style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'> </span>As originally
promulgated on July 24, 1976, P.D. No. 968, § 4 provided:</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>SEC. 4.  <i>Grant of Probation.</i>  <i>- </i>Subject to the provisions of this Decree, the court may, <b>after
it shall have convicted and sentenced a defendant</b> and upon application <b>at
any time </b>of said defendant, suspend the execution of said sentence and
place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such terms and
conditions as it may deem best.</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>Probation may be granted whether
the sentence imposes a term of imprisonment or a fine only.  An application for probation shall be filed
with the trial court, with notice to the appellate court if an appeal has been
taken from the sentence of conviction.  <b>The
filing of the application shall be deemed a waiver of the right to appeal, or
the automatic withdrawal of a pending appeal</b>.<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>An order granting or denying
probation shall not be appealable. (Emphasis added)</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>Thus, under the law
as originally promulgated, any time after the trial court had convicted and
sentenced the accused and even if he had taken an appeal, the trial court could
grant him probation in the event he is convicted.</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>On December 1,
1977, § 4 of the law was again amended by P. D. No. 1257 so as to read as
follows:</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>SEC. 4.  <i>Grant of Probation.</i>  <i>- </i>Subject to the provisions of this Decree, the court may, <b>after
it shall have convicted and sentenced a defendant but before he begins to serve
his sentence</b> and upon his application, suspend the execution of said
sentence and place the defendant on probation for such period and upon such
terms and conditions as it may deem best.</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>The prosecuting officer concerned
shall be notified by the court of the filing of the application for probation
and he may submit his comment on such application within ten days from receipt
of the notification.</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>Probation may be granted whether
the sentence imposes a term of imprisonment or a fine with subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency.  An
application for probation shall be filed with the trial court, with notice to
the appellate court <b>if an appeal has been taken from the sentence of
conviction.  The filing of the
application shall be deemed a waiver of the right to appeal, </b>or the<b>
automatic withdrawal of a pending appeal</b>.  In the latter case, however, <b>if the application is filed on or after
the date of the judgment of the appellate court</b>,<b> </b>said application
shall be acted upon by the trial court on the basis of the judgment of the
appellate court.</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='text-indent:.5in'>An order granting or denying probation
shall not be appealable.  (Emphasis
added)</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>This amendment
limited the period for applying for probation to the point just “before he
begins to serve his sentence.” This meant not only after an appeal had been
taken but even after a judgment had been rendered by the appellate court and
after the latter’s judgment had become final.  Hence the proviso that “the application [for probation] shall be acted
upon by the trial court <b>on the basis of the judgment of the appellate court</b>.”</p>

<p class=FOOTNOTES style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:.5in'>On October 5, 1985,
§ 4 of the Probation Law was again amended to further limit the period for
applying for probation to the &quot;period for perfecting an appeal.&quot; The
purpose was to confine the accused to the choice of either applying for
probation or appealing.  While heretofore
an accused could appeal and, alter his appeal had failed, apply for probation,
under theamendatory Decree, this is no longer possible.  if he appeals he cannot later apply for
probation.  If he applies for probation
he cannot later appeal.  As amended by
P.D. No. 1990, § 4 reads:</p>

was not intended as an escape hatch</b> and should not be used to obstruct and

<p class=OTHERHEADING>SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class=DISSENTINGCONCURRING>VITUG, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class=BODY>While I subscribe to the observation made by Mr. Justice Vicente
V. Mendoza in his dissenting opinion that an accused, who originally is not <span
style='letter-spacing:.25pt'>qualified for probation because the penalty
imposed on him by a court <u>a</u> </span><u>quo</u> exceeds six (6) years,
should not be denied that benefit of probation if <span style='letter-spacing:
-.05pt'>on appeal the sentence is ultimately reduced to within the prescribed
limit, I </span>am unable, however, to second the other proposition that
multiple prison terms imposed by a court should be taken in their totality for
purposes of Section 9 (a), P.D. No. 968.  In this respect, I concur with Mr. Justice Josue <span style='letter-spacing:
1.05pt'>N. Bellosillo in his <u>ponencia</u> that in determining the
eligibility or </span><span style='letter-spacing:.1pt'>disqualification of an
applicant for probation charged with, and sentenced </span><span
style='letter-spacing:.7pt'>to serve multiple prison terms for, several
offenses, &quot;the number of </span><span style='letter-spacing:.85pt'>offenses
is immaterial as long as all the penalties imposed, taken </span><span
style='letter-spacing:.55pt'>separately, are within the probationable
period.&quot; The use of the word </span><u>maximum</u> instead of the word <u>total</u>
in Section 9, paragraph (a) of P.D. 968, as amended, should be enough to reveal
that such has been the legislative intent.</p>

<p class=BODY>Thus, I still must vote for the denial of the petition.</p>
