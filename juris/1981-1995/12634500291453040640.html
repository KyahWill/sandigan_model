				<BR><STRONG>ABAD SANTOS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the morning of October 19, 1971, Alex de Guzman, a motorized tricycle
driver of Linoc, Binmaley, Pangasinan, was found dead near a fishpond in
Maasin, Mangaldan, Pangasinan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
tricycle, he was driving was missing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy performed by Dr. Numeriano Presto, Health Officer of
Mangaldan, revealed that Alex de Guzman was stabbed with a long <span style="">bladed weapon on the upper left side of the
abdomen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was a </span><span style="">five to six inch-wound on the abdomen which
perforated the liver and caused severe blood loss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For some time, the police authorities of Dagupan City had no clue
on the slaying of Alex de Guzman until they apprehended some tricycle drivers,
in the course of their "anti-dognapping" campaign when they came
across a certain Demetrio Runez on May 9, 1973.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to police Sgt. Pedro Landingan who took part in <span style="">the campaign, one </span>of the tricycle
drivers told him that Demetrio Runez<span style="">&nbsp; </span>had
something to do with the slaying of Alex de Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when Sgt. Landingan investigated
Demetrio, he revealed the circumstances surrounding the death of de Guzman, and
executed a two-page sworn statement dated <span style="">May
</span>9, 1973, Exh. "E".</p>

<p class="BODY">Exhibit "E" stated in substance that at around 8:30 in
the evening of October 18, 1971, Demetrio Runez was invited by Salvador Peruelo
and one "Teofing" to Pol's Place in Dagupan City; that thereafter <span style="">Teofing invited him to Bonuan for a good
time; that at 10:30 o'clock </span><span style="">they
</span><span style="">took a tricycle, he sat behind </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">driver and Peruelo and "Teofing" were in the side </span><span style="">car; </span><span style="">that they reached Mardi Grass Night Club, whereupon he noticed that the
driver of the tricycle was Alex de Guzman; that they proceeded to Maasin; until
he noticed that they were in a fishpond; </span><span style="">that </span><span style="">they stopped and
his two companions alighted; that "Teofing" went into the motion of
urinating, but instead of urinating, "Teofing" produced a knife, went
to Alex de Guzman and stabbed the latter; that Salvador Peruelo, armed with a
blunt weapon struck </span><span style="">Alex de
Guzman </span>causing the latter to fall to the ground; that he left the place
and walked towards Dagupan City; that while he was walking "Teofing"
and Salvador Peruelo overtook him in the same tricycle, then, driven by
"Teofing", with Peruelo in the side car; and that he did not report
the incident to the police because he was confused and was threatened by
"Teofing" not to reveal the incident to anybody.</p>

<p class="BODY">An information for robbery with homicide dated October 30, 1973,
was filed in the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan (Branch XI), charging
Salvador Peruelo and two "Does" as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 18th day of October, 1971, in the City
of Dagupan, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, the
above-named accused SALVADOR PERUELO together with JOHN DOE @ 'Teofing' and one
PETER DOE, whose real names and identities have not as yet been ascertained,
accused SALVADOR PERUELO being then armed with a deadly weapon (dagger),
confederating together, acting jointly and helping one another, and with
evident premeditation and treachery and with intent to kill, did then and
there, wilfully, unlawfully and criminally, attack, assault and use personal
violence upon the person of ALEX DE GUZMAN, a motorized tricycle driver whom
the said accused hired, by stabbing him so suddenly without giving him a chance
to defend him­self while on stop riding on his tricycle, while accused JOHN DOE
@ 'Teofing' and PETER DOE, stood vigilant and on guard for any eventuality,
which caused his death thereafter, and on occasion thereof, the said accused
SALVADOR PERUELO, JOHN DOE @ 'Teofing' and <span style="">PETER DOE, </span>with intent of gain and by means of force and violence,
stole, robbed and rode away with the said motorized tricycle taken from the
said ALEX <span style="">DE GUZMAN, </span>the driver,
to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the deceased in the amount of
P12,000.00 damages, and other conse­quential damages sustained."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On March 20, 1975, the case was archived, no arrest having been
made of Salvador Peruelo, who, it was said could not be found in his address at
Mabayuan, Olongapo City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 18, 1978, Salvador Peruelo showed up at the police
headquarters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was accompanied by
Atty. Roberto Merrera, Municipal Mayor of Binmaley, who presented him to the
police.</p>

<p class="BODY">It turned out that on July 17, 1978, Salvador Peruelo, a waiter
in Great China Night Club in Olongapo City, applied with the Olongapo City
Police Department for a police clearance in connection with his application for
employment in Olongapo Naval Base.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
informed that there was a pending case against him <span style="">in Dagupan </span>City, Salvador Peruelo and his wife, Conchita de
Guzman went to Conchita's uncle, Pablo de Guzman in Linoc, Binmaley.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Together, they asked the help of Mayor
Roberto Merrera, who brought Salvador to the Dagupan City police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whereupon Salvador Peruelo was detained at
the Dagupan City jail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 24, 1978, a certain Federico Moulic was summoned to the
police department.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Federico Moulic was a
caretaker of the fish­pond, near which Alex de Guzman was found dead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was said to have seen the slaying of de
Guzman that evening of October 18, 1971, and recognized the assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Federico Moulic confronted Salvador Peruelo and Demetrio Runez in
the investigation section of Dagupan City <span style="">Police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pointed at Peruelo </span>as
the person who hit the victim at the back with a blunt instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two pictures were taken showing Moulic
identifying Peruelo, (Exhs. "C" and "C-2").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also identified Demetrio Runez, as the one
who stabbed the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pictures were
also taken of Moulic pointing at Runez (Exhs. "C" and <span style="">"C-3”).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Federico Moulic executed a two-page sworn statement dated July
24, 1978, (Exh. "B"), narrating what he witnessed that evening of
October 18, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His testimony, as the
lone prosecution eye­witness was but a repetition of this sworn statement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 8, 1978, Salvador Peruelo was arraigned and he pleaded
not guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the case which had been
filed five years before and archived for more than three years was revived.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, the information was amended to <span style="">substitute </span>Demetrio Runez in lieu of
"Peter Doe." It appears, however, <span style="">that </span>Runez was never arrested and tried.</p>

<p class="BODY">What started in 1971 as an indictment against Salvador Peruelo
for robbery with homicide, ended in 1979, with a conviction for murder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Robbery was discarded for lack of evidence of
such fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The killing </span>was denominated as murder qualified by treachery with
the aggravating circumstance of <u>despoblado</u> but mitigated by voluntary
surrender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Salvador Peruelo's alibi that
in the evening of October 18, 1971, he was <span style="">in his </span>brother's house in Otero, Mabayuan, Olongapo City,
celebrating with relatives the first birthday of his nephew, Jesus Peruelo, <span style="">Jr., was </span>rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of February 21, 1979, the trial court held:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, with these considerations, judgment is hereby
rendered finding the accused, SALVADOR PERUELO, guilty beyond reasonable doubt
of the crime of MURDER as proven by the evi­dence and is hereby sentenced to
suffer the penalty of <u>RECLUSION</u> <u>PERPETUA</u> and to indemnify the
heirs of the deceased, ALEX DE GUZMAN, in the amount of Twelve Thousand Pesos
(P12,000.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With one-third (1/3) of
the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before Us, Salvador Peruelo seeks acquittal on the ground<span style=""> that his guilt </span>had not been
established beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Through his able <span style="">counsel, Atty.
Roberto Merrera, he points out seven interrelated errors committed by the court
<u>a</u> <u>quo</u> which for brevity may be summed up as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) The incriminating testimony of Federico
Moulic is weak, unconvincing and unreliable, and does not therefore deserve the
credence accorded to it by the trial court; (b) the sworn statement of Demetrio
Runez (Exh. "E") should not have been admitted as part of the
prosecution evidence, it being hearsay; and (c) his alibi is worthy of belief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the records that the conviction of the accused?appellant
was founded solely on the testimony of Federico Moulic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Federico Moulic who claimed that in the evening of October 18,
1971, he saw how the deceased was assaulted and stabbed by two assailants,
showed up at the Dagupan City Police Department on July 24, 1978, executed Exh.
"B" and later, testified during the trial that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a caretaker of his brother-in-law's
fishpond, he was in his hut at around 8:00 o'clock that fateful evening when he
heard somebody shout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He got his
flashlight and went out to investigate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He went to the direction of the shout (south of his hut), and at about
10 meters from the source, he "flashed the beam" of his flashlight
towards it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, he saw three
persons "struggling."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his own words he narrated what he saw:</p>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Until the next morning,
sir.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, pp. 62-66)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At 6:30 o'clock the following morning, this witness said that he
went to the place of the incident and he saw several persons but he could only
recall Barangay Captain Atong Gubatan, Trinidad Naboa and Nanding Damaso, and
some policemen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached By.
Captain Gubatan and related to him the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked <span style="">if he knew the perpetrators, his reply (to Gubatan) was that he could
recognize their faces if he could see them again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further said that he did not get near the
policemen investigating the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Federico Moulic described the person who hit the victim as tall
and thin with an oblong face, and said that it was the accused-appellant
Salvador Peruelo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also described the
one who stabbed the victim as small and dark.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He looked at the faces in the courtroom.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were many of them, but he said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"the person is not here, sir."</p>

<p class="BODY">On Federico Moulic's testimony, the trial court, concluded:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the pertinent evidence, this Court must convict.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution had established guilt beyond
reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>But then, the crime proven is that of Murder, not Robbery with
Homicide, as charged in the Information.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For so it is that evidence is wanting on the fact that the main
intention was to rob and on the occasion thereof, death resulted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, Alex de Guzman's death was directly
attributable to Salvador Peruelo's acts of concerted aggression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Federico Moulic's testimony in this regard is
credibly believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Doubtlessly, there
was treachery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The attack was suddenly
made at night and with use of superior strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alex de Guzman had no way to effectively
repel, much less, evade the aggression.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the odds were against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is inconsequential that Federico Moulic only formally submitted
his version of the incident on July 24, 1978.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibits 'B' and series).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">For </span>so it is that as early as May 9,
1973, Salvador Peruelo was already <span style="">named
as one among the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits
'E' and series).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, an extensive
investigation could not be achieved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Salvador Peruelo was nowhere to be found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the warrants of arrest served at his
known residence were unavailing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, for this reason, this case was archived on March 20, 1975.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Even more, on the day after October 18, 1971, Ludovico Moulic
already made known to Maasin, Mangaldan Barangay Captain Gubatan that he could
estab­lish the assailants' identity in a confrontation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So that, when on July 24, 1978, Salvador
Peruelo, while under detention because of this case, was identified, there was
no reason for him to complain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibits
'C' and series).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, Federico
Moulic was never shown to entertain an evil motive to implicate Salvador
Peruelo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, his coming
forward days immediately upon Salvador Peruelo's detention, should be
commended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It may be that, under the evidence, Salvador Peruelo hit Alex de
Guzman at the back, not stab the victim, as charged in the Information.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then, cons­piracy was alleged and
proven.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For Salvador Peruelo was in the
company of Demetrio Runez at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So that, the act of one is that of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More so that evidence along this line never
met any serious objections <span style="">from
Salvador Peruelo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even when Demetrio
Runez was </span>named in the Amended Information, Salvador Peruelo never made
the slightest outcry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since then,
Demetrio Runez similarly evaded arrest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the findings of the trial court on the credibility of
witnesses would not normally be disturbed, in deference to the trial court's
peculiar advantage of having observed in the first instance, the demeanor or
deportment of the witnesses in giving their testi<span style="">mony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it has been
consistently held that this rule of appre­ciation of evidence must yield to the
superior and immutable rule that the guilt of the accused must be proved beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is fundamental that
an accused is presumed innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
this presumption must prevail unless overturned by competent and credible
proof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Evidence to be believed must be credible in itself such as the
common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the
circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this, the testimony of
Federico Moulic the only person who was supposed to have witnessed the
commission of the crime must be tested.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was said that upon hearing a shout, Federico Moulic went out
of his hut, directly to its source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At a
distance of ten meters, he focused his flashlight at the source.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, then, by the beam of his flashlight, <span style="">Moulic </span>watched the unfolding of a
violent assault, allegedly by Salvador Peruelo and Demetrio Runez upon the
helpless <span style="">victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Moulic's story was </span>just
too pat to be true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No man in his normal
wits would deliberately approach and view a violent assault being perpetrated
by armed assailants, knowing that <span style="">he himself was </span>actually exposed <span style="">to </span>the danger of being seen by them <span style="">and risk </span><span style="">possible </span>liquidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, yet there was Moulic, unfliching even as
he focused his flashlight <span style="">on what<span style=""> </span></span>the culprits apparently
preferred to <span style="">commit </span>in the dark.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally strange - the culprits seemed unmindful that as they
inflicted the fatal blows upon the victim, they were being watched by <span style="">a p</span>robable eye-witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Following
</span>Moulic's <span style="">story, though, one of </span>them
shouted at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, what did Moulic
allegedly do?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When shouted at, he shut
off his flashlight and even went nearer the culprits, then moved backward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moulic, then saw the culprits tie the victim,
and thereafter, leave with the latter's tricycle.</p>

<p class="BODY">It could be seen that Moulic's behavior was utterly unusual He
could have sounded a bit credible, if he said he ran away from the scene as
fast as he could.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, to compound it
all, this witness only betrayed himself when he said he shut off his flashlight
and still saw the culprits tying the victim and then took his tricycle.</p>

<p class="BODY">If indeed Moulic had seen the entire fateful scenario, would it
not be natural for him to approach the victim after the culprits had left?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead he calmly walked back to his hut,
slept until the next morning, as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, Federico Moulic claimed that he recognized the assail­ants
and described them in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He thus
pointed at Salvador Peruelo as the tall and thin man with an oblong face who
hit the victim with a blunt instrument.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted that this witness was testifying after more
than eight years from the fateful evening of October 18, 1971, which was the
first time he allegedly saw the assailants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If this witness had indeed recognized the malefactors there appears no
reason why he kept silent for such a length of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The natural tendency of an eye-witness to a crime is to report
it, and to describe the malefactors to the authorities, at the earliest
possible opportunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to
Moulic's uncorroborated story, he had that opportunity when at 6:30 o'clock of
October 19, 1971, he went to the scene of the crime where he saw Maasin By.
Captain Atong Gubatan and some policemen investigating the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Moulic <span style="">did not even approach the police investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be recalled that for some time after
the finding of de Guzman's dead body, the police had no clue at all as to the
slaying of the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found it sufficient that Moulic had made known to
By. Captain Gubatan that he (Moulic) "could establish the assail<span style="">ants' identity in a confrontation." But
if this witness had indeed recognized the culprits, why did he not describe
their appearance </span>to the proper authorities, i.e. the police?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His behaviour was unusual for a man who
claimed to have witnessed a startling occurrence the previous night and to have
recognized the evil-doers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If after a
few hours from the occurrence Moulic did not describe the assailants to the
authorities, could he now be believed when he described them during the trial
after more than eight years?</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, what is at once revealing of Moulic's incredibility is
his claim that appellant Salvador Peruelo struck the victim at the back of the
head with a blunt instrument, when Dr. Numeriano Presto who autopsied the
victim's body on October 19, 1971, categorically declared that the only wound
he found on <span style="">the victim's body was the
fatal stab wound on the abdomen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To our mind, Federico Moulic's unconvincing and unreliable
testimony failed to link appellant Salvador Peruelo to the killing of Alex de
Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A </span>conviction based on this testimony alone, must perforce be
reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither did Exhibit "E" (the two-page sworn statement
of Demetrio Runez) strengthen the case of the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The statement was nothing but hearsay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not serve as proof of the facts
asserted therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Runez, the affiant was
not presented in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, Salvador
Peruelo against whom the statement was admitted in evidence, was not given an
opportunity to cross examine him thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, the prosecution made up for its failure to present
Demetrio Runez, by presenting Sgt. Pedro Landingan of the Dagupan City Police
who allegedly took Runez' affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Landingan testified that Runez admitted to him that he (Runez) and
Salvador Peruelo assaulted the victim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But Landingan's testimony was double hearsay and does not deserve even a
slightest consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Attached to the records, Exh. "E" is but a valueless
scrap of paper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately it
influenced the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in its appreciation of Moulic's
credibility, (Quoted decision, <u>supra.</u>) It also served as the basis of
the information filed against the accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, it is noted that Demetrio Runez was not arrested in
connection with this case, despite his having allegedly executed Exhibit
"E".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the whole this only
points to the weakness of the case of the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It must also be stressed
that no motive was shown for the killing </span>of Alex de Guzman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True, motive need not be proved where the
killer has been positively identified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But where, as in this case, the identification <span style="">is extremely tenuous, proof of motive is essential and the prosecution
has shown none.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Salvador Peruelo testified as to his actual situs when the
deceased was killed in Maasin, Mangaldan, Pangasinan that eve­ning of October
18, 1971.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was attending a birthday
celebration of his nephew, Jesus Peruelo, Jr. in Otero, Mabayuan, Olongapo
City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Peruelo was amply corroborated by
his wife Conchita Ocampo, a brother Generoso Peruelo and a neighbor who went
with him to the birthday party, Herminigildo Liganad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And, the certificate of live birth of Jesus
Peruelo, Jr. (Exh. "2") showing that he was born on October 18, 1970,
supported Salvador's claim that October 18, 1971 was his nephew's birth
anniversary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that alibi is a weak defense which an accused can
easily fabricate to escape criminal liability.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But where prosecution evidence is weak, and betrays lack of reliability
as to the identification of the defendant, alibi assumes commensurate
strength.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is but consistent with
the presumption of innocence in favor of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted, that the prosecution did
not even attempt to show that it was possible for the accused to have been at
the place of the crime in Pangasinan, either before or after the time he was in
Olongapo City.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the guilt of the accused not having been proved
beyond reasonable doubt, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>
