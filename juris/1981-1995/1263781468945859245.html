				<H3>PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. ALBERTO OPIDA Y QUIAMBAO AND VIRGILIO MARCELO, ACCUSED-APPELLANTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an automatic review of the Decision of the Circuit Criminal Court, Seventh Judicial District, imposing the death penalty upon Alberto Opida and Virgilio Marcelo for the crime of murder.<br><br>Unlike the victim in this case, who died from only one stab wound, the decision under review suffers from several fatal flaws, all equally deadly.&nbsp; It suffices to discuss only one of them.<br><br>Time and again this Court has declared that due process requires no less than the cold neutrality of an impartial judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Bolstering this requirement, we have added that the judge must not only be impartial but must also appear to be impartial, to give added assurance to the parties that his decision will be just.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> The parties are entitled to no less than this, as a minimum guaranty of due process.&nbsp; This guaranty was not observed in this case.<br><br>On July 31, 1976, in Quezon City, several persons ganged up on Fabian Galvan, stoned and hit him with beer bottles until finally one of them stabbed him to death.&nbsp; The actual knife-wielder was identified as Mario del Mundo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Nonetheless, Alberto Opida and Virgilio Marcelo were charged with murder as conspirators and, after trial, sentenced to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The basis of their conviction by the trial court was the testimony of two prosecution witnesses, neither of whom positively said that the accused were at the scene of the crime, their extrajudicial confessions, which were secured without the assistance of counsel, and corroboration of the alleged conspiracy under the theory of interlocking confessions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>What is striking about this case is the way the trial judge conducted his interrogation of the two accused and their lone witness, Lilian Layug.&nbsp; It was hardly judicious and certainly far from judicial, at times irrelevant, at worst malicious.&nbsp; Reading the transcript, one gathers the impression that the judge had allied himself with the prosecution to discredit at the outset the cre­dibility of the witnesses for the defense.<br><br>Opida is a police character, admittedly a member of the Commando gang and with a string of convictions for robbery, theft and vagrancy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> It is worth noting that the judge took special interest in his tattoos, required him to remove his shirt so they could be examined, and even described them in detail for the record.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>Besides belaboring Opida's, criminal activities and his tattoos, the judge asked him if he had "ever been convicted at the National Mental Hospital" - with what else but malice? - and suggested to him that his claim of manhandling by the police was a lie because investigators leave no mark when they torture a suspect.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> This was a point that could have been validly raised by the prosecution but certainly not by the court.&nbsp; The judge also made it of record that the witness was gnashing his teeth; was showing signs of hostility, that he was uneasy, and that he was restless.&nbsp; "Now, whom do you want to fool," the judge asked, "the prosecutor, your lawyer, or the court?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>In the hearing of September 22, 1976, the interrogation of Virgilio Marcelo, the other accused, was conducted almost wholly by the judge who started cross-examining the witness even before the defense counsel could ask his first question, and took over from the prosecu­tion the task of impeaching Marcelo's credibility.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> The judge asked him about his drug addiction, his membership in the Commando gang, his tattoos, his parentage, his activities, his criminal record - all when he was supposed to be under direct examination by his own lawyer.&nbsp; Defense counsel could hardly put in a word edgewise because the judge kept interrupting to ask his own questions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>The questions were not clarificatory but adversary; and when they were not adversary, they were irrelevant, and sometimes also cruel.&nbsp; At one point, the judge drew from the witness the statement that his mother was living with another man; forthwith he suggested that the mother was unfaithful to his father.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> We deplore this sadistic treatment of the witness, especially as, for all his supposed "toughness," he could not answer back.&nbsp; We fail to see what possible connection the mother's infidelity could have had, by any stretch of the imagination, with the instant prosecution.<br><br>But the judge was to save the best - or worst - of his spite for the third witness, Lilian Layug, a waitress in the restaurant where the appellant Opida was working as a cook.&nbsp; Noting at the outset that she spoke English, he wanted to know where she had learned it and asked in ill-concealed insinuation if she had worked in Angeles City or Olongapo or Sangley.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Because she was gesturing nervously, he asked, "Are you a conductor?"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> Of the two accused, he asked her, "They are very proud of belonging to the Commando gang?" - to which the witness answered, putting him in his place, "That I do not know, Your Honor."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>One cannot but note the mockery in the following questions put by the judge to the witness, who was probably wondering what the interrogation was all about:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td

"<br><br>I had stressed in another case that the plain mandate of the constitutional provision expressly adopted the exclusionary rule as the only practical means of enforcing the constitutional injunction against uncounselled confessions obtained in violation of one's constitutional rights by outlawing their admission in court.&nbsp; The outlawing of such confessions thereby removed the incentive on the part of military or police officers to disregard such basic constitutional rights, in the same manner that the exclusionary rule bars admission of illegally seized evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>This fundamental rule that the court that rendered the judgment or before whom the case is pending is ousted of jurisdiction upon showing of deprivation of a basic constitutional right was eroded during the past authoritarian regime.&nbsp; I hail its vigorous restatement in the<i> ponencia</i> of Mr. Justice Isagani A. Cruz.<br><br><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="left"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 121 SCRA 472, 522, 531.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> <i>Gumabon vs. Director of Prisons, </i>37 SCRA 420, 427.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> <i>Conde vs. Diaz,</i> 45 Phil. 173.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> <i>Magtoto vs. Manguera,</i> 63 SCRA 4, 29.</div>
