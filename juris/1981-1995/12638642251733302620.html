of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Before their termination, private respondents Norberto S. <span class="SpellE">Merto</span>, Jr. and <span class="SpellE">Fermin</span> T. <span class="SpellE">Baure</span> worked as manager and assistant manager,
respectively, in petitioner-company's port department in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Surigao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in January 1983, an investigation was conducted by
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> V. Villalobos,
petitioner-company's internal auditor, regarding the operations at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span>private respondents' department.</p>

<p class="BODY">The investigation uncovered certain irregularities for which the
private respondents together with their Port Section Head, <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, were made responsible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The irregularities basically pertained to
alterations and discrepancies in the port operations logbook concerning the
utilization of and rental payment for the <span class="SpellE">Uraga</span>
Lorain crane being leased from one Alfredo S. Chua for port operations in the
private respondents' department.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1983</st1:date>,
the private respondents through separate memoranda issued by petitioners
Albrecht Bake and Noel R. Tan were made to explain their involvement in the
reported irregularities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Merto</span>, he was made to account for
the representation he made that "the crane was at stand-by time despite
(his) knowledge and consent of the fact that said crane was being utilized by
the Philippine Ports Authority (PPA) for the removal and driving of fender
piles at the government pier" for which rental payments were made to Chua <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">28th </span>and 29th of November and on the 16th <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">up </span>to the 21st of December 1982.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Baure</span>, he was made to clarify the alterations in the port
operations logbook relating to the incidents of August 1st up to the 6th and
August 12th, 1982 where "the original entries of either 'breakdown' or
'out-of-order' were clearly superimposed with the words 'standby' in bigger and
bolder letters" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>where,
as in <span class="SpellE">Merto's</span> case, rental payments were given to
Chua.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the said memoranda, a provision
for the preventive suspension of the private respondents was further
included.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Ybud</span> was assigned to handle the duties of the private
respondents while they were on preventive suspension.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1983</st1:date>,
both the private respondents wrote separate explanation letters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Merto</span> stated that
his actions were in accordance with the provisions of the crane contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His letter reads as follows:</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left:2.0in;text-indent:0in">Hereunder is my
explanation to your Feb. 7 memo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
actions I took were in accordance with the provisions of the crane contract
(attached) executed by the Company on <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1982</st1:date>, as follows:</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left:2.0in;text-indent:0in">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 5 of said contract guarantees the
crane owner a minimum 7 hours daily rental irrespective of whether the unit is
used or not.</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left:2.0in;text-indent:0in">I do not think it is the
intention of the company to deprive the crane owner that right if the latter
was able to make use equal number of crane time in his performing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>private work contract, i.e. PPA work,
which he is expressly allowed to do.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left:2.0in;text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph 4 of the same
contract, all crane <span class="GramE">owner</span> to perform private
contractual work using the same contract unit.</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left:2.0in;text-indent:0in">Because of this tolerance
granted by the company to the crane owner, the stand by location station of the
contract unit has to be made silent (unspecified) in the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contracting parties understood from the
very beginning that the standby location station of the crane may at any time
be at the owner's place, or any other place where it can be conveniently called
upon and immediately for use but never envisioned to be always at <span class="SpellE">Portsite</span> to enable the crane owner to qualify to have
earned the stipulated guaranteed minimum daily rental.</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left:2.0in;text-indent:0in">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pertaining FTB and LDB, my investigation
disclosed that the superimpositions were done to rectify some deficiencies of
the log book entries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to why
company's option to utilize rented crane during its standby hours was not
exercised, I have gathered the facts that our crane was then perfectly working
well and use of option was considered not necessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Baure</span> disclaimed any
direct participation in the irregularities and justified the erasures in the
logbook in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>, <st1:date year="1983" day="8" month="2">February 8, 1983</st1:date></blockquote>

should be taken against me for apparent involvement on the matters mentioned
therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to case No.
1 of your letter, I wish to state that I have no knowledge whatsoever nor did I
participate in allowing the use of the crane by the Philippine Ports Authority
during the periods comprising November 28 and 29 and December 16-21, inclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. N. S. <span class="SpellE">Merto</span>
whose signatures appear on the statements is in the best position to explain
this matter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In case No. 2 the
original entry of either ‘breakdown' or 'out-of-order' during the period August
1-6 and 12, 1982 as appearing in the Port Operations Logbook is not entirely
accurate as the crane was at standby time at the <span class="SpellE">portsite</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, during the period there were
instances when the crane was checked up for minor mechanical defect to keep it
always in a very good running condition but those brief instances of mechanical
check-up might have occurred in the mind of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span>
D. <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> when he amended the original entries in the
Port Operations Logbook to conform to the truth and the fact that the crane was
neither 'out-of-order' or 'broken down' but on standby time and in good working
condition at the <span class="SpellE">portsite</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As regards case No. 3, I feel that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Mr. </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span> is competent to explain the
entries attributed to him in the Port Operations Logbook.</blockquote>

<blockquote>May I include in this
explanation that I have served this company for 18 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

pioneers, I have always treasured my position the way I treasure my life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now that I am nearing the period of my
retirement, it would be the highest of irresponsibility for me to exchange my
position for anything that would stain my clean record and leave a stigma upon
my honor and that of family.</blockquote>

satisfaction.</blockquote>

preventive suspension when they brought their case before the Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In connection therewith, the petitioners
invoked Sec. 3, Rule XIV of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code, as
amended, which states that:</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that pending investigation on the alleged
irregularities committed by the private respondents the petitioners can order
that the latter be placed under preventive suspension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the petitioners failed to comply
with the succeeding section of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
provision which mandates that:</p>

may extend the period of suspension provided that during the period of

benefits due to the worker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such
case, the worker shall not be bound to reimburse the amount paid to him during
the extension if the employer decides, after completion of the hearing, to
dismiss the worker." (Underlining ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that when the private respondents filed complaints
with the NLRC Arbitration Branch, the company investigation was still going <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>and no official decision to
terminate them had been issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary, however, to the petitioners' claim that the private
respondents were merely preventively suspended the evidence shows that an
advertisement for applicants to the position of Port Manager (<span class="SpellE">Merto's</span> designation) appeared in the January-February 1983
issue of the Pacific Cement Perspective, a bi-monthly publication of the
petitioner-company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Company had made
up its mind to dismiss them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records
further establish the fact that the person directly responsible for the alterations
in the port operations logbook, <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span> <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, was reinstated to his former position after serving
a 15-day suspension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Up to the time that
the Labor Arbiter handed down its decision in 1984 the petitioners had not been
able to take any official action concerning the cases of <span class="SpellE">Merto</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baure</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, there is no doubt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that </span>the
private respondents are deemed dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The issue is - was the dismissal illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an oft-repeated pronouncement in Labor
cases with respect to the termination of employment that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> (w)<span class="SpellE">hile</span> the right to dismiss or lay-off an employee is

<p class="BODY">There is an element of unfairness in the actions taken by the
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Luisito</span>

character of the petitioner-company's plant-level investigation.</p>

"the determination of the existence and sufficiency of just cause must be
exercised with fairness and in good faith and after observing due
process".</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the test of our review authority is grave abuse of
discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts ascertained by the
public respondent and, the arguments raised by the petitioners do not show
manifestly reversible error on the part of the NLRC which is clearly equivalent
to grave abuse of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the crane was on company stand-by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">time </span>or working for the Philippine
Ports Authority on a private contract of the owner, Pacific Cement would still
pay the minimum seven hours daily rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is nothing in this petition to show that the private respondents
made any money or otherwise profited from the alterations in the company's
operations' logbook.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prejudice to
Pacific Cement is likewise not clear because the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">crane </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Mr. </span>Chua
could be pulled out of the PPA project area and brought to the company's port
area anytime there was a need to use it for port operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The penalty of dismissal is unduly harsh
under the circumstances and to that extent the termination of employment
becomes illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>error,
however, for the NLRC to order reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Messrs. </span><span class="SpellE">Merto</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span class="SpellE">Baure</span> are the manager and assistant manager respectively of

managers, especially those assigned to regional or branch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">operations, </span>cannot operate freely in a
competitive and profitable manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
NLRC should know the difference between managers and ordinary workingmen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot imprudently order the reinstatement
of managers with the same ease and liberality as if it were dealing with
laborers or rank and file workers who have been terminated in their employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that there is some basis for the petitioners to
be mistrustful of the loyalty and dedication of the private respondents to
Pacific Cement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even then, the relations
between the respondents and the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>
top brass were no longer in the same category as those with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mr. </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span>
who was pardoned and accepted back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no question <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">about
the relations now.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No prejudice may have been caused the petitioners by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">altered </span>entries in the company
logbooks but it still does not spea<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">k</span>
well of a manager to state that a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>leased
equipment is on company stand-by when the truth is it was being used elsewhere <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>somebody else.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A manager worth his title and position should
not carelessly place "break-down" or "out-of-order" for a
crane which is on company stand-by.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
the need for mechanical check-ups does not warrant an entry of breakdown or out-of-order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The company has a right to expect precision
and accuracy in entries on company records from its managers. </p>

<p class="BODY">For the above reasons, we find the awards of damages and
attorneys' fees unwarranted because the private respondents are not completely
without fault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">The </span>fact that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Mr. </span><span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, the manager primarily
responsible for the alterations, was meted out only 15 days suspension does not
clear the respondents completely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
a company prerogative to choose who to appoint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">or reappoint </span>as its managers as long as arbitrary prejudice is
not thereby caused, without reason, to those who are not so chosen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No damages or attorney's fee should be paid.</p>
