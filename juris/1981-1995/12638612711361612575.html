				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">This is an appeal from
the decision dated July 3, 1968 of the then Court of First Instance (CFI) of
Manila in Civil Case No. 69345 dismissing plaintiff's suit to annul the One
Hundred Thirty-Six (P136) Million Peso contracts entered into by the Republic
of the Philippines with three (3) American corporations as well as the letters of
credit issued <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> and to restrain their
enforcement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The undisputed facts as
found by the trial court are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 4, 1967, the defendant Commissioner of Public Highways
in behalf of the Republic of the Philippines hereinafter referred to as
Republic, entered into two separate contracts with defendant Continental Ore
(Phil.), Inc., the latter acting as representative of Huber Corporation in the
first contract and as agent of Allis-Chalmers International and General Motors
Corporation in the second.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first contract, the Republic obligated itself to pay to
Huber Corporation the sum of US$13,387,170.23 in the form of irrevocable,
confirmed and divisible letters of credit in favor of Continental Ore
Corporation, <st1:address><st1:street>500 Fifth Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">New </span>York</st1:city></st1:address> or
its nominees, for the purchase of road construction equipment and spare
parts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The shipment of said goods shall
begin one to twelve months after the acceptance of the letters of credit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second contract provided that for and in consideration of
US$21,077,314.84, which the Republic obligated itself to pay to Continental Ore
Corp. (New York) in the form of irrevocable, confirmed and divisible letters of
credit, Allis-Chalmers International and General Motors Corporation would sell,
transfer and convey to the Republic road construction equipment and spare parts
under the same terms and conditions stated in the first contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both contracts were duly approved by the defendant Secretary of
Public Works and Communications and the Auditor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon prior application by the Bureau of Public Highways for the
establishment of letters of credit in the aggregate sum of US$13,387,170.23,
defendant Philippine National Bank (PNB) wrote the Bureau of Public Highways
approving said application provided that said accommodation be secured by the
guaranty of the national government to be given by the Secretary of Finance
upon written approval by the Office of the President and that said letters of
credit be opened in favor of the defendant Huber Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1967</st1:date>,
the Secretary of Finance requested the Office of the President for approval of
the guaranty of the letters of credit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in
</span>favor of Huber Corporation, which request was favorably acted upon the
following day.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 9, 1967, the PNB informed the Bureau <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>Public Highways that it had
recommended the approval by its Board <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Directors of the </span>Bureau's
application for the opening of another irrevocable, confirmed and divisible
letters of credit in favor of General Motors Corporation and Allis-Chalmers
International, provided that said accommodation be likewise secured by a
guaranty from the national government to be given by the Secretary of Finance
upon written approval of the Office of the President.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in the first application, the Executive Secretary, by
authority of the President, directed the Secretary of Finance to extend the
necessary guaranty for the letters of credit in favor of General Motors
Corporation and Allis-Chalmers International in the amount of US$21,077,214.84.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the guaranty was extended by the
Secretary of Finance on <st1:date year="1967" day="15" month="2">February 15,
 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 27, 1967, plaintiff Ramon A. Gonzales, as taxpayer and
later as stockholder of the PNB, filed before the CFI of Manila Civil Case No.
69345 praying for the annulment of the contracts of sale and for the issuance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>a writ of preliminary injunction to
restrain their enforcement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on </span>the
ground that these contracts of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">sale, </span>accommodation
and letters of credit are illegal for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of Sections 606, 607 and 608 of the Revised Administrative Code for want of
appropriation by law and certification as to the availability of funds by the
Auditor General and for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the PNB
Charter since the accommodation or loan to the Republic is beyond the lending
capacity of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Secretary of Public Works and Communications and the
Commissioner of Public Highways filed their answers admitting substantially the
factual allegations of the complaint but raising several affirmative defenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1967</st1:date>,
plaintiff filed a motion to declare Huber Corporation, Allis-Chalmers
International and General Motors Corporation in default for failure to file
their answers within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, defendants Secretary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>Public Works and Communication and
Commissioner of Public Highways asked the court to set for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hearing their affirmative defenses as grounds
for a motion to dismiss.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">PNB filed its answer,
likewise expressly admitting the principal facts of the complaint and
interposing affirmative defenses and praying that said affirmative defenses be
set for hearing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 1,
 1967</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the motion for
preliminary injunction was denied, the motion for default was granted and the
motions to dismiss the complaint were deferred for determination until trial on
the merits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After a full-blown trial,
the lower court dismissed the complaint together with the counter-claim with
costs on </span><st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 13.0pt">July 3, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal by the plaintiff-appellant
on the following legal issues:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

15.0pt;margin-left:0in">IV.</p>

<blockquote>Whether letters of credit are loans and have exceeded the statutory
limit thereof and the requirement of collateral.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the first assigned error, plaintiff-appellant posits that
the questioned contracts of sale, accommodations and letters of credit are
illegal:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) under Sections 606, 607 and
608 of the Revised Administrative Code for want of appropriation law and certification
as to the availability of funds by the Auditor General and (b) under the PNB
Charter as the accommodation or loan to the Republic is allegedly beyond the
lending capacity of the PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The </span>lower court
ruled in the negative for the reason that the contracts under consideration did
not "involve directly the expenditure of public funds for they (did) not
require the immediate payment by the government of funds out of its treasury,
but rather (for) a financing scheme or arrangement with the Philippine National
Bank un<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">d</span>er different laws."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are inclined to agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sections 606 and 607 of the Revised Administrative Code read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 606.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appropriation antecedent to making of
contract.- No contract involving the expenditure of public funds shall be made
until there is an appropriation <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, the
unexpended balance of which, free of other obligations, is sufficient to cover
the proposed expenditure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This provision
shall not, however, be construed to prevent the purchasing and carrying of supplies
in stock, under the regulations of the Bureau of Audits, provided that when
issued such supplies shall be charged to the proper appropriation account.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sec. 607.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certificate showing appropriation to meet
contracts.- Except in the case of a contract for personal service or for
supplies to be carried in stock, no contract involving an expenditure by the
insular government of three thousand pesos or more shall be entered into or
authorized until the Insular Auditor shall have certified to the officer entering
into such obligation that funds have been duly appropriated for such purpose
and that the amount necessary to cover the proposed contract is available for
expenditure to account thereof<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above provisions of the Administrative Code are without
question an implementation of Art. VI, Sec. 23, Clause 2 of the 1935
Constitution then applicable, which provides that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"No money shall be paid out of the
Treasury except in pursuance of an appropriation made by law." Said
provision was restated <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u>, in Art. VIII,
Sec. 18 of the 1973 Constitution and in Art. VI, Sec. 29 of the New
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a strict sense, <u>appropriation</u> has been defined "as
nothing more than the legislative authorization prescribed by the Constitution
that money may be paid out of the Treasury", while <u>appropriation made
by law</u> refers to "the act of the legislature setting apart or
assigning to a particular use a certain sum to be used in the payment of debt
or dues from the State to its creditors."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the premise, therefore, that no money can be taken out of the
treasury without an appropriation,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the decisive issue in this case is what constitutes compliance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with </span>the Constitution and Sections
606, 607 and 608 of the Administrative Code where the total governmental expenditure
involves partial payments <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">or </span>disbursements
of funds to run for a number of years.</p>

<p class="BODY">As early as the year 1934, this Court, under similar
circumstances, had laid this issue to rest.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A Contract between <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Electric Co.,
Inc. and the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>public street lighting service to
run for a period of ten (10) years and involving a monthly payment of P202.50
was assailed on the ground that the Municipal Council of <span class="SpellE">Imus</span>
approved the same without having the necessary funds to pay for the value of
the service to be rendered by the <span class="SpellE">Imus</span> Electric Co.
for a period of ten years and without the provincial treasurer's previous
certificate to the effect that said funds have been appropriated and were
available.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said contract was therefore
allegedly in violation of Sections 606, 607 and 608 of the Revised
Administrative Code of 1917, particularly because the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Imus</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
appropriated funds for a period of six (6) months only.</p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving the issue, this Court ruled that while it is true
that the duration of the contract was fixed at ten (10) years, a period which
was accepted by the municipality, it is also true that under the terms of the
contract, and the law, the municipality was not bound to make advance payments
and consequently, there was no reason for it to appropriate funds for the said
public service except for a period of one month or one year at most, if it had
sufficient funds in order to comply with the provisions of Section 2296 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the Revised Administrative Code
which requires that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">municipalities </span>should
at the beginning of every year, make a general appropriation containing the
probable expenses which they would have to incur.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it was held that the contract in
question is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>conflict with
the provisions of Sections 607 and 608 of said Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>Otherwise stated, appropriation must
be made only on amounts immediately demandable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above doctrine is no less applicable to the case at bar,
despite the magnitude of the government's needs and investments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that the questioned
contracts constitute a negotiated sale on credit where the Bureau of Public
Works is not required to make direct or immediate payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without abandoning the constitutional and legal safeguards
against the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">indiscriminate </span>disbursements
of public funds, this Court takes judicial notice of the imperatives of
national development that demand immediate implementation of programs, the
funding of which cannot be appropriated simply because there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">are </span>no sufficient funds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">That there was no deviation, much less a violation of Article VI,
Section 29 of the Constitution and of Sections 606, 607 and 608 of the Revised
Administrative Code, is readily apparent in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"> </span>the enactment of Republic Act No. 4680, which provides among
others:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The President
of the Philippines is hereby authorized in behalf of the Republic of the
Philippines to contract such loans, credits and indebtedness with foreign
governments, agencies or instrumentalities of such foreign governments, foreign
financial institutions, or other international organizations, with whom or
belonging to countries with which the Philippines has diplomatic relations, as
may be necessary and upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon, to
enable the Government of the Philippines to finance, either directly or through
any government office, agency or instrumentality or any government-owned, or
controlled corporation, industrial, agricultural or other economic development
purposes or projects authorized by law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> ."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 6 of said law further provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Congress
shall appropriate the necessary amount out of any funds in the National
Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to cover the payment of the principal and
interest on such loans, credits or indebtedness as and when they shall become
due."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As correctly observed by the trial court,</p>

<blockquote>"Under Republic Act 4860, the Republic is authorized to
procure foreign loans or credits from financial institutions or other
international organiza­tions, upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed
upon for the purpose of financing economic development purposes or projects
authorized by law, including the construction and improvement of highways and
bridges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be noted that, precisely,
Republic Act 4860 authorizes procurement on credit when there are no available
funds or appropriation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 6
thereof provides that ‘Congress shall appropriate the necessary amount to cover
the payment of the principal and interest on such credits as and when they
shall become due.' "<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the questioned contracts are funded by various sources
authorized by law, thereby constituting a standing appropriation or antecedent
appropriation required by Section 606 of the Revised Administrative Code before
execution of contracts involving expenditure of public funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are:</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 6(b)
of R.A. 917, 1% of the annual accrual (about P200 million) to the Highway

<p class="BODY">Thus the annual aggregate of these funds in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">amount </span>of P41.6 million is obviously
more than sufficient to meet the diminishing yearly installments on the
contracts in question ranging from P29,847,049.32 on the first year to

<p class="BODY">More <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">than </span>that,
the foregoing funding program for the repayment of the herein government's
obligations, satisfactorily negates petitioner's fears that private funds

Auditor General can prevent the funds intended for payment of said purchase, if
any, from being diverted to other purposes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the questioned contracts carry the approval
of the Auditor General as may be seen in Exhibits "5" and "53

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second assigned error that the contracts are
void as the three American corporations are not licensed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>do business in the Philippines, we
re-state the generally accepted rule that one single or isolated business
