Case No. 972-17 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch IV, in Batac, Ilocos Norte,
finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and
sentencing him to serve the penalty of life imprisonment and to indemnify the
heirs of the victim in the amount of P30,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In an information filed on August 20, 1981, appellant Ponciano
Agcaoili was charged with murder for having killed a certain Rodrigo Sado with
treachery and evident premeditation, attended by the aggravating circumstance
of nighttime.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon arraignment, appellant pleaded not guilty to the offense charged.  Trial on the merits ensued, after which the
court below rendered the assailed judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged killing took place on the night of December 15, 1977
at Paoay, Ilocos Norte.  The moon was
then shining brightly.  Rodrigo Sado and
a certain Florentino Gamul were walking together, with the latter about two (2)
meters ahead of the former, on their way to a house where they would attend
evening prayers.  Gamul passed by
appellant Agcaoili who was then standing at the left side of the path they were
following.  Thereafter, he heard a
gunshot and, when he looked back, he saw his companion slumped on the
ground.  He immediately ran away for
fear of his own life but, while on his way, he heard two (2) more shots from
behind.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the place where the evening prayers were to be
held, he asked the people who were already there to go to the place where Sado
was shot and to check if he was still alive.  He was later informed that Sado was already dead.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the police authorities received the information in
their headquarters at Paoay, Ilocos Norte, that one Rodrigo Sado was shot and
killed in Barangay No. 6 of the said place.  Pfc. Padayao, together with then Lt. Florentino Dumlao, Pat. Antonio
Arcayna and Pat. Jose Eclipse, went to the scene of the crime and examined the
body of the victim.  The cadaver was
also autopsied and was found to have sustained several gunshot wounds.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After being informed that the victim was with Florentino Gamul
when the killing occurred, the police officers investigated him and learned
that Sado was shot by one Ponciano Agcaoili.  The officers then secured a search warrant and searched the house of
said Agcaoili.  In the course of the
search, they were able to recover eight (8) live .45 caliber bullets and one
(1) complete adjustable cleaning rod with cloth used in cleaning a gun.  These items were turned over to Camp Juan in
Laoag City.  Appellant Agcaoili was
apprehended later on that day, December 16, 1977, and was committed in the same
camp.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony, appellant denied the accusation against
him.  He averred that at around the same
time when the killing occurred, he was sleeping in their house located at
Madanay, Ilocos Norte.  He was awakened
only the following day when he was apprehended by two (2) police officers.  He was brought to the municipal building and
was detained inside the stockade.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellant assails the decision of the trial court
(1) holding him guilty because of the irregularity of the waiver made by him
while he was under custodial investigation; (2) finding that the evidence of
the prosecution reveals that he was the one who shot Rodrigo Sado; and (3)
finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Aside from these arguments, he further contends that, assuming he killed Sado,
he cannot be found guilty of murder for failure of the prosecution to prove the
attendance of treachery and evident premeditation in the commission of the
crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first submission of appellant does not deserve any
consideration.  It is true that the
present Constitution mandates that any person under custodial investigation
shall have the right to remain silent and to have a counsel.  Any waiver shall be made in writing and with
the assistance of a counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant, however, loses sight of the fact that his sworn statement was not
presented in evidence against him by the prosecution.  Even the defense counsel admitted this fact, as shown in the
following testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Atty. Baldres-</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this investigation, was your statement
taken by Pat. Ventura?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>q <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was your statement reduced into writing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>q <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the investigation and at the
time when your statement was taken, were you assisted by a counsel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>q <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did Pat. Ventura tell you that you would be
assisted by a counsel?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Court-</blockquote>

<blockquote>Was the statement
marked as exhibit?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Fiscal-</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is not marked as
exhibit, your Honor.  So may I know what
is the purpose?  We did not use that as
evidence, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Atty. Baldres-</blockquote>

<blockquote>I withdraw my
question."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the second and the third contentions of the
appellant, the same are apparently premised on the failure of the prosecution
to prove the motive of Agcaoili and to present the weapon used in the alleged killing.  We are not, however, persuaded by
appellant's invocation of and reliance thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant clearly relies on the discredited defense of alibi <u>cum</u>
denial.  Time and again, the Court has
consistently ruled that alibi, as a defense, is weak because it can easily be
manufactured and fabricated.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
This is especially so if said defense is contradicted by an eyewitness'
testimony.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, appellant was positively identified by witness Gamul as the
one who shot Rodrigo Sado.  There could
not have been any mistake in his identification because the light coming from
the moon was bright enough to enable Gamul to recognize appellant and the place
was clear of obstructions.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, when this witness was first investigated by the police
the day after the killing, he readily and categorically declared as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"13. Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was it a bright night, when Rodrigo Sado
was shot?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.  It was a moonlight (sic) night, and was too bright that's why I
was able to recognize without any doubt that it was PONCIANO AGCAOILI who made
(sic) the shooting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>17. Q  From where you
were when you saw Ponciano Agcaoili shot (sic) Rodrigo Sado, was there not
anything that obstructed your view?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  None, sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is not to forget the fact that Gamul and appellant knew each
other well enough to enable the former to recognize Agcaoili who was only a few
meters away from him during the shooting incident.  Their houses are situated near each other and they often worked
together in the farm.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To consider alibi, it must be shown that it was physically
impossible for appellant to have been at the scene of the crime at the time it
was committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Applying the rule in the case at bar, appellant failed to establish the
same.  It was even shown by the
prosecution that the place where his house is located is just approximately
eight hundred (800) meters away from the scene of the crime.  Being less than a kilometer away, the situs
of the offense can easily be reached in a matter of minutes from his house
where he admittedly was at about that time.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the issue of motive, suffice it to say that,
generally, the motive of the accused in a criminal case is immaterial and, not
being an essential element of a crime, it does not have to be proved.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
How­ever, in some instances, this Court has ruled on the significance and
relevance of the motive of the accused in the commission of an offense.  Thus, when there is no eyewitness and
suspicion is likely to fall on a considerable number of persons;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
when there is doubt as to whether the accused is or is not the person who
committed the offense;<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
where it is necessary to determine the sanity of the accused or the
voluntariness of the criminal act,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
the specific nature of the crime committed,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
or whether the shooting was intentional or accidental;<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
or when the accused invokes self-defense or defense of strangers,<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
motive plays an important role in the prosecution of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts obtaining in the case at bar, nonetheless, show that
the same falls under the general rule.  The motive of appellant in killing Rodrigo Sado does not, therefore,
have to be proved by the People.  There
was an eyewitness to the killing who positively and satisfactorily identified
appellant Agcaoili as the assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that appellant was not subjected to paraffin test is of
no moment because the same is not conclusive as to his complicity in the crime
committed.  The same rule goes for the
failure of the prosecution to present the murder weapon as evidence during the
trial of the case.  This Court, in the
case of <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Gupo,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
had the occasion to rule that such failure does not defeat the cause of the
prosecution considering that, as in this case, the postmortem examination
report<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
established that the wounds sustained by the victim were caused by gunshots,
thus:  "Diagnosis:  Multiple gunshot wounds, secondary to
profuse hemorrhages and destruction of vital organs."</p>

<p class="BODY">The case for the prosecution was further bolstered by the fact
that the police authorities were able to recover eight (8) live .45 caliber
bullets and other paraphernalia for firearms from the residence of appellant
when they conducted the search therein.  The ownership of these recovered items was never refuted by appellant.  Accordingly, the presumption that the things
which a person possesses or exercises acts of ownership over are owned by him,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
squarely applies in the case at bar.  More importantly, they are indicative of the fact that appellant must
have been in possession of a firearm.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with appellant's alternative assumption that, at
most, he could be convicted only of homicide and not of murder.  The proven circumstances of and the weight
of evidence in this case show beyond cavil that treachery attended the killing
of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">With appellant pretending to be merely standing by the trail as
the victim and his companion passed by at close range, with no prior
belligerent move or any act committed by appellant as would give away his
murderous intent, the victim was completely without any premonition of an intended
assault upon his person.  Then, all of a
sudden, as the victim passed abreast, appellant let loose with a firearm,
followed rapidly thereafter with two (2) more successive shots.  Definitely, the victim was never in a
position to defend himself; he was not even able to run away or take any
evasive action as, instead, he was felled and died on the spot.  It would be the height of naivete to assume
that, considering his antecedent, coetaneous and subsequent actuations
vis-a-vis the shooting of the victim, appellant did not consciously and
deliberately adopt the particular means, methods or form of attack to ensure
the consummation of his objective with impunity.  The attack against the victim could not have been the product of
a moment of impulse, since it clearly revealed a pattern of precogitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parts of the victim's anatomy to which appellant directed the
lethal shots<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
further ineluctably reveal and confirm his perfidious and murderous intent and
conduct.  The autopsy report<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
reveals the postmortem findings on the multiple gunshot wounds which resulted
in profuse hemorrhages and destruction of the vital organs of the victim, viz:</p>

<blockquote>"1. Gunshot
wound – </blockquote>

<blockquote>Entered at an
intersectional line - Anterior axilla and a<i> </i>horizontal line more than an
inch above the umbilicus.  Penetrated
the whole abdomen, perforating a few loops of small intestines, the peritoneum
which was bulging out, to exit at a similar point at the right side and
included the right forearm at its upper third, making a thru and thru wound
where it made an exit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Entered at a point, 2 inches at the lateral
side of right arm, above the anticubital fossa, fractured the posterior side of
the elbow joint to make its exit at the elbow tip.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Entered at the left side of the left scapula
to the left shoulder near the base of the neck, where it entered its lateral
side at the level of the chin – scouring the base of the skull and brain,
fractured the left frontal vault to exit outside.  An H-shaped slit breakage was produced at the base of the nose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Entered at the left scapula, at its inferior
angle, directed upwards at the interior border of the achromial process, where
it made an exit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  A semi-linear cut wound, 2 inches long, at
the base of the neck, left side.  It
(is) directed somewhat upwards and corresponding muscle partially cut."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Despite the foregoing established facts, doubt was expressed
during the deliberations in this case as to whether <u>alevosia</u> was proved
by the prosecution to sustain the conviction of appellant for murder.  This doubt was subsequently raised in a
separate opinion and appears to have been engendered by the commentaries and
the case of <u>People vs. Torejas, etc., et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
discussed therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the rudimental doctrine that a qualifying circumstance must be
proved as conclusively as the act which it qualifies, there is no quarrel.  This is not to say, however, that such
quantum of proof can be obtained only from an eyewitness who "actually saw
how the appellant shot the deceased." Such a stricture would seriously
impair, if not render inutile, the validity and utility of circumstantial
evidence as a species of proof.  We do
not have to cite the plethora of cases wherein this Court has considered facts
drawn from circumstantial evidence as conclusive and sufficient for conviction
even in capital offenses.  In fact, the
very commentary cited hastens to add that the need to prove the manner in which
the victim was attacked is called for "(w)here no particulars are known as
to the manner in which the aggression was made nor how the act which resulted
in the death of the deceased began and developed." That is not the
situation here.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the preceding discussion, the attendant details immediately
before, during and after the murderous assault are fully explained.  The only fault attributed in the separate
opinion is that at the precise moment when appellant was shot, the eyewitness
had just passed by appellant and the victim was two (2) meters behind the
witness when suddenly fired upon, hence, the witness could not have seen that
split-second occurrence which was completely unexpected by both the eyewitness
and the victim.  In view of what will
hereafter be contrasted with this case, we emphasize the fact that no bellicose
demeanor was exhibited by appellant and no exchange of words transpired between
him and the victim at any time before the first and obviously fatal shot was
fired.  Otherwise, such conduct or
statements would have been observed or heard by the eyewitness and testified to
by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Immediately after the shot, the witness turned around and saw the
victim slumped on the ground.  There was
no other person at or around the scene of the crime, nor has the defense even
intimated otherwise.  The eyewitness
then fled therefrom as two more shots rang out.  Now, we believe that an eyewitness account of the appellant in
the very act of shooting the victim under these circumstances is a virtual
impossibility.  To require such
eyewitness evidence would be to completely disregard the unrefuted
circumstantial evidence that can but point to only one conclusion, which is
definitely not a mere assumption or conjecture.</p>

<p class="BODY">The discussion in <u>Torejas</u> on whether treachery was present
therein actually turned on the issue of credibility of the eyewitness.  Also, as earlier prefaced, the facts in said
case are at variance with those in the case at bar, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"On what was the finding by the lower court of the qualifying
circumstance of <u>alevosia</u> predicated?   All that appears from the testimony of the lone eyewitness
presented, a certain Federico Rivera, was that while the deceased Dasalla was
lighting a cigarette at the New Life Store, he saw ‘Bonifacio Torejas hit the
head of Artemio Dasalla with a bottle.’ The lower court was able to elicit from
him that at that time he was lifting a sack of palay at the adjacent store of a
certain Julio Marquez, where he was a laborer.  <u>It cannot be certain, then, that all the while he was fully aware of
what transpired between the appellant Bonifacio Torejas and the deceased</u>.  While the lower court's finding that there
was no unlawful aggression from the deceased, it being shown that he was
unarmed, could be given credence, <u>it does not exclude the probability that
there must have been some exchange of words between the two before appellant
Torejas hit the victim with a bottle</u>.  The eyewitness might have seen what was happening, but it does not
follow that he was likewise in a position to hear what was uttered by either
participant on such an occasion.  The
evidence of <u>alevosia</u> was indeed tenuous." (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After the victim in said case had been initially assaulted with
the bottle and, therefore, duly warned and aware of the felonious intent of the
accused, he ran away but was pursued by the accused who, with his bolo, stabbed
the victim to death.  That is why, on
the foregoing sequence of facts, the Court held that "considering the last
words of the conversation between the accused and the deceased, (it) is not
sufficient to hold, with reasonable certainty that the latter was completely
unaware of the attack that might have come from the defendant." Invoking a
series of doctrines, the Court reiterated that "(o)nly then, if the victim
were caught ‘completely unaware and deprived of any chance to ward off the
assault,’ would it be proper to consider the existence of <u>alevosia</u>."
This last stated rule applies to the present case in light of the facts thereof
as earlier presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to prove treachery,
we have, on a similar set of facts and figuratively closer to home, the case of
<u>People vs. Jose Madriaga IV, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
where the Court, through the present Second Division, affirmed the conviction
of appellant therein for murder qualified by treachery.  In said case, the victim, Atty. Antonio G.
Tabora, was inside a cockpit in Rosario, La Union at around 7:00 o'clock in the
evening, after the cockfights were over, when gunshots were suddenly heard and
the victim fell wounded.  He later
expired in the hospital from severe intracranial hemorrhage, secondary to a gunshot
wound.  Nobody even saw who fired the
shot and other successive shots, nor was the direction from which they came
ever established with certitude.  Hence,
as in the present case, nobody "actually saw how the appellant shot the
deceased," much less was there proof of the "manner in which the
victim was attacked." Additionally, the firearm used therein was likewise neither
recovered nor identified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Worse, and this time differing from the case under consideration,
in <u>Madriaga</u> there was the need to establish the identity of the killer
or killers since there was no evidence that the appellant therein was inside or
in the vicinity of the cockpit when the shots were fired.  Here, there is the identification of the
assailant by the witness who was only two (2) meters away from both the
appellant and the victim when the latter was shot.  In fact, the only putative doubt is on the mode or manner by
which the victim was shot by appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">In convicting Madriaga for the treacherous killing, although we
had perforce to also enumerate other circumstances to establish his <u>identity</u>
as the killer, not the presence of treachery, we held that "(o)ur review
and ratiocination based on the entire records and proven facts of this case
yield the inescapable conclusion that the prosecution's evidence, albeit
circumstantial, is of a sufficient quantum to establish the guilt of the
accused.  The catena of circumstances
proven by uncontradicted evidence x x x cannot but convince Us that, in justice
to the victim, a conviction should be decreed." We feel that the same
evidentiary appreciation should equally apply to the present case and dissipate
any doubt on the conclusions reached therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree, however, that the prosecution failed to prove evident
premeditation.  There was insufficient
evidence to establish the time when appellant determined to commit the crime,
or any act manifestly indicating that he clung to his determination, and that
sufficient time intervened between the determination and the execution to
enable him to reflect upon the consequences of his act. <a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PADILLA, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my view that treachery should not be appreciated in the
case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">In considering treachery as attendant to the killing, the
majority reasons out as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“We do not agree with appellant’s alternative assumption that, at
most, he could be convicted only of homicide and not of murder.  The proven circumstances of and the weight
of evidence in this case show beyond cavil that treachery attended the killing
of the victim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“With appellant pretending to be merely standing by the trial as
the victim and his companion passed by at close range, with no prior
belligerent move or any act committed by appellant as would give away his
murderous intent, the victim was completely without any premonition of an
intended assault upon his person.  Then,
all of a sudden, as the victim passed abreast, appellant let loose with a
firearm, followed rapidly there­after with two (2) more successive shots.  Defi­nitely, the victim was never in a
position to defend himself; he was not even able to run away or take any
evasive action as, instead, he was felled and died on the spot.  It would be the height of naivete to assume
that, considering his antecedent, coetaneous and subsequent actuations
vis-a-vis the shooting of the victim, appellant did not consciously and
deliberately adopt the particular means, methods or form of attack to ensure
the consummation of his objective with impunity.  The attack against the victim could not have been the product of
a moment of impulse, since it clearly revealed a pattern of precogi­tation.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Torejas</u>, G.R. No. L-29935, 31
January 1972, 43 SCRA 158, the Court held that <u>alevosia</u> or treachery “is
not to be presumed, but must be proved as conclusively as the act which it
qualifies.” It “can not be held to be present from mere conclusions or
inferences.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, in order that treachery may be appreciated, it is
necessary <u>to</u> <u>prove</u> <u>the</u> <u>manner</u> <u>in</u> <u>which</u>
<u>the</u> <u>victim</u> <u>was</u> <u>attacked</u>.  Where no particulars are known as to the manner in which the
aggression was made nor how the act which resulted in the death of the deceased
began and developed, it can in no way be established from mere suppo­sitions,
drawn from circumstances prior to the very moment of the aggression, that the
accused perpetrated the killing with <u>alevosia</u> (Aquino, Revised Penal
Code, 1976 ed., Vol. I, pp. 359-360).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the evidence for the prosecution shows that
Rodrigo Sado and a certain Florentino Gamul were walking together, with the
latter about two (2) meters ahead of the former, on their way to a house where
they would attend evening prayers; Gamul passed by appellant Agcaoili who was
standing at the left side of the path they were following; thereafter, he heard
a gunshot and, when he looked back, he saw his companion (Sado) slumped on the
ground; he immediately ran away for fear of his own life.  While on his way, he heard two (2) more
shots from behind.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the alleged eyewitness (Gamul) <u>did</u> <u>not</u>
<u>actually</u> <u>see</u> <u>how</u> <u>the</u> <u>appellant</u> <u>shot</u> <u>the</u>
<u>deceased</u>.  Where the manner of
the attack was not proven, the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt
and the crime should be considered homicide only (Aquino, Revised Penal Code,
Vol. I, 1976 ed., p. 360).</p>
