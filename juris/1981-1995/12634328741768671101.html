August 9, 1990 and February 4, 1991 of the Former Twelfth Division of
respondent Court of Appeals in CA­-G.R. No. 26511 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>, Inc. and Antonio M. Garcia, Plaintiffs v.
Philippine Investments Systems Organization, Bank of the Philippine Islands, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Commercial Banking Corporation and Land Bank of the
Philippines, Defendants-Appellants, <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> Export

ordering the consolidation of the said CA-G.R. <span style="">CV </span>No. 26511 with CA­-G.R. No. 20467.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the records that on September 25, 1984, <span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>, Inc. and Antonio M. Garcia filed a civil action
for declaratory relief and/or injunction with preliminary injunction against
Philippine Investments Systems Organization, Bank of the Philippine Islands, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Commercial Banking Corporation, Philippine Commercial
and Industrial Bank (PCIB) and Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP), herein
referred to as CONSORTIUM for brevity, with the Regional Trial Court, Branch
145, <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, Metro Manila, docketed as Civil Case No.
8527 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 297-298).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, CONSORTIUM filed their respective
answers with compulsory counterclaims.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They likewise prayed for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
attachment against <span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>, Inc. and Antonio M.
Garcia (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 298).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1985</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an order, denying the prayer of <span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>,
Inc. and Antonio M. Garcia for preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding sufficient grounds from the evidence
presented, however, the trial court ordered the issuance of a consolidated writ
of preliminary attachment as prayed for by private respondents (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1985</st1:date>, the sheriff assigned to the trial court garnished
various real and personal properties belonging to <span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>,
Inc., and Antonio M. Garcia, including the shares of stock belonging to the
latter in Chemical Industries of the Philippines, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span>, for
brevity) (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 199).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1988</st1:date>,
the trial court issued an order, dismissing the complaint of <span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>, Inc. and Antonio M. Garcia, together with the
counterclaim of CONSORTIUM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this
order, CONSORTIUM appealed to respondent Court of Appeals, docketed as CA-G.R.
CV No. 20467 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>, Inc. and
Antonio M. Garcia, Plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> v. Philippine
Investments Systems Organization, et al., Defendants-Appellants." This
appealed case was assigned to the Ninth Division of respondent Court of Appeals
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 325).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1989</st1:date>
and during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the appeal <span style="">in </span>the aforementioned CA-G.R. CV No.
20467, CONSORTIUM and Antonio M. Garcia entered into a compromise agreement,
which was approved by the Court of Appeals in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By reason thereof, Antonio M. Garcia was
dropped as a party to the appeal, leaving the same to proceed but only insofar
as <span class="SpellE">Dynetics</span>, Inc. is concerned (<u>Ibid</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Antonio M. Garcia, however, failed to comply
with the terms of the said compromise agreement, prompting the CONSORTIUM to
move for execution of the compromise judgment, which was granted by the trial
court <span style="">in an </span>order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="8">August 11, 1989</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., pp.
39, 300).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, several
properties of Antonio M. Garcia were levied upon and sold in execution in favor
of the CONSORTIUM, among which properties were the <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span>
shares of Antonio M. Garcia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
certificate of sale was issued in favor of the CONSORTIUM, the sheriff's return
indicating that the <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> shares which were<b> </b>sold
in execution were the same shares garnished on <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1985</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 39).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1989</st1:date>,
CONSORTIUM filed with the trial court a motion to order the corporate secretary
of <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> to enter in the stock and transfer books
of <span class="SpellE">Chempil</span> the sheriff's certificate of sale dated <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="8">August 22, 1989</st1:date> and to issue new
certificates of stock in the name of the CONSORTIUM (<u>Ibid</u>.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 4, 1989, the trial court issued an order directing
the corporate secretary of <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> to "a)
record and/or register the Certificate of Sale dated August 22, 1989 issued by
the Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Jabson</span>
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>; b) to cancel the
certificate of stocks of plaintiff Antonio M. Garcia and all those which may
have subsequently been issued in replacement thereof; and c) to issue in lieu
of said shares new shares of stock in the name of PCIB, BPI, RCBC, LBP and PISO
Bank in such proportion as their respective claims would appear in their
suit." (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 39-40).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 22, 1989, <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> Export
and Import Corporation (CEIC, for brevity) filed with the trial court an urgent
<u>ex</u>-<span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> motion for leave to <span style="">intervene </span>in Civil Case No. 8527,
accompanied by an urgent motion which manifested, among others, that it had <span style="">a </span>preferred right over the disputed <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> shares because these shares were assigned to it by
Ferro Chemicals, Inc., which purchased the aforementioned shares from Antonio
M. Garcia (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court allowed CEIC to intervene in an order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise issued <span style="">a </span>cease-and-desist order and directed the corporate secretary of
<span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> not to enforce and implement the order of <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1989</st1:date> in an order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1989</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>.).</p>

<p class="BODY">After due hearing and submission of pleadings by both CONSORTIUM
and CEIC, the trial court, on <st1:date year="1989" day="19" month="12">December
 19, 1989</st1:date>, rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Urgent Motion dated <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1989</st1:date>, filed by CEIC is
hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the Order
of <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1989</st1:date>, is
hereby SET ASIDE, and any and all acts of the Corporate Secretary of CHEMPHIL
and/or whoever is acting for and in his behalf, as may have already been done,
carried out or implemented pursuant to the Order of <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="9">September 4, 1989</st1:date>, are hereby nullified.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Perforce, the <span class="SpellE">CONSORTIUM's</span> Motions dated <st1:date year="1989" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1989</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1989</st1:date>, are both hereby
DENIED, for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Cease and Desist Order dated <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1989</st1:date>, is hereby AFFIRMED and made PERMANENT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 305).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Their motion for reconsideration having been denied, the
CONSORTIUM appealed from the foregoing decision to the Court of Appeals,
docketed as CA-G.R. CV No. 26511 and assigned to the former Twelfth Division of
the said appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1990</st1:date>,
CONSORTIUM filed a motion to consolidate CA-G.R. CV No. 26511 with CA-G.R. CV
No. 20467 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 328).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>CEIC
vehemently opposed this motion to consolidate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, respondent Court of Appeals granted the <span class="SpellE">CONSORTIUM's</span>
motion to consolidate in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1990</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 36).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1990" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1990</st1:date>, CEIC filed an urgent motion for reconsideration of the
aforementioned resolution, alleging, among others, that there is no common
question of law or fact or parties in CA-G.R. CV No. 20467 and CA-G.R. CV No.
26511(<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 329-330).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1991</st1:date>,
the Twelfth Division of respondent Court of Appeals issued a resolution,
denying <span class="SpellE">CEIC's</span> motion for reconsideration (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 43).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue for resolution in this case is whether or not
respondent Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion when it ordered the
consolidation of CA-G.R. CV No. 26511 with CA-G.R. CV No. 20467.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that both CA-G.R. CV No. 26511 and CA-G.R. CV
No. 20467 find their origin in Civil Case No. 8527.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In CA-G.R. CV No. 20467, the CONSORTIUM banks
are questioning the order of the trial court in Civil Case No. 8527, dismissing
their counterclaims, which, according to CEIC, resulted in the automatic
dissolution of attachment levied on the disputed <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span>
shares (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 342).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, in CA-G.R. CV No. 26511, the primordial issue revolves around the
ownership over the disputed <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> shares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Stated differently, both CEIC and the
CONSORTIUM banks are <span style="">contesting </span>ownership
over the disputed <span class="SpellE">Chemphil</span> shares that were (a) attached
by the CONSORTIUM in Civil Case No. 8527; (b) sold by the same banks on
execution to satisfy the judgment based on compromise rendered against Antonio
M. Garcia in CA?G.R. CV No. 20467;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and (c) claimed by CEIC <span style="">in </span>ownership
during the execution of the judgment based on compromise rendered in CA-G.R. CV
No. 20467 the result of which claim led to CA-G.R. CV No. 26511 (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 312).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, <span style="">CA-G.R. </span>No. <span style="">20467 and CA-G.R. CV No. 25611 are </span>intimately and substantially
related cases, thereby making their consolidation inevitable to avoid the
possibility of conflicting decisions in both cases (<span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>
Corporation, <span style="">Inc. v. </span>Court of
Appeals, 165 SCRA 265 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">That CEIC is not a party in CA-G.R. CV No. 20467 does not
militate against the consolidation of the two cases because under the Revised
Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals, which was approved by this Court <u>En</u>
<u>Banc</u> <span style="">on </span>October 20, 1988,
consolidation may be allowed when the two cases to be consolidated involve the
same parties <u>and</u>/<u>or</u> related questions of fact and/or law [Section
7(a)].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, for as long <span style="">as </span>two or more cases involve related
questions of fact and/or law, as in the instant case, their consolidation is in
order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the consolidation in
question being called for, it cannot be justifiably argued, as CEIC does, that
respondent Court of Appeals gravely abused its discretion when it ordered the
consolidation of CA­-G.R. CV No. 26511 with CA-G.R. CV No. 20467.</p>
