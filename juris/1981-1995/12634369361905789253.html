				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An enduring touchstone of a republican form of government is its
guarantee of equal protection of law.  To the powerless, it is the promise of parity of treatment with the
powerful when they are similarly situated.  This promise must be matched with performance, and to the extent that
the resolutions of the respondent court dated November 29, 1989 and March 9,
1990 accord fidelity to this constitutional precept, we affirm them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Less the fat of legalesse, the facts are few and
uncontroverted.  Before 1986, the
Landoil Group of Companies spearheaded by then Congressman Jose de Venecia,
Jr., was able to obtain foreign loans syndicated by various banks aggregating
approximately one hundred twenty million US dollars ($120 M).  These foreign loans were guaranteed by
PHILGUARANTEE, whose Board of Directors was then composed of private
respondents, Rosendo D. Bondoc, Cesar E.A. Virata, Ruben Ancheta, Jaime C.
Laya, Placido Mapa, Jr., Roberto Ongpin, and Cesar Zalamea.  Congressman de Venecia's group of companies
was unable to seasonably service these foreign loans and this compelled
PHILGUARANTEE to assume its obligation as guarantor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The EDSA revolution in February 1986 swept the Marcoses out of
power.  One of the first official acts
of then President Corazon C. Aquino was the creation of the Presidential
Commission on Good Government (PCGG) under E.O. No. 1.  It was given the difficult task of recovering
the illegal wealth of the Marcoses, their family, subordinates and close
associates.  In due time, the Marcoses
and their cronies had to face a flurry of cases, both civil and criminal, all
designed to recover the Republic's wealth allegedly plundered by them while in
power.  Case No. 0020 for Reconveyance,
Reversion, Accounting, Restitution and Damages was one of these cases.  It was filed by the petitioner Republic against
Jose de Venecia, Jr., Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Rosendo D. Bondoc,
Cesar E.A. Virata, Ruben Ancheta, Jaime C. Laya, Placido Mapa, Jr., Roberto
Ongpin and Cesar C. Zalamea.  We quote
its relevant allegations:</p>

DEFENDANTS' ILLEGAL ACTS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"8. From the
early years of his presidency, Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos took undue
advantage of his powers as President.  All throughout the period from September 21, 1972 to February 25, 1986,
he gravely abused his powers under martial law and ruled as Dictator under the
1973 Marcos promulgated Constitution.   Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos, together with other Defendants,
acting singly or collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one another, in
flagrant breach of public trust and of their fiduciary obligations as<i> </i><span style="">public </span>officers, with gross and
scandalous abuse of right and power and in brazen violation of the Constitution
and laws of the Philippines embarked upon a systematic plan to accumulate <span style="">ill-gotten wealth.  Among others, in furtherance of said plan and acting in unlawful

the purpose of preventing disclosure and avoiding discovery of their

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">SPECIFIC
AVERMENTS OF<br>
DEFENDANTS' ILLEGAL ACTS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“11.  Defendant Jose de Venecia, <span style="">Jr<i>. </i></span>taking undue advantage of
his relationship, influence and connection with Defendants Ferdinand E. Marcos
and Imelda R. Marcos, acting by himself and/or in active collaboration with the
other Defendants, embarked upon devices, schemes and strategems to unjustly
enrich themselves at the expense of Plaintiff and the Filipino people, among
others:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(a)  Organized and headed the Land Oil Group, a
big business conglomerate engaged in a wide range of economic activity, such as
petroleum exploration and engineering, port management and operation, and other
services.  The Land Oil Group, more
particularly, the Land Oil Resources Corporation, its parent company, and its
major subsidiaries, the Philippine-Singapore Ports Corporation, the Greater
Manila Land Corporation, Construction Consortium, Inc. and the Philippine
Hospitals and Health Services, had operations in the Philippines and abroad,
particularly, in the Middle East;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(b)  To finance his huge domestic and overseas
operations, Defendant Jose de Venecia, acting through the Land Oil Group,
borrowed enormous amounts in foreign currency denominated loans from several
syndicates of international banks, such as, but not limited to, Arab Banking
Corporation, Ahli Bank of Kuwait, Credit Suisse, First of Boston's, Saudi Cairo
Bank, Mellon Bank and the Bank of Montreal.  In view of the magnitude of the loans and the project risks involved,
the banks required that their loans be fully covered by the absolute and unconditional
guarantee of the Government of the Republic of the Philippines;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(c)  Accordingly, Defendant Jose de Venecia
applied for Philippine Government guarantee from the Philippine Export and Foreign
Loan Guarantee Corporation (Philguarantee), a government-owned and controlled
corporation organized to provide Philippine Government guarantees, and, with
the active collaboration of Defendants Rosendo D. Bondoc, who was then the
President of Philguarantee and the members of its Board of Directors,
Defendants Cesar E.A. Virata, Ruben Ancheta, Jaime C. Laya, Placido Mapa, Jr.,
Roberto Ongpin and Cesar C. Zalamea was granted full Philippine Government
guarantee coverage;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(d)  Defendant Jose de Venecia misused the
proceeds of the loans by diverting them to other uses and/or appropriation,
then for his own personal benefit using for this purpose a string of local and
overseas banks, such as, but not limited to, PNB (New York), PNB (Buendia
Branch), PCTB (Makati Branch), Swiss Banking Corp. of Hongkong, and the
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp. in Hongkong, and in an effort to hide his
complicity in the diversion, refused to submit regular accounting and reports,
all in violation of the provisions of the loan and guarantee agreements;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(e) Notwithstanding
the aforesaid repeated violations Philguarantee, with the active collaboration
of Defendants Rosendo D. Bondoc, Cesar E.A. Virata, Ruben Ancheta, Jaime C.
Laya, Placido Mapa, Jr., Roberto Ongpin and Cesar C. Zalamea, continued to
provide financial assistance to the companies owned and controlled by Defendant
Jose de Venecia;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(f)  As a result of gross mismanagement and
wanton diversion of the loans, the major operations of the Land Oil Group
collapsed, Land Oil defaulted in the payment of its maturing principal and
interests amortization and, like the man holding the proverbial empty bag,
Philguarantee had to advance on its guarantee using for this purpose
multi-millions of pesos in scarce government and taxpayers’ money, resulting in
grave and irreparable damage to Plaintiff and to the entire Filipino people.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“12.  The acts of Defendants, singly or
collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one another, constitute gross
abuse of official position and authority, flagrant breach of public trust and
fiduciary obligations, brazen abuse of right and power, unjust enrichment,
violation of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Philippines, to
the grave and irreparable damage of Plaintiff and the Filipino people.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"VI</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">CAUSE
OF ACTION</span><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“13. <u>First Cause
of Action</u>:  ABUSE OF RIGHT AND POWER
-- (a) Defendants, in perpetrating the unlawful acts described above, committed
abuse of <span style="">right and power which caused
untold misery, suffering and damage to Plaintiff.  Defendants violated, among others, Articles 19, 20 and 21 of the
Civil Code of the Philippines;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">(b) As a result of
the foregoing acts, Defendants acquired title to and beneficial interests in
funds and other property and concealed such title, funds and interests through
the use of relatives, business associates, nominees, agents or dummies.  Defendants are, therefore, jointly and
severally, liable to Plaintiff to return and reconvey all such funds and other
property unlawfully acquired; or alternatively, to pay Plaintiff, jointly and
severally, by way of indemnity, the damage cause to Plaintiff equivalent to the
amount of such funds and the value of other property not returned or restored
to Plaintiff, plus interest thereon from the date of unlawful acquisition until
full payment.</p>

<blockquote>“14.  <u>Second Cause of Action</u>:  UNJUST ENRICHMENT -- Defendants illegally
accumulated funds and other property in violation of the laws of the
Philippines and in breach of their official functions and fiduciary
obligations.  Defendants, therefore,
have unjustly enriched themselves to the grave and irreparable damage and
prejudice of Plaintiff.  Defendants have
an obligation at law, independently of breach of trust and abuse of right and
power and; as an alternative, to jointly and severally return to Plaintiff such
funds and other property with which Defendants, in gross and evident bad faith,
have unjustly enriched themselves or, in default thereof, restore to Plaintiff
the amount of such funds and the value of the other property including those
which may have been wasted, and/or lost, with interest thereon from the date of
unlawful acquisition until full payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“15. <u>Third Cause
of Action</u>:  BREACH OF TRUST -- A
public office is a public trust.  By
committing all the acts described above, Defendants repeatedly breached public
trust and the law, making them jointly and severally liable to Plaintiff.  The funds and other property acquired by
Defendants as a result of their breach of public trust are deemed to have been
acquired for the Benefit of Plaintiff and are, therefore, impressed with
constructive trust in favor of Plaintiff and the Filipino people.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“16.  <u>Fourth
Cause of Action</u>:  </span>ACCOUNTING
-­- The Commission, acting pursuant to the provisions of applicable law,
respectfully maintains that Defendants, acting singly or collectively, and/or
in unlawful concert with one another, acquired funds, assets and property
during the incumbency of Defendant public officers, or while acting in unlawful
concert with public officers, manifestly out of proportion to their salaries,
to their other lawful income and income from legitimately acquired
property.  Consequently, they are
required to show to the satisfaction of this Honorable Court that they have
lawfully acquired all such funds, assets and property which are in excess of
their legal net income, and for this Honorable Court to decree that the
Defendants are under obligation to account to Plaintiff with respect to all
legal or beneficial interests in funds, properties and assets of whatever kind
and wherever located in excess of their lawful earnings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“17.  <u><span style="">Fifth
Cause of Action</span></u><span style="">:  </span>LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES -- (a) By
reason of the unlawful acts set forth above, Plaintiff and the Filipino people
have suffered actual damages in an amount representing the pecuniary loss
sustained by the latter as a result of Defendants' unlawful acts, the
approximate value and interest on which, from the time of their wrongful
acquisition, plus expenses which Plaintiff has been compelled to incur and
shall continue to incur in its effort to recover Defendants' ill-gotten wealth
all over the <span style="">world.  Defendants are, therefore, jointly and
severally liable to Plaintiff for actual damages and for expenses incurred in
the recovery of Defendants' ill-gotten wealth.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(b) <span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a result of Defendants' unlawful,
malicious, immoral and wanton acts described above, Plaintiff and the Filipino
people had painfully endured and suffered for more than twenty long years, and
still continue to endure and <span style="">suffer
anguish, fright, sleepless nights, serious anxiety, wounded feelings and moral
shock, as well as besmirched reputation and social humiliation before the
international community, for which Defendants are jointly and severally liable
to Plaintiff and the Filipino people for moral damages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><span style="">(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
addition, Plaintiff and the Filipino people are entitled to temperate damages
for their suffering which, by their very nature, are incapable of pecuniary
estimation, but which this Honorable Court may determine in the exercise of its
sound discretion.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(d)  Defendants, by reason of the above described
unlawful acts, have violated and invaded the inalienable right of Plaintiff and
the Filipino people to a fair and decent way of life befitting a Nation with
rich natural and human resources.  This
basic, and fundamental right of Plaintiff and the Filipino people should be
recognized and vindicated by awarding nominal damages in an amount to be
determined by the Honorable Court in the exercise of its sound discretion.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(e)  By way of example and correction for the
public good and in order to ensure that Defendants' unlawful, malicious,
immoral and wanton acts are not repeated, said Defendants are jointly and
severally liable to Plaintiff for exemplary damages."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Needless to state, the de Venecia group
of companies and PHILGUARANTEE were sequestered by the petitioner, through the
PCGG.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The filing of Case No. 0020 notwithstanding, an investigation was
conducted to determine the veracity of the above allegations.  The investigation culminated in the signing
of a Deed of Assignment between the petitioner and de Venecia, Jr.,
representing seven (7) of the eighteen (18) companies of the Land Oil
Group.  The Deed was premised on the
following facts found by the petitioner after its investigation, and recited in
its whereas clauses, <i>viz</i>:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  As a result of
such investigation Philguarantee has satisfied itself (i) that such guarantee
facility was obtained in the ordinary and regular course of business, and that
no favor was accorded to the Landoil officers, in the grant of such guarantee
facility; and (ii) that the business reversals experienced by the Landoil Group
in connection with its various construction and other projects in the Middle
East and elsewhere were due, <u>firstly</u>, to the inability of the Landoil
Group to collect its contract receivables from such projects due to the reasons
specified in the sixth "whereas" clause, and, <u>secondly</u>, due to
the non-payment of its insurance claim under the insurance policy referred to
in <span style="">the succeeding (ninth),
"whereas" clause."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Certain obligations were then assumed by
de Venecia, Jr., and his group, <i>viz</i>:</p>

<blockquote>  "1.1  Upon the request of the Assignee (referring to petitioner), the
Assignors (being the above-named companies making up Landoil Group) shall
immediately cause to be transferred to the Assignee (or its nominee/s) all the
shares of the capital stock of Landoil (up to 45% of the total outstanding
issued and subscribed capital stock of Landoil) which have or may hereafter be
identified as belonging to Marcos (whether standing in his name or the name
[of] any of his nominee/s).  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1.2  Upon the effectiveness of this Agreement,
the Assignors shall cause to be paid to the Assignee, through PCGG, the amount
of P13, million, which amount represents a portion of Landoil's recovery from
an arbitration proceeding which Landoil had caused to be instituted in London
against the Lloyd's Syndicate of Insurance Underwriters;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.3  Effective immediately, the Assignors hereby
assign, transfer and convey to the PCGG:  (a) the entire proceeds of the Assignors' claims in the New York case
which Landoil has instituted against the insurance brokers, namely, the firm of
Alexander and Alexander, and (b) the entire proceeds of the Assignors' contract
receivables from all the Assignors' construction and other projects in the
Middle East and elsewhere, net of any amount required for the settlement of any
compulsory statutory liens for unpaid wages or salaries and ordinary administrative
overhead and costs, and attorney's fees and expenses of litigation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.5  The Assignors, and or their respective
officers, hereby undertake to fully cooperate with the Philippine Government,
acting through the PCGG or any other governmental agency, in the prosecution of
any case which the Philippine Government may cause to be filed against former
President Marcos and his cronies, either by furnishing testimony in any such
case, or by providing information in any investigation undertaken in contemplation
of the filing of such case, whether in the Philippines or elsewhere, as may be
required or directed by the PCGG, or by other appropriate governmental agency
from time to time."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In reciprocity, petitioner agreed to
cause the dismissal without prejudice of the complaint in Civil Case No. 0020
against de Venecia and his group of co-signors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to this Deed of Assignment, de Venecia Jr., with the
express conformity of PCGG, moved to dismiss Civil Case No. 0020 against
him.  On September 8, 1989, the
respondent court granted the motion to dismiss.  The dismissal became final and executory.  The other private respondents followed suit
with their respective motions to dismiss.  The motions were opposed by the petitioner.  Nonetheless, on December 4, 1989, the respondent court dismissed
the Expanded Complaint against herein private respondents.  The dismissal was based on two (2)
grounds:  (1) removal of an
indispensable party in the person of de Venecia, Jr., from the Expanded
Complaint; and (2) lack of cause of action in view of the facts established and
admitted by the petitioner in the Deed of Assignment.  Petitioner's motion for reconsideration and its Supplement were
denied by the respondent court on March 9, 1990.  Petitioner then filed the petition at bar, where it is contended:</p>

<blockquote>"16.  The respondent Court committed grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in dismissing the
case against defendant de Venecia's co-defendants, on the following grounds:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">a)  The Deed of Assignment executed on July 19,
1989 by Landoil in favor of the petitioner should not be made to benefit de
Venecia's co-defendant;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">b)  Defendant de Venecia is not an indispensable
party in the prosecution of the case against his co-defendants;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">c)  The liabilities of de Venecia's
co-defendants arose not only from their alleged conspiracy with defendant de
Venecia but also by virtue of their individual or collective actions done in
unlawful concert with one another;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">d)  The causes of action against defendants Ferdinand
E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos have nothing to do with the Deed of Assignment
executed by Landoil in favor of the petitioner; and<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">e)  The parties manifestly intended to exclude
defendant de Venecia's co­-defendants from the benefit of the Deed of Assignment
in question."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find partial merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The threshold question is whether the subject Deed of Assignment
justifies the dismissal of Civil Case No. 0020 against, first, private
respondents Bondoc, Virata, Ancheta, Laya, Mapa, Jr., Ongpin, Zalamea, and
second, against the private respondents, Ferdinand and Imelda R. Marcos.</p>

<p class="BODY">We shall first determine the effect of the Deed of Assignment on
the cause of action of petitioner against the first group of private
respondents - Bondoc, <i>et al</i>.  Petitioner
submits that the execution of the Deed need not result in the dismissal of
Expanded Complaint against Bondoc, <i>et al</i>.  It cites two (2) reasons:  (1) Bondoc, <i>et al. </i>were not parties to the Deed, and (2) petitioner
did not receive any consideration or benefit from Bondoc, <i>et al.,</i> when
it executed the said Deed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's submission misses the rationale of the ruling of the
respondent court.  The respondent court
ordered the dismissal of the Expanded Complaint because the Deed contained
averments which nullified petitioner's cause of action.  More specifically, the Deed averred "x
x x as a result of such investigation Philguarantee has satisfied itself (1)
that such guarantee facility was obtained in the ordinary and regular course of
business, and that no favor was accorded to the Landoil officers, in the grant
of such guarantee facility; x x x." If after investigation, petitioner has
satisfied itself that the guaranty facility was obtained in the ordinary and
regular course of business, it follows that it can no longer insist it has a
cause of action against Bondoc and company.  This admission of lack of cause of action constitutes an admission
against interest.  It binds the
petitioner as it is not alleged that it was given due to fraud, mistake or
inadvertence.  The adverse effects of
the admission bind petitioner and it is not material that respondents Bondoc
and company were not parties to the Deed or that in executing the said Deed,
petitioner did not receive any consideration from respondents Bondoc and
company.  An admission against interest
is a voluntary act and its effects do not depend on the concurrence of any
other party or consideration of any kind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner next contends that the respondent court erred in
ruling that it has only one cause of action against the respondents Bondoc and
company - i.e., that as members of the Board of Directors of PHILGUARANTEE,
they continuously extended and maintained unwarranted guarantees to cover the
foreign loans of de Venecia's Land Oil Group of Companies, cronies of the
Marcoses.  Petitioner's submission is
shared by our brethren who dissented from the majority.  They are of the view that petitioner pleaded
several causes of action.  They then
point to the introductory part of par. 11 of the Expanded Complaint which used
the phrase "among others," <i><span style="">viz</span></i><span style="">:<i><o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<blockquote>"11.  Defendant Jose<i> </i>de Venecia, Jr<i>., </i>taking
undue advantage of his relationship, influence and connection with Defendants
Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos, acting by himself and/or in active
collaboration with the other Defendants, embarked upon devices, schemes and
stratagems to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of plaintiff and the
Filipino People, <u><span style="">among others</span></u><span style="">." </span>(Underlining supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">They also cite par. 8 which used the same
phrase "among others," <i>viz</i>:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos, together with other
Defendants, acting singly or collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one
another, in flagrant breach of public trust and of their fiduciary obligations
as public officers, with gross and scandalous abuse of right and power and in
brazen violation of the Constitution and laws of the Philippines, embarked upon
a systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth.  <u>Among others</u>, in furtherance of said plan and acting in
unlawful concert with one another and with gross abuse of power and authority,
x x x." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">They also refer to par. 9 which also used
the word "among," <i>viz</i>:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span><u>Among</u>
the assets acquired by Defendants in the manner above-described and discovered
by the Commission in the exercise of its official responsibilities are funds
and other property listed in Annex "A" hereof and made an integral
part of this Complaint." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">They then cite paragraphs 13, 14, 15, 16
and 17 of the Expanded Complaint which allegedly enumerated five (5) causes of
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">This stand cannot be sustained.  Par. 8 of the Expanded Complaint merely laid down the "<u>General</u>
Averments of Defendants' Illegal Acts." The <u>specific</u> allegations of
the acts and omissions committed by respondents Bondoc and company and
constitutive of petitioner's cause of action are recited in par. 11 of the
Expanded Complaint.  It is for this
reason that par. 11 bears the descriptive title "<u>Specific</u> Averments
of Defendants' Illegal Acts." Needless to stress, the cause of action of
the petitioner against the said respondents is spelled out in par. 11 (a) to
(f).  A perusal of par. 11 will yield no
other conclusion than that there is but one cause of action against these
respondents -- that with conspiracy, they allegedly extended unwarranted
guarantees to enable the de Venecia group of companies, all cronies of the
Marcoses, to obtain foreign loans.  The
use of the phrase "among others" in the Expanded Complaint does not
in any manner mean that petitioner has <u>other</u> concealed causes of action
against these respondents.  Smart
pleaders resort to said artful phrase only to gain more leeway in presenting
their evidence.  By no stretch of the
imagination, however, can it be maintained that the opaque phrase "among
others" can confer a cause of action.  Such a ruling cannot be reconciled with substantive due process which
bars roaming generalities in any kind of complaint, whether civil or
criminal.  It is for this reason that
section 1 of Rule 8 of the Rules of Court requires that "every pleading
shall contain in a methodical and logical form, a plain, concise and direct
statement of the ultimate facts on which the party pleading relies for his
claim or defense, as the case may be...." A transgression of this rule is
fatal.  Upon the other hand, paragraphs
13 to 17 of the Expanded Complaint contain mere general averments and do not
allege petitioner's specific cause of action against these respondents.  They speak for themselves and they need not
undergo the scalpel of judicial scrutiny.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner and the dissent further forward the thesis:  The averments earlier mentioned and the deed
of assignment, juxtaposed with Annex "A," show <i><span style="">prima facie</span></i><span style=""> </span>that (a) the petitioner <u>did not intend</u> to enter into any
amicable settlement with the remaining eleven (11) corporations or regarding
the frozen assets listed in said Annex "A,", and (b) the assets of
the defendants in the said eleven (11) corporations were <u>not necessarily</u>
obtained through or as a consequence of the acts or transactions described in
subparagraphs (a) to (f), paragraph 11 of the Expanded Complaint, but <u>probably</u>
through "the other devices, schemes or stratagems."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, we find the thesis
untenable.  We need not </span>agonize
in search for the subjective intent of the petitioner in concluding the Deed of
Assignment only with the seven (7) corporations of the de Venecia group of
companies.  Speculations on intent can
be endless for it is the nature of unmanifested intent to be fugitive.  But the effort is superfluous for we need
not engage in this difficult intellectual <i>jujitsu</i>.  For, whether or not it was petitioner's
furtive intent to settle amicably with <u>all</u> the corporations of de
Venecia and the respondents Bondoc and company, is not decisive of the case at
bar.  What is determinative is that in
the Deed of Assignment, petitioner itself admitted that it has no cause of
action against these respondents in Civil Case No. 0020.  The admission was made when, after
conducting its <u>own</u> investigation, it found out that (1) de Venecia, Jr.,
was not a crony but a victim of the Marcoses; (2) the guarantees extended by
the private respondents as members of the Board of Director of PHILGUARANTEE
were given in "the ordinary and regular course of business and that no
favor was accorded to the Landoil officers in the grant of such guarantee
facility," and (3) that the business reversals experienced by the Landoil
Group in connection with its various construction and other projects in the
Middle East and elsewhere were due, <u>firstly</u>, to the inability of the
Landoil Group to collect its contract receivables from such projects due to the
reasons specified in the sixth "whereas" clause, and, <u>secondly</u>,
due to the non-payment of its insurance claim.  In light of these specific admissions, there is no need to speculate why
the other corporations of de Venecia were not made parties to the Deed of
Assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dissent likewise posits the highly stretched submission that
there is a <i><span style="">prima facie</span></i><span style=""> </span>showing that the "assets of the
defendants in the said eleven (11) corporations <u>were not necessarily</u>
obtained through or as <span style="">a </span>consequence
of the acts or transactions described in subparagraphs (a) to (f), par. 11 of
the Expanded Complaint but <u>probably</u> through "the other devices,
schemes or strategems." This submission of a <i><span style="">prima facie</span></i><span style=""> </span>showing
self-destructs for the factual basis given for its support is a mere guesswork
- i.e., that <u>probably</u> the aforementioned assets were obtained through
other devices, schemes or strategems.  Moreover, we are dealing with a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, where it
may not be proper for this Court, concededly not a trier of fact, to rule about
the existence of a <i><span style="">prima facie</span></i><span style=""> </span>case.  To be sure, the facts of the case were not fully developed, for
petitioner's Expanded Complaint was dismissed on the basis of private
respondents' motion to dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the dissent urges that the petitioner's admissions
"x x x do not by themselves clear the Board of Directors or the officers
of the Philguarantee from any liability which could have arisen from the grant
of the guaranty facility." The given reason is that "private
respondents were not sued as directors or officers of a private corporation,
but as government officials who under the Constitution were obliged to serve
with the highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency
and to remain accountable to the people." With due deference, this view
that respondents Bondoc and company were not sued as members of the Board of
PHILGUARANTEE but as public officials is simply irreconcilable with the
allegations in the Expanded Complaint of the petitioner, <i>viz</i>:</p>

(Underscoring supplied)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There cannot be any iota of doubt that
said respondents were sued as members of the Board of PHILGUARANTEE and not as
public officials.  Indeed, if they were
able to guaranty the foreign loans of petitioner it was because they were
members of the Board of PHILGUARANTEE and for no other reason.  But even granting <i><span style="">arguendo</span></i><span style=""> </span>that
these respondents were sued as public officials, we cannot perceive how they
could be charged with betrayal of their trust considering again petitioner's
admission that the guarantee facilities were extended in the "ordinary and
<u><span style="">regular</span></u><span style=""> </span>course of business."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further contends that the emerging rule in the United
States is that the release of one tortfeasor does not automatically result in
the release of the other tortfeasors, hence, the case against the private
respondents should not be dismissed even if it had consented to the dismissal
of the case against de Venecia, Jr.  We
fail to see how the principles of tort can apply to the case at bench.  Civil Case No. 0020 can hardly be classified
as a tort case for, as petitioner itself labels its complaint, it is one for
reconveyance, reversion, accounting, restitution and damages.  Petitioner has never taken the stance that
its cause of action is predicated on tort.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even if we apply the principles of tort to the case at bench,
we still affirm the ruling of the respondent court that the complaint against
private respondents as former directors of PHILGUARANTEE should be
dismissed.  It is true that in <b><i>Zenith
Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., </i>401 US 321, 91 S. Ct. 795</b>, the
US Supreme Court held that "a party releases only those other parties whom
he intends to release." Nonetheless, the ruling should be interpreted in
light of the text of the release document executed by <b><i>Zenith</i></b><i>,
viz</i>:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"To All To Whom These Presents Shall Come Or May Concern,

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is clear from the text of this release
document in <b><i>Zenith </i></b>that the release was made in exchange for a
valuable consideration, thus, in satisfaction of Zenith's claim.  In the case at bench, petitioner released de
Venecia, Jr. and some of his companies not because its claim has already been
satisfied by a sufficient consideration, but because of the fact that it could
not establish its cause of action against them.  Petitioner's investigation showed that de Venecia, Jr., was not a
crony of former President Marcos and that he obtained the guarantees to his
foreign loans in the regular and ordinary course of business.  In plain language, petitioner was convinced
that de Venecia, Jr., and company did not commit any actionable wrong,
including any tortious act.  It ought to
follow that the complaint against the respondents Bondoc and company for extending
the said guarantees in favor of de Venecia, Jr., cannot also be pursued any
further.  The complaint against de
Venecia, Jr., and these respondents are inseparable, especially because
petitioner relied on the theory of conspiracy.  In any event, the rule with respect to the effect of release of one
tortfeasor on other tortfeasors is still in a state of fluctuation even in the
United States.  Thus, the 2nd
Restatement of the Law on Torts states:</p>

<blockquote><i><span style="">"Statutes.</span></i>  About half of the states have now passed
statutes covering the matter.  They
change the early common law with varying positions, but a substantial number
provide that neither a release nor a covenant not to sue <span style="">discharges the other </span>tortfeasor unless
its terms so provide.  This is the
provision in both the 1955 Uniform Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act and the
Uniform Comparative Fault Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i><span style="">"Present status.</span></i><span style="">  </span>States
may now be classed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)  A release amounts to a
complete discharge, no matter what language <span style="">is<i> </i></span>used.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)  An instrument in the
form of a release discharges all tortfeasors; a covenant not to sue does not.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) The intent is
controlling, irrespective of the language- sometimes with a rebuttable
presumption either for or against discharge of the other tortfeasor.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)  A release of one tortfeasor does not
discharge the other unless it so provides.  There is frequent change in the alignment of the states, usually in the
direction toward classification."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Next, petitioner argues that the respondent court gravely abused
its discretion when it held that de Venecia, Jr., was an indispensable party;
hence, his exclusion in the Expanded Complaint ought to result in the dismissal
of the same Complaint against the private respondents.  The argument has merit considering that the
case can be decided without impleading de Venecia, Jr..  Be that as it may, this ruling is not enough
reason to completely reverse the respondent court.  As discussed above, the petitioner dropped its cause of action in
its Expanded Complaint by signing the said Deed of Assignment.  It has precluded itself from further
pursuing its complaint not only against de Venecia, Jr., but also against
respondents Bondoc and company who served as former directors of PHILGUARANTEE.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the submission of petitioner that the dismissal of
the complaint against the respondents Marcoses ordered by the respondent court
is a grave abuse of discretion.  We
agree that the Marcoses should be treated differently from de Venecia, Jr., and
the respondents Bondoc and company.  For
in the aforementioned Deed of Assignment, the petitioner only recognized the
lack of culpability of de Venecia, Jr., and by necessary inference, the
respondents Bondoc and company.  In
contrast, however, the said Deed did not exculpate the Marcoses, but on the
contrary, inculpated them.  More
specifically, the Deed alleged that former President Marcos "by himself
and/or through his designated nominees or cronies, owns approximately 45% of
the outstanding capital stock of Landoil, and through Landoil, a proportionate
portion of the outstanding capital stock of each of the other companies of the
Landoil Group".  According to the
same Deed, the former President and his cronies "coveted the Landoil
groups and caused the same to be taken over by his (referring to Marcos) agents
and business associates x x x".  It
was for this reason that in the same Deed, de Venecia, Jr., agreed to surrender
to petitioner all the Marcoses' shares in the Landoil group of companies and to
cooperate in the prosecution of any case to be filed against the Marcoses.  In fine, the Deed of Assignment leaves it
crystal clear that petitioner has not surrendered its cause of action against
the Marcoses as it did with respect to the respondents Bondoc and company.</p>

<p class="BODY">One final point.  The
dismissal of the Complaint against Bondoc and company is compelled by the equal
protection clause of the Constitution.  De Venecia, Jr. and the respondents Bondoc and company are similarly
situated.  Respondent Bondoc, <i><u><span style="">et al</span></u></i><i><span style="">.</span></i><span style=""> </span>were included in the Complaint only because they allegedly gave
unwarranted favors to de Venecia, Jr., in guaranteeing the latter's foreign
loans.  When petitioner admitted that no
undue favor was granted to de Venecia, Jr. in the grant of such guaranty
facilities and dismissed its complaint against him, petitioner cannot avoid its
duty of dismissing its complaint against respondents Bondoc and company.  To give a more favored treatment to de
Venecia, Jr., when the parties are equally situated is to indulge <span style="">in </span>invidious discrimination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, the resolutions dated November 29, 1989
and March 9, 1990 of the respondent court are affirmed with the modification
that the Expanded Complaint against the respondents Marcoses in Civil Case No.
0020 is reinstated and ordered to be remanded to the respondent court for
further proceedings.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-left: 0.25in;">DISSENTING
OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i>J</i>.:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I respectfully submit that the respondent Sandiganbayan committed
grave abuse of discretion in promulgating the challenged resolutions.  I am, therefore, unable to concur with the
majority opinion except insofar as it orders the reinstatement of the Expanded
Complaint in Civil Case No. 0020 against the Marcoses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue in this case is whether the dismissal by the
Sandiganbayan of Civil Case No. 0020 as against defendant Jose De Venecia, by
virtue of a Deed of Assignment executed between the Presidential Commission on
Good Government (PCGG) and seven corporations belonging to the Landoil Group,
should likewise inure to the benefit of De Venecia’s co-defendants.  The Sandiganbayan thought that it should and
dismissed the case against the co-defendants.  The petitioner thinks otherwise and submits that the Sandiganbayan acted
with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in
so doing.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material operative facts and procedural antecedents
generative of this controversy are not disputed.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Petitioner, represented by the PCGG, filed on 27 July 1987
with the Sandiganbayan a complaint for Reconveyance, Reversion, Accounting,
Restitution and Damages against JOSE DE VENECIA, JR., FERDINAND E. MARCOS,
IMELDA R. MARCOS, ROSENDO D. BONDOC, CESAR E.A. VIRATA, RUBEN ANCHETA, JAIME C.

The complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. 0020.  Upon prior leave of the Sandiganbayan, the Petitioner filed on 25
January 1988 an Expanded Complaint,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> the

<p class="OTHERHEADING">GENERAL AVERMENTS<br>
OF<br>
DEFENDANTS’ ILLEGAL ACTS</p>

<blockquote>8. <span style=""> </span>From the early years of his presidency,
Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos took undue advantage of his powers as
President.  All throughout the period
from September 21, 1972 to February 25, 1986, he gravely abused his powers
under martial law and ruled as Dictator under the 1973 Marcos promulgated
Constitution.  Defendant Ferdinand E.
Marcos, together with other Defendants, acting singly or collectively, and/or
in unlawful concert with one another, in flagrant breach of public trust and of
their fiduciary obligations as public officers, with gross and scandalous abuse
of right and power and in brazen violation of the Constitution and laws of the
Philippines, embarked upon <span style="">a </span>systematic
plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth.  Among others, in furtherance of said plan and acting in unlawful concert
with one another and with gross abuse of power and authority, Defendant
Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(a)  awarded contracts with the Government to
their relatives, business associates, dummies, nominees, agents or persons who
were beholden to said Defendants, under terms and conditions grossly and
manifestly disadvantageous to the government;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">(b)  misappropriated, embezzled and/or converted
to their own use funds of Government financial institutions;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(c)  engaged in other illegal and improper acts
and practices designed to defraud Plaintiff and the Filipino people, or
otherwise misappropriated and converted to their own use, benefit and
enrichment the lawful patrimony and revenues of Plaintiff and the Filipino
people.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>9.  Among the assets acquired by Defendants in
the manner above-described and discovered by the Commission in the exercise of
its official responsibilities are funds and other property listed in Annex “A”
hereof and made an integral part of this Complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>10.  Defendants, acting singly or collectively,
and/or in unlawful concert with one another, for the purpose of preventing
disclosure and avoiding discovery of their unmitigated plunder of the National
Treasury and of their other illegal acts, and employing the services of
prominent lawyers, accountants, financial experts, businessman [sic] and other
persons, deposited, kept and invested funds, securities and other assets in
various banks, financial institutions, trust or investment companies and with
persons here and abroad.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;">SPECIFIC
AVERMENTS </p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 0in 0in 15pt;">OF<br>
DEFENDANTS’ ILLEGAL ACTS</p>

<blockquote>11.  Defendant Jose de Venecia, Jr. taking undue
advantage of his relationship, influence and connection <u><span style="">with</span></u><span style=""> <u>Defendants</u> <u>Ferdinand</u> </span><u>E.</u> <u><span style="">Marcos</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>and</u> <u><span style="">Imelda</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>R.</u> <u><span style="">Marcos</span></u><span style="">, </span>acting
by himself and/or in active collaboration with <u>the</u> <u><span style="">other</span></u><span style=""> <u>Defendants</u>, </span>embarked upon devices, schemes and strategems
to unjustly enrich themselves at the expense of Plaintiff and the Filipino people,
among others:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">a) Organized and
headed the Land Oil Group, a big business conglomerate engaged in a wide range
of economic activity, such as petroleum exploration and engineering, port
management and operation, <u>and</u> <u>other</u> <u>services</u>.  The Land Oil <span style="">Group, more </span>particularly, the Land Oil <span style="">Resources Corporation, </span>its <span style="">parent
company, </span>and its major subsidiaries, the <span style="">Philippine-Singapore Ports Corporation, the Greater Manila Land
Corporation, <u>Construction</u> <u>Consortium</u>, <u>Inc</u>. and </span><u>the</u>
<u>Philippine</u> <u>Hospitals</u> <u>and</u> <u>Health</u> <u><span style="">Services</span></u><span style="">, had operations in the Philippines and </span>abroad, particularly, in
the Middle East;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">b) To finance his
huge domestic and overseas operations, Defendant Jose de Venecia, acting
through the Land Oil Group, borrowed enormous amounts in foreign currency denominated
loans from several syndicates of <span style="">international
banks, <u>such</u> <u>as,</u> <u>but</u> <u>not</u> <u>limited</u> <u>to,</u> <u>Arab</u>
<u>Banking</u> <u>Corporation</u>, <u>Ahli</u> <u>Bank</u> <u>of</u> <u>Kuwait</u>,
<u>Credit</u> <u>Swisse</u> <u>First</u> <u>of</u> <u>Boston</u>, <u>Saudi</u> <u>Cairo</u>
<u>Bank</u>, <u>Mellon</u> <u>Bank</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>Bank</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Montreal</u>.  In view of the
magnitude of the Loans and the project risks involved, the banks required that
their loans be fully covered by the absolute and unconditional guarantee of the
Government of the Republic of the Philippines;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">c) Accordingly,
Defendant Jose de Venecia applied for Philippine Government guarantee from the
Philippine Export and Foreign Loan Guarantee Corporation (Philguarantee), a
government-owned and controlled corporation organized to provide Philippine
Government guarantees, and, with the active collaboration of Defendants Rosendo
D. Bondoc, who was then the President of Philguarantee and the members of its
Board of Directors, Defendants Cesar E.A. Virata, Ruben Ancheta, Jaime C. Laya,
Placido Mapa, Jr., Roberto Ongpin and Cesar C. Zalamea was granted full
Philippine Government guarantee coverage;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">d)  Defendant Jose de Venecia misused the
proceeds of the loans by diverting them to other uses and/or appropriation,
then for his own personal benefit using for this purpose a string of local and
overseas banks, <u>such</u> <u>as,</u> <u>but</u> <u>not</u> <u>limited</u> <u>to,</u>
<u>PNB</u> (<u>New</u> <u>York),</u> <u>PNB</u> (<u>Buendia</u> <u>Branch),</u>
<u>PCTB</u> (<u>Makati</u> <u>Branch),</u> <u>Swiss</u> <u>Banking</u> <u>Corp</u>.
<u>of</u> <u>Hongkong</u> <u>and</u> <u>the</u> <u>Hongkong</u> <u>and</u> <u>Shanghai</u>
<u>Banking</u> <u>Corp.</u> <u>in</u> <u>Hongkong</u>, and in an effort to hide
his complicity in the diversion, refused to submit regular accounting and
reports, all in violation of the provisions of the loan and guarantee
agreements;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">e) Notwithstanding
the aforesaid repeated violations, Philguarantee, with the active collaboration
of Defendants Rosendo D. Bondoc, Cesar E.A. Virata, Ruben Ancheta, Jaime C.
Laya, Placido Mapa, Jr., Roberto Ongpin and Cesar C. Zalamea, continued to
provide financial assistance to the companies and controlled by Defendant Jose
de Venecia;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">f)  As a result of gross mismanagement and wanton
diversion of the loans, the major operations of the Land Oil Group collapsed,
Land Oil defaulted in the payment of its maturing principal and interests
amortization and, like the man holding the proverbial empty bag, Philguarantee
had to advance on its guarantee using for this purpose multi-millions of pesos
in scarce government <span style="">and </span>taxpayers’
money, resulting in grave and irreparable damage to Plaintiff and to the entire
Filipino people.</p>

<blockquote>12.  The acts of Defendants, singly or
collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one another, constitute gross
abuse of official position and authority, flagrant breach of public trust and
fiduciary obligations, brazen abuse of right and power, unjust enrichment,
violation of the Constitution and laws of the Republic of the Philippines, to
the grave and irreparable damage of Plaintiff and the Filipino people.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">VI</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CAUSE OF ACTION</p>

<blockquote>13. <u>First</u> <u>Cause</u>
<u>of</u> <u>action</u>: ABUSE OF RIGHT AND POWER -- (a) Defendants, in
perpetrating the unlawful acts described above, committed abuse of right and
power which caused untold misery, suffering and damage to Plaintiff.  Defendants violated, among others, Articles
19, 20 and 21<i> </i>of the Civil Code of the Philippines;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) As a result of
the foregoing acts, Defendants acquired title to and beneficial interests in
funds and other property and concealed such title, funds and interests through
the use of relatives, business associates, nominees, agents or dummies.  Defendants are, therefore, jointly and severally,
liable to Plaintiff to return and reconvey all such funds and other property
unlawfully acquired; or alternatively, to pay Plaintiff, jointly and severally,
by way of indemnity, the damage caused to Plaintiff equivalent to the amount of
such funds and the value of other property not returned or restored to
Plaintiff, plus interest thereon from the date of unlawful acquisition until
full payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>14.  <u>Second</u> <u>Cause</u> <u>of</u> <u>Action</u>:  UNJUST ENRICHMENT -- Defendants illegally
accumulated funds and other property in violation of the laws of the Philippines
and in breach of their official functions and fiduciary obligations.  Defendants, therefore, have unjustly
enriched themselves to the grave and irreparable damage and prejudice of
Plaintiff.  Defendants have an
obligation at law, independently of breach of trust and abuse of right and
power and; as an alternative, to jointly and severally return to Plaintiff such
funds and other property with which Defendants, in gross and evident bad faith,
have unjustly enriched themselves or, in default thereof, restore to Plaintiff
the amount of such funds and the value of the other property including those
which may have been wasted, and/or lost, with interest thereon from the date of
unlawful acquisition until full payment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>15. <u>Third</u> <u>Cause</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Action</u>:  BREACH OF TRUST
-- ­A public office is a public trust.  By committing all the acts described above, Defendants repeatedly
breached public trust and the law, making them jointly and severally liable to
Plaintiff.  The funds and other property
acquired by Defendants as a result of, their breach of public trust are deemed
to have been acquired for the Benefit of Plaintiff and are, therefore,
impressed with constructive trust in favor of Plaintiff and the Filipino
people.  Consequently, Defendants are
solidarily liable to return or reconvey to Plaintiff all such funds and
property thus impressed with constructive trust for the benefit of Plaintiff
and the Filipino people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>16. <u>Fourth</u> <u>Cause</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Action</u>:  ACCOUNTING --
The Commission, acting pursuant to the provisions of applicable law,
respectfully maintains that Defendants, acting singly or collectively, and/or
in unlawful concert with one another, acquired funds, assets and property
during the incumbency of Defendant public officers, or while acting in unlawful
concert with public officers, manifestly out of proportion to their salaries,
to their other lawful income and income from legitimately acquired
property.  Consequently, they are
required to show to the satisfaction of this Honorable Court that they have
lawfully acquired all such funds, assets and property which are in excess of
their legal net income, and for this Honorable Court to decree that the
Defendants are under obligation to account to Plaintiff with respect to all
legal or beneficial interests in funds, properties and assets of whatever kind
and wherever located in excess of their lawful earnings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>17. <u>Fifth</u> <u>Cause</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Action</u>:  LIABILITY FOR
DAMAGES -- (a) By reason of the unlawful acts set forth above, Plaintiff and
the Filipino people have suffered actual damages in an amount representing the
pecuniary loss sustained by the latter as a result of Defendants’ unlawful

after the organization of the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG)
in February 1986, the Landoil Group, acting through Landoil itself, asked the
PCGG to place the Landoil Group under sequestration for the reason that former
President Ferdinand E. Marcos, by himself and/or through his designated
nominees or cronies, owns approximately 45% of the outstanding capital stock of
Landoil, and through Landoil, a proportionate portion of the outstanding
capital stock of each of the other companies of the Landoil Group;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7) To negate the
imputation that the Landoil Group are Marcos ‘crony’ companions, and that Jose
de Venecia and other officers of the Landoil Group are Marcos ‘cronies,’ the
Landoil Group submitted proof tending to show that they were in fact the
victims rather than the ‘cronies’ of Marcos who, in 1977, coveted the Landoil
Group and caused the same to be taken over by his (Marcos’) agents and business
associates for his (Marcos’) benefit after the discovery of oil deposits off
Palawan by a consortium of oil exploration companies of which Landoil was a
substantial member, and the acquisition of Landoil, also in 1977, of a prime
port operations contract in Saudi Arabia with a value of US$350 million;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(8) After the
establishment of the present Aquino Government, Philguarantee caused an
investigation to be undertaken as to (a) the background of the issuance of the
alleged ‘behest’ guarantee facility in favor of the Landoil Group, and (b) the
management and operations of the Landoil Group, both in the Philippines and in
the Middle East.  As a result of such
investigation <u>Philguarantee</u> has satisfied itself (i) that such guarantee
facility was obtained in the ordinary and regular course of business, and that
no favor was accorded to the Landoil officers, in the grant of such guarantee
facility; and (ii) that the business reversals experienced by the Landoil Group
in connection with its various construction and other projects in the Middle
East and elsewhere were due, <u>firstly</u>, to the inability of the Landoil
Group to collect its contract receivables from such projects due to the reasons
specified in the sixth ‘whereas’ clause, and, <u>secondly</u>, due to the
non-payment of its insurance claim under the insurance policy referred to in
the succeeding (ninth) ‘whereas’ clause.”<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

undertakings hereunder.”<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal by the Sandiganbayan of Civil Case No. 0020 as
against De Venecia’s co-defendants is anchored on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>a) <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of the case as against de
Venecia pursuant to the Resolution of 8 September 1989, “which x x x has now
become final and executory after the plaintiff withdrew its ‘Motion For
Reconsideration,’“ “in effect, removed an indispensable party from this case.”
De Venecia is an indispensable party because his involvement in the
transactions, together with the Landoil Group, which are described in paragraph
11 of the Expanded Complaint, “constitute and/or comprise the very essence of
the only cause of action which is specifically averred in said Complaint, the
other causes of action alleged therein being premised on <span style="">mere general averments.” </span>With the
removal of De Venecia from the case with the express conformity of the
plaintiff, no judgment can be rendered or liability enforced against the other
defendants who are alleged to have acted in conspiracy with <span style="">him.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) The motions to
dismiss filed by de Venecia’s co-defendants may be treated as motions for
summary judgment because when an indispensable party “has x x x been dropped from
the complaint by reason of a compromise or amicable settlement which
practically negates the legal or factual basis for the principal cause of
action, then a <i><span style="">fortiori, </span></i>x
x x the cause of action has become not only insufficient but inexistent.” The
“issues having been joined already x x x, there is nothing which could prevent
defendants from submitting the case for summary judgment.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)  As to defendants Ferdinand E. Marcos and
Imelda R. Marcos, although they were declared in default, a “perusal of the General
and Specific Averments of the Expanded complaint, in relation to the causes of
action described therein, will indubitably show that above-named defendants’
alleged liabilities are intimately intertwined and closely related to the
transactions subject matter of the compromise agreement between the PCGG and
defendant De Venecia.” Accordingly, the “compromise, x x x inures to, and
benefits, defendants spouses Marcoses and completely removes any legal or
factual bases for their retention as defendants in this case.”<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its Resolution of 9 March 1990<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
denying the Petitioner’s motion to reconsider the said dismissal, the
Sandiganbayan stressed that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“x x </span>x the one and
only cause of action set out in the Expanded Complaint appears in paragraph 11
thereof, and outlined in detail under sub-paragraphs (a) and (f),
inclusive.  The Compromise Agreement, as
we had pointed out, not only removed De Venecia as an indispensable party but
also deprived the Expanded Complaint of any and all factual or legal support
for the sole cause of action set forth therein.”<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I cannot agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the Sandiganbayan got itself entangled in a
web of incorrect premises which, unfortunately, became the bases for its
conclusions.  For one, it is not true
that the Petitioner has only one (1) cause of action as described in paragraph
11 of the Expanded Complaint.  As could
be gathered from the introductory portion of said paragraph 11 under subheading
V on Specific Averments of Defendants’ Illegal Acts, the acts or transactions
enumerated in subparagraphs (a) to (f) thereof are merely “among others.” It
reads:</p>

<blockquote>“11. Defendant Jose
de Venecia, Jr., taking undue advantage of his relationship, influence and
connection <u>with</u> <u>Defendants</u> <u>Ferdinand</u> <u>E</u>. <u>Marcos</u>
<u>and</u> <u>Imelda</u> <u>R</u>. <u>Marcos</u>, acting by himself and/or in
active collaboration <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>other</u> <u>Defendants</u>,
embarked upon devices, schemes and stratagems to unjustly enrich themselves at
the expense of Plaintiff and the Filipino People, <u>a</u><u><span style="">mong</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>others</u>:”<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><u>Among</u> simply means “mingled with or
in the same group or class” or “in or through the midst of “<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, paragraph 8 thereof on General Averments states that:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos, together with other
Defendants, acting singly or collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one
another, in flagrant breach of public trust and of their fiduciary obligations
as public officers, with gross and scandalous abuse of right and power and in
brazen violation of the Constitution and laws of the Philippines, embarked upon
a systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth.  Among others, in furtherance of said plan and acting in unlawful
concert with one another and with gross abuse of power and authority, x x<b> </b>x.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and paragraph 9 states:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“(9)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Among the assets
acquired by Defendants in the manner above-described and discovered by the
Commission in the exercise of its official responsibilities are funds and other
property listed in Annex “A” hereof and made an integral part of this
complaint.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Finally, paragraphs 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17
enumerate five (5) causes of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier noted, of the eighteen (18) corporations enumerated in
Annex “A” of the complaint, only SEVEN (7) are parties to the Deed of
Assignment as ASSIGNORS therein.  Also
listed in said Annex “A” are (1) frozen bank accounts and other assets of
defendant Placido E. Mapa, Jr., (2) frozen bank accounts and other assets of
defendant Cesar Zalamea, and (3) all other assets of <u>all</u> defendants
sequestered and/or frozen by the Commission pursuant to Executive Order Nos. 1
and 2.  The averments earlier mentioned
and the deed of assignment, juxtaposed with Annex “A,” show <i><span style="">prima facie </span></i>that (a) the
Petitioner did not intend to enter into any amicable settlement with the
remaining eleven (11) corporations or regarding the frozen assets listed in
said Annex “A,” and (b) the assets of the defendants in the said eleven
corporations were not necessarily obtained through or as a consequence of the
acts or transactions described in subparagraphs (a) to (f), paragraph 11 of the
Expanded Complaint, but probably through “the other devices, schemes or
stratagems.” Otherwise, these remaining corporations should have been made
parties to the deed of assignment.  <i><span style="">Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">For another, it is not true that De Venecia is the <u>principal</u>
<u>party</u> either in the specific acts described in subparagraphs (a) to (f),
paragraph 11 of the Expanded Complaint or in the other “devices, schemes or
strategems.” If, at all, there are principal party defendants in Civil Case No.
0020, then a reading of the Expanded Complaint readily reveals that they are
Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos.  Of course, there are allegations of conspiracy which, for purposes of
the nature of the action pursued, must be understood to be civil conspiracy,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
as distinguished from conspiracy in criminal law.<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is it true that De Venecia is an indispensable party with
respect to the acts or transactions subject of the causes of action.  An indispensable party is defined as one
without whom the action cannot be finally determined, whose interest in the
subject matter of the suit and in the relief sought is so intertwined with that
of the other parties that his legal presence as a party to the proceeding is an
absolute necessity.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a> No
valid judgment can be rendered where an indispensable party is not impleaded or
brought before the court;<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a> his
non-inclusion in a case is a fatal defect and any judgment rendered therein
would be ineffective.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, it is clear that De Venecia is not an
indispensable party because a final determination of the case can be had
without his legal presence.  Since the
defendants in Civil Case No. 0020 are sued for (a) <u>collective</u> or
conspirational and (b) <u>individual</u> acts, it follows that the nature of
their corresponding obligations to the Petitioner could be joint and several as
to the first and individual or personal as to the second.  And if they are solidarily liable, it cannot
be successfully maintained that De Venecia is an indispensable party.  Article 1216 of the Civil Code provides
that:</p>

<blockquote>“The creditor may proceed against any one of the solidary debtors
or some or all of them simultaneously.  The demand made against one of them shall not be an obstacle to those which
may subsequently be directed against the others, so long as the debt had not
been fully collected.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Hence, a solidary debtor is not an
indispensable party.  We held so
categorically in <i><span style="">Republic </span>vs.
Sandiganbayan,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a> a
case which also involves an action for reconveyance, reversion, accounting,
restitution and damages filed with the Sandiganbayan against Alfredo (Bejo)
Romualdez, Ferdinand E. Marcos, Imelda R. Marcos, Jose P. Campos, Jr. and 45
other defendants.  In the said case, we
set aside the challenged resolution of the Sandiganbayan denying a motion to
drop defendant Campos, Jr.  We stated
that since the Presidential Commission on Good Government had granted immunity
to Jose Y. Campos and his family, such immunity necessarily extended to movant
Jose Campos, Jr., who is the son of Jose Y. Campos.  <i>Inter alia, </i>we noted:</p>

<blockquote>“The fact that Campos, Jr. and all the other defendants were
charged solidarily in the complaint does not make him an indispensable
party.  We have ruled in the case of <i><span style="">Operators </span></i><i><span style="">Incorporated </span></i><i><span style="">vs. American Biscuit Co., Inc., </span></i>[154
SCRA 738 (1987)] that ‘Solidarity does not make a solidary obligor an
indispensable party in a suit filed by the creditor.’ Article 1216 of the Civil
Code says that the creditor ‘may proceed against anyone of the solidary debtors
or some or all of them simultaneously.’“</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming for the sake of argument that De Venecia is indeed
a principal party, still, based on a principle of tort upon which the cause of
action is also predicated, his release did not operate to release the other
tortfeasors.  Under American
jurisprudence, three rules have developed which deal with the question of
whether the release of one joint tortfeasor releases other tortfeasors who are
not parties to or named in the release.  The first is the ancient common-law rule that a release of one joint
tortfeasor releases all other parties jointly liable, regardless of the intent
of the parties.  The second, otherwise
known as the “First Restatement rule,” states that a release of one co-conspirator
normally releases all others unless the plaintiff expressly reserves his rights
against the others.  The third provides
that the effect of the release upon co­-conspirators shall be determined in
accordance with the intentions of the parties.  In <i>Zenith </i><i><span style="">Radio </span>Corp.
vs. </i><i><span style="">Hazeltine </span>Research,
Inc.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>the Supreme Court of the United States adopted the third rule thus:</p>

<blockquote>“We recently adopted the final rule giving effect to the intentions
of the parties in Aro Mfg. Co. vs. Convertible Top Co., supra, a patent infringement
case.  x x x We concluded that a
release, ‘which clearly intends to save the releasor’s rights against a past
contributory infringer, does not automatically surrender those rights.’</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">x </span>x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The straightforward rule is that a party
releases only those other parties whom he intends to release.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court observed that “[t]o adopt the
ancient common-law rule would frustrate ... partial settlements, and thereby
promote litigation, while adoption of the First Restatement rule would create a
trap for unwary plaintiffs’ attorneys.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the release of De Venecia is clearly
intended to apply only to him.  There
was, evidently, no intent to spread the benefit to the other tortfeasors.</p>

<p class="BODY">For still another reason, the “admissions” by the Petitioner in
paragraph 8 of the deed of assignment that the guaranty facility in favor of
the Assignors “was obtained in the ordinary and regular course of business,”
that “no favor was accorded to the Landoil officers in the grant” thereof and
that the business reversals experienced by the Landoil Group in connection with
its various construction and other projects were due to the special reasons
therein enumerated are not equivalent to an admission that De Venecia’s
co-defendants incurred no liability whatsoever with respect thereto.  That the facility was obtained in such
manner with no favor to the Landoil officers do not, by themselves, clear the
Board of Directors or the officers of the Philguarantee from any liability which
could have arisen from the grant of the guaranty facility.  Private respondents were not sued as
directors or officers of a private corporation, but as government officials who
under the Constitution were obliged to serve with the highest degree of responsibility,
integrity, loyalty, and efficiency and to remain accountable to the people.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, if it were the intention of the parties in the deed of assignment to
accord to the private respondents the same benefit as that granted to De
Venecia, they could have easily done so without loss of time or effort.  Better yet, the parties could have
explicitly stipulated that, in consideration of the assignment made by the
Assignors, the Petitioner shall (a) lift the sequestration issued against
Landoil and (b) dismiss Civil Case No. 0020.  It is evident from the deed of assignment that the only non-signatory
thereto who is to be benefited thereby is defendant De Venecia.  That favor granted him is known as a
stipulation <i><span style="">pour autrui </span></i>under
Article 1311 of the Civil Code as the Sandiganbayan correctly stated in its
Resolution of 8 September 1989 granting De Venecia’s amended motion to dismiss.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
Under the said article, for such a stipulation to be effective and binding it
is necessary that the contracting parties “must have clearly and deliberately
conferred a favor upon a third person.”<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a> A
“mere incidental benefit or interest of a person is not sufficient.” The deed
of assignment in question fails to even remotely suggest such a grant in favor
of the private respondents, and for the Sandiganbayan to read into the document
that which the parties themselves have not even thought of would be to
stipulate for the parties, which is beyond its power to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, these “admissions” are contained in the “whereas”
clauses or in the recital part of the Deed of Assignment and are inconsistent
with the following provisions in the operative part thereof, to wit:  (1) the ASSIGNORS shall transfer to the
ASSIGNEE all the capital shares of Landoil (up to 45% of the capital stock)
identified as belonging to Marcos; (2) the ASSIGNORS shall fully cooperate with
the PCGG or any government agency in the prosecution of any case to be filed
against Marcos and his cronies; and (3) the dismissal of Civil Case No. 0020
against the ASSIGNORS and De Venecia shall be without prejudice, and the case
shall be deemed automatically reinstated in the event of the ASSIGNORS’
non-compliance with any of their obligations.  These obligations are, in fact, consistent with the 14th to 16th causes
of action enumerated in the Expanded Complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">These “admissions” are merely embodied in the recital part of the
deed.  It is a settled rule in the
construction of contracts that in case of a conflict between the operative part
of a contract and the recitals thereof, the former will prevail.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>  The recitals are but merely introductory and
prefatory statements of a deed and are not an essential part of the operating
portions of the contract.  They may be
used as a guide in interpreting ambiguous portions of the operative part, but
cannot supersede the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the Sandiganbayan’s grave abuse of discretion became
more pronounced insofar as the challenged resolutions benefit defendant
Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos.  They are the principal <i><span style="">dramatis
personae </span></i>in Civil Case No. 0020, and the allegations in the Expanded
Complaint do not limit the causes of action against them to transactions
involving Philguarantee which, if proven, do not at all, by any standard, make
them the least culpable.  As a matter of
fact, the ASSIGNORS in the deed of assignment admit that approximately 45% of
the outstanding capital stock of the flagship corporation, Landoil Resources
Corporation, and through the latter, “a proportionate portion of the
outstanding capital stock of the six other corporations” are owned by defendant
Ferdinand E. Marcos.  Since the
remaining eleven (11) corporations listed in Annex “A” of the Expanded
Complaint are not parties to the deed of assignment, the allegations with
respect thereto as against the Marcoses stand.  It must, however, be stressed that, because of his death, Ferdinand E.
Marcos had been substituted in Civil Case No. 0020 by his heirs pursuant to the
Sandiganbayan’s Resolution of 16 November 1989.  Accordingly, he ceased to be a party and the challenged
resolutions are, insofar as he is concerned, ineffective.  Be that as it may, the error committed by
the Sandiganbayan in granting him such unusual benefit compounded the
arbitrariness of the resolutions.  Finally, as an additional <i><span style="">indicium
</span></i>of such arbitrariness, although under the deed of assignment the
dismissal of the case against the Assignors and De Venecia was to be “without
prejudice,” the challenged dismissal against the latter’s co-defendants was
without qualification.</p>

Jamison <i>vs</i>. Franklin Life Insurance Co., 136 P. 2d 265 (Ariz. Sup. Ct.
1943).  The same rule applies to a
statute.  <u>Whereas</u> clauses do not
form a part thereof, strictly speaking; they are not part of the operative
language of the statute; they are, nonetheless, helpful to the extent that they
articulate the general purpose or reason underlying a new enactment.  (Llamado <i>vs</i>. Court of Appeals, 174
SCRA 566 [1989]).</p>
