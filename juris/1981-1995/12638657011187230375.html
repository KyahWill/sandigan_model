				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In POEA Case No. 85-06-0394, the Philippine Overseas Employment
Administration (POEA) promulgated a decision on <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1986</st1:date> dismissing the complaint for money claims
for lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision was
appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), which on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1987</st1:date> reversed the POEA
decision and ordered <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span> Construction and Trading
Co., Inc. (the recruiter) and <span class="SpellE">Arieb</span> Enterprises (the
foreign employer) to jointly and severally pay private respondent the peso
equivalent of $16,039.00, as salary differentials, and $2,420.03, as vacation
leave benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was elevated to
the Supreme Court, but the petition was dismissed on <st1:date year="1987" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1987</st1:date> and entry of judgment was made on
<st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A writ of execution was issued by the POEA but it <span style="">was returned </span><span style="">unsatisfied as </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Philsa</span></span><span style=""> was </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">longer operating </span>and was financially incapable of satisfying the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent moved for
the issuance of an alias writ against the officers of <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This motion was opposed by the officers, led
by petitioner, the president and general manager of the corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="2">February 12, 1988</st1:date>,
the POEA issued a resolution, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of which read:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, let an alias Writ of Execution be
issued and the handling sheriff is ordered to execute against the properties of
Mr. Francisco V. del Rosario and <span style="">if </span>insufficient,
against the cash and/or surety bond of Bonding Company concerned for the full
satisfaction of the judgment awarded.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1988</st1:date>,
the NLRC dismissed the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1988</st1:date>, petitioner's
motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this petition was filed on <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1988</st1:date>, alleging that the NLRC gravely abused
its discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1988</st1:date>, the Court issued a temporary
restraining order enjoining the enforcement of the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1988</st1:date>
and resolution dated <st1:date year="1988" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was given due course on <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the undisputed facts and the arguments raised
in the pleadings, the Court finds grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action of the NLRC affirming the issuance of an alias writ of
execution against petitioner, on the theory that the corporate personality of <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span> should be disregarded, was founded primarily on the
following findings of the POEA -</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per the certification
issued by the Licensing Division of this Office, it appears that <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span> Construction &amp; Trading Co., Inc., with office
address at 126 Pioneer St., <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, Metro
Manila, represented by Mr. Francisco V. del Rosario, President and General
Manager, was formerly a registered construction contractor whose authority was
originally issued on July 21, 1978 but was already <span class="SpellE">delisted</span>
from the list of agencies/entities on August 15, 1986 for inactivity;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per another certification
issued by the Licensing Division of this Office, it also appears that another
corporation, <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span> International Placement &amp;
Services Corp, composed of practically the same set of
incorporators/stockholders, was registered as a licensed private employment
agency whose license was issued on November 5, 1981, represented by the same
Mr. Francisco V. del Rosario as its President/General Manager.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and an application of the ruling of the
Court in <u>A.C.</u> <u><span style="">Ransom</span></u><span style=""> <u>Labor Union-CCLU</u> </span><u>v</u>. <u><span style="">NLRC</span></u><span style="">, </span>G.R. No. 69494, June 10, 1986, 142 SCRA 269.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, we find that the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
reliance on the findings of the POEA and the ruling in <u><span style="">A.C</span></u><span style="">. <u>Ransom</u> </span>is totally misplaced.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the law a
corporation is bestowed juridical personality, separate and distinct from its
stockholders [Civil Code, Art. 44; Corporation Code, sec. 2.] But when the
juridical personality of the corporation is used to defeat public convenience,
justify wrong, protect fraud or defend crime, the corporation shall be
considered as a mere association of persons [Koppel (Phil.), Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>, 77 Phil. 496 (1946), citing 1 Fletcher, Cyclopedia
of Corporations, 135-136; <u><span style="">see</span></u><span style=""> </span>also <span class="SpellE">Palay</span>,
Inc. v. Clave, G.R. No. 56076, September 21, 1983, 124 SCRA 638], and its
responsible officers and/or stockholders shall be held individually liable [<span class="SpellE">Namarco</span> v. Associated Finance Co., Inc., G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-20886, </span><st1:date year="1967" day="27" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 27, 1967</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 19 SCRA 962.]</span>
For the same reasons, a corporation shall be liable for the obligations of a
stockholder [<span class="SpellE">Palacio</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Fely</span>
Transportation Company, G.R. No. L-15121, <st1:date year="1962" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1962</st1:date>, 5 SCRA 1011; Emilio Cano Enterprises,
Inc. v. Court of Industrial Relations, G.R. No. L-20502, <st1:date year="1965" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1965</st1:date>, 13 SCRA 290], or a corporation
and its successor-in-interest shall be considered as one and the liability of
the former shall attach to the latter [Koppel v. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>,
<u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">; </span>Liddell &amp; <st1:place>Co.</st1:place>
v. Collector of Internal Revenue, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-9687, </span><st1:date year="1961" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 30, 1961</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 2 SCRA 632.]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">But for the separate juridical personality of a corporation to be
disregarded, the wrongdoing must be clearly and convincingly established.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be presumed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard we find the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
decision wanting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion that <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span> allowed its license to expire so as to evade payment
of private respondent's claim is not supported by the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Philsa's</span> corporate
personality therefore remains inviolable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consider the following undisputed facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent
filed his complaint with the POEA on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="6">June
 4, 1985</st1:date>;</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last renewal of <span class="SpellE">Philsa's</span> license expired on <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1985</st1:date>;</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The POEA dismissed
private respondent's complaint on <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1986</st1:date>;</p>

<p class="BODY">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Philsa</span>
was <span class="SpellE">delisted</span> for inactivity on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1986</st1:date>;<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">(5)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dismissal of the
complaint was appealed to the NLRC and it was only on <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1987</st1:date> that the judgment awarding
differentials and benefits to private respondent was rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, at the time <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span> allowed its
license to lapse in 1985 and even at the time it was <span class="SpellE">delisted</span>
in 1986, there was <span class="GramE">yet</span> no judgment in favor of private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">An intent</span>
to evade payment of his claims cannot therefore be implied from the expiration
of <span class="SpellE">Philsa's</span> license and its delisting.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither will the organization of <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span>
International Placement and Services Corp. and its registration with the POEA
as a private employment agency imply fraud since it was organized and
registered in 1981, several years before private respondent filed his complaint
with the POEA in 1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The creation of
the second corporation could not therefore have been in anticipation of private
respondent's money claims and the consequent adverse judgment against <span class="SpellE">Philsa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, substantial identity of the incorporators of the two
corporations does not necessarily imply fraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">The circumstances of this case distinguish it from those in
earlier decisions of the Court in labor cases where the veil of corporate
fiction was pierced.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>La</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Campana</u></span> <u>Coffee</u>
<u>Factory</u>, <u>Inc</u>. <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Kaisahan</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>ng</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Manggagawa</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>sa</u></span></span> <u>La</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Campana</u></span> (<u>KKM</u>), 93 Phil. 160 (1953), La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Coffee Factory, Inc. and La <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gaugau</span> Packing were substantially owned by the same
person.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They had one office, one
management, and a single payroll for both businesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The laborers of the <span class="SpellE"><u>gaugau</u></span>
factory and the coffee factory were also interchangeable, i.e., the workers in
one factory worked also in the other factory.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><u>In</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Claparols</u></span>
<u>v</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Industrial</u> <u>Relations</u>, G.R. No.</span>
L-30822, July 31, 1975, 65 SCRA 613, the <span class="SpellE">Claparols</span>
Steel and Nail Plant, which was ordered to pay its workers <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
ceased operations on June 30, 1957 <span style="">and
was </span>succeeded <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>next</u> <u>day</u>, July 1, 1957
by the <span class="SpellE">Claparols</span> Steel Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both corporations were substantially owned
and controlled by the same person and there was no break or cessation in
operations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, all the assets of
the steel and nail plant were transferred to the new corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, we
also find that, contrary to the NLRC'S holding, the ruling in <u>A.C. Ransom</u>
is inapplicable to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>A.C.</u> <u>Ransom</u>, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>. . . In the instant case, it would appear that RANSOM, in 1969,
foreseeing the possibility or probability of payment of back wages to the 22
strikers, organized <st1:city><st1:place>ROSARIO</st1:place></st1:city> to
replace RANSOM, with the latter to be eventually phased out if the 22 strikers
win their case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RANSOM actually ceased
operations on <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1973</st1:date>,
after the <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1972</st1:date>
Decision of the Court of Industrial Relations was promulgated against RANSOM. <span class="GramE">[At p. 274.]</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The distinguishing marks of fraud were therefore clearly apparent
in <u>A.C.</u> <u>Ransom</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A new
corporation was created, owned by the same family, engaging in the same
business and operating in the same compound.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, considering that the non-payment of the workers was <span style="">a </span>continuing situation, the Court
adjudged its President, the "responsible officer" of the corporation,
personally liable for the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> awarded, he being
the chief operation officer or "manager" who could be held criminally
liable for violations of Republic Act No. 602 (the old Minimum Wage Law.)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case now before us, not only has there been a failure to
establish fraud, but it has also not been shown that petitioner is the
corporate officer responsible for private respondent's predicament.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be emphasized that the claim for
differentials and benefits was actually directed against the foreign
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Philsa</span>
became liable only because of its undertaking to be jointly and severally bound
with the foreign employer, an undertaking required by the rules of the POEA
[Rule II, sec. 1(d) (3)], together with the filing of cash and surety bonds
[Rule II, sec. 4], in order to ensure that overseas workers shall find
satisfaction for awards in their favor.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the Court finds it appropriate to p<span style="">oint </span>out <span style="">that </span>a judgment against a recruiter should initially be enforced
against the cash and surety bonds filed with the POEA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As provided in the POEA Rules and Regulations
-</p>

<blockquote>. . . The bonds shall answer for all valid and legal claims arising
from violations of the conditions for the grant and use of the license or
authority and contracts of employment. The bonds shall likewise guarantee
compliance with the provisions of the Labor Code and its implementing rules and
regulations relating to recruitment and placement, the rules of the
Administration and relevant issuances of the Ministry and all liabilities which
the Administration may impose. . . .<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>[Rule II, sec. 4.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Quite evidently, these bonds do not answer for a single specific
liability, but for all sorts of liabilities of the recruiter to the worker and
to the POEA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the obligations
guaranteed by the bonds are continuing.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the bonds are subject to replenishment when they are garnished,
and failure to replenish shall cause the suspension or cancellation of the
recruiter's license [Rule II, sec. 19.] Furthermore, a cash bond shall be
refunded to a recruiter who surrenders his license only upon posting of a
surety bond of similar amount valid for three (3) years [Rule II, sec. 20.] <span class="GramE">All these, to ensure recovery from the recruiter.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore surprising why the POEA ordered execution
"against the properties of Mr. Francisco V. del Rosario <u>and</u> <u>if</u>
<u>insufficient</u>, <u>against</u> <u>the</u> <u>cash</u> <u>and/or</u> <u>surety</u>
<u>bond</u> <u>of</u> <u>Bonding</u> <u>Company</u> <u>concerned</u> for the
full satisfaction of the judgment awarded" in complete disregard of the
scheme outlined in the POEA Rules and Regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score alone, the NLRC should not have
affirmed the POEA.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED and the decision and
resolution of the NLRC, dated September 23, 1988 and October 21, 1988,
respectively, in POEA Case No. 85-06-0394 are SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining order issued by the
