				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There was no eyewitness to the actual killing of the one year and
five month old victim in this case.  A
resort to circumstantial evidence thus became a necessity.  The prosecution ascertained the guilt of the
accused-appellant through the testimonies of the mother of the victim, the aunt
of the victim, a neighbor and the doctor, who provided facts of such nature
from which the trial court was led, by a process of deductive reasoning
inferred from proven facts pieced together the accused-appellant's guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant, Manuel Magtuloy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">y </span>Montaray, 19 years old, was charged with the crime of murder in
Criminal Case No. C-37869(91) before the Regional Trial Court, National Capital
Judicial Region, Branch 126, Kalookan City.  The information filed in said case reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 16th day of June, 1991 in Kalookan City,
Metro Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, without any justifiable cause, with deliberate intent to
kill, with treachery, evident premeditation and abuse of superior strength, did
then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack and beat one ARTURO
CALIWAG, Jr., who is a minor of one (1) year and five (5) months, thereby
inflicting upon the latter serious physical injuries, which injuries directly
caused the victim's death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CONTRARY TO LAW."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment on July 29, 1991, the accused-appellant entered
the plea of not guilty.  Thereafter,
trial on the merits ensued.  On March
30, 1992, the trial court rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">its </span>decision
based on circumstantial evidence, the dispositive portion of which reads, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered finding MANUEL

him to suffer the penalty of Reclusion Perpetua with the accessories provided
by law and to pay the cost.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused is further ordered to indemnify the surviving mother of
the victim in the amount of P50,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case
of insolvency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused who is presently under detention in the City Jail,
Kalookan City, is immediately ordered to be transferred to the National

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case, as culled from the brief filed by the Office
of the Solicitor General are, as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Betty Mirallo Vda. de Caliwag and her son Arturo Caliwag, Jr., a
minor one year and five months old, together with her live-in-partner of four
months, herein appellant, resided at Peralta Street, Maligaya Park, Novaliches,
Kalookan City at the time material to the case at bar.  Ever since appellant moved in with Betty
Mirallo four months earlier, appellant, who had no work, took care of Betty's
son whenever she was in Cubao selling <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">siopao</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At 8:00 o'clock in the morning of June 16, 1991, Betty Mirallo,
after an argument with appellant, left her son in appellant's care as she had
to go to Cubao to sell <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">siopao</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and softdrinks.  Appellant and the child were the only ones
left in the house (TSN, August 12,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>1991,
p. 5; TSN, November 6, 1991, p. 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">At 11:30 of the same morning, appellant, carrying the child
Arturo Caliwag, Jr. who appeared to be dead, approached his neighbor,
Cristituto Abrazaldo, and said: 'Kuya, help me.  If the child dies, I will be blamed.' When Abrazaldo touched the
child's stomach, blood came out of his mouth.  Abrazaldo then told appellant to bring the child to a doctor (TSN,
August 19, 1991, p. 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">When Betty Mirallo arrived at the hospital where her son was
pronounced dead, appellant approached her and asked for forgiveness (TSN,
August 12, 1991, p. 13).  An autopsy
examination revealed that Arturo Caliwag, Jr. sustained a <u>hematoma</u> or
external injury on the left chest and the left jaw (TSN, August 28, 1991, p.
7).  The <u>hematoma</u>, caused by a dulled
instrument such as a fist blow or a piece of wood, resulted in a laceration of
the right auricle of the heart causing internal bleeding and then shock (TSN,
August 28, 1991, pp. 16, 19).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Lydia Mirallo de Dios, aunt of the victim, testified that during
the wake, the accused-appellant intimated to her that he slapped the victim
which caused the latter to hit the door and fall down the stairs.  After learning about it, she caused the
arrest of the accused-appellant.  While
they were inside the police car on the way to the police station, the
accused-appellant asked for her help and forgiveness.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused-appellant raised as sole error of the
trial court in holding: "X X X THAT THE PROSECUTION HAS SATISFACTORILY
PROVED THE GUILT OF THE APPELLANT BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE; HENCE IT ERRED WHEN IT CONVICTED APPELLANT."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In particular, the accused-appellant asseverates that the
established facts enumerated by the trial court in its questioned decision are
insufficient to form a solid basis for his conviction without transgressing his
constitutional right on the presumption of innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the version of the fact that the accused-appellant left
their house and when he returned, saw the victim at the foot of the stairs
already bleeding, and even assuming the correctness of the doctor's finding
that the victim suffered from violence the question that nags our mind is did
the victim accidentally fall from the stairs or was he thrown down the stairs.  If he was thrown down the stairs who is the
person responsible?  Is it the
accused-appellant?</p>

<p class="BODY">That the accused-appellant was responsible for the victim's death
is open to serious question according to the defense on the basis of the
following facts:  a) he was the one who
brought the victim to their neighbor, Cristituto Abrazaldo, asking for help; b)
upon advice of Abrazaldo, the accused-appellant brought the victim to the
hospital; and c) while the victim was lying in state at their house, he stood
vigil together with other friends and sympathizers.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General is not
convinced that the accused-appellant had nothing to do with the victim's death.</p>

<p class="BODY">After reviewing the evidence on record.  We find the Solicitor General's misgiving about the
accused-appellant's pretended innocence correct and concur with the findings
and conclusions of the court below in convicting him.</p>

<p class="BODY">In finding the accused-appellant liable for the death of the
victim, the trial court relied on the following established circumstantial
evidence:</p>

<blockquote>"1) That accused Manuel Magtuloy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">y </span>Montaray and private complainant Betty Mirallo vda. de Caliwag
are live-in partners and that the  couple lived in Betty Mirallo vda. de Caliwag's house in Maligaya Park,
Novaliches, Kalookan City, together with her son (victim), one (1) and five (5)
months old Arturo Caliwag, Jr.;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) That it was also established that the care and custody of Arturo
Caliwag, Jr. was left to the accused whenever the mother goes to Cubao to vend
siopao and cold drinks;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) That the child is not the son of the accused but the child of
Betty Mirallo vda. de Caliwag alone <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">by </span>her
deceased spouse;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4) That Betty Mirallo vda. de Caliwag trusted the accused with the
custody of her son;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5) That the house of Betty Mirallo vda. de Caliwag has no stairs
and that you only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">take </span>one step
in reaching the flooring of her shanty;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6) That the medico-legal officer, P/Capt. Florante F. Baltazar of
the PNP Crime Laboratory testified that if a child falls from the floor to the
ground at a height of one (1) meter, it will not produce hematoma or 'pasa' and
that if a child falls on a hard pavement instead of a sandy or muddy ground,
his conclusion will still be the same, that no hematoma will be produced
considering that there was no other injury in the body of the victim;</blockquote>

<blockquote>7) That on that fateful day (June 16, 1991) the accused and the
victim were left alone in the house with the child still asleep."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Betty Mirallo vda. de Caliwag testified that there were
several occasions when the accused maltreated her and the child.  She said that she did not go to the police
to report such maltreatments because the accused begged her forgiveness.  On one occasion, she claimed she went home
and saw the accused boxing her child and that she brought her son to the doctor
who just gave her receipts (sic) for medicine but she did not secure a medical
certificate because she did not know that this will happen.  This point was not rebutted by the defense.  The senseless and brutal killing of the
victim by the accused is not without motive at all.  The surviving mother courageously stated that she and the accused
quarreled on that day (June 16, 1991) because she had told the accused that she
and her child were going home to her province in the Visayas and that the
accused apparently did not like the idea.  She said that despite this misunderstanding, she sill left her son to
the accused and went to work because they had nothing to eat and in fact, the
night before, they did not have supper.  She and her son were supposed to have left for the Visayas the following
day, June 17, 1991.  To this, failure on
the part of the accused to refute it is fatal to his defense."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The entire records and proven facts of the case yield the
inescapable conclusion that the prosecution's evidence, albeit circumstantial,
is of a sufficient quantum to establish the guilt of the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
There is more than one circumstance.  The facts from which the inferences are derived are proven.  The combination of all the circumstances is
such as to produce a conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following circumstantial evidence is crucial:  1) the victim was not the son of the
accused-appellant but of Betty Mirallo vda. de Caliwag by her deceased husband;
2) on several occasions, he maltreated not only the mother of the victim but
also the victim himself; 3) in the morning of June 16, 1991, he quarreled with
the mother of the victim; 4) he and the victim were left alone in the house on
the same date; and 5) while they were in the hospital he asked forgiveness from
the mother of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second and third circumstances, We have held
that if there is doubt as to whether the defendant is or is not the person who
committed an act, the existence or non-existence of a motive for the doing of
the act is a circumstantial evidence leading to the inference that he is or is
not the author of the act done.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> In
addition, while evidence that one did or did not do a certain thing at one time
is not admissible to prove that he did or did not do the same or a similar
thing at another time, it may be received to prove a specific intent or
knowledge, identity, plan, system, scheme, habit, custom or usage, and the
like.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the records that the accused-appellant could not
get along with the victim's mother.  Quarrels between the two were frequent.  On occasions like this the accused-appellant usually vented his anger on
the victim.  In the morning of June 16,
1991, the victim's mother and the accused-appellant again quarreled simply
because he did not like the idea that she and the victim will be going home to
her province in the Visayas.  The
accused-appellant failed utterly to refute this testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the testimony of the mother of the victim
credible:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x,  the Court
considers the testimony of the mother of the victim as more truthful and
consistent with the natural course of things and human experience.  The Court also noted the preciseness of the
testimony of the mother and her being able to answer the questions directly and
she can even remember what day it was when they were supposed to leave for the
province.  The testimony of the mother
is simple and straightforward and is therefore believable than that of the
accused.  In fine, the testimony of the
mother is found by this Court as in conformity to knowledge and common
experience of mankind.  (People vs.
Salcedo, G.R. No. 86975, March 18, 1991)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It is a fundamental rule that conclusions
and findings of fact by the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal
and should not be disturbed unless for strong and cogent reasons because it is
in a better position to observe the demeanor of witnesses while testifying in
the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Turning now to the arguments of the accused-appellant:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) The accused-appellant does not dispute that on June 16, 1991,
he and the victim were left alone in the house, with the latter still
asleep.  According to him, he left the
house later and when he returned, he saw the victim at the foot of the stairs
of their house already bleeding.  The
existence of a stair, however, is belied by his own admission on
cross-examination that there were no stairs in their house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the accused-appellant's testimony is uncorroborated as
he is the only witness presented by the defense.  The absence of corroborative witnesses leads to the finding that
the defense version was simply a concoction devoid of any credibility.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2) The accused-appellant likewise submits that if he indeed
committed the act imputed to him he would not have brought the victim to their
neighbor, witness Abrazaldo, asking for help; nor bring him to the hospital; or
stayed in their house and stood vigil while the victim was lying in state.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant's simulated innocence is clearly <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">non sequitur </span></i>to his decision not
to flee.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Apart from the fact that there is no case law holding that non-flight is
conclusive proof of innocence,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> We
view these seemingly sympathetic acts as <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">indicia </span></i>of the accused-appellant's remorse for the serious
consequence of his wrongdoing, taking into consideration the testimonies of
Betty Mirallo Vda. de Caliwag that while she was in the hospital, he asked for
her forgiveness and that of Lydia Mirallo de Dios that while they were inside
the police car going to the police station, he likewise asked for her
forgiveness.  The accused?appellant's
unusually submissive stance when he was arrested destroys further his alleged
innocence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross-examination, he declared "that he did not say anything nor shout
or protest when he was put to jail because the aunt of the child slapped him at
the back; that he did not complain because he was afraid of rumors that he was
a sadist."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
His self-serving declarations do not detract from the circumstantial evidence
on record pointing to his culpability for the death of the victim.  In relation to his live-in partner and the
victim, he was a brute, that it is inconceivable that a mere slap on his back
by the sister of her live-in partner and rumors that he was a sadist cowed him
into protecting his innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly appreciated the qualifying circumstance
of treachery because when a person attacks a child of tender years treachery is
present, even if the manner of attack is not shown.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused-appellant was 19 years old while the victim was 1 year and 5 months
old.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the trial court erred in appreciating the aggravating
circumstances of abuse of superior strength and evident premeditation.  Abuse of superior strength is deemed
absorbed in treachery and cannot be separately considered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Evident premeditation may not be appreciated absent any proof as to how and
when the plan to kill was hatched or what time elapsed before it was carried
out.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 248 of the Revised Penal Code provides that the crime of
murder is punishable by <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reclusion
temporal</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>in its
maximum period to death.  Inasmuch as
there are neither aggravating nor mitigating circumstances that attended the
commission of the crime, the penalty that should be imposed on the
accused-appellant is the medium period of the penalty prescribed by said
article, conformably with Article 64 of the Revised Penal Code, or <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>Notwithstanding Our previous finding
that the aggravating circumstances of abuse of superior strength and evident
premeditation should not be appreciated in this case, the proper penalty is
