Restraining Order/Preliminary Injunction, dated June 1, 1986 (Annex H) and
which strike Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Tumamak</span> held as illegal in a Decision dated August 5, 1986

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid decision of then Director <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span>
was thereafter reversed by respondent director in her <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
decision which is now assailed in this action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A motion for reconsideration of ALU<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
appears to have been disregarded, hence its present resort grounded on grave
abuse of discretion by public respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent ordered the holding of a certification election,
ruling that the "contract bar rule" relied upon by her predecessor
does not apply in the present controversy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>According to the decision of said respondent, the collective bargaining
agreement involved herein is defective because it "was not duly submitted
in accordance with Section I, Rule IX, <span class="GramE">Book</span> V of the
Implementing Rules of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 130".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was further observed that "(t<span class="GramE">)here</span> is no proof
tending to show that the CBA has been posted in at least two conspicuous places
in the establishment at least five days before its ratification and that it has
been ratified by the majority of the employees in the bargaining unit".</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no reversible error in the challenged decision of
respondent director.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A careful
consideration of the facts culled from the records of this case, especially the
allegations of petitioner itself as hereinabove quoted, yields the conclusion
that the collective bargaining agreement in question is indeed defective, hence
unproductive of the legal effects attributed to it by the former director in
his decision which was subsequently and properly reversed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have previously held that the mechanics of collective
bargaining are set in motion only when the following jurisdictional
preconditions are present, namely, (1) possession of the status of majority
representation by the employees’ representative in accordance with any of the
means of selection and/or designation provided for by the Labor Code; (2) proof
of majority representation; and (3) a demand to bargain under Article 251,
paragraph (a), of the New Labor Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, the standing of petitioner as an exclusive bargaining
representative is dubious, to say the least.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It may be recalled that respondent company, in a letter dated <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1986</st1:date> and addressed to
petitioner, merely indicated that it was "not against the desire of (its)
workers" and required petitioner to present proof that it was supported by
the majority thereof in a meeting to be held on the same date.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The only express recognition of petitioner as said employees’ bargaining
representative that <span class="GramE">We</span> see in the records is in the
collective bargaining agreement entered into two days thereafter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Evidently, there was precipitate haste on the part of respondent company in
recognizing petitioner union, which recognition appears to have been based on
the self-serving claim of the latter that it had the support of the majority of
the employees in the bargaining unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, at the time of the supposed recognition, the employer was
obviously aware that there were other unions existing in the unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As earlier stated, respondent company's
letter is dated <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1986</st1:date>
while the two other unions, Southern Philippine Federation of Labor (hereafter,
SPFL) and Philippine Social Security Labor Union (PSSLU, for short), went on
strike earlier on <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The unusual promptitude in the recognition of
petitioner union by respondent company as the exclusive bargaining
representative of the workers in GAW Trading, Inc., under the fluid and
amorphous circumstances then obtaining, was decidedly unwarranted and
improvident.</p>

<p class="BODY">It bears mention that even in cases where it was the then
Minister of Labor himself who directly certified the union as the bargaining
representative, this Court voided such certification where there was a failure
to properly determine with legal certainty whether the union enjoyed a majority
representation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the
holding of a certification election at a proper time would not necessarily be a
mere formality as there was a compelling reason not <span class="GramE">to</span>
directly and unilaterally certify a union.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">An additional infirmity of the collective bargaining agreement
involved was the failure to post the same in at least two (2) conspicuous
places in the establishment at least five days before its ratification.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner's rationalization was that "(b<span class="GramE">)<span class="SpellE">ecause</span></span> of the real existence of the illegal strike
staged by SPFL in all the stores of GAW Trading, Inc. it had become impossible
to comply with the posting requirement in so far as the realization of its
purpose is concerned as there were no impartial members of the unit who could
be apprised of the <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span> contents".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
This justification is puerile and unacceptable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the posting of copies of the collective
bargaining agreement is the responsibility of the employer which can easily
comply with the requirement through a mere mechanical act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that there were "no impartial
members of the unit" is immaterial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The purpose of the requirement is precisely to inform the employees in
the bargaining unit of the contents of said agreement so that they could
intelligently decide whether to accept the same or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assembly of the members of ALU wherein
the agreement in question was allegedly explained does not cure the
defect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract is intended for all
the employees and not only for the members of the purported representative
alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may even be said that the need
to inform the non-members of the terms thereof is more exigent and compelling
since, in all likelihood, their contact with the persons who are supposed to
represent them is limited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, to
repeat, there was an apparent and suspicious hurry in the formulation and
finalization of said collective bargaining accord.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the aforementioned letter where respondent
company required petitioner union to present proof of its support by the
employees, the company already suggested that petitioner ALU at the same time
submit the proposals that it intended to embody in the projected agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was on <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1986</st1:date>, and promptly on the following day the
negotiating panel furnished respondent company final copies of the desired
agreement which, with equal dispatch, was signed on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another potent reason for annulling the disputed collective
bargaining agreement is the finding of respondent director that one hundred
eighty-one (181) of the two hundred eighty-one (281) workers who
"ratified" the same now "strongly and vehemently deny and/or
repudiate the alleged negotiation and ratification of the CBA".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Although petitioner claims that only seven (7) of the repudiating group of
workers belong to the total number who allegedly ratified the agreement,
nevertheless such unsubstantiated contention weighed against the factual
findings of the respondent director cannot negate the fact that the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span> contract will not promote industrial
stability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court has long since
declared that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Basic to the contract bar rule is the proposition that
the delay of the right to select representatives can be justified only where
stability is deemed paramount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Excepted
from the contract bar rule are certain types of contracts which do not foster <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">industrial stability, such as contracts where
the identity of the representative is in doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Any stability derived from such contracts must be subordinated to the
employees' freedom of choice because it does not establish the type of
industrial peace contemplated by the law."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, petitioner should be reminded that the
technical rules of procedure do not strictly apply in the adjudication of labor
disputes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, its objection that the evidence with respect to the aforesaid
repudiation of the supposed collective bargaining agreement cannot be
considered for the first time on appeal to the Bureau of Labor Relations should
be disregarded, especially considering the weighty significance thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both petitioner and private respondent GAW Trading, Inc. allege
that the employees of the latter are now enjoying the benefits of the
collective bargaining agreement that both parties had forged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot
find sufficient evidence of record to support this contention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only evidence cited by petitioner is the
supposed payment of union fees by said employees, a premise too tenuous to
sustain the desired conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even the
actual number of workers in the respondent company is not clear from the
records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said private respondent claims
that it is two hundred eighty-one (281)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
but petitioner suggests that it is more than that number.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said parties should be aware that this
Court is not an adjudicator of facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Worse, to borrow a trite but apt phrase, they would heap the <span class="SpellE">Ossa</span> of confusion upon the Pelion of uncertainty and still
expect a definitive ruling on the matter thus confounded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the inapplicability of the contract bar rule is
further underscored by the fact that when the disputed agreement was filed
before the Labor Regional Office on <st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="5">May
 27, 1986</st1:date>, a petition for certification election had already been
filed on <st1:date year="1986" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the petition was not supported by
the signatures of thirty percent (30%) of the workers in the bargaining unit,
the same was enough to initiate said certification election.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">,</span>
the order of the public respondent for the conduct of a certification election
among the rank and file workers of respondent GAW Trading, Inc. is
