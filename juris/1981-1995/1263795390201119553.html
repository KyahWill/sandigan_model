in Ohio, U.S.A., hereinafter called ARMCO-OHIO, obtained from the Philippine
Patent Office, Certificate of Registration No. 11750 for its trademark
consisting of the word "ARMCO" and a triangular device for
"ferrous metals and ferrous metal castings and forgings".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="4">April
 14, 1971</st1:date>, pursuant to trademark rules, the petitioner filed with
the said patent office an "Affidavit of Use" for said trademark,
which was subsequently accepted and for which the Patent Office issued the
corresponding notice of acceptance of "Affidavit of Use".</p>

but on <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1973</st1:date> its
name was changed to ARMCO-<span class="SpellE">Marsteel</span> Alloy Corporation
hereinafter called ARMCO-<span class="SpellE">Marsteel</span>, by amendment of
its Articles of Incorporation after the ARMCO-Ohio purchased 40% of its capital
stock.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both said corporations are
engaged in the manufacture of steel products.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">ARMCO-Ohio and ARMCO-<span class="SpellE">Marsteel</span> then
filed a petition in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to compel
ARMCO-Philippines to change its corporate name on the ground that it is very
similar, if not exactly the same as the name of one of the petitioners, which
is docketed as SEC Case No. 1187.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In due
course an order was issued by the SEC on <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date> granting the petition, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, the respondent, ARMCO STEEL
CORPORATION, is hereby ordered to take out 'ARMCO' and substitute another word
in lieu thereof in its corporate name by amending the articles of incorporation
to that effect, within thirty (30) days from date of receipt of a copy of this
Order; after which, three (3) copies of the amended articles of incorporation,
duly certified by a majority of the board of directors and countersigned by the
president and secretary of the corporation, shall be submitted to this
Commission, together with the corresponding filing fees, as required by
law."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of the said order was filed by said
respondent on <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1975</st1:date>
but this was denied in an order of <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="4">April
 16, 1965</st1:date> as the motion was filed out of time, a copy of the
questioned order having been received by respondent on <st1:date year="1975" day="18" month="2">February 18, 1975</st1:date> so that said order had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> A
motion for reconsideration filed by respondent to set aside said order of <st1:date year="1965" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1965</st1:date> was also denied by the
SEC on <st1:date year="1975" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1975</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
An appeal was interposed by respondent to the Court of Appeals which was
docketed as CA-G.R. No. 04448-R but the appeal was dismissed in a resolution of
January 13, 1976, on the ground that the appeal was perfected beyond the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period allowed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1976</st1:date>
said respondent amended its articles of incorporation by changing its name to
"ARMCO structures, Inc." which was filed with and approved by the
SEC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, in an order of <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1977</st1:date>, the SEC issued an order requiring
respondent, its directors and officers to comply with the aforesaid order of
the Commission of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date>
within ten (10) days from notice thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A manifestation and motion was filed by respondent informing SEC
that it had already changed its corporate name with the approval of the SEC to
ARMCO Structures, Inc. in substantial compliance with the said order or in the
alternative prayed for a hearing to determine if there is a confusing
similarity between the names of the petitioners on one hand and the ARMCO
Structures, Inc. on the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners then filed a comment to said manifestation alleging
that the change of name of said respondent was not done in good faith and is
not in accordance with the order of the Commission of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date> so that drastic action should
be taken against the respondent and its officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, petitioners filed a motion to
cite said respondent, its directors and officers in contempt for disobeying the
orders of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date>
and <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an order of <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1977</st1:date>, the SEC finding that the respondent, its
directors, and officers have not complied with the final order of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date> required them to
appear before the Commission on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="9">September
 22, 1977</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt by
the Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the hearing the parties submitted their respective
memoranda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In another order of January
17, 1979, the SEC finding that the respondent did not make the proper
disclosure of the circumstances when it amended its articles of incorporation
and submitted the same for the approval of the SEC thus said respondent, its
directors, and officers were ordered within ten (10) days from notice to comply
with the order of February 14, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
appeal was interposed by the respondent to the SEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> in an
order of <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1979</st1:date>
dismissed the appeal for lack of merit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the herein petition for review filed by ARMCO-Philippines
wherein it seeks the reversal of the orders of the SEC of December 14, 1979 and
August 6, 1980 and that the order of February 14, 1975 be declared <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> for
having been substantially complied with by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The grounds of the petition are as follows:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT CONSIDER ITS ORDER DATED FEBRUARY 14, 1975 <u>FUNCTUS</u>
<u>OFFICIO</u> PURSUANT TO THE LEGAL MAXIM <u>'CESSANTE</u> <u>LEGIS</u> <u>RATIONE</u>
<u>CESSAT</u> <u>ET</u> <u>IPSA</u> <u>LEX'</u> AFTER PETITIONER HAD
SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED IN GOOD FAITH WITH SAID ORDER AND SAID COMPLIANCE HAD
ACHIEVED THE PURPOSE OF THE ORDER, BY CHANGING ITS CORPORATE NAME WITH THE
APPROVAL OF SAID COMMISSION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COMMISSION ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT FIND
THAT ITS APPROVAL OF PETITIONER'S AMENDED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION CHANGING
PETITIONER'S CORPORATE NAME FROM "ARMCO STEEL CORPORATION" TO
"ARMCO STRUCTURES, INCORPORATED" WAS REGULAR AND LEGAL.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>THE COMMISSION ERRED WHEN IT DID NOT FIND
THAT PRIVATE RESPONDENTS WERE NO LONGER ENTITLED TO THE RELIEF AWARDED BY THE
ORDER DATED <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">FEBRUARY 14, 1975</st1:date>
CONSIDERING THAT SAID ORDER HAD BECOME <u>FUNCTUS</u> <u>OFFICIO</u> AND
FURTHER ENFORCEMENT THEREOF WILL BE INEQUITABLE AS IT WILL DEPRIVE PETITIONER
OF EQUAL PROTECTION OF LAWS.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>THE COMMISSION ERRED WHEN, THERE BEING A
DISPUTE AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE PURPOSE OF THE ORDER DATED FEBRUARY 14, 1975
HAD BEEN COMPLIED WITH AND WHETHER THERE WAS STILL CONFUSING SIMILARITY BETWEEN
THE CORPORATE NAMES OF RESPONDENTS AND THE NEW NAME OF PETITIONER, IT DID NOT
GRANT PETITIONER'S PRAYER THAT A HEARING BE HELD TO THRESH THE ISSUE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds no merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of the public respondent SEC of February 14, 1975 which
has long become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> clearly spells
out that petitioner must "take out ARMCO and substitute another word in
lieu thereof in its corporate name by amending the articles of incorporation to
that effect, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
Far from complying with said order petitioner amended its corporate name into
ARMCO Structures, Inc., and secured its approval by the SEC on <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That this amendment was made by petitioner
without the knowledge of the proper authorities of the SEC is borne by the fact
that thereafter on <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1977</st1:date>
an order was issued by the SEC requiring petitioner, its board of directors,
and officers to comply with the order of the Commission of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the attention of the SEC was called by
petitioner that the change of corporate name had been undertaken by it to ARMCO
Structures, Inc. and asked that it be considered as a substantial compliance
with the order of February 14, 1975, the SEC in its order of January 17, 1979
speaking through its hearing officer Antonio R. <span class="SpellE">Manabat</span>
ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1975</st1:date>, cannot but be clearer than what it purports to require or
demand from respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under in no
distinct terms, it enjoins the <u>removal</u> <u>or</u> <u>deletion</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>word</u> <u>'Armco'</u> <u>from</u> <u>respondent's</u> <u>corporate</u>
<u>name</u>, which was not so complied with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Commission, therefore, cannot give its imprimatur to the new
corporate name because there was no compliance at all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that the Securities and Exchange Commission issued its
certificate of filing of amended articles of incorporation on <st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1976</st1:date>, is nothing but an
illusory approval of the change of corporate name and a self-induced protection
from the Commission to further exact compliance of the Order of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Craftily, the Securities and Exchange
Commission and/or its administrative personnel were made to issue such
certificate during its unguarded moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Verily, the certificate could not have been issued were it not for such
lapses or had respondent been in good faith by making the proper disclosures of
the circumstances which led it to amend its articles of incorporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Correctly pointed out by petitioners, a 'new determination' as to
whether or not there is confusing similarity between petitioners' names and
that of 'Armco Structures, Incorporated', cannot be ordered without transgression
on the rule of, or the decisional law on, finality of judgment."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">8</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the said amendment in the corporate name of
petitioner is not in substantial compliance with the order of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed it is in contravention therewith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To repeat, the order was for the removal of
the word "ARMCO" from the corporate name of the petitioner which it
failed to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even if this change of
corporate name was erroneously accepted and approved in the SEC it cannot
thereby legalize nor change what is clearly unauthorized if not contemptuous
act of petitioner in securing the registration of a new corporate name against
the very order of the SEC of February 14, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly the said order of <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1975</st1:date> is not rendered <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> thereby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Had petitioner revealed at the time of the registration of its amended
corporate name that there was the said order, the registration of the amended
corporate name could not have been accepted and approved by the persons
in-charge of the registration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
actuations in this respect of petitioner are far from regular much less in good
faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arguments of the petitioner that the SEC had approved the
registration of several other entities with one principal word common to all as
"ARMCO", and that there is no confusing similarity between the
corporate names of respondents and the new name of petitioner, would indeed in
effect be re-opening the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> order of
the SEC of February 14, 1975 which had already foreclosed the issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in said final order the SEC made the
following findings which are conclusive and well-taken:</p>

<blockquote>"The only question for resolution in this case is whether the
respondent's name ARMCO STEEL CORPORATION is similar, if not identical with
that of petitioner, ARMCO STEEL CORPORATION (of Ohio, U.S.A.) and of
petitioner, ARMCO-MARSTEEL ALLOY CORPORATION, as to create uncertainty and
confusion in the minds of the public.</blockquote>

<blockquote>By mere looking at the names, it is clear that the name of
petitioner, ARMCO STEEL CORPORATION (of Ohio, U.S.A.), and that of the
respondent, ARMCO STEEL CORPORATION, are not only similar but identical and the
words 'of Ohio, U.S.A.,' are being used only to identify petitioner ARMCO
STEEL-OHIO as a U.S. corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is indisputable that ARMCO-STEEL-OHIO, having patented the term
'Armco' as part of its trademark on its steel products, is entitled to
protection in the use thereof in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The term 'Armco' is now being used on the
products being manufactured and sold in this country by Armco-<span class="SpellE">Marsteel</span> by virtue of its tie-up with
ARMCO-STEEL-OHIO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the two
companies have the right to the exclusive use and enjoyment of said term.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ARMCO STEEL-PHILIPPINES, has not only an identical name but also a
similar line of business, as shown above, as that of ARMCO STEEL-OHIO.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>People who are buying and using products
bearing the trademark 'Armco' might be led to believe that such products are
manufactured by the respondent, when in fact, they might actually be produced
by the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the goodwill
that should grow and inure to the benefit of petitioners could be impaired and
prejudiced by the continued use of the same term by the respondent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the petition for review is designed to further delay
if not simply evade compliance with the said final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
SEC order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner also seeks a
review of the orders of execution of the SEC of the said <st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1975</st1:date> order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An order or resolution granting execution of
the final judgment cannot be appealed<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">9</span></span></a> otherwise there will be no end to

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit
