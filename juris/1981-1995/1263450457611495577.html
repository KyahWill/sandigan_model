				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the election of the officers of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City chapter of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines, held in the City Hall on
February 28, 1981, the two candidates for president, <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>
O. <span class="SpellE">Parlade</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, each obtained 327 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">To break the tie, the chapter's election committee resolved to
require <span class="SpellE">Parlade</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>
to draw lots as prescribed in section 12(k) of the IBP by-laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">At that juncture, <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> called the
committee's attention to the ballot of Eduardo E. Arroyo, Sr. whose vote for <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> was not counted because it was prepared by Pedro R.
<span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Arroyo's ballot was placed in the envelope
for spoiled and invalid ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> moved that Arroyo's vote be counted in his favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The election committee held a hearing on <span class="SpellE">Mortera's</span>
motion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The committee heard the
testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> and Manuel C. Cortes, who
explained why the ballot of Arroyo was confiscated by Cesar P. Javier, the
chairman of the board of canvassers for Precinct No. 2, Arroyo's precinct.</p>

<p class="BODY">The committee upheld the invalidation of Arroyo's ballot by the
board of canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>
asked for the reconsider­ation of that ruling.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The committee denied his motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the lots were drawn, <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>
manifested in writing to the election committee that his assent to the drawing
of lots was without prejudice to his recourse to any appropriate legal remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Parlade</span> drew the winning lot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The election committee proclaimed him as the
duly-elected president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> P. Peralta, the incumbent <span class="GramE">chapter</span>
president, in his letter dated <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="3">March 3,
 1981</st1:date> apprised the president of the IBP that <span class="SpellE">Parlade</span>
and others were elected officers of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> chapter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Parlade</span> took his
oath of office on March 5.</p>

<p class="BODY">But before that oath-taking, or on March 3, <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>
filed with the IBP Board of Governors a protest wherein he prayed that Arroyo's
vote be counted in his favor, that <span class="SpellE">Parlade's</span>
proclamation be set aside and that he, <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, be
adjudged the duly elected president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Parlade</span> answered the protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing and consideration of the evidence of the parties,
the Board declared <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> the duly elected
president.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Board's resolution dated <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1981</st1:date> reads:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Finding that witness Eduardo Arroyo, Sr. <u>did in fact vote for candidate <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span></u> because he
actually authorized and directed Pedro <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> to
write ‘<span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>’ in his ballot and that Arroyo's
subsequent disclaimer of this authority and instruction was a mere afterthought
which is not entitled to credence, and on motion duly seconded, the Board after
agreeing to accept the written votes of absent Governors, </blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Resolved (Res. No. 4-81-47) to reverse and set
aside the ruling of the Board of Canvassers of Precinct No.</span> II and of
the Committee on Elections in the 28 February 1981 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Chapter elections declaring invalid the contested ballot and to count this
ballot in favor of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>, and further resolved that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> be, as he hereby is, declared the duly elected
President of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Chapter for the term
1981-1983."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On March 27, <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> took his oath of
office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March 30, <span class="SpellE">Parlade</span>
filed in this Court the instant special civil actions of <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition wherein he assailed the Board's resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1981</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Leovillo</span>
C. Agustin, the duly elected vice-president, was directed to administer the
affairs of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>
chapter in an acting capacity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Annexed to <span class="SpellE">Parlade's</span> petition is an
affidavit of Arroyo dated <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="3">March 2, 1981</st1:date>,
or two days after the election, wherein he alleged that he asked <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> to hold his blank ballot while he (Arroyo)
familiarized himself with the election materials and made up his mind as to the
candidates for whom he would vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
averred that he intended later on to request <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>
to write in the ballot the names of his (Arroyo's) candidates.</p>

<p class="BODY">After some interval, Arroyo asked <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>
for his ballot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was informed that <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> had already filled it up by writing the name of <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> in the space for president and that the ballot was
confiscated by a member of the board of canvassers as a void ballot because
voting by proxy is not allowed and its pre­paration violated the secrecy of the
ballot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Arroyo further alleged that <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> was
not authorized to fill up his ballot because he had not as yet apprised <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> of his (Arroyo's) choices among the candidates for
the different <span style="">elective positions (p. 35,
<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The crucial fact in this case is that Arroyo freely voted for <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> with the assistance of <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His vote was decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It gave <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span> a
majority of one over <span class="SpellE">Parlade</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that Arroyo, 69 (admitted to the bar in
1939), was afflicted with a physical infirmity brought about by a cerebral
stroke.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be true, as contended by <span class="SpellE">Parlade</span>, that Arroyo could sign his name as shown in his
signature in the voter's list and in his aforementioned affi­davit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1 and 4-A) but then that is a habitual act on his part
amounting to a reflex action.</p>

<p class="BODY">Writing the names of other persons would be a different thing and
that would explain why he had to seek <span class="SpellE">Acierto's</span>
assistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arroyo even protested
against the confiscation of his ballot by Javier by saying: "<span class="SpellE">Wala</span> <span class="SpellE">namang</span> violation <span class="SpellE">doon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Mababali</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">wala</span> <span class="SpellE">naman</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span>
<span class="SpellE">pagpunta</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span> <span class="SpellE">rito</span>" (p. 25, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Arroyo did not complain that he did not
authorize <span class="SpellE">Acierto</span> to fill up his (Arroyo's) ballot.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the Board of Governors did not act with grave abuse
of discretion in regarding Arroyo's ballot as a valid vote for <span class="SpellE">Mortera</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <i>certiorari</i>
does not lie to annul its resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly observed by the respondents, the decision of the
Board of Governors in election contests is final (Sec. 13, IBP By-Laws).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And one of the governing principles in the
integration of the bar is "maximum Bar autonomy with minimum supervision
and regulation by the Supreme Court" (Report of the Commission on Bar
Integration, quoted in the Resolution of this Court on Bar Integration, 69 O.G.
593, 49 SCRA 22, 25).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the IBP Board of Governors
is affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
