				<BR><STRONG>QUIASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on certiorari under Rule 45 of the
Revised Rules of Court, with a prayer for preliminary injunction or temporary
restraining order, to set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R.
SP No. 31272.  On the allegation that
private respondent was trying to enforce the said decision notwithstanding the
timely appeal of petitioner (Petition, pars. 8.1 - 8.5), we issued a temporary
restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">We grant the petition and reverse the decision of the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 3, 1989, petitioner was elected President of the
Katipunang Panlungsod <span style="">ng mga </span>Barangay ng Quezon City (KPB-QC), an association composed
of the heads of barangays and created under the old Local Government Code, B.P.
Blg. 337.  As president, petitioner
automatically became the sectoral representative of the barangays to the
Sangguniang Panlungsod of Quezon City.  The election of petitioner was held pursuant to the KPB-QC Constitution
and By-Laws and was for a term of two years or until November 3, 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 1, 1992, the Local Government Code of 1991 (1991 Code)
took effect.  The law created the Liga
ng mga Barangay (Liga), which took the place of the Pambansang Katipunan <span style="">ng mga </span>Barangay
created by the old Local Government Code.  Under Section 492 of the 1991 Code, the Liga shall have city chapters,
the presidents of which shall be elected from the <u>p<span style="">unong</span></u><span style=""> </span>barangays
in the cities.  Thus, there is in Quezon
City, a chapter of the Liga, the Liga-QC, which replaced the KPB-QC.  Also, under Section 494, the president of
the Liga-QC is an <u>ex</u> <u><span style="">officio</span></u><span style=""> </span>member of the Sanggunian.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local
Government Code of 1991 (RRI), the incumbent presidents of the associations of
barangay councils elected under the old Code shall continue to act as
presidents of the corresponding Liga chapters pending the election of the
presidents under the 1991 Code <span style="">(Rule </span><span style="">XXIX, </span>Article
210[f][1]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner therefore continued to perform his duties as president
of the Liga-QC and to sit as <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">officio</span></u><span style=""> </span>member of the Sangguniang Panlungsod
of Quezon City.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 2, 1993, petitioner received a notice of meeting of the
"general assembly" issued by the "Ad-Hoc Committee, Barangay Captains
and Barangay Officials." The meeting, scheduled that same day at 3:00 P.M.
at the Jade Valley Restaurant in Quezon City, was to take up the following
matters:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Presentation of newly installed Barangay Captains as members
of the Liga;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Financial status of the Liga;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 12pt;">3.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><!--[endif]-->Status of all ABC (Association of Barangay Councils)
programs, projects and activities;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-size: 12pt;">4.<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Other
matters.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner sent a letter to the Barangay Operations Center of
Quezon City, with instructions to transmit it to the Ad-Hoc Committee.  In his letter, petitioner objected to the
holding of the meeting stating "that the Board of Directors of the LIGA NG
MGA BARANGAY, Quezon City Chapter did not create an AD-HOC Committee for the
purpose of calling this meeting.  NEITHER did the Board of Directors authorize you to form the said AD-HOC
Committee" (Rollo, p.<span style=""> 7).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Brushing aside the letter, the Ad-Hoc Committee proceeded with
the meeting and elected a new set of directors and officers of the Liga-QC with
private respondent as the president.  The election was purportedly conducted under the old constitution and
by-laws of the KPB­-QC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon learning of the election of private respondent at the April
2, 1993 meeting, the Board of Directors of the Liga-QC adopted a resolution
dated April 13, 1993 declaring the proceedings of the said meeting null and
void.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 5, 1993, private respondent took his oath of office as
president of the Liga-QC and he informed the Sangguniang Panlungsod of his
election.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 20, 1993, petitioner filed an action against private
respondent and 17 other barangay captains of Quezon City with the Regional
Trial Court, Branch 106, Quezon City, for damages, with prayer for preliminary
injunction or temporary restraining order (Civil Case No. Q-93-15623).  The action was based on the alleged
usurpation of authority or official functions and misconduct in office of the
defendants.  On April 21, 1993, the
Regional Trial Court issued a temporary restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 3, 1993, private respondent tried to attend the regular
session of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Quezon City but the presiding officer,
Vice-Mayor Charito Planas, ordered him to leave the session hall, ruling that
his name <span style="">was not among those listed in
the roll of persons allowed to attend the session.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On May 6, 1993, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 106, Quezon City
issued a writ of preliminary <span style="">injunction
</span>ordering private respondent and his co-defendants to cease and desist
from assuming the positions to which they claim to have been elected on April
2, 1993.</p>

<p class="BODY">To stop the Regional Trial Court from hearing further Civil Case
No. Q-93-15623, private respondent filed with the Supreme Court a petition for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">warranto</span></u>
and prohibition, with preliminary injunction, which was referred to the Court
of Appeals for disposition on June 14, 1993.  The petition was docketed in the Court of Appeals as CA-G.R. SP No.
31272.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 2, 1993, the Court of Appeals rendered a decision <span style="">giving </span>due
course to the petition for <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">warranto</span></u><span style=""> </span>and
holding:</p>

<blockquote>"1.
The election held last April 2, 1993 is hereby declared legal and valid.  Petitioner Bonifacio M. Rillon is declared
as the validly and duly elected president of the Liga ng mga Barangay-Q.C.
Chapter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent Roberto A. Miguel is
enjoined from continuing to represent the Quezon City barangays in the City
Council of Quezon City and from disturbing petitioner in his functions as
president of the Liga <span style="">ng mga </span>Barangay-Q.C.
Chapter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. The
Quezon City Council is hereby ordered to accept petitioner Rillon as <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> <u>officio</u> </span>member of said Council, and is enjoined from
recognizing private respondent Miguel to sit as <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> <u>officio</u> </span>member
thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The incumbent judge of the Regional Trial
Court of Quezon City, Branch 106, is enjoined from continuing to hear Civil
Case No. Q-­93-15623" (Rollo, p. 43).</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner now comes to us claiming that the Court of Appeals
erred when it declared as valid the election held by the general assembly on
April 2, 1993 where private respondent was elected president of the Liga-QC.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may facilitate the understanding of the issues raised by
petitioner if we bear in mind that he is holding two elective positions.  These positions are:  first, as head of a barangay and second, as
president of the association of barangays in Quezon City or the <span style="">Liga-Q.C.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 43 of the 1991 Code, the term of office of barangay
officials elected prior to the adoption of the said Code was extended up to the
second Monday of May 1994.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the 1991 Code abolished the Pambansang Katipunan ng mga
Barangay and created the Liga, it is silent with <span style="">respect </span>to the extension of the term of office of the presidents
of the chapters of the Pambansang Katipunan <span style="">ng </span>mga Barangay, who were elected
under the old Local Government Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lacuna, however, was filled up by the RRI which was issued by
the Oversight Committee created under Section 533 of the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Oversight Committee
was composed of the Executive Secretary as Chairman, three members of the
Senate, three </span>members of the House of Representatives, three Department
Secretaries and one representative each from the League of Provinces, League of
Cities, League of Municipalities and Liga <span style="">ng mga </span>Barangay.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 210(f)(1) of Rule XXIX of the RRI provides that "[p]ending
election of the presidents of the municipal, city, provincial, and metropolitan
chapters of the Liga, the incumbent presidents of the association of the
barangay councils in the municipality, city, province and Metropolitan Manila
shall continue to act as presidents of the corresponding liga chapters";
while Article 210(d)(3) of Rule XXIX provides that the "incumbent
presidents of the municipal, city, and provincial chapters of the liga shall
continue to serve as <u>ex</u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">officio</span></u><span style=""> </span>members of the sanggunian concerned until the expiration of
their term of office, unless sooner removed for cause."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that petitioner, even after the effectivity
of the 1991 Code, continued to be a barangay official, as well as the president
of the Liga-QC and an <u><span style="">ex</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">officio</span></u><span style=""> </span>member
of the Sangguniang Panlungsod of Quezon City.  The main issue is the validity of the election by the Ad-Hoc Committee
on April 2, 1993 of private respondent in place of petitioner as president of
the Liga-QC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the election of private respondent <span style="">as </span>president of the Liga-QC can be
upheld, Rule XXIX issued by the Oversight Committee and the opinions of the
Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) on the matter have to be
nullified first.  There is no valid
basis to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the RRI, the election of the first set of officers of the
national and local chapters of the <span style="">Liga </span>cannot be held unless a constitution
and by-laws for the Liga is first adopted and ratified by the barangay <span style="">national </span>assembly (Rule <span style="">XXIX, </span>Art.
210[g][3]).  The said constitution and
by-laws was to be drafted by the committee created under Article 210(f)(2) of
the RRI.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 210(g)(3) of Rule XXIX provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Election of the first set of officers of the national liga
and local chapters shall be held in accordance with the duly adopted
constitution and by-laws within six (6) months from ratification by the
barangay national assembly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 210(f)(2) of Rule XXIX empowered the incumbent members of
the board of the Pambansang Katipunan ng mga Barangay, who continue to be
presidents of their respective chapters of the Liga to which they belong, to
"constitute a committee to exercise the powers and duties of the national
Liga and draft or amend the constitution and by-laws of the national Liga to
conform to the provisions of this Rule."</p>

<p class="BODY">Inasmuch <span style="">as </span>no constitution and by-laws had been drafted by the committee
and ratified by the barangay national assembly when the Ad-Hoc Committee met on
April 2, 1992, the said meeting and the elections conducted therein were invalid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Department of Interior and Local Government in Opinion No.
171, series of 1992, opined that until <span style="">and
</span>unless the constitution and by-laws of the national Liga had been
adopted and ratified <span style="">as </span>required by the RRI, there could be no legal basis for the
holding of elections for a Liga chapter, and its incumbent president should
continue as <u>ex</u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">officio</span></u><span style=""> </span>members of the sanggunian.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This opinion was </span>reiterated
<span style="">in Opinion </span>No. 220, s. 1992;
Opinion No. 223, s<span style="">. </span>1992; <span style="">Opinion </span>No. 249, s<span style="">. </span>1992; Opinion No. 329, s. 1992; and
Opinion No. 35, s. 1993.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent issuances of the DILG are in the nature of
executive construction and are entitled to great weight and respect by the
Court (Galarosa v. Valencia, G.R. No. 109455, November 11, 1993).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner had even sought the opinion of the DILG with respect
to the <span style="">validity
of </span>the election of a new set of officers <span style="">of </span>the Liga-QC prior to the adoption
of the new uniform constitution and by-laws.  He was informed by the Department Legal Counsel <span style="">in </span>a letter dated January 20, 1993 that: "Premises
considered, it is our view that <span style="">any </span>reorganization
and election of officers of the Liga ng mga Barangay would be premature and not
be in accordance with law" (Rollo, p. 64).</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent argues that the RRI cannot require the prior
adoption <span style="">of
a </span>uniform constitution and by-laws before an election in the Liga
chapters scan be held because such a condition is not required by the 1991
Code.  He says <span style="">that a rule cannot amend or modify a law (Rollo, pp. 108­-109).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There <span style="">is </span>neither
any conflict between Rule XXIX and the 1991 Code nor any violation by said rule
of the standards set by said law.  It
cannot be said that the Rule has exceeded the sphere of delegated authority or
expanded the statute, the grounds available to set aside an administrative rule
(Cooper, The Lawyer and Administrative Agencies, 1957 ed., p. 289; Schwartz,
Administrative Law, 1976 ed., p. 157).</p>

<p class="BODY">The authority given to the Oversight Committee was to adopt <span style="">the </span>appropriate rules and regulations
necessary "for the efficient and effective administration of any and all
provisions of [the] Code, thereby ensuring compliance with the principles of
local authority as<span style=""> </span>defined under the Constitution." One of the problems
addressed by the Oversight Committee was the need for an orderly transfer of
powers and functions from the old associations of barangays to the Liga
chapters.  It is to attain this
objective that the RRI required that the election of the Liga chapters be
conducted under a uniform <span style="">constitution </span><span style="">and </span>by-laws.  Considering that there are more than 1,600 chapters of the Liga,
the alternative to the adoption of the unifor constitution and by-laws <span style="">is </span>chaos.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is also private
respondent's stance that Section 507 </span><span style="">of the 1991 Code contemplates more than one constitution and by-laws,
including the existing constitutions and by-</span><span style="">laws of the associations of barangay units adopted under the old Local
Government Code and "not one or a uniform constitution and by-laws as Rule
XXIX, Article 210, subsection </span><span style="">(g) </span><span style="">of
the Rules and Regulations prescribes" (Rollo, p. 108).  This argument overlooks the fact that
Section 507 dealt with a</span><span style="">ll </span><span style="">the different leagues of local government
units covered in Title Six, Book III of the Code, while Article 210(g) of the
RRI referred only to the Liga </span><span style="">ng mga </span><span style="">Barangay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 507, Article 5 entitled "Provisions Common to all
Leagues" reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Constitution </span>and
By-laws of the <u><span style="">li</span>ga</u><u><span style=""> </span>and the leagues</u>. - All other matters not herein otherwise provided
for effecting the internal organization of the <u>leagues of local government
units</u> shall be governed by their respective constitution and by-laws, which
are hereby made suppletory to the provision of this Chapter:  Provided, that said constitution and by-laws
should always conform to the provisions of the Constitution and existing
laws" (Underlining supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Included in the list of leagues <span style="">of </span>local government units in Title <span style="">Six, </span>Book III of the Code, are:  Liga <span style="">ng
</span>Mga Barangay, which is the league involved in the <span style="">instant </span>petition;
League of Municipalities; League of Cities; League of Provinces; and the League
of Local Elective Officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, private respondent claims that assuming that Article
210(g)(3) of the RRI is valid, it cannot be given retroactive effect and that
whatever uniform constitution and by-laws adopted thereunder should be given <span style="">force and effect only after the barangay
elections of May 1994.  It is a cause of
concern to private respondent that the officials entrusted to formulate and
adopt the uniform constitution and by-laws are </span><span style="">"<u>de</u> </span><u>facto</u> <span style="">officers, if not </span><span style="">usurpers"
</span><span style="">who were elected under the old
Local Government Code (Rollo, p. 109).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The apprehension that the adoption of the uniform <span style="">constitution </span>and
by-laws may be deliberately delayed was allayed when the Liga ng mga Barangay
held its First National Congress and General Assembly on December 5 to 7, 1993
and ratified its Constitution and By-laws (DILG Memorandum Circular, November
8, 1993).</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned Rule operates prospectively to apply to elections
to be held after the adoption of the uniform constitution and by-laws.  Besides, the candidates for election as
presidents of the Liga chapters have no vested right to demand that their
election be governed by the <span style="">constitution
</span>and by-laws under the old Local Government Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Motion to Cite Respondent Rillon In Contempt, petitioner
claims that the locks to his office were changed by respondent, thus
interfering with the discharge of his duties, and that after his office was
forcibly opened by the city officials, they discovered that several pieces of <span style="">equipment </span>were missing.  Petitioner should address his <span style="">complaint to </span>the appropriate city
officials.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.  The decision of the Court of Appeals in
CA-G.R. SP No. 31272 is REVERSED.  No
pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
