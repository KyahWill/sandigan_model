of Court of the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. 64514-R,
entitled "Philippine Home Assurance Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Donmac</span>
Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 10-36).</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 7, 1975, private respondent Philippine Home Assurance
Corporation, ("Assurance"), filed an action in the Court of First
Instance of Manila (Civil Case No. 98127) as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
of the assured-consignee, Republic Flour Mills (RFM) to recover from the
defendants, <span class="SpellE">Donmac</span> Corporation ("<span class="SpellE">Donmac</span>"), E. <span class="SpellE">Rason</span>, Inc.,
("E. <span class="SpellE">Rason</span>"), <span class="SpellE">Reyma</span>
Brokerage, Inc. ("<span class="SpellE">Reyma</span>"), and Sea-Land
Services, Inc. ("Sea-Land") petitioner, herein, the sum of
P66,289,29, which it paid to RFM, after the defendants had refused to pay the
claim for the loss or damage suffered by REM's shipment, consisting of three
units of Smokehouse <span class="SpellE">Airconditioning</span> System and one
unit of <span class="SpellE">Mepaco</span> Smoke Generator (Record on Appeal, pp.
6-10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 37).</p>

of the case in the trial court, the original claim was reduced to P30<span class="GramE">,980.04</span> because some of the items claimed to have been lost
were found by the consignee and their value refunded to the insurer (Brief for
the Petitioner, p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 104).</p>

Instance to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No.-64514-R), which affirmed the said

pp. 40-64).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of fact, of the trial court, adopted by the Court of
Appeals, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On May 5, 1975 the Sea-Land Services, Inc. received at its
LVRR Elisabeth Terminal in New Jersey, U.S.A. one (1) H to H container, marked SEAU
17605, STC 3 complete units food processing machinery, with gross weight of
36,000 measuring 2097 cubic feet from the shipper, Julian Engineering Co., thru
its forwarding agent <span class="SpellE">Interport</span> Company of Chicago,
Illinois. On the same date, the Sea-Land Services Inc. issued on board Bill of
Lading No. 901-029162 covering the said shipment (Exhibits B-plaintiff; 21
Sea-Land) and the shipment was finally received by Sea-Land on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1974</st1:date> in apparent good order and
condition (id. <span class="GramE">"1"-B Sea-land).</span> The shipment
has an invoice value of US$71,635.00 CLF Manila and was sold to RFM Corporation
(Meat Processing Division), consignee, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Philippines,
which insured the said shipment on May 14, 1974 with plaintiff Philippine Home
Assurance Corporation against all risk including wars and strikes for CAF
US$71,635.00 plus 2; MU Exchange Rate of P6.50 to $1.00 or for P591<span class="GramE">,346.93</span> (Exhibit C). The shipment was loaded at the Port of
Oakland, U.S.A. on board the vessel "TRADE" or "SS SEALAND
COMMERCE" and subsequently <span class="SpellE">transhipped</span> at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
by the "SS Fairland", which was owned by the defendant. <span class="SpellE">Donmac</span> Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.S. per
Lloyd3 Register of Ships, 1974-75 edition, page 1153, Identity No. 511160 (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Nov. 15, 1976, p. 3). The "SS Fairland",
which was the agency of Sea-Land Services, Inc. (Exhibit "O") arrived
at and docked alongside Pier 3, Manila, South Harbor, on June 6, 1974 under
Customs Registry No. 935 (Exhibit "4", Sea-Land). On <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1974</st1:date> Sea-land (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.) notified the consignee RFM Corporation that the
latter's shipment aboard the S.S. "Fairland" would arrive at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>port</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1974</st1:date>, which notice was received by the
consignee on the same date (exhibit "8" Sea-Land). Cargo Sea Van No.
SEAU No. 17605, containing the shipment, was discharged from the carrying
vessel on <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1974</st1:date> in
apparent good order and condition, with its seal intact. Its content, however,
were not turned over to the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator. The
cargo sea van was brought to the container terminal of Sea-Land at Pier 3. On <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1974</st1:date> defendant Sea-Land
notified the consignee in writing that if the containerized shipment was not
taken within 36 hours from receipt, of the notice, the container with its
contents would be brought to a bonded warehouse designated by the Bureau of
Customs (Exhibit "5" Sea-Land). This notice was received by the
consignee on the same date, <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1,
 1974</st1:date> (Exhibit "5-A" Sea-Land). As the consignee failed to
pick up its containerized shipment from the container terminal, Pier 3, the
same was transferred, after a clean gate pass was issued on July 4, 1974
(Exhibit "1" <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>), to the bonded
warehouse of the Luzon Brokerage Corporation at Otis St., <span class="SpellE">Paco</span>,
Manila, (Exhibit "6" Sea-Land) but later transferred unopened to the
LBC bonded warehouse No. 2-A located at Shaw Boulevard, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (Exhibit "4" Sea-Land).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On July 13, 1974, Domingo Javier, the checker of defendant Sea-Land
went to the LBC Compound at Shaw Boulevard, <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>,
and without securing permission from Bureau of Customs and the consignee, broke
the seal of the container in the presence of one in charge of the LBC compound.
With the help of the LBC <span class="SpellE">stevedors</span>, he removed the
contents of the container and checked them on July 13, and 14, 1974. His
checking and examinations are contained in five (5) Good Order Tally sheets No.
8251 (Exhibit "7" Sea-Land), No. 8252 (Exhibit "7-A"
Sea-Land), No. 8255 (Exhibit "7-B" Sea -Land), No. 8256 (Exhibit
"7-C" Sea-Land), and No. 8259 (Exhibit "7-D" Sea-Land); and
in one Bad Order Tally Sheet, No. 8258 (Exhibits "2" and
"2-A" Sea-Land). He found that all the contents of the Good Order
Tally Sheets were in good condition with the exception of the radiator of the
engine which was dented in some parts (see Tally Sheet No. 8252) and of the
aluminum sheets which were dented in some parts (see Tally Sheet No. 8256). One
case (Bad Order Tally Sheet No. 8258) contained various items in cartons and
pieces. One (1) carton of Browning (Big) was in bad order and so with two (2)
cartons of Browning (Small) as well as one (1) carton containing 1 gallon <span class="SpellE">Carbit</span> Paint. All the rest were in good order. No
representative of the consignee or of the Bureau of Customs was present during
the checking.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The evidence of record does not disclose in what particular place
is the LBC Compound where the itemized pieces of the shipment stored pending
their transfer to the plant of the consignee at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Pulo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>, Laguna. On July 24, 1974 the defendant <span class="SpellE">Reyma</span> Brokerage, Inc. brought the itemized contents of the
van or container from the LBC compound to the plant of the consignee at <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>, Laguna and delivered them to the consignee thereat
(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"K",
"K-1" and "K-2").</span> Noted on the Delivery Receipt No.
15715 (Exhibit "K-1") were three (3) cartons which were water-damaged
and in Delivery Receipt No. 15716 (Exhibit K-2) was noted one (1) plywood case
which was in bad order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the same date, <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="7">July 24,
 1974</st1:date>, the Manila Adjusters and Surveyors Co., on request of the
consignee, sent its surveyor, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Victa</span>, to the
plant of the consignee at. <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>, Laguna to survey
the imported articles delivered thereat. The Certified Adjusters, Inc., upon
request of defendant Sea-Land Services, Inc., also sent its surveyors, and they
with the surveyor of the Manila Adjusters and Surveyors Co., inventoried and
checked the shipment. The findings of <span class="SpellE">Victa</span>, which
are contained in the Certificate of Survey dated <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1974</st1:date> submitted by the Manila Adjusters and
Surveyors Co. (Exhibit "E"), are as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"2 <span class="SpellE">pcs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">fresh</span> air damper - cut on one side approximately 3"
long.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"1 pc.</span> <span class="GramE">coil</span>
support frame assembly for 1 blower casing BC-17 - slightly dented/ cut
approximately 10" long x 4" wide.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"3 <span class="SpellE">pcs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">duct</span> sleeve SL-1 - not accounted for.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"6 <span class="SpellE">pcs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">duct</span> sleeve SL-2 - not accounted for.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"3 <span class="SpellE">pcs</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">steam</span> coil, 42" x 50" - not accounted for.</p>

<p class="2Q">"18 rolls block butyl rubber tape - not accounted for.</p>

<blockquote>The surveyors of the Certified Adjusters, Inc. had the same
findings (Exhibit "A" Sea-Land). The rest of the items were found in
good order condition and accepted by the consignee. The surveyors of the Manila
Adjusters and Surveyors Co. gave the opinion that the "damages"
sustained by the two (2) fresh air dampers and one (1) coil support frame
assembly apparently occurred while the shipment was in transit from port of
origin to destination". However, the surveyors could not state where and
when the losses (not accounted for items) could have occurred because they were
not present during the stripping of the container of its contents (Exhibit
"E", p. 4). The surveyors of the Certified Adjusters, Inc. did state
their opinion on the cause and place of damage/loss. The Manila Adjusters and
Surveyors Co. computed the damages (<span class="SpellE">dentings</span>) and <span class="SpellE">Iosses</span> (not accounted for items) to have a claimable value
of P66<span class="GramE">,289.29</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"F"). The consignee filed its claim for the said amount with the
defendants Sea-Land Services, Inc. and E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc.
but both defendants declined to pay the same, alleging that they are not
responsible for the damages/losses suffered by the cargo (Exhibit.
"G"). The consignee thereupon demanded payment from the plaintiff an
insurer of the cargo and the latter complied by issuing on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1975</st1:date> a check in favor of the consignee for
the amount of P66<span class="GramE">,289.29</span>. The consignee signed and
delivered to the plaintiff a subrogation receipt dated June 5, 1975 for the
amount of P66,289.29 (Exhibits "M" and "N"). The plaintiff
as <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span> demanded payment from defendants Sea-Land
Services, Inc. and E. <span class="SpellE">Razon</span>, Inc., but both refused
to pay for, according to them, they are not responsible for the damages/losses
suffered by the cargo (Exhibits "I" and "J"). On August 19,
1975 the consignee returned the check in the amount of P66<span class="GramE">,289.29</span>
issued to it by the plaintiff, informing the latter that the unaccounted for
items with a value of P35,909.25 were found and accounted for, and therefore,
the said amount should be deducted from the original claim of P66,289.29, thus
making the corrected claim to be in the amount of P30,380.04 (Exhibit
"L"). The plaintiff paid the consignee the said amount of P30<span class="GramE">,380.04</span>; and the plaintiff likewise reduced its claim
against the defendants from P66,289.29 to P36,380.04 (Partial Stipulation of
Facts)" (Decision, CA-G.R. No. 64514-R, pp. 3-7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
<span style="text-transform:uppercase">pp. </span>42-46).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the Court of Appeals, petitioner invoked the provisions of
Section 15 of the Bill of Lading, (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-D,
Sea-Land) in support of its claim that there was a constructive delivery of the
shipment to the consignee and that it had been discharged of its responsibility
over the shipment before July 13, 1974 when it opened the sealed container van.
The Court of Appeals, however, dismissed this claim of petitioner on the ground
that it was raised for the first time on appeal; therefore, it was considered
as having been waived by petitioner (Decision, p. 9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 48).</p>

<p class="BODY">In appellate procedure, parties are not allowed to change
theories or shift positions in the appellate court. On appeal, the parties must
keep within the issues stated in their pleadings or the theories on which their
causes of action in the trial court were predicated (American Express Co. v. <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, 46 Phil. 207; <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Decasa</span>, 55 Phil. 461).</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint filed by Assurance as a <span class="SpellE">subrogee</span>
in Civil Case No. 98127 was to collect, damages from the defendants therein,
including petitioner, for the short-landing of and damages to the cargo while
in the custody of the defendants (Complaint, par. 6; Record on Appeal, p. 8; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 37). The answer of petitioner claimed that the
"<span class="SpellE">devanning</span>" of the insured cargo in July 13
and 14, 1974 took place after due notice was given to the consignee and only
after the latter failed to claim the cargo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 26 of the Answer of Sea-Land states: "Despite
notice to consignee, the latter failed to take delivery of the container for
almost one (1) month. Consequently, the subject container was transferred to
the Luzon Brokerage Customs Bonded Warehouse for <span class="SpellE">devanning</span>.
The <span class="SpellE">devanning</span> took place on July 13 and 14, 1974.
Upon <span class="SpellE">devanning</span>, only one case was found in bad
condition. The box consisted of 149 packages, but only 4 packages were noted
with exceptions" (Record on Appeal, pp. 31-32; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 37).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that petitioner did not. <span class="GramE">specifically</span>
cite the provisions of Section 15 of the Bill of Lading (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1-D, Sea-Land) as the authority to support its right to "<span class="SpellE">devan</span>" the insured cargo, but under the rules on
pleading, a party is not required to specify the provisions of the law or
contract relied upon by the pleader. The rules only require the allegations of
the ultimate facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rules on appellate procedure do not even require the parties
to adhere to their position in minute detail but only to abide by the general
position adopted by them in the trial court (Fisk v. <span class="SpellE">Honario</span>,
14 Ore. 29). Neither do the rules prevent the parties from putting up
additional grounds to support their position (Sons v. <span class="SpellE">Yangco</span>
Steamship Co., 34 Phil. 597).</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the issue
of the right of petitioner to "<span class="SpellE">devan</span>" was
not raised by it in the trial court, the fact remains that Assurance failed to
object when the Bill of Lading (Exhibit 1-D, See Land) was presented in
evidence. As a matter of fact, Assurance admitted the genuineness and due
execution of said document in the partial stipulation of facts submitted to the
trial court (Record on Appeal, p. 50; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 37).
Likewise, Assurance did not object to the admissions of the evidence proving
the steps taken by petitioner before removing the cargo from the container van.
When issues not raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent
of the parties, they shall be treated in all respects, as if they had been
raised in the pleadings (Rule 10, Sec. 5, Revised Rules of Court; <span class="SpellE">Lisarraga</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> v. Yap <span class="SpellE">Tico</span>, 24 Phil. 504; Molina v. <span class="SpellE">Somes</span>,
24 Phil. 49).</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the issue as to whether petitioner had been
relieved of its obligations under the Bill of Lading when it "<span class="SpellE">devaned</span>" the cargo on <st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Section 15 of the Bill of Lading <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> 1-D Sea-Land provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The carrier or master may appoint a stevedore or any other
persons to unload and take delivery of the goods and such delivery from ship's
tackle shall be considered complete and all responsibility of the carrier shall
then terminate.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is agreed that when possession of the goods is received or taken

or private, such authority or person shall be considered as having received
possession and delivery of the goods solely as agent of and on behalf of the
shipper and consignee, at the risk of the goods and subject to any lien of the
carrier thereon. <u>Also if the consignee does not take possession or delivery

incurred in so dealing with or disposing of the goods, or by reason of the
consignee's failure or delay in taking possession and delivery as provided
herein</u> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 14; Underlining supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The "SS Fairland", carrying the container van SEAU
17605, STC 3, arrived in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Port</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename></st1:place>
on <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1974</st1:date>. On the same
day, the said container was unloaded and discharged from the carrying vessel.
The day before the arrival of the vessel, petitioner notified RFM, the
consignee, that the latter's shipment would be arriving on <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner notified RFM in a letter dated <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1974</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 5)
that the shipment in the container van No. 17605 would be transferred to a
customs bonded warehouse. In a follow-up letter dated <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1974</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6),
petitioner again informed RFM that the said container van had been transferred
to the bonded warehouse of the <span class="SpellE">Luson</span> Brokerage
Corporation and asked RFM to take immediate delivery of the cargo (Decision, p.
9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 48).</p>

<p class="BODY">The bonded warehouse of Luzon Brokerage Corporation is located in
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro Manila and in the vicinity of the offices of RFM.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the third time, petitioner sent a notice to RFM on <st1:date year="1974" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1974</st1:date> that the cargo had been
transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Luson</span> Brokerage Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6, Sea-Land).</p>

<p class="BODY">The cargo was unloaded from the container van on <st1:date year="1974" day="13" month="7">July 13, 1974</st1:date> in the presence of the
Luzon Brokerage Corporation personnel. It was at this time that portions of the
shipment were found to be in bad order. It was only on <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="7">July 24, 1974</st1:date> that RFM took delivery of the
shipment from the Luzon Brokerage Corporation bonded warehouse and transferred
the same to its plant in <span class="SpellE">Cabuyao</span>, Laguna. A survey
conducted at the consignee's plant showed that the fresh air damper and the
coil support frame assembly had been damaged while several pieces of parts of
the food processing machinery were missing. By this time, Sea-Land had been
relieved of responsibility over the cargo under Section 15 of the Bill of
Lading.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that the cargo was shipped "H to H
container STC 3 complete units food processing machinery," meaning that
the shipper itself loaded the cargo into the van, which was sealed before its
delivery to the carrying vessel.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no evidence presented by Assurance as to the actual
condition of the cargo when it was loaded into the container van by Julian
Engineering Co., the shipper. Assurance issued the insurance policy without
prior inspection of the cargo on the assumption that, the cargo loaded into the
