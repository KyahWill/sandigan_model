<p class="BODY"><span>An appeal was made to the Court </span><span>of 
</span><span>Appeals docketed as CA-GR No. 46373-R<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[*]</sup> entitled <em>Filipino Society of 
Composers, Authors, Publishers, Inc., Plaintiff-Appellant v. Benjamin Tan, 
Defendant-Appellee</em>, from the decision of the Court of First Instance of 
Manila, Branch VII in Civil Case No. 71222<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[**]</sup> "<em>Filipino Society of Composers, 
Authors and Publishers, Inc., Plaintiff v. Benjamin Tan, Defendant</em>", which 
had dismissed plaintiffs' complaint without special pronouncement as to 
costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Court of Appeals, finding that the case involves pure 
questions of law, certified the same to the Supreme Court for final 
determination (Resolution, CA-G.R. No. 46373-R, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 36; Resolution of the Supreme Court of 
February 16, 1973 in L-36402, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
38).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The undisputed facts of this case are as 
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Plaintiff-appellant is a non-profit association of authors, 
composers and publishers duly organized under the Corporation Law of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
and registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said 
association is the owner of certain musical compositions among which are the 
songs entitled:<span>&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE"><em>Dahil</em></span> <span class="GramE"><em>Sa</em></span><em> Iyo</em>"; "<span class="SpellE"><em>Sapagkat</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Ikaw</em></span><em> Ay Akin</em>"; "<span class="SpellE"><em>Sapagkat</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Kami</em></span><em> Ay Tao Lamang</em>" and "<em>The Nearness 
Of You</em>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the other hand, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> is the operator of a restaurant known as "Alex Soda 
Fountain and Restaurant" where a combo with professional singers, hired to play 
and sing musical compositions to entertain and amuse customers therein, were 
playing and singing the above?mentioned compositions without any license or 
permission from the appellant to play or sing the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Accordingly, appellant demanded from the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> payment of the necessary license fee for the 
playing and singing of aforesaid compositions but the demand was 
ignored.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Hence, on </span><st1:date month="11" day="7" year="1967"><span>November 7, 1967</span></st1:date><span>, appellant filed a 
complaint with the lower court for infringement of copy</span><span>right 
against defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for allowing the playing in 
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> restaurant of said songs 
copyrighted in the name of the former.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, in his answer, 
countered that the complaint states no cause of action.<span>&nbsp; </span>While not 
denying the playing of said copyrighted compositions in his establishment, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> maintains that the mere singing and playing of 
songs and popular tunes even if they are copyrighted do not constitute an 
infringement (Record on Appeal, p. 11; Resolution, CA-G.R. NO. </span>46373-R, 
<span class="SpellE"><span><em>Rollo</em></span></span><span>, pp. 32-36) under 
the provisions of Section </span>3 <span>of the Copyright Law (Act 3134 of the 
Philippine Legislature).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The lower court, finding for the defendant, dismissed the 
complaint (Record on Appeal, p. 25).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Plaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeals which as already 
stated certified the case to the Supreme Court for adjudication on the legal 
question involved.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Resolution, Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 36; Resolution of the Supreme Court of 
February 18, </span>1973, <span class="SpellE"><span><em>Rollo</em></span></span><span>, p. 
38).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In its brief in the Court of Appeals, appellant raised the

<span class="GramE">A and B).</span></p></blockquote></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The petition is devoid of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The principal issues in this case are whether or not the 
playing and singing of musical compositions which have been copyrighted under 
the provisions of the Copyright Law (Act 3134) inside the establishment of the 
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> constitute a public performance for 
profit within the meaning and contemplation of the Copyright Law of the 
Philippines; and assuming that there were indeed public performances for profit, 
whether or not <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> can be held liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Appellant anchors its claim on Section 3(c) of the Copyright 
Law which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. <span>3.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>The proprietor of a copyright or his heirs or assigns shall have

<p class="BODY">It maintains that playing or singing a musical composition is 
universally accepted as performing the musical composition and that playing and 
singing of copyrighted music in the soda fountain and restaurant of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> for the entertainment of the customers although the 
latter do not pay for the music but only for the food and drink constitute 
performance for profit under the Copyright Law (Brief for the Appellant, pp. 
19-25).</p>
<p class="BODY">We concede that indeed there were "public performances for 
profit".</p>
<p class="BODY">The word 'perform' as used in the Act has been applied to "One who 
plays a musical composition on a piano, thereby producing in the air sound waves 
which are heard <span>as </span>music x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and if the instrument he plays on is a piano plus a 
broadcasting apparatus, so that waves are thrown out, not only upon the air, but 
upon the other, then also he is performing the musical composition." <span class="GramE">(<em>Buck, et al. v. 
</em></span><em><st1:city><st1:place>Duncan</st1:place></st1:city>, et 
al.</em><span class="GramE">; <em>Same v. Jewell-La Salle Realty Co.</em>, 32F. 
2d.</span> <span class="GramE">Series 367).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">In relation thereto, it has been held that "The playing of music 
in dine and dance establishment which was paid for by the public in purchases of 
food and drink constituted 'performance for profit' within Copyright Law." <span class="GramE">(<em>Buck, et al. v. Russon</em>, No. 4489 25 F. Supp. 
317).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, it has been explained that while it is possible 
in such establishments for the patrons to <span>purchase their food and drinks 
and at the same time </span><span>dance to the music of the orchestra, the music 
is furnished and used by the orchestra for the purpose of inducing the public to 
patronize the establishment and pay for the entertainment in the purchase of 
food and drinks.<span>&nbsp; </span>The defendant conducts his place of business for 
profit, and it is public; and the music is performed for profit (<em>Ibid</em>., 
p. 319).<span>&nbsp; </span>In a similar case, the Court ruled that </span><span>"The 
</span><span>performance in a restaurant or hotel dining room, by persons 
employed by the proprietor, of a copyrighted musical composition, for the 
entertainment of patrons, without charge for admission to hear it, infringes the 
exclusive right of the owner of the copyright." (<em>Herbert v. Shanley</em> 
</span><em><st1:place>Co.</st1:place>; John Church Co. v. Hillard Hotel Co., et 
al.</em><span>, </span>242 
<st1:country-region><st1:place><span>U.S.</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span> 
590-591).<span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>In delivering the opinion of the Court in 
said two cases, Justice Holmes elaborated thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"If the rights under the copyright are infringed only by a 
performance where money is taken at the door, they are very imperfectly 
protected.<span>&nbsp; </span>Performances not different in kind from those of the 
defendants could be given that might compete with and even destroy the success 
of the monopoly that the law intends the plaintiffs to have.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is 
enough to say that there is no need to construe the statute so narrowly.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The defendants’ performances are not eleemosynary.<span>&nbsp; </span>They are 
part of <span>a </span>total for which the public pays, and the fact that the 
price of the whole is attributed to a particular item which those present are 
expected to order is not important.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is true that the music is 
not the sole object, but neither is the food, which probably could be got 
cheaper elsewhere.<span>&nbsp; </span>The object is a repast in surroundings that to 
people having limited power of conversation or disliking the rival noise, give a 
luxurious pleasure not to be had from eating a silent meal.<span>&nbsp; </span>If 
music did not pay, it would be given up.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it pays, it pays out 
of the public's pocket.<span>&nbsp; </span>Whether it pays or not, the purpose of 
employing it is profit, and that is enough." <span class="GramE">(<em>Ibid.</em>, 
p. <span>594).</span></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case at bar, it is admitted that the patrons of the 
restaurant in question pay only for the food and drinks and apparently not for 
listening to the music.<span>&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial court, the music 
provided is for the purpose of entertaining and amusing the customers in order 
to make the establishment more attractive and desirable (Record on Appeal, p. 
21).<span>&nbsp; </span>It will be noted that for the playing and singing the musical 
compositions involved, the combo was paid as independent contractors by the 
appellant (Record on Appeal, p. 24).<span>&nbsp; </span>It is therefore obvious that 
the expenses entailed thereby are added to the overhead </span>of the restaurant 
which are either eventually charged in the price of the food and drinks or to 
the overall total of additional income produced by the bigger volume of business 
which the entertainment was programmed to attract.<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, 
it is beyond question that the playing and singing of the combo in 
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> restaurant constituted 
performance for profit contemplated by the Copyright Law.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span>(Act </span>3134 <span>as amended by P.D. No. </span>49 <span>as 
amended).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Nevertheless, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> cannot be 
said to have infringed upon the Copyright Law.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> allegation that the composers of the contested 
musical compositions <em>waived</em></span> <span>their right in favor of the 
general public when they allowed their intellectual creations to become property 
of the public domain before applying for the corresponding copyrights for the 
same (Brief for Defendant-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, pp. 14-15) is 
correct.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Supreme Court has ruled that "Paragraph 33 of 
Pa</span>tent Office Administrative Order No. 3 (as amended, dated September 18, 
1947) entitled 'Rules of Practice in the Philippines Patent Office relating to 
the Registration of Copyright Claims' promulgated pursuant to Republic Act 165, 
provides among things that an intellectual creation should be copyrighted thirty 
(30) days after its publication, if made in Manila, or within sixty (60) days if 
made elsewhere, failure of which renders such creation public property." 
(<st1:city><st1:place><em>Santos</em></st1:place></st1:city><em> v. McCullough 
Printing Company</em>, 12 SCRA <span>324-325 [1</span>964].<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Indeed, if the general public has made use of the object sought to be 
copyrighted for thirty (30) days prior to the copyright application the law 
deems the object to have been donated to the public domain and the same can no 
longer be copyrighted.</p>
<p class="BODY">A careful study of the records reveals that the song "<span class="SpellE"><em>Dahil</em></span><em> Sa Iyo</em>" which was registered on 
April 20, 1956 (Brief for Appellant, p. 10) became popular in radios, juke 
boxes, etc. long before registration (TSN, May 28, 1968, pp. <span>3-5; 25) 
</span>while the song "<em>The Nearness Of You</em>" registered on January 
<span>14, 1955 </span>(Brief for Appellant, p. 10) had become popular twenty 
five (25) years prior to 1968, (the year of the hearing) or from <span>1943 
</span>(TSN, May 28, <span>1968, </span>p. 27) and the songs "<span class="SpellE"><em>Sapagkat</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Ikaw</em></span><em> Ay Akin</em>" and "<span class="SpellE"><em>Sapagkat</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Kami</em></span><em> Ay Tao Lamang</em>" both registered on 
July 10, <span>1966, </span>appear to have been known and sang by the witnesses 
as early as 1965 or three years before the hearing in 1968.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
testimonies of the witnesses at the hearing of this case on this subject were 
<span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> by the appellant.<span> </span><span class="GramE">(<em>Ibid.</em>, pp. 28; 29 and 30).</span></p>
<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, it is clear that the musical compositions 
in question had long become public property, and are therefore beyond the 
protection of the Copyright Law.</p>
