</span><span class="SpellE">Santolan</span> Road</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:city></st1:address>.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was 
registered in her name under TCT No. 45238 of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.</p>
<p class="BODY">A portion of the lot was occupied by a house of Tomas <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> who had been leasing said portion from Magdalena 
Bautista since <span>1954.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>Having obtained from <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> various amounts (loans) which had reached a total of 
P500.00 on <st1:date month="8" day="1" year="1956">August 1, 1956</st1:date>, 
<st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> signed a note acknowledging that obligation and 
promising to sell one-fourth of her lot to him should she fail to pay her 
debt.<span>&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> discovered that 
<st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> planned to sell her lot to another.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>So, on February 5, 1960, he caused to be annotated on the original of her 
title on file in the Register of Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> 
City, his adverse claim over one-fourth of the property.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On </span><st1:date month="3" day="17" year="1961"><span>March 17, 1961</span></st1:date><span>,

Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>, offering to mortgage </span>her lot 
to him as security for the repayment of the debt.<span>&nbsp; </span>The deed of real 
estate mortgage was prepared by the son of Ignacio <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="3" day="22" year="1961">March 22,

<p class="BODY">Unable to redeem her property when the mortgage obligation matured 
on <st1:date month="3" day="17" year="1962">March 17, 1962</st1:date>, 
<st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place> decided to sell it to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> for P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>She executed a deed of absolute sale 
in his favor on <st1:date month="3" day="29" year="1962">March 29,

adverse claim had ended).<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon the registration of the sale, 
<st1:place>Magdalena</st1:place>'s TCT No. <span>45239 </span>was cancelled and 
TCT No. 61132 was issued to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">To recover the possession of the lot from <span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> and cancel <span class="SpellE">Ilao's</span> adverse

<span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> a complaint in the Court <span>of First

possession and ownership of the lot in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case Atty. <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> conveyed the property to his brother <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> for a stated 
consideration of P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On January <span>4, </span>1964, a decision was rendered ordering 
<span class="SpellE">Ilao</span> to vacate the premises in question and remove his 
constructions <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, <span>as </span>soon as he 
was paid the sum of P500.00 by the plaintiffs, representing the unpaid loan 
plaintiff Bautista had obtained and likewise after such payment, defendant 
(<span class="SpellE">Ilao</span>) was ordered to pay the sum of P10 as monthly 
rental and P10 for monthly water bills upon proof of payment by the plaintiffs 
to the defendant of the said loan of P500.00.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="15" year="1964">August 15,

occupancy of the property in question.</p>
<p class="BODY">Magdalena promptly retaliated by filing this suit on August 28, 
1964 against the <span class="SpellE">Domalantas</span> — Ignacio, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> — praying 
that the sale which she made in favor of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> be reformed and declared an equitable mortgage, 
and that the titles which had been issued to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> be 
annulled.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City rendered a decision the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That the filing of pleadings, appearances, motions and notices,

shall be attached to the record of the case."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>In their motion to set aside the resolution dated September

dated October </span><span>16, </span><span>1980 of postmaster Gonzalo 
Bernardino of the <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> Center Post Office, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City 3001 that the copy of the decision which was 
sent by registered mail to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> was received by him on August 13, 1980.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>However, the same postmaster notified the Court of Appeals on 
</span><st1:date month="8" day="29" year="1980"><span>August 29,

1980</span></st1:date><span> per record."<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In denying petitioner's motion to set aside resolution, the 
Court of Appeals correctly ruled —<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"While the second certification of the postmaster is questionable, 
and We are tempted to investigate the matter, nevertheless, We decided to forego 
such an investigation since it is inconsequential whether the appellants 
received the decision on August 12, 1980, as previously certified by the 
postmaster Bernardino, or on August 13, 1980, as it was made to appear in the 
second certification, for even if the latter were correct, the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for filing appellants' motion for 
reconsideration would have expired on August 28, 1980.<span>&nbsp; </span>The motion 
for reconsideration was received by this Court on <st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1980">September 23, 1980</st1:date>, or 26 days late.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
mailing of the motion to the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court was not a valid 
filing of said pleading.<span>&nbsp; </span>The filing of a pleading by registered 
mail with the Court under Section <span>1, </span>Rule 13, of the Rules of 
Court, like service by registered mail under Section 5 of the same rule, 
requires that the pleading be 'plainly addressed to the court where the case is 
pending.’” (p. 43, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>On certain occasions, this Court has allowed liberality in 
the construction of the Rules.<span>&nbsp; </span>The present case, however, does not 
warrant such liberality because the decision of respondent Court of Appeals is 
satisfactorily supported by the records.<span>&nbsp; </span>We therefore quote with 
approval the following apt observations of the Court of 
Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"After a thorough consideration of the circumstances surrounding the 
execution of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span><span class="GramE">. 'B' or <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> '2', the Court is convinced that it is an 
instrument to guarantee the payment of a loan.</blockquote>
<blockquote>There is no evidence that plaintiff Magdalena Bautista, after the 
execution of said <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B' or '2' <span class="GramE">has</span> ceased to have the complete possession of the property 
supposedly sold.<span>&nbsp; </span>There has been no attempt on the parts of <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> to transfer 
the property to their names for taxation purposes.<span>&nbsp; </span>The evidence 
showing that plaintiff Magdalena Bautista paid interest of P150.00 monthly after 
the execution of <span class="SpellE"><span>Exh</span></span><span>. 'A' 
</span>and then increased it to P300.00 monthly after the <span>exe</span>cution 
of <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'B', both to defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span>, is very 
convincing.<span>&nbsp; </span>The payment of such interests is an indication that 
the transaction is a loan with interest.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Finally, notwithstanding the alleged sale of the property to <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Domalanta</span> under <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">'B' or <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> '2', the debt of plaintiff Magdalena Bautista 
continued to pile up to P19<span class="GramE">,442.28</span>, as of September 
1964.<span>&nbsp; </span>The loan in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> 
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'C-19) earned an interest of P13<span class="GramE">,442.28</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'C-20').</span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"Due to the following <span class="GramE">circumstances,</span> 
and under the provision of Art. 1603, Civil Code, the Court considers <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">'B' or <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">'2', as an equitable 
mortgage."</span> (pp. 15-16, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
