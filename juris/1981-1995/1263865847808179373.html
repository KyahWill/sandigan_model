finding him guilty of violating Section 4, Article II, of the Dangerous Drugs
Act, sentencing him to life imprisonment, and to pay P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
in fine, and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 a.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1988</st1:date>, the Narcotics Command (NARCOM) based in
<st1:place>Upper Calarian</st1:place>, <st1:place><st1:placename>Zamboanga</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, was alerted by an informant
that a certain "Benjie" was peddling marijuana, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>prohibited plant, along <st1:street><st1:address>Cabatangan
  Road</st1:address></st1:street>, San Roque, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">Zamboanga</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, Major Cabayacruz, local NARCOM
officer-in-charge, directed Sgt. Amos Foncardas to conduct <span class="GramE">a
surveillance</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Upon </span>that mandate, Sgt. Foncardas
instructed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Sgt. </span>Romeo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Dayag </span>to pursue a <span class="GramE">"test-buy"
operation.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">At or about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time>
of the same day, Sgt. Dayag and his civilian informer allegedly proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address>Cabatangan
  Road</st1:address></st1:street> where they found "Benjie".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dayag's mole supposedly introduced him
(Dayag) to "Benjie" and informed the latter that he (Dayag) wished to
purchase marijuana. "Benjie" allegedly handed Dayag three cigarettes
of marijuana worth P5.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
Dayag and his informant repaired to the NARCOM office where they submitted the
three sticks of marijuana for examination at the PC-INP crime laboratory.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="9">September
 8, 1988</st1:date>, the local NARCOM unit formed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a team </span>led by Sgt. Foncardas to bust "Benjie".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Sgt.
Dayag </span>fronted as the group's "poseur-buyer".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30
 p.m.</st1:time>, the team proceeded to <st1:street><st1:address>Cabatangan
  Road</st1:address></st1:street> aboard motorcycles.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Dayag
</span>allegedly walked toward a sari-sari store where "Benjie",
along with three or four persons, was standing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sgt. Foncardas and company positioned themselves fifteen meters away
from the store.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dayag allegedly approached "Benjie" and told him that
he wanted to buy marijuana worth P10.00. "Benjie" allegedly
recognized him as his customer the day before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He allegedly turned over to him six sticks of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, he, Dayag, paid two marked
five-peso bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dayag thereafter placed his right hand on his head in a
pre-arranged cue to Sgt. Foncardas, et al.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The latter then swooped down on "Benjie" and announced <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>bust. "Benjie" was bodily
searched where the two marked five-peso bills were recovered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dayag meanwhile passed the six marijuana
cigarettes to Foncardas. "Benjie" was brought to the NARCOM headquarters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was later identified as Benjamin Bernardo
y Mercado, the accused below, the appellant herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Athena Anderson, forensic chemist of the PC-INP crime laboratory,
positively identified the nine sticks of marijuana to be actually, marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused's defense is alibi, i.e., that at or about the time
Sgt. Dayag allegedly went to the sari-sari store, he, together with others, was
at a farm allegedly three kilometers away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused said that it was day-to-day routine that he was at the farm
where he stayed until <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, and so he submits, he could not have
been near the locus criminis either on September 7 or 8, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">He also testified that at or about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00
 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1988</st1:date>,
he, with his brother, Romeo, and uncle, Benjamin de los Reyes, were watching
television, while his mother, Teresita, was minding the store, when four
persons on motorcycles arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
alleged that without warning, the two manacled him and dragged him toward the
motorcycles.</p>

<p class="BODY">Teresita rushed to the side of his son and held on to him in a
tug of war between mother and the military.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, one of them allegedly pointed an armalite rifle at her and then
she fainted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused was allegedly brought to the Southern Command
(SOUTHCOM) headquarters where he was interrogated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that he was mauled and told to
come across with P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in exchange for
freedom.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also claimed that he was
denied food and water throughout.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as we </span>said,
convicted the accused and sentenced him accordingly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In returning the verdict of guilty, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">His </span>Honor noted that the accused had
been positively identified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>the
one who sold marijuana to Sgt. Dayag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
also rejected his alibi, that he (the accused-petitioner) was at that time
three kilometers away from the scene of the crime, since it was not physically
impossible to travel, on foot, therefrom, and in time to ply his illegal trade
at the time the authorities claimed they saw him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge also relied on the failure of Teresita, the
accused's mother, to report the accused's "abduction" on <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1988</st1:date> by unknown armed men
to the authorities, assuming that the accused had been abducted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He observed that <span class="GramE">neither
his brother, Romeo, or</span> his father, Roman, bothered to bring the incident
to the police, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">if </span>there indeed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">was </span>any irregularity in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NARCOM's </span>actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">He found no ulterior motive on the part <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">of </span>the accused's captors in making the arrest, more
significantly, because of the fact that the very defense admitted that the accused
did not know the NARCOM agents who swooped down on him.</p>

<p class="BODY">He disregarded pleas by the accused that the sticks upon sticks
of cannabis found in his person were planted and that he was mauled and
blackmailed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it was true that he was
manhandled, so the trial judge noted, why <span class="GramE">was it</span>, he
asked, that he did not complain to the fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused now has it that the trial court, in rendering its
verdict, erred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He submits that the
evidence for the prosecution was unreliable and unworthy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He posits three questions.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, he says that he could not have in all likelihood sold
marijuana in broad daylight, in a crowded neighborhood, and in full view of the
public ("If [he] was really a drug pusher...[h]e would have asked Sgt.
Dayag to go inside..."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>)</p>

<p class="BODY">He also wonders why Sgt. Dayag did not apprehend him on <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1988</st1:date>, when they first
closed the drug deal.</p>

<p class="BODY">He impugns the decision because the prosecution never presented
the informant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the predicament of the accused hangs on the credibility
of the testimony of the poseur-buyer, Sgt. Romeo Dayag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We think that it hinges on it, because:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) Nobody else, except him, saw marijuana
changing hands; Sgt. Dayag's back-up did not see it and acted alone on Dayag's
cue;<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
(2) The informant--who might have witnessed the event--was not made to take the
stand.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">We find his recital straightforward, spontaneous, and
convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the judge below
had accepted his testimony, and who but a judge is in a better position to
measure the credibility and demeanor of a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held indeed in a long line of
cases that in matters of credibility, this court leaves judges ample
discretion, having personally seen the witness’ deportment and having
personally heard his account.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
As in those cases, we defer to the finding--as to Sgt. Romeo Dayag's
testimony--of His Honor in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, we also affirm His Honor's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused's insistence that no dope peddler can pursue his
trade in a public place holds, to our mind, no water.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The exchange of marijuana (rolled up in
sticks) from hand to hand and the passing of money from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">palm </span>to palm are done in quick movements, and in swift
succession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the transaction
took place at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

and not <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 p.m.</st1:time> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>the accused would have it,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and the twilight provided a good cover.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Sgt. Dayag </span>did
not act the first time (<st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="9">September 7,
 1988</st1:date>) he saw the accused is not fatal to the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor General submits, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">"Sgt. </span>Dayag wanted to avoid being
suspected of planting evidence."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the prosecution failed to produce the NARCOM's
informant in court is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
is not, so the accused puts it, the "best witness"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

to establish the fact that a "test-buy" operation had indeed occurred
among the accused, Sgt. Dayag, and the latter's informer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dayag himself testified that it happened, and
as we observed, he, Dayag, positively identified the accused as the drug pusher
selling his wares along <st1:street><st1:address>Cabatangan Road</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In our considered opinion, Dayag has given
the prosecution the evidence they needed to pin the accused on a drugs rap, and
to build a case against him for pushing cannabis sativa.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant, moreover, has not successfully attributed any
motive against the NARCOM or Dayag, and why either should testify falsely
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court finds no more necessity in dwelling on the accused's other
charges, i.e., that the authorities had intimidated him or had set him up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are convinced that based on the evidence
on record, he is guilty as charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED in
toto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
