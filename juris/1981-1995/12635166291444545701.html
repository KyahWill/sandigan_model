				<H3>REYNATO MANLANGIT, COMPLAINANT, VS. JUDGE MELITO L. URGEL, RESPONDENT. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>PUNO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">Before us is an administrative complaint filed by complainant <b>REYNATO MANLANGIT </b>against <b>JUDGE MERITO URGEL</b>, Presiding Judge, Third Municipal Circuit Trial Court, Panganiban, Catanduanes, for gross ignorance of the law.<br><br>Complainant is the owner and operator of a passenger jeepney, with plate number EVC 120.&nbsp; On August 13, 1994, the jeepney, driven by <b>EDGARDO CASTILLO</b>, plied its usual route going to Virac, Catanduanes. Complainant and a number of passengers were also inside the jeep.&nbsp; While approaching a blind curve, the jeepney driver occupied the wrong lane.&nbsp; At the curve, they suddenly saw a parked dump truck. By then, it was too late to avoid collision with the truck.&nbsp; The jeepney then swerved to the right.&nbsp; The driver and the complainant managed to jump off the jeepney before it plunged into the river.&nbsp; The passengers were not as lucky.&nbsp; They sustained some injuries and were brought to the nearest hospital for treatment.<br><br>Consequently, a <b>criminal complaint</b> for serious physical injuries through reckless imprudence was filed with the sala of respondent <b>JUDGE MERITO URGEL</b> against jeepney driver Edgardo Castillo and complainant/owner of the jeepney.<br><br>On November 3, 1994, <b>respondent judge issued a warrant</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><b> for the arrest of complainant</b> and Castillo.&nbsp; Their bailbond was fixed at Ten Thousand Pesos (P10,000.00) each.&nbsp; Upon service of the warrant, complainant, through his lawyer, filed a Motion to Drop him from the Criminal Complaint and Quash the Warrant.&nbsp; Nonetheless, complainant posted bail for his provisional liberty.&nbsp; Later, however, respondent judge ruled favorably on his motion and issued an Order<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> dropping him from the criminal complaint.<br><br>Complainant charged that the <b>erroneous issuance of the warrant of arrest</b> caused him and his family grave humiliation, undue embarrassment and anxiety.&nbsp; He prayed that appropriate disciplinary and administrative action be taken against respondent judge for gross ignorance of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>We directed respondent judge to answer the charge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> In his Comment,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> he explained that the preliminary examination he conducted showed that complainant/jeepney owner was in the vehicle at the time of the incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Upon this basis, he ordered the arrest of complainant applying the 1914 case of <b>Chapman v. Underwood</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><b> </b>which held:<br><br><blockquote>"An owner who sits in his automobile, or other vehicle, and permits his driver to continue in violation of the law by the performance of negligent acts, after he has had a reasonable opportunity to observe them and to direct that the driver cease therefrom, becomes himself responsible for such acts.&nbsp; The owner of an automobile who permits his chauffeur to drive up the Escolta, for example, at a speed of 60 miles an hour, without any effort to stop him, although he has had a reasonable opportunity to do so, becomes himself responsible, <b>both criminally and civilly</b> for the results produced by the acts of the chauffeur.&nbsp; xxx" (italics supplied)</blockquote><br>Respondent judge points that when complainant filed a motion to quash the warrant of arrest against him, he acted immediately and favorably on said motion.&nbsp; Respondent judge concedes that while his act was a judicial error, it should not be the subject of administrative sanction.<br><br>In a Resolution, dated June 7, 1995, we referred the case to the Court Administrator for evaluation, report and recommendation.<br><br>In his Memorandum,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> dated October 17, 1995, the Court Administrator found merit in the complaint and recommended that respondent judge be meted a severe reprimand for the erroneous issuance of a warrant of arrest against complainant.<br><br>We agree with the factual findings of the Court Administrator.<br><br>It is a basic postulate in criminal law that <b>the criminal act of one person cannot be charged to another without a showing that the other participated directly or constructively in the act or that the act was done </b><b>in furtherance of a common design or purpose for which the parties were united in intention</b>. In cases of employer-employee relations, <b>an employer is not criminally liable for the criminal acts of his employee or agent unless he, in some way, participates in, counsels or abets his employee's acts or omissions</b>.&nbsp; In such case, the employer himself becomes a participant to the criminal act of his employee.&nbsp; His liability under the circumstances is direct and criminal.&nbsp; However, <b>under Article 102, in relation to Article 103 of the Revised Penal Code</b>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> <b>the employer's liability for the criminal negligence of his employee is subsidiary in nature and is limited only to civil indemnity.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Thus, an employer is party to a criminal case for the criminal negligence of his employee only by reason of his subsidiary <b>civil</b> liability under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>In the case at bar, we carefully reviewed the transcript of the preliminary examination conducted by respondent judge.&nbsp; Nowhere does it show that complainant/jeepney owner participated in, abetted or even approved the negligent and reckless manner in which his driver maneuvered the vehicle on that blind curve.&nbsp; Moreover, it does not appear that complainant's driver continuously pursued a reckless and thoughtless control of the wheel <b>throughout the journey, with nary an admonition or reproof on the part of complainant/jeepney owner.&nbsp; </b>It is evident that the driver's decision to go on the wrong lane while approaching a blind curve was a split second judgment which left neither the complainant nor any of the passengers time to react to the perilous maneuver.&nbsp; Thus, respondent judge misread the ruling in the case of <b>Chapman v. Underwood.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> In <b>Chapman</b>, the Court held that:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x&nbsp; An owner who sits in his automobile x x x<b> </b>and <b>permits his driver to continue</b> in a violation of the law by the performance of negligent acts, after he has had <b>reasonable opportunity</b> to observe them and to direct that the driver cease therefrom, becomes himself responsible for such acts.&nbsp; The owner of an automobile who permits his chauffeur to drive up the Escolta, for example, at a speed of 60 miles per hour, without any effort to stop him, although he has had a reasonable opportunity to do so, becomes himself responsible, both criminally and civilly, for the results produced by the acts of his chauffeur.&nbsp; On the other hand, <b>if the driver, by a sudden act of negligence, and without the owner having reasonable opportunity to prevent the act or its continuance, injures a person or violates the criminal law, the owner of the automobile, although present therein at the time the act was committed, is not responsible, either criminally or civilly, therefor.&nbsp; The act complained of must be continued in the presence of the owner for such a length of time that the owner, by his acquiescence, makes his driver's acts his own."</b></blockquote><br>The erroneous issuance of the warrant of arrest against complainant necessarily caused him and his family undue anxiety, humiliation and embarrassment.&nbsp; Indeed, complainant had to hire a counsel and incur expenses for his bond to fight for his liberty which he could have lost due to a patently erroneous warrant of arrest issued by respondent judge.&nbsp; Life, liberty and property hang on the balance everytime a judge wields judicial power.&nbsp; We cannot overemphasize the importance of a judge's cautious, diligent and intelligent performance of judicial functions.&nbsp; Reckless judges make justice a tormenting illusion to our people.<br><br><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF</b>, respondent judge MELITO L. URGEL is fined One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) and is admonished to be more circumspect in the performance of his judicial functions, with a warning that repetition of the same or similar act shall be dealt with more severely in the future.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., (Chairman), Regalado, Mendoza,</i> and <i>Francisco, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, p. 10.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Dated November 8, 1994, <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 56-58.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Complaint, dated December 2, 1994; <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 1-2.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> Resolution, dated February 22, 1995; <i>Rollo</i>, p.14.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> <i>Rollo</i>, pp. 15-16.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Exhibits "1" and "2", Portions of the testimony of private complainants/passengers during the preliminary examination relative to the accident; <i>Rollo</i>, at pp. 25 &amp; 28.<br><br><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> G.R.
