<p class="BODY">From the nature of the issues raised in the present appeals, we
are constrained to set out and analyze the facts involved which we are told do
not sustain the conclusions drawn by the court below.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of respondent court presents the
two sides of the incident as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On July 27, 1973, at about 7:00 o'clock in the morning, <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>, being a public
school teacher of Barrio Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> reported to the precinct of her assignment
particularly at the Elementary School of Sta. Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, by reason of the <span class="SpellE">deputization</span>
of all public school teachers to assist the COMELEC in the conduct of the
National Referendum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Between 3:00 and 3:30 P.M. of that day, while she was inside
Precinct No. 11-A, she saw Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, son of the barrio
captain of Sta. Cruz, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, get the remark
sheet <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>voter <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> <span class="SpellE">Firmalino</span> and began to
write on said remark sheet of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She called the attention of the Referendum Committee composed of <span class="SpellE">Leandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Fagtanac</span>, Chairwoman; <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> <span class="SpellE">Fale</span> and Benito <span class="SpellE">Facura</span>, Members, to these acts of Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
but the Committee did not mind her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So,
she took the initiative of going to and advising Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
not to write anything on the remark sheet of the voter <span class="SpellE">Firmalino</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> what business of hers (sic) in so doing to which
she answered that she was merely advising him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> stood up, pulled out his appointment
paper as an observer in the referendum and tore it to pieces saying that it was
useless and not respected anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> went out of the precinct
reported the matter to his father, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, the
barrio captain of Sta. Cruz.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few
minutes later, barrio captain Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, father of
Elmo, entered Precinct No. 11-A and shouted at <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>, ‘<span class="SpellE">Hijo</span> de <span class="SpellE">puta</span>, why do you interfere with what my son is doing?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why are you pretending to be somebody here in
Sta. Cruz?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You are a no good <span class="SpellE">headteacher</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I do
not send my children to this school because of your enviousness.’ <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> answered that
she was merely advising Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> not to write on the
remark sheet of <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span> <span class="SpellE">Firmalino</span>
and she did not pretend to be somebody.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was leaving the precinct, he
further said that he would report <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Mrs. </span>Maria
Ford.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thirty minutes after Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> had
left the precinct, Maria Ford, owner of the Asturias Sugar Central, arrived
very angry, saying, 'Where is <span class="SpellE">Suping</span>, where is <span class="SpellE">Suping</span>?' <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> immediately presented herself to Maria Ford, and
the latter said, 'Why did you campaign for 'No' <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">according to the barrio captain?</span>' <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> answered, 'I did not campaign for 'No' I
even wanted a zero ‘No' because you promised to provide electricity in this
barrio if nobody votes 'No'.’ Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> then
interrupted their conversation and said that <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> really campaigned for 'No' votes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria Ford said, 'Its true you campaigned for
‘No' and why do you still insist on reasoning?', and then, Maria Ford slapped <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> on the left
face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She wanted to retaliate but her
sister, <span class="SpellE">Fidelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Frias</span>,
held her back and pulled her away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria
Ford further said, 'I'll have you transferred to a far place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You are ungrateful to me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>You are always rebelling against me.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Get out and go home.’ Afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> reported this
particular incident to the police authorities of <span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Capiz</span> (Exhibit 'A'/ '1').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also sent telegrams to the President
(Exhibits 'I' and 'H'), to the COMELEC (Exhibit 'J') and to the Secretary of
National Defense (Exhibit 'L') in connection with this incident<span style="font-size:12.0pt">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court observes that, on his part, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> presented his version of the incident thus:</p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2 p.m.</st1:time> on
referendum day, Benito <span class="SpellE">Facura</span>, upon the request of
the chairwoman of the Referendum Committee, <span class="SpellE">Leandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Fagtanac</span>, went to the house of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
to inform him that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">wa</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">s</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">
</span>trouble in the barrio center.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> went to said place and he had a
talk with <span class="SpellE">Leandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Fagtanac</span>
about what happened thereat.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Leandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Fagtanac</span> informed Vicente
<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> that <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> shouted at Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>; that
she requested <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
to keep quiet but the latter continued to shout at Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
that he should not teach the voters because they were more intelligent than
him; that when Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> showed his appointment papers
as referendum observer, <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
tore it to pieces and threw it on the floor; and that as a result of the
commotion created by the quarrel of <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> and Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, the people
scattered away<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>from the precinct.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon getting this information from <span class="SpellE">Leandra</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fagtanac</span>, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> asked
her where was <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
and he was told that she had just left the room.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was
about to leave the precinct, <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> came in.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> then addressed her, ‘Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>, what happened <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">here?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Can you not settle this
since this is our affair?' <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> answered, 'I told Elmo not to teach the voters
because they also </span>know what they're doing and why are you inquiring?'
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>'Why did you humiliate Elmo when we have a chairwoman to refer this
matter?' (sic) <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
countered, 'You think you're still a <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain
inside this precinct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It's the <span class="SpellE">headteacher</span> who is powerful in this building.’ Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> said, ‘I'm not trying to be somebody here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If you won't believe me, I'd report this
matter at the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span>.’ <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> said, 'I don't care to whom you'd report,
I'm not afraid, go ahead.' So, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> left with
his jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The people were no longer
voting, and on the way to the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> thought of asking Maria Ford to pacify <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>, to stop her
from molesting and disturbing the people so they could vote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> then
believed that Maria Ford, being the godmother of <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>, could pacify her.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Maria Ford asked Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> how the
voting was going along, and the latter told her that <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> was getting uncontrollable in the precinct,
that she tore the appointment as observer of his son Elmo, and that the people
were not voting anymore.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> asked Maria Ford to stop <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> from molesting and disturbing the
people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> left to report the matter to the COMELEC Registrar but
he did not meet him because he was out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On his way home, he met the Mayor and the Governor and to whom he
narrated this incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The following
day, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> reported this incident to the police
authorities of <span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>
and it was entered in the Police Blotter (Exhibit '3'-Uy)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Said decision continues with an account of the incident this time
by Maria Ford:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 1:30 p.m. on referendum day, some people reported to
Maria Ford that <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
was screaming at the polling place, and they asked her to stop <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> as she is her
(a)<span class="SpellE">hijada</span> and relative because people were going away
and not voting anymore.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then came
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, the barrio captain, who also asked Maria
Ford to intercede with <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
because she was creating trouble, fighting with his son, and many people were
leaving the polling place.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Maria Ford went to the polling place to find out the truth of
the report and also to make the people vote.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon her arrival at the polling place, <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> immediately shouted, 'Why did you come here,
you're helping the barrio captain!' Maria Ford answered, 'I came here because
the people and the barrio captain asked me to make you keep quiet and stop this
trouble.' Then <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
screamed, 'I'm the <span class="SpellE">headteacher</span> here!' Maria Ford told
<span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> to keep
quiet and go home and not to scream, but she answered that she was the <span class="SpellE">headteacher</span> and she was supposed to be there and she would
not go home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Maria Ford started to
inquire from the people around whether or not <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> has some trouble with Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and whether or not she tore his appointment paper as
referendum observer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> screamed again
saying that Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was insulting her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Maria Ford told Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
to go home, and when Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> passed between her and <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>, the latter
continued to scream insulting words at Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> even wanted to beat Elmo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,
and she was trembling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So, laboring
under the belief that <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
had already become hysterical, Maria Ford slapped her on the face to calm her
down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After this, <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> quieted down momentarily, and then she said
to Maria Ford, 'If you're not only old, I'd beat you!' Maria Ford held out her
face to <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>
and ordered her to hit it, but she did not.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

Cruz' called for comment or action from <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span> which, to the mind of the court, is an innocuous
expression or statement merely showing disgust, displeasure or, at its worst,
anger, and not to slander.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is of a
lesser degree and intensity than the words '<span class="SpellE">putang</span> <span class="SpellE">ina</span> mo' which the Supreme Court in Reyes v. People,
L-21528, March 28, 1969, 27 SCRA 686, has stated to be a common expression in

the other statements of Vicente <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> which did not call
for any comment from <span class="SpellE">Sulpicia</span> <span class="SpellE">Fabrigar</span>,
her silence should be deemed to be an admission of their truth and truth can
not hurt or insult.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, an act or

of one's person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is especially true
if the aggrieved party is a school teacher who, in penal law, is a person in

required of all, if we are to uphold and enhance the dignity of the teaching
profession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The demeaning act of
respondent Ford is virtually inexpiable when done, as in this case, in the
presence of the public inside a polling precinct during an electoral
exercise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This certainly is one of the
extreme circumstances under which ridicule, discredit and contempt could be
cast upon the aggrieved party in the community where she performs her functions
as a mentor of their children.</p>

<p class="BODY">As discerningly observed by respondent court, considering the
position of private respondent, nothing but shame, humiliation and dishonor
could have been heaped upon her by the indignities she had to suffer at the
hands of petitioner Ford.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
there is ample reason to believe that said petitioner's displeasure over the
rumor that private respondent was campaigning for "No" votes was
sufficient motive for her to deliberately confront private respondent and
maltreat the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The act of petitioner Ford in slapping private respondent on the
face in public is contrary to morals and good customs and under the
circumstances, could not but have caused the latter mental anguish, moral shock,
wounded feelings and social humiliation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>

not persuaded by such pretense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent was in the performance of her duty when the incident took place and
she had every right to stay in her post.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, petitioner Ford had no legitimate business inside the

<p class="BODY">With respect to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, the
gravity of the defamatory words uttered by him depends not only upon their
sense and grammatical meaning, judging them separately, but also upon the
special circumstances of the case and the antecedents or relationship between
the offended party and the offender which might tend to prove the intention of
the offender at the time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to say that the imputations uttered by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> against private respondent also cast further dishonor,
discredit and contempt on the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was a barrio captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His proven actuations do not speak well of a
public officer, especially when done in the presence of the public during said
referendum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> claims that private
respondent should be bound by her statement appearing in the police blotter where
she made no mention that she was slandered by the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is fallacious reasoning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The entry in the police blotter, even if
admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, is not necessarily entitled to
full credit as the entrant did not have personal knowledge of the facts stated
and the police agent who prepared the same did not testify in court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Admissibility of evidence is one thing; the weight thereof is another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court below also declared that an entry
in the police blotter is an entry in an official record made in the performance
of duty by a public officer and, as such, its trustworthiness arises and its
correctness cannot be impugned, there being a presumption of regularity in its
execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not entirely
correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Entries in official records are
only <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> evidence of the facts therein stated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are not conclusive.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied with private respondent's explanation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her initiative in promptly instituting her
complaint clearly manifests her honest intention to vindicate the wrong
committed against her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She explained
that shortly after the incident between her and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>,
petitioner Ford came and slapped her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, when the report was made by private respondent to the police
authorities of <span class="SpellE">Dumalag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>,
the immediate hurt and humiliation being felt by her was not only the slander
committed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> but, primarily and
foremost, the slapping by petitioner Ford.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the police report of private respondent which focused on her
being slapped by petitioner Ford, although inadvertently omitting the incident
with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> in view of her emotional state
then, should not be construed to mean that private respondent was not slandered
by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Like an affidavit, a police blotter is taken <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> hence, in the same manner, it could be just as
incomplete and inaccurate, sometimes from either partial suggestions or for
want of suggestion or inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be
unable to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the
correction of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate
recollection of all that pertains to the subject.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

It is understandable that the testimony during the trial would be more lengthy
and detailed than the matters stated in the police blotter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Uy's</span>
disquisition on the omission of his intemperate and slanderous outburst in the
entries made in the police blotter, or in the telegrams sent by private
respondent, cannot outweigh the evidence on which respondent court based its
factual findings and conclusions that he did commit said act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the testimony thereon of private
respondent in open court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>our
