EDSA revolution of 1986 restored the reality that the people's might is not a
myth.  The 1987 Constitution then
included people power as an article of faith and Congress was mandated to pass
laws for its effective </span>exercise.  The Local Government Code of 1991 was enacted providing for two (2)
modes of initiating the recall from office of local elective officials who
appear to have lost the confidence of the electorate.  One of these modes is recall through the initiative of a
preparatory recall assembly.  In the
case at bench, petitioners assail this <span style="">mode
of initiatory recall as unconstitutional.  The challenge cannot succeed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner
Enrique T. Garcia was elected governor of the province of Bataan in the May 11,
1992 elections.  In the early evening of
July 1, 1993, some mayors, vice </span>mayors and members of the Sangguniang
Bayan of the twelve (12) municipalities of the province met at the National
Power Corporation compound in Bagac, Bataan.  At about 12:30 A.M. of the following day, July 2, 1993, they proceeded
to the Bagac town plaza where they constituted themselves into a Preparatory
Recall Assembly to initiate <span style="">the
recall election of petitioner Garcia.  The mayor of Mariveles, Honorable Oscar de los Reyes, and the mayor of
Dinalupihan, the Honorable Lucila Payumo, were chosen as </span>Presiding
Officer and Secretary of the Assembly, respectively.  Thereafter, the Vice-Mayor of Limay, the Honorable Ruben Roque,
was recognized and he moved that a <span style="">resolution
be passed for the recall of the petitioner Garcia on the ground of "loss
of confidence."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The motion was "unanimously

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">One

and its majority was seventy-three (73).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On July 7, 1993,
petitioners filed with the respondent COMELEC a petition to deny due course to
said </span>Resolution No. 1.  Petitioners alleged that the PRAC failed to comply with the
"substantive and procedural requirements" laid down in Section 70 of
R.A. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991.  In a <i><span style="">per curiam</span></i><span style=""> </span>Resolution
promulgated August 31, 1993, the respondent COMELEC dismissed the petition and
scheduled the recall elections for the position of Governor of Bataan on
October 11, 1993.  Petitioners then
filed with Us a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with writ of
preliminary injunction to annul the said Resolution of the respondent COMELEC
on various grounds.  They urged that
section 70 of R.A. 7160 allowing recall through the initiative of the PRAC is
unconstitutional because: (1) the people have the sole and exclusive right to
decide whether or not to initiate recall proceedings, and (2) it violated the
right of elected local public officials <span style="">belonging
to the political minority to equal protection of </span>law.  They also argued that the proceedings
followed by the PRAC in passing Resolution No. 1 suffered from numerous
defects, the most fatal of which was the deliberate failure to send notices of
the meeting to sixty-five (65) members of the assembly.  On September 7, 1993, We required the
respondents to file their Comments <span style="">within
a non-extendible period of ten (10) days.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> On September 16, 1993, We set the
petition for hearing on </span>September 21, 1993 at 11 A.M.  After the hearing, We granted the petition
on the narrow ground that the sending of selective notices to members of the
PRAC violated the due process protection of the Constitution and fatally flawed
the enactment of Resolution No. 1.  We
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After deliberation, the Court opts not to resolve the alleged
constitutional infirmity of sec. 70 of R.A. No. 7160 for its resolution is not
unavoidable to decide the merits of the petition.  The petition can be decided on the equally fundamental issues of:
(1) whether or not all the members of the Preparatory Recall Assembly were
notified of its meeting; and (2) assuming lack of notice, whether or not it
would vitiate the proceedings of the assembly including its Resolution No. 1.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The failure to give notice to all members of the assembly,
especially to the members known to be political allies of petitioner Garcia was
admitted by both counsels of the respondents.  They did not deny that only those inclined to agree with the resolution
of recall were notified as a matter of political strategy and security.  They justified these selective notices on
the ground that the law does not specifically mandate the giving of notice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We reject this submission of the respondents.  The due process clause of the Constitution
requiring notice as an element of fairness is inviolable and should always be
considered as part and parcel of every law in case of its silence.  The need for notice to all the members of
the assembly is also imperative for these members represent the different
sectors of the electorate of Bataan.  To
the extent that they are not notified of the meeting of the assembly, to that
extent is the sovereign voice of the people they represent nullified.  The resolution to recall should articulate
the majority will of the members of the assembly but the majority will can be
genuinely determined only after all the members of the assembly have been given
a fair opportunity to express the will of their constituents.  Needless to stress, the requirement of
notice is mandatory for it is indispensable in determining the collective
wisdom of the members of the Preparatory Recall Assembly.  Its non-observance is fatal to the validity
of the resolution to recall petitioner Garcia as Governor of the province of
Bataan.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The petition raises other issues that are not only <i>prima impressionis</i>
but also of transcendental importance to the rightful exercise of the sovereign
right of the people to recall their elected officials.  The Court shall discuss these issues in a
more extended decision."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
response to this constitutional call, Congress enacted R.A. 7160, otherwise

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A reading of the
legislative history of these recall provisions will reveal that the idea of
empowering a preparatory recall assembly to initiate the recall from office of local
elective officials originated from the House of Representatives and not the
Senate.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">The legislative records reveal that
there were two (2) </span>principal reasons why this alternative mode of
initiating the recall process thru an assembly was adopted, <u>viz</u>: (a) to
diminish the difficulty of initiating recall thru the direct action of the
people; and (b) to cut down on its expenses.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> Our
lawmakers took note of the undesirable fact that the mechanism of initiating
recall by direct action of the electorate was utilized only once in the City of
Angeles, Pampanga, but even this lone attempt to recall the city mayor
failed.  Former Congressman Wilfredo
Cainglet explained that this initiatory process by direct action of the people
was too cumbersome, too expensive and almost impossible to implement.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, our legislators added in the Code a second mode of initiating the
recall of local officials, i.e., thru a preparatory recall assembly.  They brushed aside the argument that this
second mode may cause instability in the local government units due to its
imagined ease.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We have
belabored the genesis of our recall law for it can light up many of the
unillumined interstices of the law.  In
resolving constitutional disputes, We should not be beguiled by foreign jurisprudence

constitutional settings and needs.  Prescinding from this proposition, We shall now resolve the contention
of petitioners that the alternative mode of allowing a preparatory recall
assembly to initiate the process of recall is unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is first postulated by the petitioners that "the right to
recall does not extend merely to the prerogative of the electorate to reconfirm
or withdraw their confidence on the official sought to be recalled at a <span style="">special election.  Such prerogative necessarily includes the

the people have the "<u>sole</u> and <u><span style="">exclusive</span></u><span style=""> </span>right
to decide on whether to <u><span style="">initiate</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">a recall proceeding." The Constitution did not provide for

discernment dictates.  The power given
was to select which among the means and methods of initiating recall elections
are effective to carry out the judgment of the electorate.  Congress was not straightjacketed to one
particular </span><span style="">mechanism of initiating recall elections.  What the Constitution simply required is
that the mechanisms of recall, whether one or many, to be chosen by Congress </span>should
be <u>effective</u>.  Using its
constitutionally granted discretion, Congress deemed it wise to enact an <span style="">alternative
mode of initiating recall elections to supplement the former mode of initiation
by direct action of the people.  Congress has made its choice as called for by the Constitution and it is
not the prerogative of this Court to supplant this judgment.  The choice may be erroneous but even then,
the remedy against a bad law is </span>to seek its amendment or repeal by the
legislative.  By the principle of
separation of powers, it is the legislative that determines the necessity,
adequacy, wisdom and expediency of any law.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners
also posit the thesis that in passing Resolution </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">1, the Bataan Preparatory Recall Assembly did not only initiate
the process of recall but had </span><i><span style="">de
facto</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">recalled
petitioner Garcia from office, a power reserved to the people alone.  To quote the exact language of the
petitioners: "The initiation of a recall through the PRA <u>effectively
shortens and ends the term of the incumbent local officials</u>.  Precisely, in the case of </span>Gov.
Garcia, an election was scheduled by the COMELEC on 11 October 1993 to
determine who has the right to assume the unexpired portion of his term of
office which should have been until June 1995.  Having been relegated to the status of a mere candidate for the same
position of governor (by operation of law) he has, therefore, been effectively
recalled."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
In their Extremely Urgent Clarificatory Manifestation,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
petitioners put the proposition more bluntly by stating that a "PRA
resolution of recall is the recall itself."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Again, the
contention cannot command our concurrence.  Petitioners have misconstrued the nature of the initiatory process of
recall by the PRAC.  They have embraced
the view that initiation by the PRAC is not initiation by the </span>people.  This is a misimpression for initiation by
the PRAC is also initiation by the people, albeit done indirectly through their
representatives.  It is not
constitutionally impermissible for the people to act through their elected representatives.  Nothing less than the paramount task of
drafting our Constitution is delegated by the people to their representatives,
elected either to act as a constitutional convention or as a congressional
constituent assembly.  The initiation of
a recall process is a lesser act and there is no rhyme or reason why it cannot
be entrusted to and exercised by the elected representatives of the
people.  More far out is petitioners'
stance that a PRA resolution of recall is the recall itself.  It cannot be seriously doubted that a PRA
resolution of recall merely starts the process.  It is part of the process but is not the whole process.  This ought to be self evident for a PRA resolution
of recall that is not submitted to the COMELEC for validation will not recall
its subject official.  Likewise, a PRA
resolution of recall that is rejected by the people in the election called for
the purpose bears no effect whatsoever.  The initiatory resolution merely sets the stage for the official
concerned to appear before the tribunal of the people so he can justify why he
should be allowed to continue in office.  Before the people render their sovereign judgment, the official
concerned remains in office but his right to continue in office is subject to
question.  This is clear in section 72
of the Local Government Code which explicitly states that "the recall of
an elective local official <u><span style="">shall be
effective only</span></u><span style=""> </span>upon
the election and proclamation of a successor in the person of the candidate
receiving the highest number of votes cast during the election on recall."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We shall next
settle the contention of petitioners that the disputed law infracts the equal
protection clause of the Constitution.  Petitioners asseverate:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>5.01.2.  It denied
petitioners the equal protection of the laws for the local officials
constituting the majority party can constitute itself into a PRA and initiate
the recall of a duly elected provincial official belonging to the minority
party thus rendering ineffectual <span style="">his election by popular mandate.  Relevantly, the assembly could, to the
prejudice of the minority (or even partyless) incumbent official, effectively
declare a local elective position vacant (and demand the holding of a special
election) for purely partisan political ends regardless of the mandate of the
electorate.  In the case at bar, 64 of
the 74 signatories to the recall resolution have been political opponents of
petitioner Garcia, not only did they not vote for him but they even campaigned
against him in the 1992 elections.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Petitioners'
argument does not really assail the law but its possible abuse by the members
of the PRAC while exercising their right to initiate recall proceedings.  More specifically, the fear is expressed
that the members of the PRAC may inject political color in their decision as
they may initiate recall proceedings only against their political opponents
especially those belonging to the minority.  A careful reading of the law, however, will ineluctably show that it
does not give an asymmetrical treatment to locally elected officials belonging
to the political minority.  First to be
considered is the politically neutral composition of the preparatory recall
assembly.  Sec. 70 (b) of the Code
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 70. <i><u>Initiation of the Recall Process</u></i>. (a) Recall
may be initiated by a preparatory recall assembly or by the registered voters
of the local government unit to which the local elective official subject to
such recall belongs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There shall be a preparatory recall assembly
in every province, city, district, and municipality which shall be composed of
the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(1)  <i>Provincial level</i>. - All mayors, vice
mayors and sanggunian members of the municipalities and component cities;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(2)  <i>City level</i>. - All punong barangay
and sangguniang barangay members in the city;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span> <i>Legislative District level</i>. - In cases
where sangguniang panlalawigan members are elected by district, all elective
municipal officials in the district; and in cases where sangguniang panlungsod
members <span style="">are
elected by district, all elective barangay officials in the district; and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;"><span style="">(4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>
<i>Municipal level</i>. - </span><span style="">All punong barangay and sangguniang
barangay members in the municipality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Under
the law, <u>all</u> mayors, vice-mayors and sangguniang members of the
municipalities and component cities are made members of the preparatory recall
assembly at the provincial level.  Its
membership is not apportioned to political parties.  No significance is given to the </span>political affiliation of
its members.  Secondly, the preparatory
recall assembly at the provincial level includes <u>all</u> the elected
officials in the province <span style="">concerned.  Considering their number, the greater
probability is that no one political party can control its majority.  Thirdly, sec. 69 of the Code provides that
the only ground to recall a locally elected public official is loss of
confidence of the people.  The members
of the PRAC are in the PRAC not in representation of their political parties
but as representatives of the people.  By necessary implication, loss of confidence cannot be premised on mere
differences in political party affiliation.  Indeed, our Constitution encourages the multi-party system for the </span>existence
of opposition parties is indispensable to the growth and nurture of the
democratic system.  Clearly <span style="">then, the law as crafted cannot be
faulted for discriminating against elected local officials belonging to the
minority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fear that a
preparatory recall assembly may be dominated by a political party and that it
may use its power to initiate the recall of officials of opposite political
persuasions, especially those belonging to the minority, is not a ground to
strike down the law as unconstitutional.  To be sure, this argument has long been in disuse for there can be no
escape from the reality that</span><span style=""> </span><u>all</u>
powers are susceptible of abuse.  The
mere possibility of abuse cannot, however, infirm <i><span style="">per se</span></i><span style=""> </span>the
grant of power to an individual or entity.  To deny power simply because it can be abused by the grantee is to
render government powerless and no people need an impotent government.  There is no democratic government that can
operate on the basis of fear and distrust of its officials, especially those
elected by the people themselves.  On
the contrary, all our laws assume that our officials, whether appointed or elected,
will act in good faith and will regularly perform the duties of their
office.  Such a presumption follows the
solemn oath that they took after assumption of office, to faithfully execute
all our laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the law instituted safeguards to assure that the
initiation of the recall process by a preparatory recall assembly will not be
corrupted by extraneous influences.  As
explained above, the diverse and distinct composition of the membership of a
preparatory recall assembly guarantees that all the sectors of the electorate
province shall be heard.  It is for this
reason that in Our Resolution of September 21, 1993, We held that notice to all
the members of the recall assembly is a condition <i><span style="">sine qua non</span></i><span style=""> </span>to
the validity of its proceedings.  The
law also requires a qualified majority of all the preparatory recall assembly
members to convene in <u>session</u> and in a <u><span style="">public place</span></u><span style="">.  It also requires that the recall resolution
by the said majority must be adopted <u>during</u> its session </span><u>called
for the purpose</u>.  The underscored
words carry <span style="">distinct
legal meanings and purvey some of the parameters limiting the power of the
members of a preparatory recall assembly to initiate recall proceedings.  Needless to state, compliance with these
requirements is necessary, otherwise, there will be no <u>valid</u> resolution
of recall </span>which can he given due course by the COMELEC.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore,
it cannot be asserted with certitude that the members of the Bataan preparatory
recall assembly voted strictly along narrow political lines.  Neither the respondent COMELEC nor this
Court made a judicial inquiry as to the reasons that led the members of the
said recall assembly to cast a vote of lack of confidence against petitioner
Garcia.  That inquiry was not undertaken
for to do so would require crossing the forbidden borders of the political
thicket.  Former Senator Aquilino
Pimentel, Jr., a major author of the subject law in his book <u>The Local </u></span><u>Government
Code of 1991: The Key to National Development</u>, <span style="">stressed the same reason why the
substantive content of a vote of lack of confidence is beyond any inquiry,
thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is only one ground for the recall of local government
officials: loss of confidence.  This
means that the people may petition or the Preparatory Recall Assembly may
resolve to recall any local elective officials without specifying any
particular ground except loss of confidence.  There is no need for them to bring up any charge of abuse or corruption
against the local elective officials who are the subject of any recall
petition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of Evardone vs. Commission on Elections, et al., 204
SCRA 464, 472 (1991), the Court ruled that "loss of confidence" as a
ground for recall is a political question.  In the words of the Court, "whether or not the electorate of the
municipality of Sulat has lost confidence in the incumbent mayor is a political
question."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Any assertion therefore that the members of
the Bataan preparatory recall assembly voted due to their political aversion to
petitioner Garcia is at best a surmise.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners
also contend that the resolution of the members of the preparatory recall
assembly subverted the will of the electorate of the province of Bataan who
elected petitioner Garcia with a majority of 12,500 votes.  Again, the contention proceeds from the
erroneous premise that the resolution </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">recall is the recall itself.  It refuses to recognize the reality that the resolution of recall is a
mere proposal to the electorate of Bataan to subject petitioner to </span><span style="">a </span><span style="">new test of faith.  The proposal will still be passed upon by
the sovereign electorate of Bataan.  As
this judgment has yet to be expressed, it is premature to conclude that the
sovereign will of the electorate of Bataan has been subverted.  The electorate of Bataan may or may not
recall petitioner Garcia in an appropriate election.  If the electorate re-elects </span>petitioner Garcia, then the
proposal to recall him made by the preparatory recall assembly is
rejected.  On the other hand, if the
electorate does not re-elect petitioner Garcia, then he has lost the confidence
of the people <span style="">which
he once enjoyed.  The judgment will
write </span><i><span style="">finis</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">to </span>this political
controversy.  For more than judgments of
courts of law, the judgment of the tribunal of the people is final for
"sovereignty resides in the people and all government authority emanates
from them."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In
sum, the petition at bench appears to champion the sovereignty of the people,
particularly their direct right to initiate and remove elective local officials
thru recall elections.  If the petition
would succeed, the result will be a return to the previous system of recall
elections which Congress found should be improved.  The alternative mode of initiating recall proceedings thru a
preparatory recall assembly is, however, an innovative attempt by Congress to
remove impediments to the effective exercise by the people of their sovereign
power to check </span>the performance of their elected officials.  The power to determine this mode was
specifically given to Congress and is not proscribed by the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW WHEREOF,</b> the original Petition and the
Supplemental Petition assailing the constitutionality of section 70 of R.A.

The rule is, the termination of the official relations of a public officer
depends on the law under which his office was created.  For incumbents of positions other than
constitutional offices, therefore, the subject of regulating their removal from
office ordinarily forms part of the power of the legislature.  This legislative power, however, is not
absolute, since it may be limited or even completely taken away by the
provisions of the Constitution. Thus, where the Constitution prescribes the
method of removal and the causes for the same, the methods and grounds so
established are exclusive; and it is beyond Congress to prescribe any other
means or causes for removal.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The paramount
issue in this case is the constitutionality of that part of Section 70 of the
Local Government Code of 1991 (R.A. No. 7160) which grants to a body known as
the preparatory recall assembly (PRA) the power to initiate recall proceedings.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> At the provincial level, as in this
case, the PRA is composed of all mayors, vice-mayors, and </span><i style=""><span style="">sanggunian</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">members of the
municipalities and component cities in the province.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issue can
only be resolved by inquiring into the nature or essence of <u>recall</u>.  The system of recall was adopted for the
first time in our jurisdiction in the 1973 Constitution.  Section 2 of Article XI thereof provided:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>  "SEC. 2. <i style="">The Batasang Pambansa</i><span style=""> </span>shall enact a local government code
which may not thereafter be amended except by a majority vote of all its
members, defining a more responsive and accountable local government structure
with an effective system of recall, x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This section was incorporated, with some modifications, in the
1987 Constitution to emphasize the thrust on decentralization and to provide
for a mechanism of initiative and referendum.  Section <span style="">3 </span>of Article X
thereof provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>SEC. 3. The
Congress shall enact a local government code which shall provide for a more
responsive and accountable local government structure instituted through a
system of decentralization with effective mechanisms of recall, initiative, and
referendum, x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Recall is of
American origin.  In 1951, the
constitutions of twelve (12) States of the American union contained provisions
on recall.  Oregon was the first to
adopt it in 1908, although it had been part of the charter of the city of Los
Angeles five years earlier.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

it, like the power of initiative and referendum, to be a fundamental right of
citizens within a representative democracy.  For its definition, <i style="">Wallace</i><span style=""> </span>quotes Webster's New International
Dictionary, <span style="">2<u>nd</u> </span>ed.,
2075, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"The right or procedure by which a public official, commonly a
legislative or executive official, may be removed from office, before the end
of his term of office, by a vote of the people to be taken on the filing of a
petition signed by the required number of qualified voters (commonly
25%)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
principle underlying recall is stated in <i style="">Dunham
vs. Ardery</i></span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">as follows:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We understand that the principle underlying the recall of
public officers means that the people may have an effective and speedy remedy
to remove an official who <span style="">is </span>not
giving satisfaction -- one who they do not want to continue in office,
regardless of whether or not he is discharging his full duty to the best of his
ability and as his conscience dictates.  If the policies pursued do not meet the approval of a majority of the
people, it is the underlying principle of the recall doctrine to permit them to
expeditiously recall the official, without form or ceremony, as provided for in
the charter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since recall is
constitutionally mandated in our jurisdiction, it goes without saying that it
is a power reserved to the people to be exercised by the registered
voters.  It was for this reason that, to
implement the power of recall under the 1973 Constitution, Batas Pambansa Blg.
337 (the old Local Government Code) provided </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Section 54 thereof as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 54.  <i style="">By whom exercised; Requisites</i><span style="">. -- </span>(1) The power of recall shall be
exercised by the registered voters of the unit to which the local elective
official subject to such recall belongs.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(2)  </span>Recall
shall be validly initiated only upon petition of at least twenty-five percent
of the total number of registered voters in the local government unit concerned
based on the election in which the local official sought to be recalled was
elected."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">To implement the
1987 Constitution provision on recall, the Local Government Code of 1991
likewise expressly provides in Section 69 as follows:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 69. <i style="">By whom </i><i style=""><span style="">Exercised</span></i><span style="">. </span><span style="">-? </span><span style="">The power of recall for loss of confidence shall be exercised by the
registered voters of a local government unit to which the local elective
official subject to such recall belongs."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Indubitably
then, the power of recall is <u>exclusively</u> vested in the electorate or,
more specifically, in the registered voters of the local government </span><span style="">unit </span><span style="">concerned.  In the United States, from where we patterned our system of
recall, the initiation of the recall proceeding is always done by a certain
percentage of the voters.  Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x The required percentage ranges from ten in Kansas to
thirty in North Dakota, but twenty-five is by far the most common."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">In
both B.P. Blg. 337 and the Local Government Code of 1991, our Legislature fixed
it at twenty-five percent (25%) of the total number of registered voters in the
local government unit concerned during the election in which the local official
sought to be recalled was elected.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It follows then that said power
cannot be shared with any other group of persons or officials.  Any such sharing would impair or negate the
exclusive character of the power.  It is
indivisible.  Its essential, nay indispensable,
components are the initiation and the election, both of which are substantive
in character.  By reason of its
exclusive and indivisible character, both components must be exercised by the
electorate alone.  The reason why the
initiation phase can and must be done only by the electorate is not </span>difficult
to understand.  If it can also be done
by another body, such as the PRA in this case, the exclusiveness or
indivisibility of the power is necessarily impaired or negated.  In such a case, the electorate is bypassed
and the resulting recall petition or resolution can by no means be an
authentic, free, and voluntary act of the electorate, which characteristics are
the indicia of the exercise of a power.  The power to initiate, being a component of the power of recall,
necessarily includes the power not to initiate.  The power to initiate becomes meaningless if another body is
authorized to do it for the electorate.  Worse, since the second component of the power of recall, i.e., the
recall election, does not come into play without the recall petition, it
follows that where the petition is not done through the initiative of the
electorate because the latter chooses not to exercise its power to recall or
finds no reason therefor, that election becomes, as to the electorate, more of
a duty and not a power.  The electorate
would in effect be compelled to participate in a political exercise it neither
called for nor decided to have.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the fullness of the power of recall precludes the
delegation of the corresponding authority to initiate it to any entity other
than the electorate, especially where the delegation<span style=""> unduly infringes upon and impairs such power as in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I might add that since Congress decided to retain the 25%
requirement for the traditional method of initiating recall -- ­which is the
method in full accord and perfect harmony with the true essence of recall --
the provision for an alternative method, <i>i.e.,</i> recall resolution by a
mere majority of the PRA, is subtly designed to negate, if not altogether
defeat, the power of the electorate and to substitute the will of a very small
group for the will of the electorate.  Admittedly, it is extremely difficult to meet the 25% requirement.  On the other hand, it is far too easy, and
at times politically convenient and expedient, to get a majority of the members
of the PRA to initiate a recall proceeding.  The choice then is all too obvious.  Indeed, this is the clear message of the admission by former Congressman
Wilfredo Cainglet that the 25% requirement rendered the traditional method
ineffective thus necessitating the creation of an alternative method.  But the alternative method besmirches the
sanctity of the recall process.  If 25%
was found ineffective, then the remedy should have been to reduce it to, say,
15% or 20%.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The conclusion
then is inevitable that the provision on the preparatory recall assembly in
Section 70 of the Local Government Code of 1991 is unconstitutional because it
amounts to an undue delegation of the power of recall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">QUIASON, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Recall is a process for the removal of an official during his
term by a vote of a specified number of citizens at an election called for such
purpose (Wallaca v. Tripp, 358 Mich. 668, 101 NW 2d 312).</p>

<p class="BODY">The process may be provided for in a constitution or in the
absence of constitutional empowerment, in ordinary statutes.  In the latter case, the legislature enacts a
system for recall in the exercise of its general control of the removal of
public officer (In re Bower, 41 Ill,. 777, 242 Ne 2D, 252, Dunhan v. Ardery, 43
OKI 619, 142 p. 331).</p>

<p class="BODY">Recall statutes enacted without express constitutional mandate
have been upheld against claims (a) that they are obnoxious to a republican
form of government (Dunhan v. Ardery <u>supra</u>) or (b) that they constitute
a denial of due process or a bill of attainder (State ex rel Topping v.
Houston, 94 Neb. 445, 643 NW 796, Roberts v. Brown, 73 Tenn App. 567, 310 SW
2d. 197).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The procedure in the recall of an official may be prescribed in
the constitution itself or in statutory provisions relating to the
subject.  In passing on the construction
of recall statutes, the courts have enforced them according to their terms and
have disclaimed all concern as to their wisdom and policy (State ex rel Clark
v. Harris, 74 Or 573, 144 p. 109).</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1987 Constitution does not prescribe the procedure in the
recall of elective officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">The intent is clear that the 1987 Constitution leaves it to
Congress to provide the recall mechanism without any pre-ordained
restrictions.  The broad powers of
Congress in prescribing the procedure for recall include the <span style="">determination as to </span>the number of
electors needed to initiate the recall, the method of voting of the electors,
the time and place of the voting and whether the proc<span style="">e</span>ss includes the election of the successor of the recalled
official.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Local Government Code of 1991 (R.A. No. 7160), Congress
adopted an alternative procedure for initiating the recall and made it as a
mere stage of the recall process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Congress also deigned it wise to give the electorate a chance to
participate in the exercise twice:  first, in the initiation of the recall; and, secondly, in the election
of the person to occupy the office subject of the recall.  This is in contrast with the first recall
statute in the Philippines, the Festin Law (Com. Act No. 560) where the
participation of the electorate ended after the voting for the recall.  In the Festin Law, the electorate were
denied the opportunity to vote for the retention of the official subject of the
recall.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a sense, the members of the PRA can be considered as
constituting a segment of the electorate because they are all registered voters
of the province.  If they constitute
less than one percent of the voters in the province, that miniscule number goes
to the policy, not the validity of the law and the remedy to correct such a
flaw is left with the legislature, not with the judiciary.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VITUG, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I fully concur with the
disquisition made by Mr. </span>Justice Reynato S. Puno, and I agree that it is
not within the province of the courts to question the <span style="">wisdom of, let alone supplant, legislative judgments laid down by
Congress to the extent of its constitutional authority and mandate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may not be amiss,
however, to caution against </span>any idea of omnipotence in wielding the
"power of recall" conferred to the "Preparatory Recall
Assembly." Clearly implicit in any grant of power, like any other <span style="">right, is an assumption of a correlative duty
to </span>exercise it responsibly.   When
it, therefore, becomes all too evident that there has been an abuse of that
authority, appropriate judicial recourse to, and corrective relief by, this
Court will not be denied.</p>
