				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In 1981, Ace Building Care and the Philippine Tuberculosis <span style="">Society entered </span>into a contract under
which the former would provide the latter with janitorial and allied services
for <span style="">a </span>stipulated consideration, subject to such
adjustment as might be subsequently required by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contract was renewed yearly until 1985,
when the services were placed under public bidding and a new contract was
awarded to another company, which then took over from ABC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 9, 1985, the 41 janitors ABC had earlier detailed to
PTS filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Commission against both
ABC and PTS for unpaid wage differentials under Wage Order <span style="">Nos. </span><span style="">5 </span>and 6, holiday premium pay, damages
and attorney's fees, reimbursement of cash bond, incentive leave pay and bonus
and separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ABC filed a
cross-claim against PTS, contending that the latter was liable for the
statutory increases, while PTS moved to dismiss on the ground that it belonged
to the public sector and was not covered by the Labor Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the position papers and other evidence submitted
by the parties, Labor Arbiter Felipe T. <span class="SpellE">Garduque</span> II
held <span style="">on </span>September 30, 1987, that
the complainants were not entitled to legal holiday pay and to reimbursement of
cash bond or separation pay except for five of them who were allowed separation
pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision also awarded incentive
leave with pay except for seven of them, who had worked less than one year.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter also held ABC and PTSI jointly and severally
liable for payment of the wage differentials under Wage Orders Nos. 5 and 6.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both ABC and PTSI appealed to the NLRC, which on <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1988</st1:date>, affirmed the
decision with respect to the award of separation pay and service incentive
leave with pay but held that it was ABC alone that should pay the <span style="">wage </span>differentials under Wage Orders
Nos. 5 and <span style="">6.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The complainants and ABC filed their respective motions for
reconsideration and, upon denial thereof, filed the separate petitions for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
with this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon motion of ABC, we
issued on <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1988</st1:date>, a
temporary restraining order enjoining the NLRC from enforcing and/or carrying
out its decision dated <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="2">February 15,
 1988</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1988</st1:date>, we consolidated
the two petitions.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 82868, the petitioners-complainants argue that the
respondent Commission erred in not holding respondents PTS and ABC jointly and <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> <span style="">liable </span>for
the differential pay required under Wage Orders Nos. 5 and 6.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 82932, petitioner ABC raises three issues, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">1.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not herein petitioner Ace Building
Care is liable for the wages and allowances mandated by Wage Orders Nos. 5 and
6; and whether or not herein respondent Philippine Tuberculosis Society, Inc.
should be exempted from the payment of the wages and allowances under the said
Wage Orders to the individual respondents.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">2.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether <span style="">or

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not herein petitioner is liable to
the five individual respondents for the payment of separation pay.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first and common issue in these two petitions has already
been resolved by this Court in Eagle Security Agency, Inc. vs. NLRC,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where we held:</p>

<blockquote>Petitioners' <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability for the
amounts due the security guards finds support in Articles 106, 107 and 109 of
the Labor Code which state that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Art. 106.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Contractor or
subcontractor</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- Whenever an
employer enters into <span style="">a </span>contract
with another person for the performance of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
work, the employees of the contractor and of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">latters</span></span><span style="">' subcontractor, if any, shall be paid in accordance with the provisions
of this Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">In the event that the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay the
wages of his employees in accordance with this Code, the employer shall be
jointly and severally liable with his contractor or subcontractor to such
employees to the extent that he <span style="">is
liable to employees directly employed by him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align: center;" align="center">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="2Q">Art. 107.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Indirect
employer.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>? The provisions of
the immediately preceding Article shall likewise apply to any person,
partnership, association or corporation which, not being an employer, contracts
<span style="">with an independent contractor for the
performance of any work, </span><span style="">task, </span><span style="">job or project.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align: center;" align="center">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="2Q">Art. 109.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Solidary</u></span><u> liability</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The provisions of existing laws to the
contrary notwithstanding, every employer or indirect employer shall <span style="">be held responsible with his contractor or
subcontractor for any violation of this Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For purposes o</span><span style="">f </span><span style="">determining the extent of the civil liability
under this Chapter, they shall be considered as direct employers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">This joint and several
liability of the contractor and the principal is mandated by the Labor Code to
assure compliance of the </span>provisions therein including the statutory
minimum wage (Article 99, Labor Code).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The contractor is made liable by virtue of his status as direct
employer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The principal, on the other
hand, is made the indirect employer of the contractor's employees for purposes
of paying the employees their wages should the <span style="">contractor be unable to pay them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This joint and several liability facilitates, if not guarantees, payment
of the workers’ performance of any work, task, job or project, thus giving the
workers ample protection as mandated by the 1987 Constitution (See Article II,
Sec. 18 and Article XIII, Sec. 3).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, it is beyond dispute that the security guards
are the employees of EAGLE (See Article VII, Sec. 2 of the Contract for
Security Services; G.R. No. 81447, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
34).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That they were assigned to guard
the premises of PTSI pursuant to the latter's contract with EAGLE and that
neither of these two entities paid their wage and allowance increases under the
subject wage orders are also admitted (See Labor Arbiter's Decision, p. 2; G.R.
No. 81447, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 75).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the <span style="">application of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> provisions of
the Labor Code on joint and several liability of the principal and contractor
is appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See Del Rosario &amp;
Sons Logging Enterprises, Inc. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 64204, May 31, 1985, 136 SCRA
669).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the disavowal of liability by PTS on the ground that it
belongs to the public sector, the Court declared<span style=""> </span>through Justice Cortes:</p>

<blockquote>PTSI also alleges that it is exempt from payment under the subject
Wage Orders because it is a public sector employer while the Wage Orders cover
only employers and employees in the private sector (G.R. No. 81447, Petition,
p. 9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is unmeritorious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
definition of <span style="">a </span>public sector
employer relied upon by PTSI is relevant only for<span style=""> purposes of coverage under the Employees’ Compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the Labor Code provides that </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">used </span>in <span style="">Book Three,
Title II on </span><span style="">Wages, </span><span style="">the term "employer" includes
"the Government and all its branches, subdivisions and instrumentalities,
all government-owned or controlled corporations and institutions..." (Article
97(b), Labor Code).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his manifestation dated November 8, 1989, the Solicitor
General declared that his office was "abiding by the aforementioned ruling
of the Honorable Court." PTS, on the other hand, urges us to re-examine
the said case, insisting that the Philippine Tuberculosis Society is expressly
mentioned as belonging to the public sector in Section 3 of the Rules
Implementing Title II, Book IV of the Labor Code, thus:</p>

<blockquote>SEC. 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Employer - (a) The
term shall mean any person natural or juridical, domestic or foreign, who
carries on in the Philippines any trade, business, industry, undertaking or <span style="">activity of any kind and uses the services </span>of
<span style="">another person who is under his orders
as regards the employment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an employer shall belong to either:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <u>public sector</u> covered by the
GSIS, comprising the National Government, including government-owned or
controlled corporations, the <u>Philippine Tuberculosis Society</u>, the
Philippine National Red Cross, and the Philippine Veterans Bank;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <u>private sector</u> covered by the
SSS, comprising all employers <u>other than those defined </u><u><span style="">in </span>the
immediately preceding paragraph</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">PTS adds:</p>

<blockquote>While it is true that the term "employer" as used in
Title II, Book Three of the Labor Code, includes "the Government and all
its branches, subdivisions and instrumentalities, all government-owned or
controlled corporations <span style="">and
institutions …," it does not follow that the government and all its
branches, subdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities are covered by Wage </span>Orders
<span style="">Nos. 5 and 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were so, then every employee in the
government receiving the minimum wage would be entitled </span>to <span style="">wage adjustments <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, however, is not what </span>the wage <span style="">orders intended so their application had to
be limited to "workers in the private sector."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Court sees it, the wage orders do not apply to the <u>direct</u>
employees of PTS who in fact are members of the Government Service Insurance
System.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainants <span style="">in G</span>.R. No.
82868 unquestionably belong to the private sector and for this reason are
covered by the Social Security System.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are the <u>indirect</u> employees of the PTS and as such are
entitled to hold it liable, <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> with their
direct employer, for their unpaid wage differentials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this sense, the PTS <span style="">is </span>correctly classified as an employer
coming under the private sector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>T<span style="">he </span>reference to it <span style="">as </span>belonging
to the public sector relates only to its direct employees "for purposes <span style="">of coverage </span>under
the Employees’ Compensation Commission," not <span style="">to </span>its indirect employees coming from the private sector.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues regarding the separation pay and the service incentive
leave pay are factual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have said
often enough that the findings of fact of quasi-judicial agencies which have
acquired expertise on the specific matters entrusted to their jurisdiction are
accorded by this Court not only respect but even finality if they are supported
by substantial evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied that the complainants were able to establish by
Exhibit "B" their length of service to entitle them to service
incentive leave with pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument
that the affidavit is hearsay because the affiants were not presented for
cross-examination <span style="">is </span>not
persuasive because the rules of evidence are not strictly observed in proceedings
before administrative bodies like the NLRC, where decisions may be reached on
the <span style="">basis </span>of position papers
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also worth noting that ABC
has not presented any evidence of its own to disprove the complainant's
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Solicitor General correctly
points out, it would have been so easy to submit the complainants' employment
records, which were in the custody of ABC, to show that they had served for
less than one year.</p>

<p class="BODY">A slight modification must be made, though, in the case of Norma
Moreno <span class="SpellE">Mangabat</span>, who was denied the service incentive
leave with pay, possibly through an oversight.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibit "B" shows that her employment was from "7/79 to
12/81 and 3/84 to 7/84." Section 3 of Rule V, Book III of the Omnibus
Rules Implementing the Labor Code, provides that the term "at least one
year service" shall mean service within 12 months, whether <u>continuous
or broken</u>, reckoned from the date the employee started working.</p>

<p class="BODY">The submission that the five complainants awarded <span style="">separation pay were not </span>entitled thereto
because their terms expired with the contract with PTS is also not
acceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ABC never offered any
evidence that the employment of the claimants was co-terminal with the
janitorial contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree that the
termination of ABC's contract with PTS resulted in a partial closure or
cessation of operations of ABC that called for the application <span style="">(if </span>only by analogy) of Article 283 of
the Labor Code providing in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><u>In
case of retrenchment to prevent losses and in cases of closures or cessation of
operations of establishment or undertaking not</u> due to serious business
losses or financial <span style="">reverses, the
separation pay shall be equivalent to one (1) month pay or at least one-half
(1/2) month pay for every year of service, whichever is higher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fraction of at least six (6) months shall
be considered one (1) whole year.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Our conclusion is that Ace Building Care and the Philippine
Tuberculosis Society are <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable to the
complainants for their differential pay under Wage Orders Nos. 5 and 6, PTS
being considered <span style="">in </span>the
circumstances of this case to be the indirect employer of workers in the
private sector.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>ABC is liable for the <span style="">pa</span>y<span style="">ment </span>of the separation pay and incentive leave pay of the
complainants mentioned in the challenged decisions, with the modification only
that Norma Moreno <span class="SpellE">Mangabat</span> shall also be entitled to
service incentive leave with pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the above findings, it is no longer necessary to
resolve the motion of the complainants that the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">supersedeas</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>bond fixed by the Court for <span style="">the issuance </span>of the temporary
restraining order <span style="">on </span><st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1988</st1:date>, be increased to
P500,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, judgment is rendered <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. 82868, the decision of respondent
