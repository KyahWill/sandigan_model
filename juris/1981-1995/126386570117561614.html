Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court with a prayer for the issuance of a writ
of preliminary injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
seek to enjoin and restrain respondent judge from further proceeding with Civil
Case No. C-2442 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
(now Regional Trial Court) on the ground of lack of jurisdiction to annul a final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment rendered by the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> (now Regional Trial Court) in
Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">TM-223.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioners filed an action for partition with the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, Branch I, docketed as Civil Case No. TM-223,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1966</st1:date>,
the defendants were served with a copy of the complaint and summons thru their
co­-defendant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> who acknowledged
receipt thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="11" month="7">July 11, 1966</st1:date>,
all the defendants in the above-numbered case, thru counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Pine, filed their answer to the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, on <st1:date year="1967" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1967</st1:date>, the said defendants, thru the same
counsel, filed their amended answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1970</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> (now RTC)
rendered judgment in favor of the petitioners and against all the defendants in
the <span style="">civil </span>case, including
private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since no appeal was
made by any of the defendants from the decision of the trial court, the same
became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and the court issued the
corresponding writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, before the writ could be carried out by the provincial
sheriff, all the defendants, thru the same counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>
Pine, filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> with the Court
of Appeals seeking to annul the writ of execution issued by the trial court in <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> in Case No. <span class="GramE">TM-223.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="7">July
 9, 1971</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition for lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1972</st1:date>,
respondents <span class="SpellE">Lucina</span> <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>
and Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> brought an action before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (now RTC) docketed
as Case <span style="">No. </span><span class="GramE">C-2442,
for the annulment of the final judgment rendered by the trial court in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cavite</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE"> in Case No.</span> TM-223, alleging the following matters:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that they did not authorize anyone including
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Pine to file an answer in their behalf
as defendants in Case No. <span class="GramE"><span style="">TM-</span>223, and that the filing of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
with the Court of Appeals to annul the writ of execution in the same case was
without their <span style="">knowledge and </span>participation.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners’ motion to dismiss the action was denied by the CFI
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the instant <span style="">petition </span>was
filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> (now RTC) committed grave
abuse of discretion or acted without jurisdiction <span style="">in </span>denying the petitioners’ motion to
dismiss the action for annulment of the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment rendered by the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The applicable law is Republic Act No. 296, as amended, otherwise
known as “The Judiciary Act of 1948,” which was the law in force when the <span style="">disputed </span>action for annulment was <span style="">filed </span>on <st1:date year="1972" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1972</st1:date> in the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is based on the principle that the facts
alleged in the complaint and the law in force at the time of commencement of
action determine the jurisdiction of a court (<span class="SpellE">Lum</span>
Bing v. <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>, 92 Phil. 799; Rodriguez v. <span class="SpellE">Pecson</span>, 92 Phil. 172; <span class="SpellE">Salao</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>, No. <span class="GramE">L-29146, </span><st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 5, 1985</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 138 SCRA 17; <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v.

November 27, 1986, 146 SCRA 79).</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 44(a) of the Revised Judiciary Act of 1948 then vested
original jurisdiction in the Courts of First Instance over all civil actions in
which the subject of the litigation is not capable of pecuniary estimation and
an action for the annulment of a judgment <span style="">and
an </span>order of a court of justice belongs <span style="">to </span>this category (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Ursua</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>, 107 Phil.
622).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A court of first instance or a
branch thereof has the authority and the jurisdiction as provided for by law to
annul a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment rendered by
another court of first instance or by another branch <span style="">of </span>the same court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
was the ruling laid down in the cases of <span class="SpellE">Dulap</span> v.
Court of Appeals, No. <span class="GramE">L-28306, </span><st1:date year="1971" day="18" month="12"><span class="GramE">December 18, 1971</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 42 SCRA 537; <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> v. Imperial, No.</span>

318).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in an action to annul
a final judgment or order, the choice of which court the action should be filed
is not left to the parties; by legal mandate the action should be filed with
the Court of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
question is in what place (with what particular court of first instance) the
action should be commenced and tried (<span class="SpellE">Dulap</span>, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue therefore to be resolved in the
instant case is not one of jurisdiction but of venue--whether it was properly
laid in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for the
annulment of the judgment rendered by the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court fixes the venue in Courts
of First Instance, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SEC. 2.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Venue in Courts of First Instance-- (a) Real actions.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- Actions affecting title to, or for
recovery of possession, or for partition or condemnation of, or foreclosure of
mortgage on, real property, shall be commenced and tried in the province where
the property or any part thereof lies.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“(b) Personal actions.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- All other actions may be commenced and
tried where the defendant or any of the defendants resides or may be found, or
where the plaintiff or any of the plaintiffs resides, at the election of the
plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.”</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The complaint filed by respondents with the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> for the annulment of judgment states that they reside
at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> and that petitioners, as
defendants, reside at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
(p. 48, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Since
the action for annulment of judgment is a personal one, the venue of the action
in this case should be either CFI of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> or CFI
of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> at the election of the plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, venue was improperly laid in the CFI
of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and respondent judge should have dismissed
the action for annulment of judgment on the ground of improper venue.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to state at this point that although the
prevailing rule before B.P. 129 was that courts of first instance and their
branches have jurisdiction to annul each other’s final judgments and orders as
ruled in <span class="SpellE">Dulap</span> and subsequent cases, fundamental
principles still dictate that the better policy, as a matter of comity or
courteous interaction between courts of first instance and the branches
thereof, is for the annulment cases to be tried by the same court or branch
which heard the main action sought to be annulled (<span class="SpellE">Gianan</span>
v. Imperial, <u>supra</u>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
despite the re-examination by this Court of the old ruling in <span class="SpellE">Mas</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Dumara-og</span>, <u>supra</u>,
recent decisions still uphold its rationale that pursuant to judicial
stability, the doctrine of non-interference should be regarded as highly
important in the administration of justice whereby the judgment of a court of <span style="">competent </span>jurisdiction may not be
opened, modified or vacated by any court of concurrent jurisdiction (Ngo Bun <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sayo</span>, No. <span class="GramE">L-45825, </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 30, 1988</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 163 SCRA 237;
Republic v. Reyes, Nos.</span> <span class="GramE">L-30263-65, </span><st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 30, <span style="">1987</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style="">; </span>Parco v. Court of
Appeals, No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-33152, </span><st1:date year="1982" day="30" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 30, 1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 111 SCRA).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the foregoing discussion may no longer find any application
at this time with the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, enacted on
August 10, 1981, which transferred the jurisdiction over actions for annulment
of judgment to the Court of Appeals, it was deemed necessary if only to bring
light and settle the existing confusion and chaos among judges of the different
courts of first instance and their branches concerning the application of the
old laws on jurisdiction and venue over this kind of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Probably, this confusion was the underlying
reason of the Legislature behind the transfer of jurisdiction over annulment of
judgments from the trial courts to the Court of Appeals under B.P. 129.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if We were to disregard, for the sake of argument, the issue
on jurisdiction of and venue in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> in the annulment suit, We found, upon perusal of the
records, that no sufficient grounds exist to justify the annulment of the final
judgment of the <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certain requisites must be established before
a judgment can be the subject of an action for annulment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judgment can be annulled only on <span style="">two </span>grounds:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the judgment is void for want of
jurisdiction or for lack of due process of law, or (b) it has been obtained by
fraud (<st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> v. <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span>, No. <span class="GramE">L-17322, </span><st1:date year="1962" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 30, 1962</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 5 SCRA 494).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">None of the aforementioned grounds was shown to exist to support
the annulment action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The contention of
private respondents that they were not served with summons in Case No. TM-223
in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
court is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their memorandum
filed with this Court, they admit that they were served with summons thru their
co-defendant Antonio <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> who acknowledged receipt
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipt of summons is shown
by the return submitted by the sheriff to the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apart from
the presumption that the sheriff had regularly performed his functions, records
amply show that all the defendants, including private respondents had filed
their answer in Case No.TM-223 thru counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>
Pine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when final judgment had been
rendered by the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span> against respondents and
a writ of execution issued by the trial court, the private respondents, thru
the same counsel, Atty. Pine even instituted a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and <i>mandamus</i> to enjoin the execution of the judgment of the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city> court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondents now allege that they have not
authorized Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Pine to appear in their
behalf as defendants in Case No. <span class="GramE">TM-223 or to file the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the appellate court.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such allegation is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">An attorney is presumed to be properly authorized to represent
any cause in which he appears, and no written power of attorney is required to authorize
him to appear in court for his client (Sec. 21, Rule 138, <span class="GramE">Rules</span>
of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that private
respondents had not personally appeared in the hearings of Case TM-223 in the
trial court is immaterial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The filing of
the answer by and appearance of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> Pine in
their behalf are sufficient to give private respondents standing in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is hard to believe that a counsel who has
no personal interest in the case would fight for and defend a case with
persistence and vigor if he had not been authorized or employed by the party
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is obvious that since the
appellate court had decided adversely against private respondents in their
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the latter filed the annulment suit for a
second chance at preventing petitioners from enforcing the decision rendered by
<span style="">the </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cavite</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> court in favor of the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is an important fundamental principle in <span class="GramE">Our</span>
judicial system that every litigation must come to an end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Access to the courts is guaranteed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But there must be a limit thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a litigant’s rights have been
adjudicated in a valid final judgment of a competent court, he should not be
granted an unbridled license to come back for another try.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The prevailing party should not be harassed
by subsequent suits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, if endless
litigations were to be encouraged, unscrupulous litigants will multiply in
number to the detriment of the administration of justice (Ngo Bun <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sayo</span>, <u>supra</u>; <span class="SpellE">Pacquing</span> v. Court of Appeals, G.R. 52498, July 19, 1982,
