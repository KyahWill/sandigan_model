Reynaldo Tayapad appealed from the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Iloilo, convicting him of robbery with homicide, sentencing 
him to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and ordering him to pay an indemnity 
of P12,000 to the heirs of the victim, Quintin Franco, Sr., an alleged 
sexual pervert (Criminal Case No. 12405).
<p>
<em>Version of the prosecution</em>.  - The judgment of conviction was 
based on the testimony of the prosecution witness, Mary Jane Salvalosa, 
12, a grade six pupil of the Jaro Elementary School.  She knows Tayapad 
(Rey), 21, single, jobless and residing at Cuartero Street, Jaro, Iloilo
 City but actually living in the Salvalosa house where he has a 
boyfriend named James (3 and 17, Oct. 29, 1980).
</p><p>
She declared that at about six o'clock in the afternoon of May 22, 1980,
 when it was already dark, she accompanied Tayapad to his house located 
near the compound of the Central Philippine University in Jaro.  He got a
 piece of wood about a meter long and two inches thick which he made her
 carry.  They went to the back of the university garage where she left 
the piece of wood.
</p><p>
At the behest of Tayapad, Mary Jane called Quintin Franco, Sr. in his 
office at the university.  Franco went to the back of the garage.  As 
instructed, she hid herself amidst the sugarcane and papaya plants 
nearby.  While there, she heard three thuds or blows.
</p><p>
Shortly thereafter, Tayapad rejoined her.  They climbed the university 
fence.  He gave her sixty centavos and a wallet which she later returned
 to Tayapad.  She did not see any other person at the back of the 
garage.  <em>Roger Angga was not there</em>.  Tayapad slept in Mary 
Jane's house.  The following morning he told her that Franco was dead 
the night before (8-9 tsn Oct. 29, 1980).
</p><p>
The autopsy disclosed that Franco suffered a contusion-abrasion in the 
occipital region and two lace­rated wounds in the parietal area.  There 
were contusions and an abrasion on his lips.  When his scalp and skull 
were opened, there were massive hematomas and fractures inside.  
Cerebral hemorrhages caused his death (Exh. A and B).
</p><p>
Steve Castillo, a homosexual friend of Tayapad, testified that on the 
following day, May 23, 1980, Tayapad asked him to sell or pawn a ring 
and a watch allegedly given to the latter by his aunt.  The ring was 
said for fifty pesos and the watch was pawned for sixty pesos.  Steve 
received P50 as commission.  Tayapad admitted having disposed of the 
ring and watch which belonged to Franco (8-9, 25-26 tsn March 5, 1981). 
 He burned the wallet.
</p><p>
Dolores Franco, the victim's widow, testified that on May 22, 1980, 
before her husband was killed, he left the house with the sum of P200 
collected from a tenant of their land.  He was wearing a gold ring and a
 Seiko wrist watch worth P300.  The money, ring and watch were missing 
when his dead body was found.
</p><p>
<em>Accused Tayapad's version</em>.  - Tayapad's story is that Franco, 
"admittedly a homosexual", was killed by his "virile lover", Roger Angga
 (who did not testify).
</p><p>
As summarized in his brief, Tayapad's testimony was that in the morning 
of May 22, 1980, Franco phoned him and requested him to contact Angga.  
At two-thirty in the afternoon, he went downtown to look for Angga whom 
he met at the Palace Theater.  He told Angga that Franco needed his 
services (services between homosexuals and virile men).  Angga promised 
to meet Franco.
</p><p>
Tayapad went to Barangay Calubi-an, Jaro at the residence of the 
Salvalosas to converse with his friends.  He left the place at about six
 o'clock and went home, accompanied by Mary Jane.  From there, he and 
Mary Jane proceeded to the Central Philippine University.  He brought a 
piece of wood of about two feet in length and two inches in diameter 
because, when taking the route passing over the fence and nearing 
President Pulido's house in the university compound, they might 
encounter the latter's big dogs.
</p><p>
He and Mary Jane went to the playground and then to the Alumni Building.
  It was about six thirty.  He saw Angga seated under the acacia tree as
 if he was hiding.  He was obviously under the influence of drugs.  His 
lips were pale and he was shivering.
</p><p>
Tayapad took Mary Jane to the Alumni Building and from the window he 
pointed Franco to her.  Mary Jane then went to the office of Franco.  
Upon her return, she told Tayapad that Franco needed him in the office. 
 He went to the office of Franco.  He and Mr. Franco exchanged 
greetings.  He told Franco that Angga was outside.
</p><p>
Franco asked him to tell Angga to go to the back of the garage.  While 
there, he requested Mary Jane to leave them for a moment as he and 
Franco had something to talk about.  When Tayapad was about to fetch 
Angga, he saw the latter coming towards them.  Tayapad asked permission 
to leave but Franco requested him to stay.  He stayed but moved away 
from Franco and Angga by about five to ten feet.
</p><p>
Tayapad heard them arguing.  Angga was saying "You are stingy and I am 
not satisfied with what you are doing to me".  After Angga uttered these
 words, he heard a thud.  He approached Angga and Franco.  He saw Roger 
holding an iron pipe with his two hands and striking Franco on the head.
  He tried to stop Angga but the latter said:  "Be calm, you son of a 
bitch".
</p><p>
Tayapad wanted to help Franco and tried to stop Angga but due to fear 
and shock, he could not move his hands as if he was paralyzed.  After 
Angga's third blow at the head of Franco, the latter fell to the ground.
  He saw Angga take the wallet, ring and watch of Franco.
</p><p>
When Angga turned back and bent over Franco, Tayapad ran away.  He 
looked for Mary Jane and saw her near the papaya plant.  He called for 
her.  They passed through the sugarcane and corn plants and climbed back
 at the fence.
</p><p>
The next morning at about seven o'clock Angga called him to contact Franco.  He phoned the Franco residence.
</p><p>
Tayapad came to know Angga when the latter was introduced to him by his 
friend, Alain Gray.  He introduced Angga to Franco because he knew that 
Angga could do the thing which Franco needed very much.
</p><p>
Tayapad was investigated by the police about this incident on June 11, 
1980.  Sergeant Estampador asked him to sign his statement hurriedly 
without reading its contents because he was afraid the police might do 
something bad to him.  When he told them about Angga, they refused to 
believe that such person existed.  They pointed to him (Tayapad) as the 
one who killed Franco.  The charge against him is a lie because he could
 not do such a thing, even in thought, because Franco was good to him.
</p><p>
The article given to him by Angga was not given to the police because he
 was able to sell it through somebody.  He was afraid that the article 
might be discovered in his possession.
</p><p>
<em>Ruling</em>.  - The trial court gave credence to the artless 
testimony of a guileless twelve-year old-girl.  The fact that Tayapad 
told her that Franco was dead and that the watch and ring were in his 
possession and were sold by him through a homosexual crony are 
circumstantial evidence connecting him with the robbery with homicide.
</p><p>
The trial court doubted the <em>existence of Angga</em>.  It regarded 
Tayapad's uncorroborated declaration that Angga was the killer as a pure
 invention.  Not even Alain Gray, who allegedly introduced Angga to 
Tayapad, testified for Tayapad.  The police could not find him.
</p><p>
Mrs. Franco belied Tayapad's testimony that Franco called Tayapad in the
 morning of May 22, 1980.  The truth was that Franco was in Barotac 
Viejo from five o'clock in the morning to four o'clock in the afternoon 
of that day.
</p><p>
In this appeal, Tayapad contends that the trial court erred in holding 
that he was the killer of Franco and that the circumstantial evidence 
proves his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.
</p><p>
As pointed out by the Solicitor General, Mary Jane's testimony that only
 Tayapad and Franco were at the back of the garage and no other person 
was there at the time of the killing is more credible than Tayapad's 
testimony that Angga was there.
</p><p>
Surely, Mary Jane would have noticed Angga's presence if such a person 
was in the vicinity.  Tayapad would have mentioned Angga to Mary Jane.  
He did not do so.  He existed only in Tayapad's imagination.  That was 
why Mary Jane did not see him.  Tayapad's imputation of the crime to 
Angga does not create any reasonable doubt as to his guilt for <em>robo con homicidio</em>.
</p><p>
The circumstances proven constitute an unbroken chain which leads to but
 one fair and reasonable con­clusion and that is that Tayapad was the 
perpetrator of the robbery with homicide (U. S. vs. Villos, 6 Phil. 
510).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the trial court's judgment is affirmed with the modification 
that the accused is further sentenced to pay Dolores Franco P500 as the 
value of the cash, ring and watch.  The indemnity of P12,000 is 
increased to P30,000.  No costs.
SO ORDERED.
