prevailing party should not be harassed by subsequent suits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, if endless <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

(Ngo Bun <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> v. Judge <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sayo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">, G.R. No. 45825, June 30, 1988).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no dispute that
the decision of the Minister of Labor in this case has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; neither petitioner nor private respondent having
appealed or moved for reconsideration thereof, and that petitioner is willing
to satisfy the judgment and has in fact disbursed money to private respondent
for the purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bone of contention
however, is in the amount of the judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It will be noted that </span>petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">school never raised the issue of the supposed ambiguity of the decision
of the Minister of Labor, not even in a motion for clarification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, the
terms of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of </span>the
judgment are clear, that the Minister of Labor was thinking in specific amounts
not in terms of percentages, although the same were based on estimates or
approximations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Were it otherwise, or as
petitioner school would have it, the Minister of Labor would have confined
himself to statement of percentages without mentioning the total of the amount
involved in each item nor the grand total of P943<span class="GramE">,980.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a primary and elementary rule of construction of documents
that when the words or language thereof is clear or readily understandable by
an ordinary reader, there is absolutely no room for interpretation (<span class="SpellE">Leveriza</span> v. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">IAC, 157
SCRA </span>282 [1988]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise it has
been held that where the import of a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">decision
is clear, the </span>motion for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">clarification
of the same will </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">denied (Baer
v. <span class="SpellE">Tizon</span>, 58 SCRA 3 [1974]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Moreover, a lurking
ambiguity if <span class="GramE">any,</span> can be readily dissipated by a
consideration of the decision in its entirety.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As </span>admitted by both petitioner and private respondent, the
estimates are based on projections, so that the result of the percentages is
not immediately discernible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
therefore, obvious that the Minister decreed a fixed amount acceptable to both
parties and intended to finally dispose of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In addition, a writ will
not </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">recalled by reason of any
defense which could have been made at the time of the trial of the case, nor
can the recall be made so as to practically change the terms of a judgment
which has become final (<span class="SpellE">Walfson</span> v. </span>Del <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rosario, 46 Phil. 43 [1924]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise settled in the </span><span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the </span>court retains a
certain amount of control over a writ of execution after it leaves its hands
but control is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">limited </span>and
regulated by fairly definite rules of law and is not unrestricted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a writ of execution may be quashed when
it appears:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a) that it has been
improvidently issued, or b) that it is defective in substance, or c) is issued
to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">wrong </span>party, or d) that
the judgment debt has been paid or satisfied, or e) when the writ has been
issued without authority, or f) there had been a change in the situation of the
parties which makes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">such </span>execution
inequitable, or g) when it appears that the controversy had never been
submitted to the judgment of the court, and therefore no judgment at all had
ever been rendered thereon (Cobb-Perez v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lantin</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">, </span>23 SCRA 637).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
not one of the grounds mentioned is present in the case at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
a part payment of the judgment does not authorize the <span class="SpellE">quashal</span>
or recall of the writ in its entirety if the full amount of the judgment is due
and demandable (<span class="SpellE">Walfson</span> v. Del Rosario, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Likewise noteworthy in
the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> case is the fact that an extension of
time fixed by a judgment which has become final for the payment of a certain
sum of money is in effect a modification of the judgment and is beyond the
jurisdiction of the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it
has been settled in the case of <span class="SpellE">Itogon-Suyoc</span> Mines v.
NLRC, 117 SCRA 523 [1982]), that a party cannot impugn the correctness of a
judgment not appealed from by him; and while he may make counter assignment of
errors, he can do so only to sustain the judgment on other grounds, but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>to seek modification <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or reversal thereof, for </span>in such case
he must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, a party who voluntarily executes,
