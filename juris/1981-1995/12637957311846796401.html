CAREFUL REVIEW OF THE FACTS AND EVIDENCE ON RECORD WILL READILY DISCLOSE A
NEGATIVE ANSWER.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AS SUPERVISOR, THE
COMPLAINANT IS INDEED DUTY BOUND TO MAINTAIN AN IMPECCABLE RECORD OF ATTENDANCE

ALSO FOR HIM TO ATTEND TO IMPORTANT BUSINESS MATTERS THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE
FIRST HOURS OF EACH WORK DAY.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>IN FACT,
HIS BEING FOUND TO HAVE BEEN REPORTING LATE FOR WORK FOR NO LESS THAN
SEVENTY-FIVE (75) TIMES DURING A TWO-YEAR PERIOD DOES NOT SPEAK WELL OF HIS
COMMITMENT TO HIS FUNCTIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AS A SUPERVISOR, ESPECIALLY
CONSIDERING THE LAME EXCUSES HE USED TO JUSTIFY HIS FREQUENT TARDINESS, E.G.,
'FLAT TIRES, PERSONAL MATTERS, CAR REPAIRS, ETC.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IN THE SAME BREATH, COMPLAINANT'S RE­ACTION TO THE MEMORANDUM
OF THE PERSONNEL MANAGER WHICH ASKED HIM TO REFRAIN FROM ENTERING AND HANGING
HIS CLOTHES IN THE LADIES' ROOM CLEARLY CONSTITUTES CONDUCT UN­BECOMING OF A
MANAGERIAL EMPLOYEE, FOR INS­TEAD OF DISPLAYING A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DE­CORUM
AND RESPECT HE RESPONDED WITH UNCALLED FOR OUTBURST AND LANGUAGE NOT EXPECTED
OF HIM BY REASON OF HIS POSITION.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"MOREOVER, AS A CREDIT AND COLLECTION SUPERVISOR <span class="GramE">WHOSE</span> FUNCTIONS REQUIRE CONSTANT RAPPORT WITH THE CUSTOMERS
OF THE RESPONDENT COMPANY, HE WAS EXPECTED TO USE AT ALL TIMES TACT AND
DIPLOMACY WHEN DEALING WITH THE CUSTOMERS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>BUT CONTRARY TO THIS EXPECTATION, COMPLAINTS WERE RECEIVED FROM REGULAR
CLIENTS THAT HE WAS CONDUCTING HIS TRANSACTIONS WITH THE LATTER IN A VERY
UNPROFESSIONAL AND OFFENSIVE MANNER, THEREBY FORCING THE RESPONDENTS THRU THEIR
ASSISTANT MANAGER TO WRITE LETTERS OF APOLOGY TO SAID COMPLAINING CLIENTS
INASMUCH AS SAID UNPROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOUR IS CAUSING GRAVE PREJUDICE TO THE
BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND INTERESTS OF THE RESPONDENTS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>THIS HAS BEEN AGGRAVATED WHEN HE SHOUTED AT A
CLIENT AND EVEN WENT TO THE EXTENT OF CHALLENGING THE LATTER TO A FISTFIGHT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"UNDER THE FOREGOING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES IT COULD BE SAID
THAT IF ON ACCOUNT OF THE ACTS AND UNPROFESSIONAL CONDUCT OF COMPLAINANT HE HAD
SHOWN THAT HE COULD NOT EFFECTIVELY PERFORM HIS DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
WHEN QUARRELING WITH THE CLIENTS AND THAT HE COULD NOT SET HIMSELF AS A GOOD
EXAMPLE WHEN HE IS THE FIRST ONE TO BREAK THE RULES OF DISCIPLINE AND GOOD

PLACED UNDER PREVENTIVE SUSPENSION, WAS MORE OF AN ANTICIPATION OF WHATEVER
