not the accused had indeed committed the crime of rape as charged, to merit a
judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision rendered on <st1:date year="1985" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1985</st1:date>, the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">, </span>after thoroughly evaluating the evidences presented and after
observing the demeanor and listening to the testimony of the witnesses, found
the accused guilty of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">crime </span>of
rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
<span class="GramE">portion</span> of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the court finds the accused <span class="SpellE">Concordio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sarda</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
Rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the revised penal code
committed with the use of a bolo a deadly weapon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There being an aggravating circumstance that
the crime was committed in an uninhabited <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">place
which is not offset by any mitigating circumstance, the court has no
alternative but to impose the </span>ca<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pital
punishment of DEATH.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>May the Lord have
mercy on your <span class="GramE">soul.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

her for the suffering and humiliation undergone by her by reason of the sexual
affront perpetrated upon her." (p. 51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sabornido</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> filed a complaint against the accused two
(2) days after the alleged rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
crime was said to have been committed as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with deliberate intent to
have sexual intercourse, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and
criminally hold the hands of one VENUS SABORNIDO, his step daughter, and
removed his sharp pointed bolo and pointed it to her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

superior strength and force (2) the crime was isolated (3) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the victim </span>is 12 years old (4) the
perpetrator used sharp pointed bolo.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law."</span> (p. 1, decision)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts attending the commission of the crime are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">summarized in the People's brief as follows:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30 o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon, 12-year old private complainant Venus <span class="SpellE">Sabornido</span>
was in an isolated bamboo grove located at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>,
together with her stepfather, appellant <span class="SpellE">Concordio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarda</span>, cutting bamboos for <span class="SpellE">banca</span>
outriggers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her mother, Lilia de la
Pena, had earlier gone home to get food (p. 3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
Sept. 12, 1985, testi­mony of Venus <span class="SpellE">Sabornido</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant called private complainant to come near him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she did, appellant held her right hand
and said: 'Venus, I will use you and do not <span class="GramE">worry,</span> I
will be responsible for you.' At this point, private complainant cried and
struggled to get free.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant unsheathed
his bolo pointed the same to private complainant's neck and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">threatened to kill her if she made a noise or
moved (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"Appellant pushed private complainant to the ground while
repeating his threats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He removed her
underwear with one hand and held the bolo to her neck with the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant then let go of the bolo and pulled
down his trousers to his knees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He <span class="GramE">laid</span> on top of private complainant who tried to close her
legs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But appellant place (sic) his knee
between her legs to force them apart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then with one hand, he inserted his sexual organ into that of private
complainant, and with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">other </span>one
hand immobilized her arms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he
finished, appellant loosened his grip on private complainant who thereupon sat
up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While zipping his pants, appellant
told the crying child: 'Do not worry, I will be the one responsible for you, I
will give you everything which will make you happy, do not tell this matter to
anybody or else I will kill you.' (pp. 6-10, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra)</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Private complainant left appellant and headed for home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the way, she met her mother who was
bringing food to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her mother
inquired why she was crying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She replied
that they would talk about it at their house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon reaching home, private complainant told her mother that she was
raped by her stepfather in the bamboo grove.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant did not come home that night.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The next morning, private complainant went to the police with
her mother and gave a statement recounting her harrowing experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, private complainant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and her mother proceeded to see Dr. Franco <span class="SpellE">Redoblado</span> who conducted a physical examination of her
sexual organ (pp. 11-13, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

of Dr. Franco <span class="SpellE">Redoblado</span>) (pp. 3-6, <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant denies the crime of rape, stating that he and the
complainant had an amorous relationship and he was charged only because they
were caught “in <span class="SpellE">flagrante</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span>.”<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused entered a plea of not guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He now assigns the following errors:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN NOT GIVING EVIDENTIARY
WEIGHT AND CREDENCE TO THE TESTIMONIES OF THE ACCUSED AS WELL AS THE
COMPLAINANT'S MOTHER.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN
GIVING SO MUCH CREDIBILITY AND CREDENCE TO THE VERSION OF THE COMPLAINANT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE COURT A QUO ERRED IN FINDING THE
ACCUSED GUILTY AS CHARGED INSTEAD OF ACQUITTING HIM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 1-2, Appellant's Brief)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused assigns as error the failure of the trial court to
give weight and credit to his testimony and to that of the complainant's
mother, his common-law wife.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the facts and evidences in the records, this
Court, like the trial court, considers said testimonies unworthy of
belief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
testimony, for one, is not only self-serving but contrary to human
experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the accused would like
the court to believe was that he and his twelve year old step daughter had an
amorous relationship going on for three (3) months already and that the only
reason why they could not indulge in sexual relations earlier was because the
mother was in the house and that they only had an opportunity to do so on that
fateful day of March 31, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is unbelievable for if it were true that the two
were really sweethearts, they would have indulged in sexual acts several times,
and not only once (People v. <span class="SpellE">Moredo</span>, 127 SCRA 117
[1984]), Surely, there would have been similar opportunities during the span of
time that the accused claimed their relationship had been existing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated by the trial court, there were more
opportunities in the house than in a bamboo grove.</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts of the complainant belie the allegation of the
accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If there was really
consent on the part of Venus, the victim, she would not have immediately filed
the charges the following day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No reason
was given by the appellant except the contention that Venus would not have
filed the case if not for her mother's arrival, which means she reported the
incident only because she feared her mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But Lilia herself, the victim's mother, reported the rape and had her
daughter physically examined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was to
her mother that Venus first reported the abuse by her stepfather.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the mother really saw her daughter and
common-law husband in an intimate embrace, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">she </span>would not have accompanied her daughter to the police and to
the doctor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At most, she would have
charged the two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and not the appellant
alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no reason also
for the victim to file charges against one who had not done anything wrong to
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There can be </span>no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">direct benefit to her family, only harm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This explains the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">change </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of heart of the mother who did not want </span>the man who had been her
husband since 1979 to go to jail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is an absence of motive of the complainant to file the rape charge against the
accused (People v. Rosario, 159 SCRA 192 [1988]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, for filing the case she will
get shame and humiliation in return -- something unbearable to a barrio girl
just emerging from childhood.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lilia de la Pena's
testimony cannot likewise be given merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Her testimony appears perjured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court </span>did not give credence to the testimony of a
witness whose statements are not only contradictory to her earlier spontaneous
acts but also patently untruthful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
one instance, Lilia told the court that the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">was </span>her husband and Venus, her daughter by her deceased
husband.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She later admitted on
cross-examination that <span class="SpellE">Pepe</span> <span class="SpellE">Sabornido</span>
her lawful husband was still alive and that she and the accused were not
legally married.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A court will find it
difficult to believe a witness who cannot even tell the truth about her own
personal circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidence to be
worthy of credence, must not only be credible but must also come from a
credible source (People v. <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>, 123 SCRA 327
[1983]).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lilia's actions are
likewise inconsistent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She reported the
rape incident immediately, obviously to seek justice for her daughter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She later testified for the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She gave no reason for the change.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Testimony coming from such a source is not
worthy of credence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The appellant assigns as
another error the trial court's giving credence to the complainant's testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sarda</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> contends that the victim never registered a
strong </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">outcry </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The failure of the complainant to scream is fully </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">satisfactorily explained (See People v. <span class="SpellE">Mustacisa</span>,
159 SCRA 227 [1988]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the fact that the place was isolated with the nearest
house 150 to 250 meters away, there was the threat employed by the accused on
the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is moreover the moral
ascendancy of the stepfather over the 12-year old stepchild.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This also explains why the victim was not
able to free herself and run for safety when the accused relaxed his guard on
her.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has consistently held that rape is committed when
intimidation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">is </span>used on the victim
(People v. Daniel, 86 SCRA 511 [1978]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's attempt to establish an intimacy between him and
the victim by the fact that the latter addressed him simply as Cording, must
not likewise be given credence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As held in the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">case </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span><u>People</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">v</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Manalo</u></span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(145 SCRA 9 [1986]) familiarity between
the accused and the offended party does not create an inference that an amorous
relation existed between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It can
even be </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sign of disrespect or
disregard for the person who took the place of </span>her father and who has
now ruined her future.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the appellant contends that the resistance offered by
the victim should have been strong and genuine to prove rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That it must have been tenaciously carried
throughout is not necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records
show that the victim offered resistance by closing her legs and pushing the
appellant but she finally succumbed because of the appellant's superior
strength and threats.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The moral
ascendancy and influence of the appellant over the victim enabled him to select
a time and place where rape could be effected unnoticed by other persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We consider that Venus treated the accused as
her father as manifested in her testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused submits that the force and intimidation used are not
sufficient to prove that he committed the crime of rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records belie this argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence sufficiently establishes the
elements of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">As compared with the self-serving testimony of the accused and
the highly doubtful testimony of the complainant’s mother, the testimony of the
complainant was given in a simple, straight-forward and spontaneous manner
reflecting the truth (People v. <span class="SpellE">Ausan</span>, 152 SCRA 52
[1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been a long-established
rule that in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">prosecution for </span>rape, the accused may
be convicted even on the complainant's testimony alone, if credible (People v. <span class="SpellE">Monteverde</span>, 142 SCRA 668 [1986]).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is a principle that "conclusions as to
credibility in rape cases lie heavily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">on
</span>the trial court".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Partulan</span>, 156 SCRA 489 [1987])
and People v. <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>, 116 SCRA 487 [1982]) for it is
the court which has observed the behavior and deportment of the witnesses.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lastly, the appellant
claims that the prosecution evidence failed to prove his guilt beyond
reasonable doubt considering that the complainant's version is questionable and
not totally believable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There is no reason for us
to disbelieve the complainant's testimony and to reverse the trial court's
finding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As earlier stated, the
testimony of Venus was given </span>in a straight-forward, convincing, and
consistent manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
stated:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Venus is not the personification of the Goddess of Beauty

<blockquote>"The court observed her give a positive <span class="GramE">straight,</span>
