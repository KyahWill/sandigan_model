due to the ap­proaching fiesta of <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Maglihe</span>, a dance was held in said <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
in the evening of April 21, 1983; that while the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain was deliver­ing a speech to start the dance, the accused Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> went to the middle of the dancing floor, making a
dance movement known in the <span class="SpellE">visayan</span> as '<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">nagkorantsa</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">', brandishing his knife and challenging
everyone as to who was brave among the people present; the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain approached Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> and admonished him
to keep quiet and not to disturb the dance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the accused, instead of heeding to the advice of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain, stabbed the latter on the left arm; that
accused Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> held the left hand of ac­cused
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dionilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Garol</span> was able to get from the hand of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> the hunting knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately thereafter, accused Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, who rushed towards the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain, stabbed the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain at the back and
the other co-accused also took turns in stabbing the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain; the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain at that time was not
armed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except for the accused Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span>, Danny Esteban and <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villaester</span> who were merely holding stones, the other
co-accused participated in the stabbing incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain fell to the ground and died, the accused in this case took turns in
kicking the dead body of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain and
were dancing </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">around said dead body;
that the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain suffered eleven (11) wounds
in the different parts of his body, two of which happened to be at the back of
his dead body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the

rushed to and attacked the victim followed by the other co-accused in this case
who also rushed at and stabbed the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He specified that accused Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sidrito</span> <span class="SpellE">Lokesio</span> were carrying
knives while the accused <span class="SpellE">Merlando</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>
was carrying a bolo; and that they stabbed the victim one after another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He said that the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Danny </span>Esteban, Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaester</span> were all carrying stones which they threw at the
store of the victim's wife (TSN pp. 7-10; Oct. 17, 1983).</p>

<p class="BODY">This testimony was fully corroborated by another pro­secution
eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Cero who was about three (3)
meters away and whose narration tallied on all material points with that of <span class="SpellE">Dionilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garol</span> as to what
transpired that night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated further
that when he saw the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain being stabbed
he tried to approach the group but he was held by Danny Esteban who said
"do not try to interfere, you are not a party to this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have already gotten what we have been
aiming for." <span class="GramE">(TSN, page 12, Oct. 18, 1983).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he ran away but Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> and
Danny Esteban stoned him because they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">intended
to kill him also.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also testified that
when he returned to the crime scene, he saw Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span>,
Danny Esteban and companions simultaneously kicking the dead body and shouting
"who is brave among here."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

also added that Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> wanted to be a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain and she happened to know that as a fact,
because he told the crowd not to listen to the victim's speech </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the latter will not be staying long as <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She also testified that the
accused <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaester</span>
splashed one glass of tuba on the face of the deceased and that the victim had
had a misunderstanding with the <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> on a theft
case involving Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 68-69).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It will be noted that the
above witnesses were cate­gorical and straightforward when they stated that
they saw appellants stab the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They even specified the type of weapon used
by each of said appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">There is no possibility
that they could have been mis­taken in their identification for apart from
being near the crime scene which was well illuminated with two <span class="SpellE">Petromax</span> lamps (TSN, page 6, Oct. 19, 1983), these
witnesses are familiar with the appellants since they are all residents of the
same locality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, there is no
showing that the witnesses had any motive to testify falsely against the
appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In fact, under similar
circumstances, the Court has held that where the scene of the stabbing was
clearly lighted and no motive was shown why prosecution witnesses would in</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">criminate the appellants, identification
would be given full faith and credit (People v. <span class="SpellE">Escoltero</span>,
139 SCRA 218).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The theory of the defense in this case is that it was only the
accused Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> who stabbed the victim while
the other accused did not participate in the stabbing incident (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 75-76).</p>

<p class="BODY">In an attempt to disprove the findings of the trial court,
appellants pointed out that there are certain incon­sistencies that render the
testimonies of prosecution wit­nesses, incredible.</p>

<p class="BODY">For one thing they claim that <span class="SpellE">Dionilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garol</span> could not have seen Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>
stab the victim because as <span class="SpellE">Garol</span> himself stated, when
said accused rushed towards the victim, he ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows however, that <span class="SpellE">Garol</span> clearly testified that he saw all of them stab the
Barrio Captain, one after another and it was only after the Barrio Captain fell
to the ground that he ran towards the municipal hall to report the incident to
the police (TSN, page 11, Oct. 17, 1983).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Another circumstance
allegedly raising grave doubts on the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Dionilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Garol</span> was his failure to report to the police
authorities the fact of stoning (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 71-72).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">However, the fact of
stoning was not the means used to kill the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">victim </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and the omission </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of the same in the narration in the report
does not detract from the esta­blished fact that the victim was stabbed several
times which caused his death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was also pointed out that <span class="SpellE">Dionilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garol</span> testified that the store of the victim's wife was
stoned while <span class="SpellE">Boni­facio</span> Cero also testified that he
was the one being stoned.</p>

<p class="BODY">There appears to be no inconsistency between the two testimonies.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The fact that the store of the victim's
wife <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was stoned does not preclude the
possibility that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Cero was also stoned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Finally, appellants
maintain that <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Cero could not have seen with
precision the stabbing of the victim while he was being hugged by Danny Esteban
and he had a feeling that he would be killed by the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Much less could it be possible for accused
Danny Esteban, <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaester</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sidrito</span> <span class="SpellE">Lokesio</span> and Alfredo
<span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> who were at the store of <span class="SpellE">Severina</span> <span class="SpellE">Cadillero</span>, to join in
stabbing the victim, the appellants argued (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 73-74).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The records show that
Cero testified that he saw appellants stab the deceased before he was embraced
by appellant Danny Esteban who told him "do not interfere you are not a
party to this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have already gotten
what we have been aiming for." <span class="GramE">(TSN, page 12, Oct. 18,
1983).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the language is
unmistakable that in that at said point, the stabbing and the killing being
described by all the witnesses had already been accomplished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Indeed, if there be any
inconsistency or contradictions in their testimonies, the same are trivial and
merely refer to minor matters which do not affect credi­bility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They do not detract from the essential facts
or vital details of the crime pinpointing their criminal responsibility (<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief, p. 16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As held by this Court, discrepancies in minor details are to be expected
from an <span class="SpellE">uncoached</span> witness (People v. <span class="SpellE">Arbois</span>, 138 SCRA 31).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such minor variations would rather show the sincerity of the witnesses
and the absence of connivance between them to make their testimonies tally in
every respect (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pielago</span>, 140 SCRA 419,
423).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Truth to tell, such trivial
differences constitute fail-safe reliability.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Accused Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> claims that the trial court erred in not giving
weight to the admission of accused Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>
that he was the lone perpetrator of the killing incident (Brief for
Accused-Appellant Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span>, p. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus the defense argues that the accused
Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, </span>Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Merlando</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sidrito</span> <span class="SpellE">Lokesio</span>, <span class="SpellE">Monico</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> and <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaester</span>, did not stab
the victim and were not at the scene of the crime and that it was only accused
Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> who stabbed the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As found by the trial
court, such claim is not sup</span>ported by sufficient evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, an entry in the Police
Logbook (Exhibit "D") of the Integrated National Police of <span class="SpellE">Tayasan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, shows
that one Gloria Callao, wife of the accused <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, turned over to the police two (2) hunting knives
owned by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the accused Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> and Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More­</span>over, as correctly pointed out by
the Solicitor General, such theory is belied by the identification made by the
prosecution witnesses and by the number and location of the victim's wounds
which are mute evidence that several persons committed the crime (People's
Brief, p. 17).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As repeatedly held by the
Supreme Court, the claim of alibi by the accused cannot prevail over positive
iden­tification by credible witnesses (People v. <span class="SpellE">Tirol</span>,
102 SCRA 558); more so where as in the case at bar, it was not demonstrated
that it was physically impossible for the accused to have been at the scene of
said crime at the time of its commission (People v. Mercado, 97 SCRA 232).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand, the
claim of Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> of self-defense when he
stabbed the victim is not sustained by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial court, the victim </span>was
not armed at the time of the incident, so that there was no danger to the life
and limb of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The latter claims that he had to stab the victim who boxed him and
would not release his wounded hand (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 76).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the obvious disproportion of the
means used to repel the alleged attack, three witnesses of the prosecu­tion
testified that the accused Hamlet <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> rushed
towards the victim and stabbed the latter at the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said testimonies were corroborated by the
Post Mortem Examination (Exhibit "A") and the Sketch (Exhibit
"B") of the human body of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">victim
</span>which showed a stab wound at the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, the nature, character, location and extent of the wound
suffered by the victim, negates the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> claim
of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span>, 54 Phil. 77).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, the eleven (11) wounds suffered by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">victim </span>are indicative of aggression (People v. <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>, 83 Phil. 548; People v. Mendoza, L-16392, Jan. 30,
1965).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> submits
that the pro­secution failed to prove the existence of conspiracy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among others, he pointed out that he was
unarmed at the time of the incident, that his name was not mentioned in the
report made by <span class="SpellE">Dionilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garol</span>
to Patrolman Barrera as to the perpetrators of the crime; that his name was not
included in the entry in the police logbook of the Integrated National Police
of <span class="SpellE">Tayasan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental
and that he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">had no </span>participation
in the commission of the felony except the alleged nodding of his head at a
time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">when he was trying </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">wrest the </span>knife from Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span> which is not an indication of conspiracy (Brief
for <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span>, pp. 13-16).</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that the accused Hugo Grengia, Danny Esteban and
Leonilo Villaester did not participate in the stabbing, the lower court finds
them equally liable as principals with the other accused in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were found to be holding stones which
they threw at the store owned by the victim and his wife; they participated in
kicking and dancing around the dead body of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain and although <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> also tried to wrest the
knife from Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, he clearly told <span class="SpellE">Dionilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Garol</span> when the latter
succeeded in getting the knife and was hold­ing the hands of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dollantes</span>, "do not try to intervene here because you
might be included in the plan." <span class="GramE">(TSN, pp. 7-10, October
17, 1983).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Danny Esteban uttered
the same statements to <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Cero, saying
"do not try to interfere you are not a party to this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have already gotten what we have been
aiming for." <span class="GramE">(TSN, pp. 9-14, October 18, 1983).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, as previously stated, while the victim was
delivering a speech, Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> was telling people
not to listen to the victim as he will not stay long as a <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also to be noted that
although he was a <span class="SpellE">compadre</span> of the victim, he never
tried to help the former while he was being stabbed and after the incident, he
never visited the victim's family.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus the lower court found the existence of conspiracy as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span>, Danny
Esteban and <span class="SpellE">Leonilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaester</span>
by their acts, aimed at the same object, and their acts, though apparently
independent, are in fact concerted and cooperative, indi­cating closeness of
personal association, concerted action and concurrence of senti­ments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The conduct of the defendants, before, during
and after the commission of the crime clearly shows that they acted in
concert.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Emilio <span class="SpellE">Agag</span>, L-64951, June 29, 1984, Justice <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>)

them guilty of Murder." (Decision, <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case
No. 5832, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 77)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In one case, this Court held "that while the acts done by
the petitioners herein vary from those of their co-accused, there is no
question that they were all prompted and linked by a common desire to assault

<p class="BODY">Appellant Hugo <span class="SpellE">Grengia</span> lays much stress
on the tes­timony of Dr. Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Kho</span> that it is
possible that all the stab wounds were inflicted by the same weapon, in a des­perate
effort to show that only one person committed the crime and that there is no
conspiracy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show however, that said Doctor merely replied to the
questions propounded by the defense lawyer as to the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>different possibilities on how the wounds of the victim may
have been inflicted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But testifying
specifi­cally on the case at bar, he categorically stated that actually the
wounds could be produced by a single bladed weapon with different sizes but not
necessarily only a single bladed weapon.</p>

complained of, is only one of the acts showing conspiracy, without which,
conspiracy cannot be said not to have been esta­blished.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court also found that treachery was present in the
