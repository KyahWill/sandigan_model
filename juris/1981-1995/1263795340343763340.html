				<BR><STRONG>CORTES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Six cases involving various private schools, their teachers and
non-teaching school personnel, and even parents with children studying in said
schools, as well as the then Minister of Labor and Employment, his Deputy, the
National Labor Relations Commission, and the then Minister of Education,
Culture and Sports, have been consolidated in this single Decision in order to
dispose of uniformly the common legal issue raised therein, namely, the
allocation of the incremental proceeds of authorized tuition fee increases of
private schools provided for in section 3(a) of Presidential Decree No. 451,
and thereafter, under the Education Act of 1982 (Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232).</p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, the common problem presented by these cases
requires an interpretation of section 3(a) of Pres. Dec. No. 451 which states:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC 3.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><b>Limitations</b>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>--The increase in tuition or other school
fees or other charges as well as the new fees or charges authorized under the
next preceding section shall be subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) That no increase
in tuition or other school fees or charges shall be approved unless sixty (60%)
<b>per centum</b> of the proceeds is allocated for increase in salaries or
wages of the members of the faculty and all other employees of the school
concerned, and the balance for institutional development, student assistance
and extension services, and return to investments:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That in no case shall the return to
investments exceed twelve (12%) per centum of the incremental proceeds;</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
*</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In addition, there is also a need for a
pronouncement on the effect of the subsequent enactment of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 which provides for the allocation of tuition fee
increases in section 42 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a nutshell, the present controversy was precipitated by the
claims of some school personnel for allowances and other benefits and the
refusal of the private schools concerned to pay said allowances and benefits on
the ground that said items should be deemed included in the salary increases
they had paid out of the 60% portion of the proceeds from tuition fee increases
provided for in section 3(a) of Pres. Dec. No. 451.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The interpretation and construction of laws
being a matter of judicial power and duty [<span class="SpellE">Marbury</span> v.
<st1:city><st1:place>Madison</st1:place></st1:city>, 1 <span class="SpellE">Cranch</span>
137 (1803); <span class="SpellE">Endencia</span> v. David, 93 Phil. 696 (1953)],
this Court has been called upon to resolve the controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the process of reading and at times, having to decipher, the
numerous pleadings filed in the six cases, the Court found that the main issue
has been approached by the parties from almost diametrical points, thereby
bringing into focus three sub-issues:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b><u>first</u></b>,
whether or not allowances and other fringe benefits of faculty members and
other school employees may be charged against the 60% portion of the tuition
fee increases provided for in section 3(a) of Pres. Dec. No. 451; <b><u>second</u></b>,
whether or not the same items may be charged against said portion under the
provisions of B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232; and, <b><u>third</u></b>,
whether or not schools and their employees may enter into a collective
bargaining agreement allocating more than 60% of said incremental proceeds for
salary increases and other benefits of said employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After these sub-issues have been resolved,
the Court will tackle the other incidents attending the individual cases, <b>seriatim</b>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual antecedents that brought these cases before this
Tribunal are as follows:</p>

<u>CASE</u></p>

<p class="BODY">This case originated from a Complaint filed with the Regional
Office No. VII of the Ministry of Labor on February 11, 1981 against petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Institute of Technology (CIT) by private
respondents, <span class="SpellE">Panfilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Canete</span>,
et al., teachers of CIT, for non-payment of:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>a) cost of living allowances (COLA) under Pres. Dec. Nos. 525, 1123,
1614, 1678 and 1713, b) thirteenth (13th) month pay differentials and c)
service incentive leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of an
Order issued by the then Deputy Minister of Labor <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>, a labor-management committee composed of
one representative each from the Ministry of Labor and Employment (MOLE), the
Minister of Education, Culture and Sports (MECS), and two representatives each
from CIT and from the teachers was created.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said committee was to ascertain compliance with the legal requirements
for the payment of COLA, thirteenth (13th) month pay and service incentive
leave [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 84].</p>

<p class="BODY">The position taken by CIT during the conference held by the labor
management committee was that it had paid the allowances mandated by various
decrees but the same had been integrated in the teacher's hourly rate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It alleged that the payment of COLA by way of
salary increases is in line with Pres. Dec. No. 451.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also claimed in its position paper that it
had paid thirteenth month pay to its employees and that it was exempt from the
payment of service incentive leave to its teachers who were employed on
contract basis [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 85-86].</p>

<p class="BODY">After the report and recommendation of the committee, herein public
respondent, then Minister of Labor and Employment issued the assailed Order
dated September 29, 1981 and held that the basic hourly rate designated in the
Teachers' Program is regarded as the basic hourly rate of teachers <u>exclusive</u>
of the COLA, and that COLA should not be taken from the 60% incremental
proceeds of the approved increase in tuition fee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the Order reads:</p>

<blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, CIT is hereby ordered to pay its teaching
staff the following:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assails the aforesaid Order in this Special Civil
Action of <i>Certiorari</i> with Preliminary Injunction and/or Restraining

<p class="BODY">Upon a complaint filed by ten faculty members for alleged
non-compliance by herein petitioner Divine Word College of <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span>
with, among others, Pres. Dec. No. 451, i.e., allowances were charged to the
60% incremental proceeds of tuition fee increase, the Labor Regulation Section
of Regional Office No. V (<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>) of the Ministry of Labor and
Employment conducted an inspection of the employment records of said
school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the report on
the special inspection that the school did not comply with Pres. Dec. No. 451,
herein respondent Regional Director issued an Order dated <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1983</st1:date>, requiring compliance by the <st1:place><st1:placename>Divine</st1:placename>

said Order which the Regional Director treated as a Motion for
Reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon failure of the
school to comply with the aforesaid Order, another Order (August 2, 1983) was
issued by herein respondent Regional Director requiring herein petitioner to pay
the faculty members-complainants (herein private respondents) the amounts
indicated therein or the total sum of Six Hundred Seventeen Thousand Nine
Hundred Sixty Seven Pesos and Seventy Seven Centavos (P617,967.77).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's Motion for Reconsideration of
the Order was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the respondent Deputy Minister of Labor and Employment
affirmed the Order of the Regional Director, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>Coming now to the substantial merit of the case, we share the view
that the emergency allowances due the complainants under the several presidential
decrees (PD's 525, 1123, etc.) cannot be charged by the respondent against the
60% of the incremental proceeds from increase in tuition fees authorized under
PD 451, not only because as per decision of the Supreme Court (UE vs. UE
Faculty Association, et. al., G.R. No. 57387, September 30, 1982) said
allowances whether mandated by law or secured by collective bargaining should
be taken only from the return to investment referred to in the decree if the
school has no other resources to grant the allowances but not from the 60%
incremental proceeds, but also because to hold otherwise would, to our mind,
inevitably result in the loss of one benefit due the complainants - that is the
salary or wage increase granted them by PD 451.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In other words, we believe that by paying the complainants'
allowances out of the 60% incremental proceeds intended for their salary
increase they are practically being deprived of one benefit - their share in
the 60% incremental proceeds in terms of salary or wage increase.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, for the reasons above-stated, the Order appealed from is
hereby AFFIRMED, and the appeal DISMISSED, for lack of merit.</blockquote>

diverse interests, opposed yet intertwined, and all deserving, and demanding,
the protection of the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On one arm

efforts to maintain an adequate educational system in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perched precariously on the other arm of the
same balance is the much-needed financial uplift of schoolteachers, extolled

future.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ranged with them with needs and
claims as insistent are other school personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And then, anxiously waiting at the <span class="GramE">sidelines,</span>
is the interest of the public at large, and of the State, in the continued
availability to all who desire it, high-standard education consistent with
national goals, at a reasonable and affordable price.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amidst these opposing forces the task at hand becomes saddled

upon such varied interests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
Court can not go beyond what the legislature has laid down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its duty is to say <b>what the law is</b> as

not the same as saying <b>what the law should be</b> or what <span class="GramE">is

policies adopted by the legislative branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is it the business of this Tribunal to remedy every unjust situation
that may arise from the application of a particular law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is for the legislature to enact remedial
legislation if that be necessary in the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But as always, with apt judicial caution and
cold neutrality, the Court must carry out the delicate function of interpreting
the law, guided by the Constitution and existing legislation and mindful of
settled jurisprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court's
function is therefore limited, and accordingly, must confine itself to the judicial

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, on the other hand, argues in support of
the Order of the public respondent that Pres. Dec. No. 451 allocates the 60%
proceeds of tuition fee increases exclusively for salary increases of teachers

</span>Anent the <u>U.E</u>. case, the Solicitor General states that the

President that the 60% incremental proceeds shall be solely applied to salaries
of faculty members and employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 7, 1986, considering the supervening events, including

</span>In support of this stance, petitioner points out that said personnel
benefits are not included in the enumeration of the items for which the balance
(less 60%) or 40% portion of the incremental proceeds may be allotted under

proceeds of authorized tuition fee increases may be applied to increases in
emoluments and/or benefits for members of faculty, including staff and
administrative employees of the school as the valid interpretation of the law,
as against that made by the respondent Deputy Minister of Labor in the assailed
Order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the latter interpretation is
upheld, petitioner would go as far as questioning the constitutionality of
Pres. Dec. No. 451 upon the ground that the same discriminates against the
petitioner and other private schools as a class of employers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the petitioner, the discrimination
takes the form of requiring said class of employers to give 60% of their
profits to their employees in addition to the COLA mandated by law, while other
employers have to contend only with salary increases and COLA [Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 46].</p>

proceeds from tuition fee hikes for retirement plan, faculty development and
allowances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue that said rules
and regulations were invalid for having been promulgated in excess of the

<p class="OTHERHEADING">RESOLUTION OF THE FIRST SUB-ISSUE</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has consistently held, beginning with the <u>University</u>

other than those derived from tuition fee increases, allowances and benefits
should be charged against the proceeds of tuition fee increases which the law
allows for return on investments under section 3(a) of Pres. Dec. No. 451,
therefore, not against the 60% portion allocated for increases in salaries and
wages (See 117 SCRA at 571).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This ruling

<p class="BODY">There is no cogent reason to reverse the Court's ruling in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 3(a) of Pres. Dec. No. 451 imposes among the conditions for the
approval of tuition fee increases, <b>the allocation of 60% per cent of the
incremental proceeds thereof for increases in salaries or wages of school
personnel, and not for any other item such as allowances or other fringe
benefits</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly put by the Court
in <u>University</u> <u>of</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Pangasinan</u></span> <u>Faculty</u>

in basic salary</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law cannot be
construed to include allowances which are benefits over and above the basic
salaries of the employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To charge
such benefits to the 60% incremental proceeds would be to reduce the increase
in basic salary provided by law, an increase intended also to help the teachers

economic times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Emphasis supplied] <span class="GramE">(127 SCRA 691, 702).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This interpretation of the law is consistent with the legislative
intent expressed in the Decree itself, i.e., to alleviate the sad plight of
private schools and that of their personnel wrought by slump in enrolment and
increasing operational costs on the part of the schools, and the increasing
costs of living on the part of the personnel (Preamble, Pres. Dec. No.
451).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While coming to the aid of the
private school system by simplifying the procedure for increasing tuition fees,
the Decree imposes as a condition for the approval of any such increase in
fees, the allocation of 60% of the incremental proceeds thereof, to increases
in salaries or wages of school personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This condition makes for a <b>quid</b> <b>pro</b> <b>quo</b> of the
approval of any tuition fee hike by a school, thereby assuring the school
personnel concerned, of a share in its proceeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The condition having been imposed to attain
one of the main objectives of the Decree, which is to help the school personnel
cope with the increasing costs of living, the same cannot be interpreted in a
sense that would diminish the benefit granted said personnel.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of existing laws which exclude allowances from the
basic salary or wage in the computation of the amount of retirement and other
benefits payable to an employee, this Court will not adopt a different meaning
of the terms "salaries or wages" to mean the opposite, i.e. to
include allowances in the concept of salaries or wages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged implementing rules and regulations promulgated
by the then MECS to the effect that allowances and other benefits may be
charged against the 60% portion of the proceeds of tuition fee increases
provided for in Section 3(a) of Pres. Dec. No. 451, suffice it to say that
these were issued <b>ultra</b> <span class="SpellE"><b>vires</b></span>, and
therefore not binding upon this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in">The rule-making authority granted by

</span>Arguments raised in the <span class="SpellE">Fabros</span> case</p>

<p class="BODY">In assailing MECS Order No. 25, s. 1985, petitioners argue that
the matter of allocating the proceeds from tuition fee increases is still
governed by Pres. Dec. No. 451.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
their opinion that section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 did
not repeal Pres. Dec. No. 451 for the following reasons:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b><u>first</u></b>, there is no conflict
between section 42 of B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 and section 3(a)
of Pres. Dec. No. 451 or any semblance of inconsistency to deduce a case of a
repeal by implication; <b><u>second</u></b>, Pres. Dec. No. 451 is a specific
law upon a particular subject - the purposes and distribution of the
incremental proceeds of tuition fee increases, while B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 is a general law on the educational system; as such, a specific law is not
repealed by a subsequent general law in the absence of a clear intention; and <b><u>third</u></b>,
Pres. Dec. No. 451 is still the only law on the subject of tuition fee
increases there being no prescription or provision in section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 or elsewhere in the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They furthermore aver that the disputed MECS
Order which imposed additional burdens against the 60% incremental proceeds of
tuition fee increases are not provided in either Pres. Dec. No. 451 or B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
logical result as intimated by petitioners is that the inclusion of paragraph
7.4 and related paragraphs 7 to 7.3 and 7.5 in the questioned MECS order
contravenes the statutory authority granted to the public respondent, and the
same are therefore, void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent PACU takes the contrary view contending that MECS
Order No. 25, s. 1985, complies with the mandate of section 42 of B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 which law had already repealed Pres. Dec. No.
451.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PACU notes that the <u>University</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>East</u> case invoked by petitioners is not applicable
because the issue in that case does not involve the effect of B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 on Pres. Dec. No. 451.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, representing the public respondent, after
giving a summary of the matters raised by petitioner and respondent PACU,
points out that the decisive issue in this case is whether B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 has repealed Pres. Dec. No. 451 because on the
answer to this question depends the validity of MECS Order No. 25, s.
1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Public respondent holds the view
consistent with that of PACU on the matter of B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 having repealed Pres. Dec. No. 451.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To support this contention, the Solicitor General compared the
respective provisions of the two laws to show the inconsistency and
incompatibility which would result in a repeal by implication.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">RESOLUTION OF THE SECOND SUB-ISSUE</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of tuition fee increases section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">The enactment of B. P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 and the

arguments of the parties in these cases, one side, composed of the teachers and
other employees of the private schools, insist on the applicability of section
3(a) of Pres. Dec. No. 451 as interpreted and applied in the <u>University</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>East, University</u> <u>of</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Pangasinan</u></span>
<u>and</u> <u>St.</u> <u>Louis</u> <u>University</u> cases, while the private
schools uphold the view that the matter of allocating the incremental proceeds
from tuition fee increases is governed by section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 as implemented by the MECS Rules and
Regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As stated, the latter's
argument is premised on the allegation that B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 impliedly repealed Pres. Dec. No. 451.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second sub-issue, therefore, this Court upholds the view
taken by the Solicitor General in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Fabros</u></span>
case, that the decisive issue is whether B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 has repealed Pres. Dec. No. 451.</p>

<p class="BODY">In recognition of the vital role of private schools in the
country's educational system, the government has provided measures to regulate
their activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As early as March 10,
1917, the power to inspect private schools, to regulate their activities, to
give them official permits to operate under certain conditions and to revoke
such permits for cause was granted to the then Secretary of Public Instruction
by Act No. 2706 as amended by Act No. 3075 and Commonwealth Act No. 180.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 6139, enacted on <st1:date year="1970" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1970</st1:date>, provided for the
regulation of tuition and other fees charged by private schools in order to
discourage the collection of exorbitant and unreasonable fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In an effort to simplify the "cumbersome
and time-consuming" procedure prescribed under Rep. Act. No. 6139 and
"to alleviate the sad plight of private schools", Pres. Dec. No. 451
was enacted on <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While this later statute was being
implemented, the legislative body envisioned a comprehensive legislation which
would introduce changes and chart directions in the educational system, hence,
the enactment of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What then was the effect of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 on Pres. Dec. No. 451?</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court after comparing section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 and Pres. Dec. No. 451, particularly section 3(a) thereof, finds evident
irreconcilable differences.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Pres. Dec. No. 451, the authority to regulate the
imposition of tuition and other school fees or charges by private schools is
lodged with the Secretary of Education and Culture (Sec. 1), whereas section 42
of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 liberalized the procedure by
empowering each private school to determine its rate of tuition and other
school fees or charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pres. Dec. No. 451 provides that 60% of the incremental proceeds
of tuition fee increases shall be applied or used to augment the salaries and
wages of members of the faculty and other employees of the school, while B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 provides that the increment shall be applied or
used in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the MECS.</p>

<p class="BODY">A closer look at these differences leads the Court to resolve the
question in favor of repeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed
out by the Solicitor General, three aspects of the disputed provisions of law
support the above conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b><u>First</u></b>,
the legislative authority under Pres. Dec. No. 451 retained the power to
apportion the incremental proceeds of the tuition fee increases; such power is
delegated to the Ministry of Education and Culture under B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b><u>Second</u></b>,
Pres. Dec. No. 451 limits the application or use of the increment to salary or
wage increase, institutional development, student assistance and extension
services and return on investment, whereas B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 gives the MECS discretion to determine the application or use of the
increments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b><u>Third</u></b>, the
extent of the application or use of the increment under Pres. Dec. No. 451 is
fixed at the predetermined percentage allocations:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>60% for wage and salary increases, 12% for
return in investment and the balance of 28% to institutional development,
student assistance and extension services, while under B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232, the extent of the allocation or use of the increment is likewise left to
the discretion of the MECS.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legislative intent to depart from the statutory limitations
under Pres. Dec. No. 451 is apparent in the second sentence of section 42 of B.
P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Pres. Dec. No. 451 and section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 which cover the same subject matter, are so clearly inconsistent and
incompatible with each other that there is no other conclusion but that the
latter repeals the former in accordance with section 72 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 72.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE"><b>Repealing clause</b>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- All laws or parts thereof inconsistent with
any provision of this Act shall be deemed repealed or modified, as the case may
be.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Opinion No. 16 of the Ministry of Justice dated <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="1">January 29, 1985</st1:date>, quoted below,
supports the above conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>Both P.D. No. 451 and B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 deal
with the imposition of tuition and other school fees or charges and their use
and application, although the latter is broader in scope as it covers other
aspects of the educational system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
note substantial differences or inconsistencies between the provisions of the
two laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>P.D. No. 451 prescribes
certain limitations in the increase of tuition and other school fees and their
application, whereas the latter law, B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 is
silent on the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under P.D. 451,
rates of tuition/school fees need prior approval of the Secretary of Education,
Culture (now Minister of Education, Culture and Sports), who also determines
the reasonable rates for new school fees, whereas under B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232, each private school determines its rate of
tuition and other school fees or charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>P.D. No. 451 authorizes the Secretary of Education and Culture to issue
requisite rules and regulations to implement the said Decree and for that
purpose, he is empowered to impose other requirements and limitations as he may
deem proper and reasonable in addition to the limitations prescribed by the
Decree for increases in tuition fees and school charges, particularly, the
limitations imposed in the allocation of increases in fees and charges, whereas
under B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232, the collection and application
or use of rates and charges adopted by the school are subject to rules and
regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports
without any mention of the statutory limitations on the application or use of
the fees or charges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The authority
granted to private schools to determine its rates of tuition and unconditional
authority vested in the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports to determine
by rules and regulations the collection and application or use of tuition or
fees rates and charges under B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 constitute
substantial and irreconcilable incompatibility with the provisions of P.D. No.
451, which should be for that reason deemed to have been abrogated by the
subsequent legislation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 is a
comprehensive legislation dealing with the establishment and maintenance of an
integrated system of education and as such, covers the entire subject matter of
the earlier law, P.D. No. 451.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
omission of the limitations or conditions imposed in P.D. No. 451 for increases
in tuition fees and school charges is an indication of a legislative intent to
do away with the said limitations or conditions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Crawford, <u>supra</u>, p.
674).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has also been said that
-</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">an</span> act which purports to set out in full

<p class="BODY">Having concluded that under B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
232 the collection and application or use of tuition and other school fees are
subject only to the limitations under the rules and regulations issued by the
Ministry, the crucial point now shifts to the said implementing rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">The guidelines and regulations on tuition and other school fees
issued after the enactment of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232
consistently permit the charging of allowances and other benefits against the
60% incremental proceeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such was the
tenor in the MECS Order No. 23, s. 1983; MECS Order No. 15, s. 1984; MECS Order
No. 25, s. 1985; MECS Order No. 22, s. 1986; and DECS Order No. 37, s.
1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the
latest order reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>In any case of increase at least sixty percent (60%) of the
incremental proceeds should be allocated for increases in or provisions for
salaries or wages, allowances and fringe benefits of faculty and other staff,
including accruals to cost of living allowance, 13th month pay, social security,
<span class="SpellE">medicare</span> and retirement contribution and increases as
may be provided in mandated wage orders, collective bargaining agreements or
voluntary employer practices.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The validity of these orders, particularly MECS Order No. 25, s.
1985, is attacked on the ground that the additional burdens charged against <b>".
. . the 60% of the proceeds of the increases in tuition fees constitute both as
[sic] an excess of statutory authority and as [sic] a substantial impairment of
the accrued, existing and protected rights and benefits of the members of
faculty and non-academic personnel of private schools."</b> [Memorandum
for Petitioners; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 191].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners allege that these additional
burdens under the MECS Order are not provided in the law itself, either in
section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232 or section 3(a) of Pres.
Dec. No. 451, except increases in salaries in the latter provision.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Section 42 of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the petitioners' insistence that the questioned rules
and regulations contravene the statutory authority granted to the Minister of
Education, this Court finds that there was a valid exercise of rule-making
authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The statutory grant of rule-making power to administrative
agencies like the Secretary of Education is a valid exception to the rule on
non-delegation of legislative power provided two conditions concur,

<p class="BODY">Assailed by the petitioners in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Biscocho</u></span>
and the <span class="SpellE"><u>Valmonte</u></span> cases is the Order of the
respondent Minister of Labor directing the execution of a CBA between the
school and the respondent <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> Santo Parochial
School Faculty Association which provides for an economic package equivalent to
90% of the proceeds of tuition fee increases for school year 1985-1986, another
90% for school year 1986-1987 and 85% for school year 1987-1988.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to said Order, petitioners in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Biscocho</u></span> case allege that the parties had agreed to
incorporate in their CBA a provision which allocates one-half (1/2) of the 90%
portion of the proceeds or 45% to increases in the monthly <u>basic</u> <u>salaries</u>
and the other one-half (1/2) or 45% to increases in monthly living allowance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners in the two cases seek the nullification of the
MOLE Order for exactly opposite reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Biscocho</u></span> case, the controversy
springs from what petitioners perceive to be a diminution of the benefits to be
received by the school employees insofar as the CBA allocates only 45% for
salary increases instead of 60%, which petitioners claim to be the portion set
aside by Pres. Dec. No. 451 for that purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, the case questions the allocation of the remaining 45%
of the 90% economic package under the CBA, to allowances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stripped down to its essentials, the question
is whether or not the 90% portion of the proceeds of tuition fee increases <span class="SpellE">alloted</span> for the economic package may be allocated <u>for</u>
<u>both</u> <u>salary</u> <u>increases</u> <u>and</u> <u>allowances</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioners in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Valmonte</u></span>
case believe that the MOLE cannot order the execution of a CBA which would
allocate more than 60% of the proceeds of tuition fee increases for salary
increases of school employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, petitioners question the authority of the then Minister of
Labor and Employment to issue the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> Order
insofar as this allocates the tuition fee increases of the respondent private
school.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to them, only the
Minister of Education, Culture and Sports has the authority to promulgate rules
and regulations on the use of tuition fees and increases thereto, pursuant to
the provisions of B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 232.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further argue that the assailed Order
collides with the provisions of Pres. Dec. No. 451 insofar as it allocates 90%
of the tuition fee increases for salary adjustments of the members of the
bargaining unit which exceeds the 60% of the said increases allocated by the
Decree for the same purpose.</p>

raised, this Court notes that in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Valmonte</u></span>

was denied its right to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor-Management Committee was empowered

submitted to the committee reflects that in all the deliberations, it was never
denied the right to present evidence and be heard on all the issues raised,
particularly to demonstrate that it had complied with the various COLA, 13th
month pay and service incentive leave decrees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The evidence presented during the conferences and the position paper of
the parties were made the basis of the committee's report and recommendation
which in turn became the basis of the order of the Minister of Labor directing
the petitioner to pay the complainants their COLA and service incentive leave
benefits.</p>

deprived of his right to be heard when it appears on the record that it was

process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the face of the well-settled

<p class="BODY">The University's answer to the Union's claim of underpayment of
the 13th month pay is that the "transportation allowance" paid to its
employees partakes the nature of a mid-year bonus which under section 2 of
Pres. Dec. No. 851 and section 3(c) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations
is equivalent to the 13th month pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter ordered FEU to pay the 13th month pay
differentials of the complainants reasoning that:</p>

<blockquote>CLEARLY, transportation allowance cannot be considered as
"equivalent" of 13th month pay as it is neither a Christmas bonus,
midyear bonus, profit sharing payment, or other cash bonuses, pursuant to
paragraphs (c) and (e), Section 3 of PD 851.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The regularity of its payment further cements this proposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>PERFORCE, complainants are underpaid of their 13th month pay in an
amount equivalent to 50% of their basic salary for the 1st year of service,
plus additional 5% every year thereafter but not to exceed 100% of their basic
salary which, per respondent's formula, corresponds to their transportation
allowance.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 61).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Third Division of the National Labor Relations
Commission reversed the Labor Arbiter's ruling by dismissing the complainant's
claim for underpayment of the 13th month pay for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>From the above findings and conclusion, it is clear that insofar as
employees with ten (10) years of service or more are concerned, they receive
the equivalent of one (1) month pay for Christmas bonus and another one (1)
month pay as transportation allowance or a total of fourteen (14) months salary
in a year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, <span class="GramE">this
group of employees are</span> fully paid of their 13th month pay and are not
therefore subject to the instant claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As it is, only those with less than ten (10) years of service are
included or encompassed by the Labor Arbiter's resolution on this particular
issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With this clarification, we shall
now proceed to discuss the crux of the controversy, that is, the determination
of whether or not the so designated "transportation allowance" being
paid to the employees should be considered among those deemed equivalent to
13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As adverted earlier, the
Labor Arbiter opined that it cannot be so considered as the equivalent of 13th
month pay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>In passing upon the issue, we deemed it best to delve deeper into
the nature and intendment of the transportation allowances as designated by
both the complainants and the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainants claim that the transportation allowance they enjoy has
always been called and termed allowance and never as bonus since the time <span class="GramE">the same was</span> given to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They assert that it simply was intended as an allowance and not a
bonus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would appear however that
complainants do not dispute respondent's stand that transportation allowance is
being paid only every March of each year as distinguished from other allowances
that are being paid on a monthly basis or on a bi-monthly basis; that the
amount of transportation allowance to be paid is dependent on the length of
service of the employee concerned (i.e. 50% basic in the first year and
additional 5% for each succeeding years, etc.); that the said method of
computing the amount of the transportation allowance to be paid the complainants
is identical to that used in determining Christmas bonus (respondent's exhibit
8) that the reason behind said transportation allowance is to financially
assist employees in meeting their tax obligations as the same become due on or
about the month of March of each year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>We are inclined to believe and so hold that by the manner by which
said transportation allowance is being paid (only once a year) as well as the
method in determining the amount to be paid (similar to Christmas bonus) and considering
further the reason behind said payment (easing the burden of
taxpayer-employee), the said transportation allowance given out by respondent
while designating as such, partakes the nature of a mid-year bonus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears to note in passing that in providing
for transportation allowance, respondent was not compelled by law nor by the
CBA (Annex "A" of respondent's Appeal) as nowhere in the CBA <span class="GramE">nor</span> in the Labor Code can be found any provision on
transportation allowance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
therefore a benefit that stemmed out purely from the voluntary act and
generosity of the respondent FEU.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, said transportation allowance is only being paid once a
year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, regular
allowances not considered as 13th month pay equivalent under P.D. 851, to our
mind, refer to those paid on regular intervals and catering for specific
employees' needs and requirements that recur on a regular basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Verily, if the intendment behind the disputed
transportation allowance is to answer for the daily recurring transportation
expenses of the employees, the same should have been paid to employees on
regular periodic intervals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All
indications, as we see it, point out to conclusion that the disputed
transportation allowance, while dominated as such apparently for lack of better
term, is in fact a form of bonus doled out by the respondent during the month
of March every year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hence, we hold that it is one of those that can very well be
considered as equivalent to the 13th month pay (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 73, 74, 75, 76).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court sustains the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
view of public respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The benefit
herein designated as "transportation allowance" is a form of bonus
equivalent to the 13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, where this does not amount to 1/12 of the <span class="GramE">employees</span> basic salary, the employer shall pay the
difference.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evident intention of the law was to grant an additional
income in the form of a 13th month pay to employees not already receiving the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court ruled in <u>National</u>

<blockquote>Otherwise put, the intention was to grant some relief - not to all
workers - but only to the unfortunate ones not actually paid a 13th month
salary or what amounts to it, by whatever name called; but it was not
envisioned that a double burden would be imposed on the employer already paying
his employees a 13th month pay or its equivalent - whether out of pure
generosity or on the basis of a binding agreement and, in the latter case,
regardless of the conditional character of the grant (such as making the
payment dependent on profit), so long as there is actual payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, what was conceived to be a 13th
month salary would in effect become a 14th or possibly 15th month <span class="GramE">pay.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Pragmatic considerations also weigh heavily in favor of crediting
both voluntary and contractual bonuses for the purpose of determining liability
for the 13th month pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To require
employers (already giving their employees a 13th month salary or its
equivalent) to give a second 13th month pay would be unfair and productive of
undesirable results.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the employer who
had acceded and is already bound to give bonuses to his employees, the
additional burden of a 13th month pay would amount to a penalty for his
munificence or liberality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The probable
reaction of one so circumstanced would be to withdraw the bonuses or resist
further voluntary grants for fear that if and when a law is passed giving the
same benefits, his prior concessions might not be given due credit; and this negative
attitude would have an adverse impact on the employees (pp. 369, 370).</blockquote>

<blockquote>To hold otherwise would be to impose an unreasonable and undue

contrary stance would indeed create an absurd situation whereby an employer who
started giving his employees the 13th month pay only because of the
unmistakable force of the law would be in a far better position than another
who, by his own magnanimity or by mutual agreement, had long been extending his

credence to respondent's claim that the payment of legal holiday pay was in
fact made pursuant to law, P.D. 570-A in particular, it is not one that arose
out of company practice or policy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Finding that said payment was made based on an honest although
erroneous interpretation of law, which interpretation was later on corrected by
the issuance (sic) of Policy Instruction No. 9 and which issuance prompted
respondent to withdraw the holiday pay benefits extended to the employees who
were paid on a regular monthly basis, and finding further that under Policy
Instructions No. 9, said subject employees are deemed paid their holiday pay as
they were paid on a monthly basis at a wage rate presumably above the statutory
minimum, we believe and so hold that the withdrawal of said holiday pay benefit
was valid and justifiable under the circumstances (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 33-4).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court cannot sustain the foregoing decision of public
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said decision relied on
Section 2, Rule IV, Book III of the implementing rules and on Policy
Instruction No. 9 which were declared by this Court to be null and void in <u>Insular</u>
<u>Bank</u> <u>of</u> <u>Asia</u> <u>and</u> <u>America</u> <u>Employee's</u> <u>Union</u>
(<u>IBAAEU</u>) <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Inciong</u></span> G.R. No.
52415, October 23, 1984, 132 SCRA 663].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In disposing of the issue at hand, this Court reiterates the ruling in
that case, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>WE agree with the petitioner's contention that Section 2, Rule IV,
Book III of the implementing rules and Policy Instruction No. 9 issued by the
then Secretary of Labor are null and void since in the guise of clarifying the
Labor Code's provision on holiday pay, they in fact amended them by enlarging
the scope of their exclusion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is elementary in the rules of statutory construction that when
the language of the law is clear and unequivocal the law must be taken to mean
exactly what it says.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, the provisions of the Labor Code on the entitlement to the benefits of
holiday pay are clear and explicit - it provides for both the coverage of and
exclusion from the benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In Policy
Instruction No. 9, the then Secretary of Labor went as far as to categorically
state that the benefit is principally intended for daily paid employees, when
the law clearly states that every worker shall be paid their regular holiday
pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a flagrant violation of the
mandatory directive of Article 4 of the Labor Code, which states that "All
doubts in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of this Code,
<b>including its implementing rules and regulations</b>, shall be resolved in
favor of labor." Moreover, it shall always be presumed that the
legislature intended to enact a valid and permanent statute which would have
the most beneficial effect that its language permits (<span class="SpellE">Orlosky</span>
vs. Haskell, 155 A. 112).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 673-4).</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>BISCOCHO</u> <u>CASE</u></p>

<p class="BODY">At issue also in this petition is whether the 60% incremental
proceeds may be subjected to attorney's fees, negotiation fees, agency fees and
the like.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes the fact that there are two classes of employees
among the petitioners:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) those who are
members of the bargaining unit and (2) those who are not members of the
bargaining unit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first class may be
further subdivided into two:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>those who
are members of the collective bargaining agent and those who are not.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the questioned Order of the respondent Minister <b>applies
only to members of the bargaining unit</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The CBA prepared pursuant to said Order, however, covered employees who
are not members of the bargaining unit, although said CBA had not yet been
signed at the time this petition was filed on <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Assuming it was signed thereafter, the inclusion of employees outside
the bargaining unit should be nullified as this does not conform to said order
which directed private respondents to execute a CBA covering only members of
the bargaining unit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being outside the coverage of respondent Minister's order, and
thus, not entitled to the economic package involved therein, employees who are
non-members of the bargaining unit should not be assessed negotiation fees,
attorney's fees, agency fees and the like, for the simple reason that the
resulting collective bargaining agreement does not apply to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be clear, however, that while
non-members of the bargaining unit are not entitled to the economic package
provided by said order, they are, in lieu thereof, still entitled to their
share in the 60% incremental proceeds of increases in tuition or other school
fees or charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">As far as assessment of fees against employees of the collective
bargaining unit who are not members of the collective bargaining agent is
concerned, Article 249 of the Labor Code, as amended by B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 70, provides the rule:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 249.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b>Unfair labor
practices of employers</b>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>-</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>(e)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Employees of an appropriate collective bargaining unit
who are not members of the recognized collective bargaining agent may be
assessed a reasonable fee equivalent to the dues and other fees paid by members
of the recognized collective bargaining agent, if such non-union members accept
the benefits under the collective agreement. . .</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Employees of the collective bargaining unit who are not members
of the collective bargaining agent have to pay the foregoing fees if they
accept the benefits under the collective bargaining agreement and if such fees
are not unreasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners who
are members of the bargaining unit failed to show that the equivalent of ten
(10%) percent of their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> sought to be
deducted is unreasonable.</p>
