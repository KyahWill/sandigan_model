denying petitioner's claims for refund of overpaid income taxes of P102,246.00

<p class="BODY">In CTA Case No. 1251, petitioner ESSO deducted from its gross
income for 1959, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>part of its
ordinary and necessary business expenses, the amount it had spent for drilling
and exploration of its petroleum concessions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This claim was disallowed by the respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Commissioner of </span>Internal Revenue on the ground that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">expenses should be </span>capitalized and
might be written off as a loss only when a "dry hole" should
result.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ESSO then filed an amended
return where it asked for the refund of P323,279.00 by reason of its
abandonment as dry holes of several of its oil wells.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also claimed as ordinary and necessary
expenses in the same return was the amount of P340,822.04, representing margin
fees it had paid to the Central Bank on its profit remittances to its <st1:state><st1:place>New

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In CTA Case No. 1558, the
CIR assessed ESSO a deficiency income tax for the year 1960, in the amount of
P367,994.00, plus 18% interest thereon of P66,238.92 for the period from </span><st1:date year="1961" day="18" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">April

total of P434,232.92.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deficiency
arose from the disallowance of the margin fees of P1,226,647.72 paid by ESSO to
the Central Bank on its profit remittances to its <st1:state><st1:place>New
  York</st1:place></st1:state> head office.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ESSO settled this
deficiency assessment on </span><st1:date year="1964" day="10" month="8">August
 10, 1964</st1:date>, by applying the tax credit of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

paying under protest the additional amount of P213,201.92.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1964" day="13" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">August 13, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, it claimed the refund of P39,787.94 as overpayment
on the interest on its deficiency income tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It argued that the 18% interest </span>should have been imposed not on
the total deficiency of P367,944.00 but only in the amount of P146,961.00, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">difference between the total deficiency and </span>its
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tax credit of P221,033.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This claim was denied by
the CIR, who insisted on charging the 18% interest on the entire amount of the </span>deficiency
tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1965" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1965</st1:date>, the CIR also denied the claims of ESSO for
refund of the overpayment of its 1959 and 1960 income taxes, holding that the
margin fees paid to the Central Bank could not be considered taxes or allowed
as deductible business expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">ESSO appealed to the CTA and sought the refund of P102,246.00 for
1959, contending that the margin fees were deductible from gross income either
as a tax or as an ordinary and necessary business expense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also claimed an overpayment of its tax by
P434,232.92 in 1960, for the same reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Additionally, ESSO argued that even if the amount paid as margin fees
were not legally deductible, there was still an overpayment by P39,787.94 for
1960, representing excess interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the CTA denied petitioner’s claim for refund of
P102,246.00 for 1959 and P434,234.92 for 1960 but sustained its claim for
P39,787.94 as excess interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
portion of the decision was appealed by the CIR but was affirmed by this Court
in Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. ESSO, G.R. No. L-28502-03, promulgated
on <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ESSO for its part appealed the CTA decision
denying its claims for the refund of the margin fees P102,246.00 for 1959 and
P434,234.92 for 1960.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is the issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">now before </span>us.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The first question we must
settle is whether R.A. 2009, entitled An Act to Authorize the Central Bank of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to Establish a Margin Over Banks' Selling Rates of Foreign Exchange, is a
police measure or a revenue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">measure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is a revenue measure, the margin fees
paid by the petitioner to the Central Bank </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

gross income under Sec. 30(c) of the </span>National Internal Revenue
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This provides that all taxes paid
or accrued during or within the taxable year and which are related to the
taxpayer's trade, business or profession are deductible from gross income.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner maintains that margin fees are taxes and cites the
background and legislative history of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
</span>Margin Fee Law showing that R.A. 2609 was nothing less than <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>revival of the 17% excise tax on
foreign exchange imposed by R.A. 601.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was a revenue measure formally proposed by President Carlos P.
Garcia to Congress <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>part of,
and in order to balance, the budget for 1959-1960.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was enacted by Congress as such and,
significantly, properly originated in the House of Representatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During its two and a half years of existence,
the measure was one of the major sources of revenue used to finance the
ordinary operating expenditures of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was, moreover, payable out of the General
Fund.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the claimed
legislative intent, the Court of Tax Appeals, quoting established principles,
pointed out that -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">We are </span>not unmindful
of the rule that opinions expressed in debates, actual proceedings of the
legislature, steps taken in the enactment of a law, or the history of the
passage of the law through the legislature, may be resorted to as an aid in the
interpretation of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>statute which
is ambiguous or of doubtful <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">meaning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The courts may take into consideration the
facts leading up to, coincident with, and in any way connected with, the passage
of the act, in order that they may properly interpret the legislative
intent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But it is also well-settled
jurisprudence that only in extremely doubtful matters of interpretation does
the legislative history of an act of Congress become important.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">a matter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of fact, there
may be no resort to the legislative history of the enactment of a statute, the
language of which is plain and unambiguous, since such legislative history may
only be resorted to for the purpose of solving doubt, not for the purpose of
creating it. [50 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 328.]<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the above consideration, there are at least two cases
where we have held that a margin fee is not a tax but an exaction designed to
curb the excessive demands upon our international reserve.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>
(Phil.) Inc. v. Acting Commissioner of Customs,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote>A margin levy on foreign exchange is a form of exchange control or
restriction designed to discourage imports and encourage exports, and
ultimately ‘curtail any excessive demand upon the international reserve’ in
order to stabilize the currency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Originally adopted to cope with balance of payment pressures, exchange
restrictions have come to serve <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">various
purposes, such </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">limiting
non-essential imports, protecting domestic industry - and when combined with
the use of multiple currency rates - providing a source of revenue to the
government, and area in many developing countries regarded as a more or less
inevitable concomitant of their economic development programs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The different measures of exchange control </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">restriction cover different phases of foreign exchange transactions
i.e., in quantitative restriction, the control is on the amount of foreign
exchange allowable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of the
margin levy, the immediate impact is on the rate of foreign exchange; in fact,
its main function is to control the exchange rate without changing the par
value of the peso as fixed in the <span class="SpellE">Bretton</span> Woods
Agreement Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For </span>a member
nation is not supposed to alter its exchange rate (at par value) to correct a
merely temporary disequilibrium in its balance of payments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By its nature, the margin levy is part of the
rate of exchange as fixed by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">government.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>As to the contention that the margin levy is a tax on the purchase
of foreign exchange and hence should not form part of the exchange <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rate, suffice it to state that We have </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">already </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">held the contrary for the reason that a tax is levied to provide
revenue for government operations, while the proceeds of the margin fee are
applied to strengthen our country's international reserves.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, in Chamber of Agriculture and Natural Resources of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. Central Bank,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">idea was expressed, though in
connection with a different levy, through Justice J.B.L. Reyes:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Neither </span>do we find
merit in the argument that the 20% retention of exporter's foreign exchange
constitutes an export tax.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A tax is a
levy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>the purpose of
providing revenue for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">government </span>operations,
while the proceeds of 20% retention, as we have seen, are applied to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> strengthen </span>the Central Bank's
international reserve.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We conclude then that the margin fee was imposed by the State in
the exercise of its police power and not the power of taxation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Alternatively, ESSO prays
that if margin fees are not taxes, they should nevertheless be considered
necessary and ordinary business expenses and therefore still deductible from
its gross income.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fees were paid </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The applicable provision
is Section 30 (a) of the National Internal Revenue Code reading as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>SEC. 30.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Deductions from

and rentals or other payments required to be made as a condition to the
continued use or possession, for the purpose of the trade or business, of

<p class="BODY">In the case of Atlas Consolidated Mining and D<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">evelopment Corporation v. Commissioner of
Internal Revenue,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> the Court laid down the rules on the
deductibility of business expenses, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The principle is recognized that when a taxpayer claims a
deduction, he must point to some specific provision of the statute in which
that deduction is authorized and must be able to prove that he is entitled to
the deduction which the law allows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
previously adverted to, the law allowing expenses as deduction from gross
income for purposes of the income tax is Section 30 (a) (1) of the National
Internal Revenue which allows a deduction of ‘all the ordinary and necessary
expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or
business.’ An item of expenditure, in order to be deductible under this section
of the statute, must fall squarely within its language.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We come, then, to the statutory test of deductibility where it is
axiomatic that to be deductible as a business expense, three conditions are
imposed, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the expense must be
ordinary and necessary, (2) it must be paid or incurred within the taxable
year, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(3) it must be paid or
incurred in carrying on a trade or business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In addition, not only must the taxpayer meet the business test, he must
substantially prove by evidence or records the deductions claimed under the
law, otherwise, the same will be disallowed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The mere allegation of the taxpayer that an item of expense is ordinary
and necessary does not justify its deduction.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that there is a number of decisions in the United
States delving on the interpretation of the terms ‘ordinary and necessary’ as
used in the federal tax laws, no adequate or satisfactory definition of those
terms is possible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, this Court
has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">never attempted to define with
precision the terms 'ordinary and necessary.' There are however, certain
guiding principles worthy of </span>serious consideration in the proper
adjudication of conflicting claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ordinarily, an expense will be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">'necessary' where the expenditure is appropriate and helpful in the
development of the taxpayer's business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is 'ordinary' when it connotes a payment which is normal in relation
to the business of the taxpayer and the surrounding circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The term 'ordinary' does not require that the
payments be habitual or normal in the sense that the same taxpayer will have to
make them often; the payment may be unique or non-recurring to the particular
taxpayer affected.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>There is thus no hard and fast rule on the matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right to a deduction depends <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">in </span>each case on the particular facts
and the relation of the payment to the type of business in which the taxpayer
is engaged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The intention of the
taxpayer often may be the controlling fact in making the determination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that the expenditure is ordinary and
necessary in the operation of the taxpayer's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">business, the answer to the question as to whether the expenditure is
an allowable deduction as a business expense must be determined from the nature
of the expenditure itself, which in turn depends on the extent and permanency
of the work accomplished by the expenditure.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the above explanation, we hold that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the Court of Tax Appeals did not err when it
held on this issue </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
