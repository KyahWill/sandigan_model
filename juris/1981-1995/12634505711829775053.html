<p class="BODY">The facts are simple.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
quoted from <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief:</p>

<blockquote>"Early in the evening of <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="11"><span style="">November 21, 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span>in <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, complaining witness Victoria <span class="SpellE">Micaller</span>,
a retardate, was going up her house when appellant suddenly pulled her forcibly
down to a dark room below (<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>, pp. 3-5, May 11,
1978).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He embraced her, and as she was
still standing, he took off her panty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He pushed her down to the floor and kissed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, <span class="SpellE">per­vertedly</span>,
he had her take his penis in her mouth twice, which made her feel like <span class="SpellE">vomitting</span> (<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>, p. 3, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the muddy floor, appellant rolled <st1:state><st1:place>Victoria</st1:place></st1:state>,
removed her clothes and bra, and kissed her profusely (<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>,
p. 4, Id.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this time, appellant was
already on top of her and began carnal intercourse with her many times (<span class="SpellE">kinandot</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>'), all the while
warning her that he would kill her if she reported to the authorities (<span class="SpellE">TSN</span>, pp.4-5, <st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After satisfying his lust, appellant reluctantly

<p class="BODY">The vortex of controversy in this appeal is whether the
complainant is so mentally retarded that she could not have given valid and
legal consent to the sexual act which appellant claims to have been voluntary, although,
accord­ing to complainant, force and threat were employed to make her submit to
his bestial desires.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That complainant,
Victoria <span class="SpellE">Micaller</span> is a </span><u><span style="">retardate</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">or one mentally ill,
such that she was incapable of offer­ing any effective or real resistance to
appellant's sexual assault, was sufficiently established by the
prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Romeo Y. <span class="SpellE">Tating</span>, Chief of the <span class="SpellE">Neuro</span>-Psychiatric
Di­vision of the <span class="SpellE">NBI</span> and Dr. Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Pilyen</span>, Sr. Psycho­logist, also of the same agency,
affirmed that Victoria has the mental level of a seven-year old child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tating's</span>
report contains the following background history of the victim:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

girls and 2 boys.</blockquote>

suffered from fever and convulsion, <span class="GramE">fits,</span> hence she
was confined and treated in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for eight (8) months.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her condition then
was serious and she was baptized while in confinement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her discharged, frequent check <span style="">up </span>was done because of a yellowish
foul smelling substance coming out from the ears, which lasted for one-and-a
half (1-1/2) hours.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She was observed to be able to stand at 5 years, and was able
to talk in some syllables at the age of 8.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She started schooling at the age of 9 at the Geronimo
Elementary School for mentally retarded children in <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>,
Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was able to finish Grade III

<p class="BODY">Complainant's mental status as of the date of exami­nation was
given as follows in the same report:</p>

<blockquote>"The subject came when called for interview, but hesitated to
sit down as her companion left her before the undersigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was observed to <span style="">stare blankly but obeys simple instructions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mood is dull and inadequate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Asked of her nickname, she said, 'Sister',
but explained she answered 'Vicky'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Asked why she was in this office and what has happened to her, she said

22,' the 2nd among six (6) siblings of 4 girls and 2 boys.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>She said that she is 31 years, finished Grade
III only as she stopped schooling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She

<p class="BODY">In subjecting herself to the bestial attack of appellant,
complainant did so not with voluntary consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's defense of allegedly not knowing that Victoria was an
imbecile or mentally retarded is simply unbelieva­ble.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His claim of Victoria and he being
sweethearts with previous sexual intercourses having taken place even before
the incident of November 21, 1976 is likewise, incredible, <span class="GramE">specially</span>
with his admission that he made no formal court­ship nor sent her love
letters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His supposed intimacy, with
Victoria would certainly have made him realize her unsound and retarded mental
condition, that his sexual attack on her would make him criminally liable as if
he <span style="">had copulated with a girl too young
to be capable of reason, as one below 12 years, which is one way by which rape
may be committed even without violence or intimation.</span><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">7</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's insistence that there was consent because he and
complainant were <span class="GramE">sweethearts is</span> therefore of no
avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her defective state of mind,
complainant could not have induced appellant to nurse a desire to have her for
a sweet­heart, nor could she have possessed the capacity to under­stand the
meaning of having such a relationship with appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mental condition was such that she would
not resist sexual advances because she was so deprived of reason to make any
effective resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, by her
being so dep­rived, the act is made possible in the same way when there is
active resistance but same is overcome by force and threat, which is the
essence of the crime of rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, from complainant's testimony, appellant had resorted
also to force and intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
she stated that appellant "removed my panty forcibly".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="GramE">embraced</span> and
pulled me," and "he scolded me; he "said if I will report he
would kill me." It must just be the woman intuition in her, and an
instinctive sense of personal danger that made her not quite as easy in
yielding to his beastly advances that prompted appellant to employing force and
threat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant's claim that the
sexual act was voluntary, therefore, was pro­perly rejected by the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This could make his claim that a
"careful coherent scrutiny of the statement of Victoria shows it (sic) to
be clear and intelligently given" of no avail to him, for <span style="">if </span>it were, his defense of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> would just as effectively fall for then,
complainant's tes­timony would show that he had used force and intimidation in
giving vent to his lewd designs upon complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reinforcing this above fact is appellant's
own claim that "such charge of rape is a concoction of the mind of the
parents and relatives", for, inferentially, this means that Victoria
reported the outrage on her person to her parents, which is not expected of her
if she had voluntarily sub­mitted to the sexual act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant, finally, tried to prove his claim of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> in the sexual act by mentioning that he had
had similar acts with Victoria in the room of a friend, one Mauricio Sanchez,
whom he saw when he and Victoria went to Sanchez's apartment on the evening of
November 21, 1976, where they performed the act on the ground floor, the second
floor being the sleeping quarter of his friend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That appellant, however, failed to present his friend as a witness
clearly betrays the <span class="SpellE">feableness</span> of his defense that
Victoria is his sweetheart, and their sexual indulgence on the night of record
was voluntary and fully con­sented to by complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style=""> </span>the guilt of appellant, having been <span style="">proved beyond reasonable doubt, the judgment
appealed from is hereby affirmed, but with the modification that appel­lant
