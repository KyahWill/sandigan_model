				<BR><STRONG>CORTES, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Assailed in this petition is the decision of the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC) in NLRC Case No. 11-4406-83, entitled "Jose M. Chua v. <span class="SpellE">Chong</span> Guan Trading," whereby the NLRC held that
private respondent Jose M. Chua was illegally dismissed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Chong</span> Guan Trading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court after a careful examination of the pleadings filed in this
case, i.e., the Petition and its Annexes, the Comment of public respondent, the
Reply and Supplemental Reply of petitioner, the Manifestation/Opposition of
private respondent, and the Rejoinder of public respondent, considered the
Comment as answer, the issues joined, and the case submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jose M. Chua was employed as sales manager of <span class="SpellE">Chong</span>
Guan Trading, a dealer of paper and paper products owned by Mariano<span class="GramE">,<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pepito</span></span>
and <span class="SpellE">Efren</span> Lim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent started working with the petitioner way back in 1960
but it was only in 1972 that his name was registered by petitioner with the
Social Security System [Decision of SSC in SSS Case No. 8728, p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 49.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In November 1983, private respondent filed a complaint with the
Office of the Labor Arbiter of the National Capital Region charging petitioner
with illegal dismissal and non-payment of overtime pay and other benefits
provided for by law. In his complaint, private respondent alleged that he was
fired by Mariano Lim because of the incident that occurred on <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the record that on the morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1983</st1:date>, a customer, who
borrowed the store's telephone directory, accidentally dropped it on the top
glass of the store's showcase causing it to break.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> Lim saw
the already taped broken top-glass he asked for an explanation from private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In order to cover up for the
customer, private respondent admitted that he himself accidentally broke it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> then got
angry and hurled "unprintable words and invectives" at private
respondent [Decision of NLRC, p. 2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 14.]
What transpired thereafter was disputed by both parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent claimed that he was
dismissed by Mariano Lim when the fatter ordered him to leave petitioner's
premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, on the other hand,
denied having dismissed private respondent and claimed that it was private
respondent who went home after the incident and failed to report for work for
many days thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleged
that, far from being dismissed, it was private respondent himself who abandoned
his job.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties filed their respective position papers and agreed to
submit the case for resolution on the basis of the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1984</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision finding that there was no illegal
dismissal since private respondent was <span class="GramE">never</span> dismissed
by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter held
that the altercation that occurred between private respondent and the Lim
brothers because of the broken top-glass cannot be construed as the dismissal
of the private respondent because it was only a minor incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement on the issue of the alleged
abandonment by private respondent was made but the Labor Arbiter ordered the
reinstatement of private respondent but without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, respondents are hereby ordered to reinstate complainant
to his former position without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, to pay him
his proportionate 13th-month pay for the year 1983 and the money equivalent of
fifteen (15) days service incentive leave pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All his other claims including the claim for damages are hereby,
DISMISSED.<span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>[Decision of Labor Arbiter, p. 7; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 31]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent elevated the decision of the Labor Arbiter to
the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a resolution promulgated on
<st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1987</st1:date>, the NLRC
dismissed the appeal for being filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon motion of private respondent, the NLRC reconsidered its
Resolution and gave due course to the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1987</st1:date>
respondent Commission decided in favor of private respondent and held that:</p>

<blockquote>* <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>. . . <span class="GramE">we</span> are by and large convinced that
the appellant was indeed dismissed without the attendant formalities required
by law.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On account of which, he
should therefore, be reinstated to his former position with three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> without qualification or deduction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Should reinstatement, however, be not feasible due to circumstances
or developments not attributable to the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>,
the appellant should, in addition to the three years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
be paid a separation pay equivalent to one half month pay for every year of
service, a fraction of at least six (6) months being considered as one whole
year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The rest of the award for other benefits stays.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, modified as above-indicated, the decision appealed from
is hereby, AFFIRMED.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span> [NLRC Decision, p. 18; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 18.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the NLRC decision, petitioner interposed the present
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court will first address the procedural issue raised by the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that respondent NLRC has no jurisdiction to
entertain the appeal filed by private respondent, much less modify the decision
appealed from, the same having become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
after the lapse of ten (10) days from respondent's receipt thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 223 of the Labor Code [Pres. Decree 442, as amended]
provides for a <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period of ten (10) days
within which to appeal a decision of the labor arbiter to the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ten-day period has been interpreted by
this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Vir-jen</u></span> <u>and</u> <u>Marine</u>
<u>Services</u> <u>Inc.,</u> <u>v</u>. <u>National</u> <u>Labor</u> <u>Relations</u>
<u>Commission</u> G.R. Nos. 58011-12, July 20, 1987, 115 SCRA 347] as ten (10)
"calendar" days and not ten (10) "working" days.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, while the appeal was filed within ten (10)
working days from receipt of the decision, it was filed beyond the ten (10)
calendar days prescribed by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent received a copy of the decision of Labor Arbiter Martinez on <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1984</st1:date> while the appeal was filed
only on <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1984</st1:date> or
twelve (12) days from notice of the decision [Resolution of NLRC, p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 32.]</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the perfection of an appeal in the manner and
within the period prescribed by law is not only mandatory but jurisdictional,
and failure to perfect an appeal has the effect of rendering the judgment final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> [<span class="SpellE">Narag</span> v.
National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 69628, October 28, 1987, 155 SCRA
199.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, as correctly pointed out
by the Solicitor General, the NLRC may disregard the procedural lapse where
there is an acceptable reason to excuse tardiness in the taking of an
appeal<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Comment of the Office of
Solicitor General, p. 6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 46; See also

G.R. No. 70479, February 27, 1987, 148 SCRA 187; MAI Philippines, Inc. v.
National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No.73662, June 18, 1987, 151 SCRA
196.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the appeal was filed out of time because the counsel
of private respondent relied on the footnote of the notice of the decision of
the Labor Arbiter which stated that "the aggrieved party may appeal . . .
within ten (10) <u>working</u> days, as per NLRC Resolution No. 1, series of
1977." [Decision of NLRC, p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 13;
Underscoring supplied.] In the case of <u>Firestone</u> <u>Tire</u> <u>and</u> <u>Rubber</u>
<u>Co</u>. <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Phil</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Lariosa</u></span>,
[supra], which has substantially the same set of facts as this case, the Court
accepted the party's reliance on the erroneous notice in the labor arbiter's
decision as a reasonable ground for excusing non-compliance with the ten (10) <span class="GramE">calendar</span> day period for appeal. Explaining the reason for
this ruling, the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mindful of the fact that <span class="SpellE">Lariosa's</span>
counsel must have been misled by the implementing rules of the labor commission
and considering that the shortened period for an appeal is principally intended
more for the employee's benefit, rather than that of the employer, We are
inclined to overlook this particular procedural lapse and to proceed with the
resolution of the instant case. [<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 191.]</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, private respondent's late filing of the appeal
notwithstanding, the Court finds that public respondent did not commit grave
abuse of discretion in giving due course to the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having disposed of the procedural issue, the Court will now deal
with the main issue in this case, which is whether or not NLRC committed grave
abuse of discretion in ordering petitioner to pay private respondent three
years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and separation pay (if reinstatement
is no longer possible) for the alleged illegal dismissal of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">While petitioner concedes that private respondent of must be
reinstated since there was no intentional abandonment on the part of private
respondent, it challenges the order for the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and separation pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner contends
that there was no illegal dismissal to speak of since private respondent was
never dismissed in the first place, and that justice dictates that private
respondent must simply be reinstated [Reply pp. 1-2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 51-52.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the labor arbiter and the NLRC agree that the accidental,
breaking of the showcase's top-glass was so minor an incident as to provoke an
employer to dismiss a managerial employee who has worked with him for more than
twenty (20) years [Decision of NLRC, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
16.] However, in holding that private respondent was illegally dismissed by
petitioner, the NLRC held that:</p>

<blockquote>We agree that the accidental breaking of the showcase's top-glass
was a minor incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily it
could not provoke an employer (who knew what its repercussions could be) to
dismiss an employee for that matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>But</u>
<u>the</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>appellees</u></span> <u>[petitioner</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Chong</u></span> <u>Guan</u> <u>Trading and</u> <u>its</u> <u>owners</u>]
<u>who</u>, <u>we</u> <u>perceive</u>, <u>were</u> <u>indeed</u> <u>bent</u> <u>on</u>
<u>ousting</u> <u>the</u> <u>appellant</u> <u>[private</u> <u>respondent</u> <u>Chua]
magnified</u> <u>it</u> <u>to</u> <u>such</u> <u>a</u> <u>serious</u> <u>proportion</u><i>,</i>
<u>as</u> <u>shown</u> <u>by the</u> <u>unprintable</u> <u>words</u> <u>and</u>
<u>invectives</u> <u>that</u> <u>they</u> <u>hurled</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>appellant</u>,
<u>to</u> <u>ostensibly</u> <u>justify</u> <u>their</u> <u>heretofore</u> <u>desire
to</u> <u>terminate</u> <u>him.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>In</u> <u>short,</u> <u>they</u> <u>seized</u> <u>the</u> <u>incident</u>
<u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>most</u> <u>opportune</u> <u>time</u> <u>to</u> <u>implement</u>
<u>their</u> <u>obvious</u> <u>decision</u> <u>to</u> <u>lay-off</u> <u>the</u>
<u>appellant</u>. . . . <span class="GramE">(Decision of NLRC, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 16; Underscoring supplied.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The import of the above findings of the NLRC is that the breaking
of the top-glass was used by petitioner as an excuse to terminate respondent
Chua in accordance with its scheme or plan to oust him.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot sustain the findings of respondent NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the labor arbiter, no evidence was presented to
establish the existence of the so-called scheme to oust private respondent
[Decision of Labor Arbiter, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29.) It
was based only on private respondent's unsupported claim that there was an
"orchestrated scheme or plan" to oust him and that this plan had been
carefully laid out for a long time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent's claim is not borne out by the record which shows
that petitioner has been granting substantial cash advances to private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact barely a month
before his alleged illegal dismissal, petitioner allowed private respondent to
make a cash advance of P4<span class="GramE">,718.00</span> (Decision of Labor
Arbiter, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29.] If indeed there was a
scheme to oust private respondent, petitioner should have denied him further
cash advances knowing that his services will soon be terminated and as a result
thereof, there may be no way to recover the cash advances.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the NLRC admitted in its decision that <span class="GramE">its</span> finding that the petitioner was "indeed bent on
ousting" private respondent was based only on its "perception" and
not on any evidence on record (Decision of NLRC, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 16.] This Court however, cannot rely on <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
perception or speculations in the absence of any credible evidence to support
it [San Miguel Corporation v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No.
50321, March 13, 1984, 128 SCRA 180.] For while it is well-established that the
findings of facts of the NLRC are entitled to great respect and are generally
binding on this Court [<span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span> Highway Lines, Inc.

equally well-settled that the Court will not uphold erroneous conclusions of
the NLRC when the Court finds that the latter committed grave abuse of
discretion in reversing the decision of the labor arbiter or when the findings
of facts from which the conclusions were based were not supported by
substantial evidence [Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. Employees

<p class="BODY">The question that must now be addressed by the Court is whether,
absent the alleged scheme or plan to oust private respondent, it can be
inferred from the events that transpired on the morning of October 28, 1983
that private respondent was illegally dismissed by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent claims that Mariano Lim dismissed him when the
latter said: "<span class="SpellE">Lumayas</span> ka <span class="SpellE">rito</span>."
This is disputed by the petitioner who claims that it was private respondent
who voluntarily left petitioner's premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination of the events that gave rise to the
present controversy as shown by the record, the Court is convinced that private
respondent was never dismissed by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if it were true that Mariano Lim ordered
private respondent to go and that at that time he intended to dismiss private
respondent, the record is bereft of evidence to show that he carried out this
intention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent was not
even notified that he had been dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nor was he prevented from returning to his work after the October 28
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only thing that is
established from the record, and which is not disputed by the parties, is that
private respondent Chua did not return to his work after his heated argument
with the Lim brothers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner has consistently manifested its willingness
to reinstate private respondent to his former position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This negates any intention on petitioner's
part to dismiss private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner first expressed its willingness to reinstate private respondent
during the initial hearing of the case before the Labor Arbiter [Decision of
Labor Arbiter, p. 6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30.] In its position
paper the petitioner also stated that:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>IN PASSING, we gladly reiterate . . . that the management is still
waiting and more than willing to accept him [private respondent] and return to
his former position, notwithstanding his long unauthorized absences and the
intentional abandonment from his job.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>("Annex B" to the Petition, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">This was again reiterated by the petitioner in its Reply to the
Comment of public respondent filed in connection with the instant petition
[Reply, pp. 1-2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 51-52.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, considering the Court's finding that private
respondent was never dismissed by the petitioner, the award of three years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> was not proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Backwages</span>, in general, are granted on grounds
of equity for earnings which a worker or employee has lost due to his illegal

private respondent must have construed the October 28 incident as his dismissal
so that he opted not to work for many days thereafter and instead filed a
complaint for illegal dismissal [Decision of Labor Arbiter, p. 6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30.] On the other hand, petitioner interpreted
private respondent's failure to report for work as an intentional abandonment
["Annex B" to the Petition, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
24.] However, there was no intent to dismiss private respondent since the
petitioner is willing to reinstate him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nor was there <span class="GramE">an intent</span> to abandon on the part
of private respondent since he immediately filed a complaint for illegal
dismissal soon after the October 28 incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

then immediately file an action seeking his reinstatement [<span class="SpellE">Judric</span>
