IN THE CASE CA-G.R. CAR NO. 03332, SUSTAINING PRIVATE RESPONDENT MELCHOR
MATIC'S RIGHT OF REDEMPTION UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 12 OF THE AGRICULTURAL
LAND REFORM CODE (REP. ACT 3844).</p>

<p class="BODY">PETITIONER <st1:city><st1:place>LOURDES</st1:place></st1:city>
GONZALES WAS THE OWNER OF TWO (2) PARCELS OF RICELAND SITUATED AT KAINGIN, <st1:city><st1:place>SAN
  RAFAEL</st1:place></st1:city>, BULACAN.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>ONE PARCEL IS A ONE-HECTARE <st1:place>LOT</st1:place>, WHILE THE OTHER
PARCEL HAS AN AREA OF 2.75 HECTARES, MORE OR LESS.</p>

<p class="BODY">ON <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="5">MAY 29, 1974</st1:date>,
PETITIONER AND PRIVATE RESPONDENT MELCHOR MATIC EXECUTED A TENANCY AGREEMENT
(KASUNDUAN SA PAMUMUWISAN) COVERING THE AFORESAID LOTS WHEREIN IT WAS AGREED
THAT THE LATTER AS TENANT OF THE FORMER, WILL CULTIVATE THE LAND.</p>

<p class="BODY">ON <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="7">JULY 19, 1974</st1:date>,
PETITIONER SOLD TO ONE RODOLFO TAGLE THE PARCEL OF LAND WITH AN AREA OF 2.75
HECTARES FOR P5,000.00 WHICH PARCEL OF LAND IS NOW EMBRACED BY TCT NO. 239735.</p>

<p class="BODY">ON <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="12">DECEMBER 30, 1975</st1:date>,
PETITIONER SOLD THE OTHER PAR­CEL OF LAND IN FAVOR OF ONE ESABELITA ALDEA FOR
P6,000.00 WHICH PARCEL OF LAND IS NOW EMBRACED BY TCT NO. T-199904.</p>

<p class="BODY">BOTH TRANSACTIONS WERE MADE WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF AND WITHOUT
THE SAME BEING OFFERED FOR <st1:city><st1:place>SALE</st1:place></st1:city> TO
PRIVATE RESPONDENT AS THE REGISTERED TENANT THEREOF, IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 12
OF RA 6389.</p>

<p class="BODY">SOMETIME IN NOVEMBER 1981, PRIVATE RESPONDENT LEARNED OF THE TWO
(2) SALES.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>HE OFFERED TO REDEEM THE LAND
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12 OF RA 6389, BUT PETITIONER REFUSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>SO, ON <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="3">MARCH 25, 1982</st1:date> RESPONDENT FILED A COMPLAINT FOR REDEMPTION
BEFORE THE DEFUNCT COURT OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS IN BALIWAG, BULACAN (CAR CASE
NO. 1544) AND ON <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="8">AUGUST 11, 1982</st1:date>
HE CONSIGNED WITH THE SAME COURT THE REDEMPTION MONEY IN THE SUM OF P11,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">THE LOWER COURT, AFTER TRIAL, RENDERED JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF
PETITIONER AND DISMISSED THE COMPLAINT ON THE GROUND THAT THE SALE OF THE LAND
IN QUESTION WAS FICTI­TIOUS FOR THE CONSIDERATION THEREFOR WAS LOW, THAT THE
REAL INTENTION OF THE PETITIONER-VENDOR, IN ACCORDANCE WITH HER ORAL TESTIMONY,
WAS TO GIVE THE LAND TO THE VEN­DEES WHO ARE HER NEPHEW AND NIECE AND WHILE SHE
WAS STILL ALIVE, TO CREATE A TRUST RELATIONSHIP AMONG THEMSELVES; THAT THE
CONTRACTS BEING NULL AND VOID, NO RIGHT OF REDEMPTION MAY RIPEN IN FAVOR OF THE
TENANT.</p>

<p class="BODY">ON APPEAL TO THE RESPONDENT INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT, THE
DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT WAS SET ASIDE AND PRIVATE RESPONDENT WAS ALLOWED TO
REDEEM THE PROPERTIES.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>SAID COURT RULED
THAT THE CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY PETITIONER TRANSFERRING THE PARCELS OF LAND TO
RODOLFO TAGLE AND ISABELITA ALDEA ARE CONTRACTS OF ABSOLUTE SALE AND THAT
PETITIONER CANNOT ORALLY CLAIM, THROUGH HER OWN TESTIMONY, AFTER BEING SUED,
THAT THE CONTRACTS WERE FICTITIOUS AND SIMULATED JUST TO AVOID THE CONSEQUENCES
THEREOF.</p>

<p class="BODY">THE DISPOSITIVE PORTION OF THE DECISION READS -</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, THE DECISION APPEALED FROM IS HEREBY SET ASIDE,
AND ANOTHER ONE ENTERED, SUSTAINING THE RIGHT OF PLAINTIFF TO REDEEM THE
PROPERTIES COVERED BY TCT NO. 238735 AND THAT COVERED TCT NO. 199904 FROM
RESPECTIVE DEFENDANTS, ISABELITA ALDEA AND RODOLFO TAGLE, WHO ARE HEREBY
ORDERED TO EXECUTE THE CORRESPONDING DEEDS OF SALE IN PLAINTIFF'S FAVOR, WITHIN
TEN (10) DAYS FROM FINALITY OF THIS DECISION; OTHERWISE, THE PROPER REGISTER OF
DEEDS SHALL EXE­CUTE THE DEEDS OF SALE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>COSTS AGAINST DEFENDANTS <u>PRO-RATA</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (PP. 26-27, ROLLO)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">FROM THIS DECISION, PETITIONER INTERPOSED THE PRESENT APPEAL,
WHICH WE FIND WITHOUT MERIT.</p>

<p class="BODY">THE PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S RIGHT TO REDEEM THE PROPERTY IN QUESTION
IS PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 12 OF RA 6389 WHICH PROVIDES -</p>

<blockquote>"IN CASE THE LANDHOLDING IS SOLD TO A THIRD PERSON WITHOUT THE
KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGRICULTURAL LESSEE, THE LATTER SHALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO REDEEM
THE SAME AT A REASONABLE PRICE AND CONSIDERATION:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>XXX.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>THE RIGHT OF REDEMPTION UNDER THIS SECTION MAY BE EXERCISED WITHIN ONE
HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS FROM NOTICE IN WRITING WHICH SHALL BE SERVED BY THE VENDEE
ON ALL LESSEES AFFECTED AND THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRARIAN REFORM UPON THE
REGISTRATION OF THE <st1:city><st1:place>SALE</st1:place></st1:city>, AND SHALL
HAVE PRIORITY OVER ANY OTHER RIGHT OF LEGAL REDEMPTION.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>X <span class="SpellE">X</span> <span class="SpellE">X</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">IN HER ATTEMPT TO DEFEAT PRIVATE RESPONDENT'S RIGHT OF
REDEMPTION, PETITIONER CLAIMS THAT THE CONTRACTS ARE FICTITIOUS AND THAT SHE
DID NOT REALLY SELL THE LAND­HOLDINGS BUT EXECUTED THE CONTRACTS MERELY FOR THE
PURPOSE OF CREATING A TRUSTEESHIP RELATION AMONG THEMSELVES.</p>

<p class="BODY">PETITIONER'S AFORESAID CLAIM IS UNTENABLE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AS CORRECTLY RULED BY <st1:street><st1:address>RESPONDENT
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street>, THE CONTRACTS IN QUESTION, CLEARLY WORDED
AS THEY ARE, NEED NO FURTHER INTERPRETATION.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>THEY ARE NO OTHER THAN CONTRACTS OF ABSOLUTE <st1:city><st1:place>SALE</st1:place></st1:city>,
WHICH BY PETITIONER'S OWN ADMISSION, WERE INTENDED TO <st1:place><st1:city>TRANSFER</st1:city>
 <st1:state>AS</st1:state></st1:place> IN FACT, THEY TRANSFERRED THE LEGAL
TITLE OF THE PROPERTY INVOLVED TO THE VENDEES ALDEA AND TAGLE, WHILE IN THE
MEANTIME SHE RETAINED THE BENEFICIAL OWNERSHIP THEREOF.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>TO FACILITATE THE REGISTRATION, SHE EVEN
EXECUTED AN AFFIDAVIT OF NON-TENANCY.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>AFTER CAUSING THE CONTRACTS TO BE REGISTERED AND CERTIFICATES OF TITLE
ISSUED TO THE VENDEES, PETITIONER CANNOT NOW CLAIM THAT THE CONTRACTS WERE
FICTITIOUS AND SIMULATED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>WHETHER THE
CONSIDERATION WAS RELATIVELY LOW OR INADEQUATE, OR WHETHER THERE WAS IN FACT NO
CONSIDERATION AT ALL, IS A MATTER AMONG THE PARTIES TO THE <st1:city><st1:place>SALE</st1:place></st1:city>
ITSELF BUT WHICH THEY MAY NOT INVOKE TO FRUSTRATE THE RIGHT OF REDEMPTION
ACCORDED BY LAW TO PRIVATE RESPONDENT.</p>
