				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The United Church of Christ <span style="">in </span>the Philippines has a<span style=""> </span>church
building erected on two unregistered parcels of land <span style="">with </span><span style="">an area of 571
square meters situated at the corner of the provincial road and General Luna
Street near <span class="SpellE">Iglesia</span> </span><span class="SpellE">Evangelica</span>
in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental.</p>

<p class="BODY">The executive committee of the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
District Conference, Inc. voted on <st1:date year="1971" day="20" month="11">November
 20, 1971</st1:date> to approve the request of the "<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Church</st1:placetype></st1:place>"
to exchange the site of its church building for the lot of the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> spouses (p. 44, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1972</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> District Conference, Inc., through its
moderator, Reverend Arturo Jason, sold the said parcels of land for P6<span class="GramE">,000</span> to the spouses Wins<span style="">ton F. <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> and Clarita <span class="SpellE">Derequito</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the opening statement of the deed the
vendor is designated as the <span class="SpellE"><u>Negros</u></span> District
Conference of the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Inc. which is
apparently an <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u> of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumaguete</u></span>
District Conference, Inc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime before that sale was consummated, or, on September 25,
1972, the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> spouses sold for P3,000 to the <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> District Conference, Inc. (also represented by
Moderator Jason) a parcel of unregistered land with <span style="">an </span><span style="">area of 1,045 square
meters located at Zamora Street in the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A new
church building was cons­tructed on that lot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The congregation of the United Church of Christ was supposed to transfer
to that new church on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="7"><span style="">July 9, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is an allegation that the transfer was already <span class="GramE">effected</span>
in September, 1978 (pp. 5 and 11, Record on Appeal).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Reverend <span class="SpellE">Lamberto</span> <span class="SpellE">Vaño</span>, the pastor of the
United </span>Church of Christ in <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>, was
opposed to the transfer to the new church.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In view of his opposition, the executive committee of the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference removed him and named a new
pastor in his place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Vaño</span>
was informed of his removal in <span style="">a letter
</span>dated <st1:date year="1978" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1978</st1:date>
signed by Moderator <span class="SpellE">Leumin</span> P. Alonso of the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Con<span style="">ference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was replaced by Reverend Samuel <span class="SpellE">Raterta</span> in spite of the fact that the judicial commission
of the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference restrained the
executive committee from removing <span class="SpellE">Vaño</span> (pp. 18 and
27, Record on Appeal). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Vaño</span> claims that his removal was an act
of harassment and that his term as pastor was in fact extended to 1981 by the
church congregation in <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1978</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Vaño</span> and fifteen adherents of the United Church of
Christ in <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span> (composed of the chairman,
secretary, treasurer, auditor, financial secretary and <span style="">ten members of the local church council) filed a </span><u><span style="">class suit</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental against the </span><span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference, Inc. and the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> spouses (Civil Case No. 7049).</p>

<p class="BODY">The objectives of the suit are to annul the said sales and to
restore <span class="SpellE">Vaño</span> to his position as pastor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs alleged that the two parcels
of land, allegedly valued at P100<span class="GramE">,000</span>, were sold to
the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> spouses for the grossly inadequate price of
P6,000 while the land purchased from the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> spouses
had a fair market value of only P20,000.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the sale to the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maypa</span></span><span style=""> spouses was
not approved by the congregation of the local </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">church</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bayawan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> spouses filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint on the grounds of lack of jurisdiction, lack of cause of
action, prescription and <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference, Inc., a
religious corporation, also filed a motion to dismiss on the grounds of lack of
jurisdiction and lack of cause of action (the plaintiffs allegedly did not
exhaust their remedies within the church) and on the additional ground that the
plaintiffs have no legal capacity to sue <span style="">because
they cannot represent the sect known as the United Church of Christ in the
Philippines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court in its order of <st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1979</st1:date> dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It held that the plaintiffs, not being
parties to the two contracts, could not impugn the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Seven of the sixteen plaintiffs filed a motion dated <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1979</st1:date>, withdrawing from the
case because they had ceased to be members of the church.</p>

<p class="BODY">The heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Pioquinto</span>, the
alleged original owner of the 321-square-meter land where the old church
stands, filed a complaint in intervention dated <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1979</st1:date> wherein they prayed that the sale of the
land to the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span> spouses be annulled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They alleged that the said land was donated
in 1917 by Felix <span class="SpellE">Pioquinto</span> to the United Church of
Christ on condition that it would be used solely as the site of a church
building and that the sale of the land to the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span>
spouses was a violation of that condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court did not allow the intervention because the case
had already been decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs
<span style="">appealed </span>to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took their lawyer eighty-<span style="">six </span><span style="">days (an </span>original period of sixty days
and three extensions) to submit <span style="">their </span><span style="">107-page </span><span style="">mimeographed record on appeal which has no subject-index.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For the filing of appellants' brief, appellants' lawyer was given
an original period of forty-five days and an <span style="">exten</span>sion of <u><span style="">ninety
days</span></u><span style=""> </span>(April 21 to
September 3, 1980).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, contrary to
the policy and practice of the Court of <span style="">Appeals,
</span><span style="">as embodied in its <u>Banc</u>
resolution of March 21, 1971, 67 <span class="SpellE">O.G</span>. 2578, the
resolution granting the </span><span style="">ninety-day
</span><span style="">extension did not contain </span><u><span style="">"the warning that upon failure to file
the brief within this period the appeal </span></u><u><span style="">will </span></u><u><span style="">either be
dismissed for failure to file appellant's brief" or given due course
without <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> brief for failure to </span></u><u><span style="">file it</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The practice of granting the ninety-day extension with that
warning was intended "to save time, money and effort and to attain greater
efficiency in the operation of the Court" of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yet, <span style="">in </span>the instant case, <u>no warning was given</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants' lawyer filed motions dated July 3
and August 29, asking for second and third extensions of fifteen days and thirty
days, respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Fifth Division
of the Court of Appeals in its resolution of September 30, 1980 granted the
appellants a second extension of thirty days (in addition to the ninety days),
or up to October 2 within which to file their brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the appellants had been granted already 165 days or five
and a half months within which to file their brief (April 21 to October 3),
they were not able to file it within that period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their lawyer asked for another extension of
fifteen days from October 1, then an extension of <span style="">ten </span>days from October 15 and lastly an extension up to <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="11"><u>November 3, 1980</u></st1:date> within which
to file his brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Flabbergasted by the long extension, defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed an urgent motion dated <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1980</st1:date> and a supplemental motion dated
<st1:date year="1980" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1980</st1:date> for <span style="">the dismissal</span> of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Fifth Division in its resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1980</st1:date> granted the fifth
extension (without acting on <span style="">the </span>motions
for <span style="">third </span>and fourth extensions)
"provided that <span style="">the brief </span>would
be filed on or before <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="10"><u>October 25,
 1980</u></st1:date>" (p. 48, CA <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court deferred the action on the motion
to dismiss the appeal which admittedly contained "plausible reasons".</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants asked for a sixth extension or up to November 7 within
which to file their brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not
acted upon by the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">They mailed their brief on <u><span style="">November </span>7</u> and it was received in the Court of Appeals on
November 19.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contained <u>ten pages</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Two hundred days were required by the
appellants to prepare their ten-page brief</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in its resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="12">December 18, 1980</st1:date> denied <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>'
motion to dismiss the appeal and after considering appellants' sixth motion for
an extension to file their brief on or before November 7, admitted their brief
and gave <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> forty-five days from notice to
file their brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in their motions of
December 17 and 29, 1980 asked for the suspension of the period within which to
file their brief and again moved for the dismissal of the appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also filed a motion dated <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1981</st1:date> for the reconsideration
of the resolution denying their motion to dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in its resolution of <u>May 13, 1981</u>
denied that motion for reconsideration, gave the <span class="SpellE">Maypa</span>
spouses, as <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, an extension of ninety days
within which to file their brief but without the warning required in its 1971
resolution, and granted <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
District Conference, Inc. 45 days within which to file its brief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed
their brief on <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1981</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed in this Court the instant
petition for review (in reality a special civil action of <i>certiorari</i>)
wherein they assailed the resolution of the Court of Appeals admitting appellants'
brief and denying their mo­tion to dismiss the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether the Court of Appeals committed a grave abuse
of discretion in not dismissing private respondents' appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals did not adhere to the rule that
"extension of time for the filing of briefs will not be allowed, except
for good and sufficient cause" (Sec. 15, Rule 46, <span class="GramE">Rules</span>
of Court).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was unduly liberal in
granting extensions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It <span style="">ignored its 1971 <u>Banc</u> resolution
regarding the ninety-day extension which is reaffirmed in Article VI, paragraph
(D<span class="GramE">)(</span>1)(b) of the Court of Appeals' Internal Operating
Procedures ap­proved in the <u>Banc's</u> Resolution No. 163 dated </span><st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="4"><span style="">April
 30, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It allowed appellants' counsel to trifle with the Court and to
make a mockery of appellate practice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Division clerk of court, <span class="GramE">who</span> should be
aware of the 1971 resolution regarding the ninety-day extension, should at
least have called the Court's attention to the necessity of complying with it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, since <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>' brief
had already been filed and the case has been submitted for decision, the ends
of justice would be better served if this case is decided on the merits as soon
as possible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court in its
resolution of October 5, 1981 advised the parties that because the appeal
involves a question of law, it is within this Court's exclusive appellate
jurisdiction and that, eventually, it would be certified <span style="">by the Appellate Court to this Court pursuant
to section 31 of the Judiciary Law and section 3, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record has already been elevated to
us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the case should be decided now
by this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether the trial court erred in dis­missing
appellants' complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of
the order of dismissal shows that it is a confusing and cockeyed order and that
the trial court was not careful in preparing it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The issues at bar are:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether or not the deed <span style="">of </span>sale executed by the defendants <span class="SpellE">Maypas</span> in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
District Conference, Inc. and the deed of sale executed by the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference, Inc. in favor of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Maypas</span></span><span style=""> (are) valid on <span style="">its (sic) face;<o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">whether</span> the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference, Inc. has the authority to enter
into a contract;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">whether</span> the
plaintiffs suffered damages as a result of the transactions entered by the
defendants, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">whether</span> one who is
not a party to the two contracts subject matter of the present complaint for
annulment can assail the contracts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As a rule, <span style="">a contract
</span>cannot be assailed by one who is not a party thereto (<span class="SpellE">Singson</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Saldajeno</span>, <span class="SpellE">G.R</span>. No. <span class="GramE">L-27343).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Going over the grounds of the defendants in their motion
(sic) to dismiss, sustain the view that the answers to <span style="">the </span>questions asked for are <u><span style="">all in the affirmative.<o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, finding the motion (sic) to dismiss well-founded
and meritorious, and the opposition thereto not justifiable, as plaintiffs have
not even bothered to present the Constitution and By-laws of the United Church
of Christ, on who can enter into a contract and bind the United Church of
Christ, said motions to dismiss are hereby granted and the complaint for annulment
of contract filed by the plaintiffs <span style="">is </span>hereby
dismissed without costs" (p. 34, Record on Appeal).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs submitted to the court the <span style="">church'</span>s constitution and by-laws and then moved for the
reconsideration of the dismissal order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their motion was denied in the trial court's minute order of <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal order, with <span style="">its
</span>incorrect grammar and syntax, gives the impression that it was hurriedly
prepared, that it was not the fruit of conscientious study and that the trial
court simply wanted to terminate the case then and there.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court said that after going over the grounds of the
motions to dismiss, its "answers to the questions asked" or to the
issues which it had stated "are all in the affirmative".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that were so, then the trial court
admitted that the plaintiffs suffered damages as a consequence of those sales
and that they could assail the sales even if they are not parties thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">To sustain that dismissal order would be to sanction its
contradictory implications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
the trial court overlooked that plaintiffs' action is not confined to the annulment
of the two sales but includes the restoration of <span class="SpellE">Vaño</span>
to his position as pastor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without prejudging the case and considering the rule that in a
motion to dismiss based on lack of cause of action the defendant hypothetically
admits the truth of the allegations of the complaint, we hold that the
plaintiffs' action is not totally unmeritorious and that it should not have
been dismissed outright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court
should have deferred the resolution thereof until the trial, a procedure
allowed under section 3, Rule 16 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs contend in their complaint that the power to
dispose of the two parcels of land on which the old church of the United Church
of Christ in <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span> stands belongs to the local
congregation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their theory is that the
local church council of <span class="SpellE">Bayawan</span> (whose members are
the plaintiffs in this case), acting as a board of trustees, is empowered by
section <span style="">16, Article I of the by-laws of
the United Church of Christ "to undertake all transactions involving the
real properties of the church, such as acquisition, purchase, lease, mortgage, <u>sale</u>,
donations and the like, and present recommendations on the same to the Church
Council.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Final action
on the <u>disposition, conveyance,</u> lease, mortgage, or <u>alienation</u> of
said properties resides in the <u>congregation</u>" (p. 67, Record on
Appeal).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> in their brief have not
invoked any pro­vision of the constitution and by-laws to sustain their contention
that the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference, Inc. is vested
with authority to sell the church site to the <span class="SpellE">Maypas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deed of sale was signed in behalf of the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumaguete</u></span> District Conference, Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not been clarified whether the <span class="SpellE"><u>Dumaguete</u></span> District Conference, Inc. is the same as
the <span class="SpellE"><u>Negros</u></span> District Conference, Inc.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that the said land was owned by the United
Church of Christ and could be alienated by the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
District Conference, Inc. or whether it was actually owned <span style="">by the local </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="">church</span></st1:placetype><span style=""> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bayawan</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint in intervention of the heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Pioquinto</span>
shows that part of the land was ceded to the local church and not to the <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> District Conference, Inc. or to the national church.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The precipitate dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint in an order
that is plainly deficient in cogency and plausibility shows that the plaintiffs
were not accorded their full day in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil courts will not interfere in the internal affairs of a
religious organization except for the protection of civil or property
rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those rights "may be the
subject of litigation in a civil court, and the courts have jurisdiction to de­termine
<span class="SpellE">controverted</span> claims to the title, use, or possession
of church property" (76 <span class="SpellE">C.J.S</span>. 874-5).</p>

<p class="BODY">"Where a civil right depends upon matters of an ecclesiastical
nature, the civil tribunal tries the civil right and nothing more, taking the
ecclesiastical decision out of which the civil right arises as it is found, and
accepting such decision as a matter adjudicated by another jurisdiction." <span class="GramE">(Syllabus, <span class="SpellE">Verzosa</span> vs. Fernandez, 55

420, 434).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the trial court's ruling that the plaintiffs
cannot assail the two sales because they are not parties thereto, it suffices
to state that the defendants hypothetically admitted that the plaintiffs have
instituted a class suit and that they have proceeded on the assumption that the
sale of the church site was not authorized or was undertaken by the wrong
party, in which case the sale would be an un­enforceable contract (Arts. 1317
and 1403, Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the trial court's order of dismissal is set
aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants should answer the
complaint as well as the complaint in intervention of the heirs of Felix <span class="SpellE">Pioquinto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court should thereafter hold a pre-trial and explore the avenues for an
amicable settlement of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If no
