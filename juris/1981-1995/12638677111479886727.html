CV No. 68021 which affirmed the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental (now Regional Trial Court), Branch IV, <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, in Civil Case No. 11393; and (b) respondent

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="20" month="3">March 20, 1968</st1:date>,
Leticia de la <span class="SpellE">Vina-Sepe</span> executed a real estate
mortgage in favor of PNB, San Carlos Branch, over a lot registered in her name
under TCT No. T-31913 to secure the payment of a sugar crop <span style="">loan of P3<span class="GramE">,400</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, Leticia <span class="SpellE">Sepe</span>,
acting as attorney-in-fact for her brother-in-law, private respondent Romeo <span class="SpellE">Alcedo</span>, executed an amended real estate mortgage to include
his (<span class="SpellE">Alcedo's</span>) Lot No. 1626 (being a portion of Lot
No. 1402, covered by TCT 52705 of the <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>

increased loan of P16,500 (pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">PNB's</span> Brief, p.
74, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Leticia <span class="SpellE">Sepe</span> and private respondent <span class="SpellE">Alcedo</span> verbally agreed to split fifty-fifty (50-50) the
proceeds of the loan (p. 94, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) but failing to
receive his one-half share from her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alcedo</span> wrote a letter on May 12, 1970 to the PNB, San
Carlos Branch, revoking the Special Power of Attorney which </span>he <span style="">had given to Leticia <span class="SpellE">Sepe</span>
to mortgage his Lot No. 1626 (p. 95, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

his land had already been included as collateral for <span class="SpellE">Sepe's</span>
1970-71 sugar crop loan, which the latter had already availed of, nevertheless,
he assured <span class="SpellE">Alcedo</span> that the bank would exclude his lot

collection and injunction with damages (p. 33, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

collateral of Leticia de la <span class="SpellE">Vina-Sepe</span> in our
recommendation for her 1971-72 sugar crop loan" (p. 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) is binding on the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having given that assurance the bank may not

<p class="BODY">In the case of Philippine National Bank vs. Court of Appeals (94
SCRA 357), where the bank manager assured the heirs of the debtor-mortgagor
that they would be allowed to pay the remaining obligation of their deceased
parents, the Supreme Court held that the bank must abide by its
representations.</p>

<blockquote>"On equitable principles, particularly on the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, we must rule against petitioner Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> is based upon the grounds
of public policy, fair dealing, good faith and justice, and its purpose is to
forbid one to speak against its own act, representations, or commitments to the
injury of one to whom they were directed and who reasonably relied
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> springs from equitable principles and the equities
in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is designed to aid the
law in the administration of justice where without its aid injustice might
result.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been applied by this
Court wherever and whenever the <span style="">special
</span>circumstances of a case so demands."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, since PNB had promised to exclude <span class="SpellE">Alcedo's</span> property as collateral for <span class="SpellE">Sepe's</span>
1971-72 sugar crop loan, it should have released the property to <span class="SpellE">Alcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mortgage
which <span class="SpellE">Sepe</span> gave to the bank on <span class="SpellE">Alcedo’s</span>
lot as collateral for her 1971-<span style="">72 sugar
crop loan was null and void for having been already <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span>
by <span class="SpellE">Alcedo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since <span class="SpellE">Alcedo's</span> property secured only <u>P13,100.00</u>
of <span class="SpellE">Sepe's</span> 1970-71 sugar crop loan of P16,500.00
(because P3,400 was secured by <span class="SpellE">Sepe's</span> own property), <span class="SpellE">Alcedos</span> property may be held to answer for only the unpaid
balance, if any, </span>of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sepe's</span></span><span style=""> 1970-71
loan, but not the 1971-72 crop loan. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While Article 1358 of the New Civil Code requires that the
revocation of <span class="SpellE">Alcedo's</span> Special Power of Attorney to
mortgage his property should appear in a public instrument:</p>

following must appear in a public document:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) Acts or
contracts which have for their object the creation, transmission, modification
or extinguishment of real rights over immovable property; sales of real
property or of an interest therein are governed by Articles 1403, No. 2 and
1405."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">nevertheless</span>, a
revocation embodied in a private writing is valid and binding between the
parties (<span class="SpellE">Doliendo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Depino</span>,

<blockquote>"The legalization by a public writing and the recording of the

as between the parties, but mere conditions of form solemnities which the law
imposes in order that such contract may be valid as against third persons, and
to insure that a publicly executed and recorded agreement <span style="">shall </span>be respected by the latter."
(<span class="SpellE">Alano</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Babasa</span>,
10 Phil. 511.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The PNB acted with bad faith in proceeding against <span class="SpellE">Alcedo's</span> property to satisfy <span class="SpellE">Sepe's</span>
