				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">There should be a special place in hell for child molesters for
they are men who are dirty, despicable, <span class="GramE">deviant</span> and
the dregs of society.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such is Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Malate</span>, the appellant, who was convicted by the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> for raping a 9-year old
girl and sentenced "to suffer an imprisonment of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> and to indemnify the complainant in the amount of
P1<span class="GramE">,344.30</span> in concept of actual damages and P500.00 for
moral damages."</p>

<p class="BODY">The People's version of the facts is the following:</p>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="5">May
 10, 1972</st1:date>, upon his return to his residence at barrio <span class="SpellE">Malbog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span>, from barrio <span class="SpellE">Gapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Daraga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> where he harvested <span class="SpellE">palay</span>, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> found his
nine?year-old daughter <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> in bed, complaining of pain in the stomach (pp. 5,
8, 13-14, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days later, because the pain had not
subsided, <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> brought his daughter to <span class="GramE">an</span> <span class="SpellE">herbolario</span> or quack doctor at
barrio San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> of the same municipality (p. 15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Feb. 13, 1973; pp. 8, 23, 24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
May 18, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the pain persisted, <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> took his daughter to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Albay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> on <st1:date year="1972" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1972</st1:date> (p. 9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
May 18, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orense</span>, a resident <span class="GramE">physician</span>
thereat examined the girl (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the patient's private parts, the examining
physician found:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Slight irritation of the labia <span class="SpellE">majora</span> which was reddish;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marked irritations around the urethral
opening and labia <span class="SpellE">minora</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An unhealed tear or rent at the <span class="SpellE">forchet</span> about 1 cm.</blockquote>

<blockquote>No other injuries were located (pp. 6-7, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1973" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1973</st1:date>; p. 3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="8">August 5,
 1974</st1:date>; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A").</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The above injuries, in the doctor's opinion, could have been
caused by a blunt object like a <span class="SpellE">pumicent</span> (tumescent)
penis (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., April 13, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said injuries prompted the doctor to inquire
from the girl what happened, and the latter finally confessed that she was
abused by the appellant, who threatened to hack her with his bolo if she
revealed the matter to anyone (pp. 13-14, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1973" day="13" month="4">April 13, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor relayed the information to the
girl's father, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> who, after obtaining
the corresponding medical certificate from the physician on May 23, 1972, lost
no time in instituting the complaint against the appellant (pp. 10, 12, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the witness stand, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> recounted that at about 8:00 o'clock in the morning
of May 10, 1972, appellant, a neighbor living about 120 meters away from the <span class="SpellE">Lustina's</span> house, accosted complainant who was playing alone
under a coconut tree, and covered the latter's mouth with his hand, then
dragged her to a nearby spot with tall grasses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There, he made her lie on the grass, raised her skirt, removed her panty
and then his pants, after which he inserted his penis into her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl felt pain and cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After satisfying his bestial instincts, he
threatened to hack her with his bolo if she should divulge what had happened
(pp. 7-10, 13-14, 24, 45, 47, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Feb. 13, 1973; p.
11, 17, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., May 18, 1973)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused denied the rape and put up an alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He attributed the charge to a personal grudge
which Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span>, <span class="SpellE">Salvacion's</span>
father had against his family.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
claimed, thru Municipal Health Officer <span class="SpellE">Wilhelmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Abrantes</span>, that <span class="SpellE">Salvacion's</span>
vaginal condition could have been due to washing with polluted water or sitting
too long in a hot place.</p>

<p class="BODY">As in most criminal cases, the appeal raises factual issues
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, the appellant makes
the following assignment of errors:</p>

<blockquote>"I<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE</span> <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> ERRED IN FULLY ACCEPTING THE TESTIMONY OF
PROSECUTION WITNESS DR. PURIFICACION ORENSE AND REJECTING THE TESTIMONY OF
DEFENSE WITNESS DR. WILHELMO ABRANTES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"II<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE</span> <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE MOTIVE
OF COMPLAINANT'S FATHER RAFAEL LUSTINA, IN FABRICATING THIS CRIMINAL CASE AGAINST
THE ACCUSED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"III<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE</span> <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED GUILTY
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE OFFENSE OF RAPE THERE BEING NO MORAL CERTAINTY
OF HIS ALLEGED GUILT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IV. THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> ERRED IN BEING SEEMINGLY BIASED IN FAVOR OF
THE PROSECUTION DURING THE COURSE OF THE PROÂ­CEEDINGS AS THE RECORDS WILL BEAR
OUT.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"V<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>THE</span> <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> ERRED IN NOT GIVING CREDENCE TO THE
TESTIMONY OF DEFENSE WITNESSES."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error is easily refuted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Dr. <span class="SpellE">Purificacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Orense</span> and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Wilhelmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Abrantes</span> are general practitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Orense</span>
presumably has a wider general practice since she is a resident physician at
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Albay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Provincial</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> whereas Dr. <span class="SpellE">Abrantes</span>' line is public health since he is a municipal
health officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between the two
physicians, the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Orense</span> is the more
acceptable especially because she personally examined <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span>
whereas Dr. <span class="SpellE">Abrantes</span> did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second assignment of error is to the effect that <span class="SpellE">Salvacion's</span> father fabricated the charge of rape because he
resented the fact that Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Malate</span> and his father <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> were placed as co-tenants on a piece of land thus
reducing his share of the harvest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant also claims that as a further ground for resenting him, he had
testified in favor of Edwin <span class="SpellE">Artita</span> whom Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> had allegedly boxed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We reject this assignment of error for as
very well said in the People's brief:</p>

<blockquote>"The imputation of motive is obviously a desperate, albeit,
vain attempt, at seeking exculpation by the defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But assuming there was such resentment, the
same could not have sufficiently impelled the victim's father to falsely and
maliciously fabricate a charge of rape against <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Malate's</span> son, herein appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The girl's father would not have gone as far
as subjecting not only his daughter of tender age to the rigors and ordeals of
a public trial and thereafter suffer the consequent social humiliation, but his
whole family as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, only a
desire to bring the offender to justice for his bestial act could have moved
Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> to rightly press the charges against
appellant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">With particular reference to the <span class="SpellE">Artita</span>
affair, <span class="GramE">We</span> adopt with approval its dismissal by the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused further alleged that another reason why
complainant conceived this charge against him is the fact that he (accused)
testified against complainant during the investigation of the barrio captain of
an incident when <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> was charged of boxing Edwin <span class="SpellE">Artita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the
accused himself explained that the case between <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span>
and Edwin was amicably settled upon payment of P5.00 by the former to the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the quarrel
between complainant and <span class="SpellE">Artita</span> was so trivial that it
was easily settled with the payment of P5.00, we cannot believe that it was
sufficient cause for <span class="SpellE">Lustina</span> to frame up the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Incidentally, in the cited incident the name
of the party involved was Edwin <span class="SpellE">Artita</span> which makes us
wonder whether he is related to the defendant's witness, Hugo <span class="SpellE">Artita</span>, who corroborated the defense of alibi."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The third and fifth assignment of errors mean the same thing,
i.e. that the trial court erred in giving credence to the evidence of the
prosecution rather than to that of the defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Involved, therefore, is the credibility of witnesses and on this score
We are not disposed to discard the appreciation of the evidence by the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> because it was in a peculiar position to do so having personally
seen the witnesses testify and their demeanor while doing so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And it should be noted that there is nothing
in the record which the trial court overlooked and could have materially
changed the result.</p>

<p class="BODY">As previously stated, the appellant denied the rape and put up an
alibi.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claimed that on <st1:date year="1972" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1972</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 a.m.</st1:time> he started to plow the farm he was
cultivating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stopped plowing at <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 a.m.</st1:time> when he had to lend his <span class="SpellE">carabao</span> to Hugo <span class="SpellE">Artita</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also said that while he was plowing, <span class="SpellE">Artita</span> helped him pull out some weeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ate lunch with <span class="SpellE">Artita</span>
at the latter's house and at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="13">1:00 p.m.</st1:time>
they plowed <span class="SpellE">Artita's</span> field and finished the task at
around <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hugo <span class="SpellE">Artita</span>
substantially corroborated the alibi of the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alibi cannot prevail over the positive testimony of <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> identifying the appellant as her ravisher.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should also be borne in mind that the
place where he claimed to have worked is only 160 meters from the scene of the
crime so that it was not impossible for him to be there.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims that the trial court was biased in favor of
the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Illustrative of the
trial court's conduct cited by the appellant to support his claim is the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>We cannot allow that
these proceedings will run intermittently mainly because the lawyer will say
that he has a certain purpose for the question.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cross examination is more than one and one-half hours already and
considering the tender age of the witness, she came out with flying
colors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those questions are quite
complicated for a child to answer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And
then let us be realistic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
absolutely no human being on this earth even how small, who is not, in some
parts of the day, sick or is not left by the parents because sometimes the
parents go to seek for their livelihood.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Not only that, this girl was not yet in her senses,
then how could she know.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>How
could she answer your question at the age of four?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Probably she does not know what happened in
this world.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If she were already at the
age of reason it can be allowed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
from a child, it is improper.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reform the
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If you feel that there are
still some questions, you may proceed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court would prefer that you ask your question and you should not be
stopped because it is already past twelve and the Court would like the defense
counsel to make the cross-examination as long as he believes necessary in order
that there will be absolutely no alibi later on if the Court would find the
accused responsible for this sordid and detestable crime of which he is
tried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We want to give you the
opportunity." <span class="GramE">(TSN, February 13, 1973, pp. 56-58.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial judge made the statement during the cross-examination
of <span class="SpellE">Salvacion</span> and he had to do so because counsel for
the accused was obviously trying to confuse, bewilder, <span class="SpellE">harrass</span>
and exhaust the girl of tender years who, according to the trial judge in his decision,
"exuded an aura of innocence and simplicity devoid of artifice and
deception." In fact if the statement is read with an unprejudiced eye, it
can easily be perceived that the court was disposed to be patient and liberal
in respect of cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
same patient and liberal attitude of the judge is revealed in other statements
to defense counsel which the appellant also cites to support his claim of bias,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the opinion of the
Court the line of questioning is very immaterial, irrelevant and impertinent,
but considering that the accused is being charged of a very serious offense and
the counsel has manifested that he has a certain objective or information which
he wants to elicit from the witness, we will give him all the chances so that
it cannot be said that the right of the accused to a just and fair trial has
not been unnecessarily curtailed by the Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, if the trend of questioning will continue and the Court will
detect that there is no material information that will be elicited from the <span class="GramE">witness,</span> we will be constrained to stop the line of
question." <span class="GramE">(TSN, May 18, 1973, p. 16.)</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Court:</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that
you are on cross-examination but it does not necessarily mean that you can ask
any question under the sun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And as to
this testing of credibility is a hackneyed reason for cross <span class="SpellE">examineers</span>
to forward to the Court just to allow them to ask immaterial and irrelevant
questions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, if the Court will
not control those kinds of questions there will be no end to <span class="GramE">a
litigation</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial of a case
will be prolonged so much and the administration of justice will be
subverted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Presiding Judge does not
believe that we are placed in this podium powerless and without objective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the belief of this Presiding Judge that
we have the right to regulate the proceedings, to stop excess not only on the
part of the counsel for one party but also the counsel for the other
party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it is the Court has been quite
liberal, including the prosecutor, with the defense counsel and we believe that
the defense counsel has no basis to complain as to the attitude of the Court in
allowing him to proceed with his cross examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But certainly there is a limit to anything,
and the Court believes with all sincerity that the cross examination is going
out of bounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Objection
sustained." <span class="GramE">(TSN, May 18, 1973, p. 19.)</span></blockquote>
