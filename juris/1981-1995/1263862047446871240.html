				<BR><STRONG>GRIÑO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Manuel Leaño filed a
verified letter-complaint charging Attorney Ernesto Andico of Rosario, Cavite,
with having notarized a forged Deed of Real Estate Mortgage of his house and
lot (covered by TCT No. T-9651) which was later foreclosed and sold at public
auction to Emilio Ricafrente resulting in the eventual ejectment of the
complainant and his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">wife </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">from the property
by Ricafrente.  He alleged that Attorney
Andico was remiss and grossly negligent in the performance of his duties as a
notary public by failing to ascertain the identity of the persons who executed
the supposedly forged Deed of Real Estate Mortgage before he notarized the
same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In his Comment on the
complaint, Atty. Andico averred </span>that he personally knows the complainant,
a former municipal policeman of Rosario, for he (Andico) was an elective
municipal official of that town, first as municipal councilor in 1964, and as
vice-mayor in 1972, that he could not possibly have been mistaken about the
identity of Leaño as the person who executed the Deed of Real Estate Mortgage
in 1974 in favor of one Jacinto Ilas (Annex 1); that in 1966.  Leaño and his wife Asuncion Crisostomo had a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">lso mortgaged </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the same property in favor of the Rural Bank of Sal</span>inas <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">which he also notarized as notary public of
the </span>bank (Annex <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">2); that
although Ilas; in an affidavit (Annex A of letter-complaint) denied being the
mortgagee of the property, Ilas never appeared nor testified in Civil Case No.
4094 which Leaño filed against Atty. Andico involving the mortgaged property; </span>that
the truth <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is that Ilas was really the </span>mortgagee
in the questioned Deed of Real Estate Mortgage (Annex 1) and it was he who
signed the Petition for Extrajudicial Foreclosure of Real Estate Mortgage
before Notary Public Juan C. Medina, Jr. (Annex 3 of Comment); that Leaño's
administrative complaint against him is politically motivated because the
complainant i<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">s </span>a henchman of
Andico's political opponent, Mayor Calixto Enriquez, who administered the oath
to Leaño's letter-complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The solicitor General to

Mortgage</u> involving their land covered by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">TCT No. 9651" is false </span>because he admitted during the
investigation that he and his wife did mortgage that land to the Rural Bank of
Salinas on September 30, 1966.  Leaño
admitted his and his wife's signatures on the deed of mortgage (Annex 2 of
Comment);</p>

is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">false.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is belied by
his testimony that he came to know about the mortgage in favor of Ilas in 1978
or 1979 when he received a notice from Atty. Julian Medina demanding payment of
his account to Ilas, and by his testimony that he received the sheriff's notice
of the foreclosure after the auction sale on May 14, 1976;</span></p>

said affidavit on January 31, 1981, and that he met Leaño's wife, Asuncion
Crisostomo, for the first time on September 19, 1981 in the office of Atty.
Conrado Aquino, were contradicted:   (1)
by Leaño who testified that he met Ilas for the first time in the house of the
barangay captain in 1982 (pp. 4-6, t.s.n., Aug. 19,1985); and (2) by Atty.
Espiritu's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">testimony that Leaño and </span>his

</span><!--[endif]-->The allegation of Atty. Andico that the administrative
complaint against him is politically motivated is credible because Leaño

that it was Mayor Enriquez, with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">help

his letter-complaint, and that he subscribed his complaint before Mayor
