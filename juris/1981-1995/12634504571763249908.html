DOMESTIC RELATIONS COURT OF CAMARINES SUR AND THE CITIES OF NAGA AND IRIGA AND
HAIDE B. VISTA-GUMBA, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The spouses Romeo N. Gumba and Haide B. Vista, both lawyers, were
married in 1968.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They lived with Haide'
s parents in Naga City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some months
after the marriage, Romeo left Haide and lived in Canaman, Cama­rines Sur with
his concubine, Josefina Ballena, and their two children.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Haide was then pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On August 19, 1969, she gave birth to a baby
girl who was named Romy Fay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1972, Haide sued Romeo for support.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance of Camarines Sur,
Naga City Branch II, in a decision dated February 14, 1974, ordered Romeo to
pay Haide "in advance every month" seventy-five pesos for the support
of their child and past support at the same rate as of July 7, 1972 (when the
complaint was filed) plus five hundred pesos as attorney's fees (Civil Case No.
7334).</p>

<p class="BODY">No support was adjudged in favor of Haide because she was working
as legal officer of the regional health office at P472 per month.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo did not appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, that judgment became final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 17, 1974, Romeo rejoined Haide and lived with her in
an apartment at Naga City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On April 27,
1978, he again abandoned her and refused to pay the rental for the apartment
and to support her and their child.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Haide
was constrained once more to go to court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 21, 1978, she sued Romeo in the Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Court in Naga City for the revival of the judgment against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a second cause of action, she asked that
Romeo be ordered to pay P950 (instead of P75) a month for the support of their
child and of herself because she was no longer gainfully employed (Civil Case
No. 81).</p>

<p class="BODY">Romeo filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the five-year
period for executing the judgment by writ of execution had not yet expired and
that the modification of that judgment is within the jurisdiction of the Court
of First Instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion was denied
by the Juvenile and Domes­tic Relations Court in its orders of December 14,
1979 and March 6, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">Romeo filed in the Court of Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
dated March 17, 1980 wherein he prayed for the annulment of the order of
December 14, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the respondents
had filed their comments, the Court of Appeals in its resolution of May 23,
1980 certified the case to this Court because it involves the trial court's
juris­diction (CA-G. R. No. 10542-SP).</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues are whether the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court
has jurisdiction over the action filed by Haide and whether the record of Civil
Case No. 7334 of the Court of First Instance should be transferred to the
special court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 6591, which took effect on Septem­ber 30, 1972,
created the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court for Camarines Sur and the
Cities of Naga and Iriga.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It contains
the following provisions on jurisdiction and transfer of cases:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court. -</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Provisions of the Judiciary Act to the contrary
notwithstanding, the court shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to hear
and decide the following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c) Annulment of marriages, relief from marital obligations,
legal separation of spouses, and <u>actions for support</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SEC. 9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Transitory
provisions</u>. - Upon the orga­nization of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations
Court, the Secretary of Justice shall cause all cases and proceedings <u>pending</u>
before the courts of first instance, municipal courts and city courts in the
Province of Camarines Sur and the Cities of Naga and Iriga, properly cognizable
by said court to be transferred thereto."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Chief Justice in Administrative Order No. 4 dated February 3,
1976 directed that "all cases and proceedings, except those that have
already been submitted for decision as of this date, <u>pending</u> before the
Courts of First Instance, Circuit Criminal Court, City Courts and Municipal
Courts within the Province of Camarines Sur and the Cities of Naga and Iriga,
which are within the juris­diction of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court
for the Province of Camarines Sur and the Cities of Naga and Iriga,” should be
transferred to the latter court (72 O. G. 2050).</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the complaint by Haide in the Juvenile and Domestic
Relations Court, Civil Case No. 81, should be regarded as a <u>new action</u>
which is separate and distinct from Civil Case No. 7334 (R-799) of the Court of
First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The new action is based on the inadequacy of the sup­port awarded
to the child in Civil Case No. 7334 and the necessity for giving support to the
mother who had a job in 1974 when Civil Case No. 7334 was decided but who was
jobless in 1978 when the new case was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint in Civil Case No. 81 covers a period starting on
April 27, 1978, when Romeo abandoned Haide for the second time, or at least
from August 21, 1978, when the complaint was filed and which is, therefore, the
date of the judicial demand for support.</p>

<p class="BODY">That case is within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The cause of action for revival of the 1974 judgment may be disregarded
as not being in order because the judgment for support does not become dormant
and the five-year period for executing it by motion does not apply thereto
(Velayo vs. Velayo, L-23538, July 21, 1967, 20 SCRA 734, 65 O. G. 2096).</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the transfer of the <u>expediente</u> of Civil
Case No. 7334, that cannot be allowed since it was not a pending case when the
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court was organized in 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original record of the case was
destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only the decision was
reconstituted and a copy of that decision already forms part of the re­cord of
Civil Case No. 81 of the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of First Instance should be the one to resolve the
pending incidents in Civil Case No. 7334 and should en­force the 1974 judgment
in that case which judgment will not be affected by judgment to be rendered in
Civil Case No. 81.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two cases are
independent of each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">JDRC Judge Ma. Rosario Quetulio-Losa did not err in denying Romeo
N. Gumba's motion to dismiss and in setting Civil Case No. 81 for pre-trial.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed and the res­training
order issued by the Court of Appeals is dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against the petitioner.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
