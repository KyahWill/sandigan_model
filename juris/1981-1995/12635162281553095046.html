				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">In a letter-complaint dated 11 January 1993, addressed to this Court, Respondent Atty. Inocencio E. Dumlao, then Branch Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 134, was charged by the RTC Makati Movement against Graft &amp; Corruption for allegedly engaging in usurious activities, immorality and violation of the Anti-Graft &amp; Corrupt Practices Act (R.A. 3019, as amended).&nbsp; The complaint alleged that Respondent withheld the salary checks of all RTC Makati employees to compel them to borrow money from him at usurious rates, as evidenced by Trust Agreements.&nbsp; The amounts loaned are collected through his alleged paramour, Ms. Piedad Rufo (now Piedad R. Cruz), a clerk employed at the Cash Section of the Office of the Clerk of Court, RTC Makati.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>Respondent was also charged with allegedly demanding money from party litigants and lawyers in exchange for favorable action on their cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Attached to the letter-complaint are the following supporting documents:<br><br>Petition dated 25 April 1988 signed by about 90 employees of the Makati RTC requesting that the remittances of the employees' checks, allowances and other benefits be done either by registered mail addressed to the respective Branch Clerks or OIC's or by personal representation by one personnel of each branch upon authority from the Branch Clerk of Court or OIC;<br><br>Memorandum of then Makati RTC Clerk of Court Maximo C. Contreras directing the release of treasury warrants to the payees only, otherwise the release should bear his approval;<br><br>Complaint for Sum of Money filed on 4 October 1990 by respondent lnocencio E. Dumlao against a certain Nelson Olandesca based on a promissory note which was attached to the complaint as Annex "A;"<br><br>Affidavit complaint dated 15 October 1991 of respondent lnocencio E. Dumlao for estafa (trust agreement) against Adora Balinguit filed with the fiscal's office of Makati ...;<br><br>Subpoena issued in IS No. 92-1162 dated 20 February 1992 for estafa (violation of trust agreement) where the complainant is respondent Dumlao against one Lorie Ann Martinez who was then a court employee of Makati RTC Branch 149.&nbsp; Attached to the subpoena are two (2) receipts signed by Martinez as trustee and Dumlao as trustor.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Based on the rule laid down in the case "Anonymous Complaint Against District Judge Gibson A. Araula, CFI of Southern Leyte, Branch X"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> that:<br><br>[a]lthough the court does not as a rule act on anonymous complaints, cases are excepted in which the charge could be fully borne by public records of indubitable integrity, thus needing no corroboration by evidence to be offered by complainant, whose identity and integrity could hardly be material where the matter involved is of public interest<br><br>the complaint was given due course and a Resolution dated 3 May 1993 was issued requiring Respondent to comment.<br><br>Respondent vehemently denied all the charges and branded the allegations as mere conjectures, hearsay and rumors without legal or factual basis.&nbsp; He revealed that since December 1992, he has been engaged in a confidential mission to help the Court Administrator expose the widespread corruption in the Makati RTC and he surmised that this is the reason for the "anonymous poison letter" against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>In its Reply dated 27 July 1993, complainant Movement denigrated Respondent's claim as prime crusader against graft and corruption and challenged.&nbsp; Respondent's appointment as a confidential agent in view of the latter's removal from the Land Transportation Office, prior to his appointment as Branch Clerk of Court of RTC Makati, Branch 34, for being notoriously undesirable.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>On 7 1994, the Office of the Chief Justice received another letter-complaint against Respondent signed by Susan B. Quinto for:<br><br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corruption and dereliction of duty for exacting money from court litigants in the pretext that the amounts exacted are his commissioner's fees yet; he does not prepare his reports.<br><br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For operating a lending agency with the use of the facilities of the court and for exacting from court employees usurious interest;<br><br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For criminal negligence in the performance of his duties as Branch Clerk of Court of RTC, Branch 234, Makati, Metro Manila.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>In a Resolution dated 1 June 1994, the aforementioned cases were consolidated and referred to Executive Judge Salvador Abad Santos of the RTC, Makati, Metro Manila, for investigation, report and recommendation.<br><br>In the course of the investigation conducted by Executive Judge Abad Santos, no one appeared in behalf of the RTC Movement Against Graft &amp; Corruption.&nbsp; However, complainant Susan Quinto testified and adduced evidence to substantiate her complaint.<br><br>In his report submitted on 23 August 1994, Executive Judge Abad Santos made the following findings which we quote in full below:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>With regard with the first charge, the private complainant has shown through, among others, court records that respondent indeed charged commissioner's fees for the reception of evidence in at least 2 <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> cases.&nbsp; These cases are Makati Insurance Company, Inc. versus Hadji Anthony Lim (Civil Case No. 91-217) and Household Finance Corporation versus Sps. Oledena (Civil Case No. 92-3449).&nbsp; Both cases are pending before Branch 134 RTC Makati.&nbsp; Both cases were dismissed by the present presiding Judge Paul Arcangel for failure to prosecute only to find out that plaintiffs in the two (2) cases had already presented their evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte </span>on 20 July 1992 and 17 June 1993 respectively before the then Clerk of Court who was respondent Dumlao. Notwithstanding the protestations of respondent to the effect that he was not the recipient of the amount although he admitted he "billed" the parties and the subsequent recantation of one of the lawyers, the court still believes him to be liable since in the first place he admitted having demanded certain amounts from the parties. Again during his testimony he made an admission that he collected commissions of from P300.00 to P500.00 for the <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span> reception of evidence.&nbsp; (TSN, 28 July 1994, pp. 6-7.) Nowhere in the Rules is the Clerk of Court allowed to charge and collect commissioner's fees for the reception of evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span>.&nbsp; On the contrary, on Page 32 paragraph 1 of the Manual for Clerks of Court it is stated that "No Clerk of Court shall demand and/or receive commissioner's fees for reception of evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte</span>." This offense is aggravated by respondent's failure to prepare the commissioner's reports notwithstanding his having been paid at the<span style="font-style: italic;"> ex-­parte</span> reception.<br><br>Moreover, there is the unrefuted allegation of a certain Atty. Eugenio Macababayao that respondent asked P1,000.00 from him when he requested that his LRC Case No. M-2489 be set for hearing.&nbsp; It appears that the said case was filed on 11 Feb. 1992.&nbsp; After the lapse of one or two months when he went to respondent to request that the case be calendared, respondent asked for P1,000.00.&nbsp; Because he refused to pay, the case was not set for hearing.&nbsp; It was only on 17 Jan. 1994 after respondent was transferred to another Court that the case was included in the Court's calendar. Whether or not respondent demanded money is no longer as important.&nbsp; The fact is it took almost two (2) years before the case was set for hearing. Among others, it is the duty of the Clerk of Court to assist the Judge in matters such as this.<br><br>With regard to the second charge of engaging in usurious activities, the evidence of private complainant are so preponderant that it cannot but be concluded that respondent was into usurious activities on government time and resources.&nbsp; The testimony of Arthur Blancaflor, his runner then, was given with ease and spontaneity and so complete that its veracity cannot be doubted.&nbsp; His testimony details respondent's collection process.&nbsp; Blancaflor on payday gets the pay checks of respondent's debtors, brings them to the payees for the latter's endorsement, gives them to respondent for his second endorsement and deposits them to respondent's account with the Philippine National Bank.&nbsp; This testimony is corroborated by that of Atty. Cynthia Marmita, Clerk of Court of Br. 136 RTC Makati who admitted having borrowed money from respondent "around 20 to 30 times" at 10% interest a month. (TSN, 15 July 1994, pp. 4-5.) Teresa Arzaga, a municipal employee detailed with Makati RTC also testified to the same effect except that the loans were coursed thru respondent's friend Piedad Rufo.&nbsp; (TSN, 12 July 1994, pp. 4­-8.) Rosario Ambrosio also testified that she borrowed money from Piedad Rufo to the tune of around P50,000.00.&nbsp; This witness turned hostile when she denied having dealt with respondent with regard to her loan transactions although she admitted having heard of the same.&nbsp; (TSN, 12 July 1994, p. 8.)<br><br>But what really convinced the court of respondent's lending activities are the documentary evidence attached to the complaint as annexes and introduced in evidence at the hearing. These are Exh. K, the information filed against RTC Makati employee Lorie Ann Martinez at the instance of respondent Dumlao for violation of Trust Agreement (Estafa):&nbsp; Exh. L, the affidavit-complaint of respondent Dumlao in the said estafa case where it is alleged that Lorie Ann Martinez "failed to deliver to the beneficiary, Ms. Piedad Ronquillo (Rufo) the sum of P6,000.00 on their delivery dates, i.e., June 15, and July 15, 1991, and likewise failed to return to complainant on or before June 18 and July 18, 1991, the said sum of P6,000.00 in violation of her obligation to do so, in accordance with the "Trust Agreement" referred to in the affidavit-complaint; Annex C of the complaint in Administrative Matter No. P-93-800, which is a copy of the complaint for sum of money filed by respondent Dumlao against one Nelson Olandesca based on a promissory note signed by the latter in favor of the former; and Annex D of the same complaint which is another affidavit-complaint for estafa again filed at the instance of respondent Dumlao vs. another RTC Makati court employee, Adora Balinguit, with the same "Trust Agreement" as exhs. L1 &amp; L2 as basis.&nbsp; All these indubitably show that respondent was really engaged in lending activities especially in the light of respondent's failure to satisfactorily explain them.<br><br>Finally, as to the charge of dereliction of duty as Branch Clerk of Court of RTC Makati Branch 134, all one has to do is to examine the Monthly Reports signed by respondent Dumlao and the inventory submitted by the present presiding judge of the said branch and it becomes apparent that while respondent Dumlao reported that their court had only 2 cases pending decision for the month of April, 1993; 4 for May 1993; and 2 for June 1993; yet the inventory submitted by Judge P. Arcangel as of 13 December 1993 shows about 120 cases were submitted for decision or with unresolved incidents some of which as early as 1983.&nbsp; Respondent's reliance on the report of the criminal and civil in?charge will not exculpate him from being negligent especially in the light of his own admission of "aberrations" and "shenanigans" going on in their branch.&nbsp; This should have all the more put him on his guard and he should have double checked the entries in the inventories given to him for his signature.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br><div style="text-align: center;">xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br>Based on the foregoing, Executive Judge Abad Santos recommended the dismissal of Respondent from service on grounds of grave misconduct and dishonesty prejudicial to the best interest of the service and acts unbecoming a court officer.<br><br>After a thorough analysis of the records of the case, we find that the dismissal of Respondent is in order. We approve the recommendation of Executive Judge Abad Santos.<br><br>Public service requires utmost integrity and strictest discipline.&nbsp; A public servant must exhibit at all times the highest sense of honesty and integrity.&nbsp; The administration of justice is a sacred task.&nbsp; By the very nature of their duties and responsibilities, all those involved in it must faithfully adhere to, hold inviolate, and invigorate the principle solemnly enshrined in the 1987 Constitution that a public office is a public trust; and all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency.&nbsp; The conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, from the presiding judge to the lowliest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.&nbsp; Their conduct, at all times, must not only be characterized by propriety and decorum but, above all else, must be above suspicion. Indeed, every employee of the judiciary should be an example of integrity, uprightness and honesty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>The nature and responsibilities of public officers enshrined in the 1987 Constitution and oft-repeated in our case law are not mere rhetorical words.&nbsp; Not to be taken as idealistic sentiments but as working standards and attainable goals that should be matched with actual deeds.<br><br>In the case at bench, the particular public officer concerned is a Branch Clerk of Court of a court of justice who is described as an essential officer in any judicial system, whose office is the hub of activities, both adjudicative and administrative<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and who occupy a position of great importance and responsibility in the framework of judicial administration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Clerks of Court are, thus, required to be individuals of competence, honesty and probity specifically mandated to safeguard the integrity of the court and its proceedings, to earn respect therefor, to maintain loyalty thereto and to the judge as the superior officer, to maintain the authenticity and correctness of court records and to uphold the confidence of the public in the administration of justice.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>Did Respondent live up to his commitment?<br><br>On the issue of Respondent's demanding and receiving so called "commissioner's fees," we find the charges against Respondent meritorious.&nbsp; The Manual for Clerks of Courts, which in essence is the "Bible for Clerks of Courts"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> specifically provides that:<br><br>No Branch Clerk of Court shall demand and/or receive commissioner's fees for reception of evidence <span style="font-style: italic;">ex-parte.</span><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>...The court shall allow the commissioner, other than an employee of the court, such reasonable compensation as the circumstances of the case warrant...<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> (Underscoring ours.)<br><br>Yet despite the express prohibition, a bill for the payment of P2,000.00 as commissioner's and stenographer's fees for the ex-parte presentation of plaintiffs evidence in the case of Makati Insurance Co., Inc. v.
