				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the much discussed and vexed question as to
the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals under section 45 of the Judiciary Law,
as amended by Republic Act No. 6031, to review the decision of the Court of
First Instance in cases exclusively cognizable by an inferior court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> in its decision dated September 1, 1975 in an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit, Civil Case No. 3509, ordered the Yu spouses
to vacate the one-third portion on the southern side of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Stall No. 1 of the <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span> Central Market
and to pay the spouses Anita G. Torres and <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span>
Torres the sum of ninety pesos a month from February 19, 1975 until the
possession of the stall is restored to the Torres spouses (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Yu spouses appealed to the Court of First Instance which in a
decision dated <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1975</st1:date>
in Civil Case No. 15178 affirmed the municipal court's judgment (p. 40, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of
that decision was received by the Yu spouses on <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fifteen days later, they filed a motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They received the order denying it on <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1975</st1:date> (p. 75, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fourteen
days later, or on December 23, they mailed their petition for review to the
Court of Appeals (p. 5, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals in its resolution of January 13, 1976 gave
due course to that petition, required the Torres spouses to answer it, set the
case for hearing on February 11 and directed the issuance of a preliminary
injunction upon private respondents' filing of a bond in the sum of one
thousand pesos (Yu vs. Torres, CA-G. R. No. <span class="GramE">SP-04952).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">That resolution was assailed by the Torres spouses in the instant
special civil action of <i>certiorari</i> which they filed in this Court on <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their petition was given due course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(In the meantime, the decision of the Court
of First Instance was executed).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The Torres spouses
contend that the Court of Appeals has no jurisdiction under Republic Act No. </span>6031
to review the said decision of the Court of First Instance because the issue of
whether its factual find­ings are supported by substantial evidence is
allegedly a purely legal question which this Court has the exclusive
jurisdiction to resolve (pp. 7 and 11, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Diametrically opposed to
that contention is the position taken by the respondents Yu.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend that whether the factual
findings in the decision of the Court of First Instance are supported by
substantial evidence is an issue that is within the exclusive juris­diction of
the Court of Appeals (pp. 95, 100-103, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In resolving these conflicting views, it is neces­sary to examine
the lawmaker's efforts to diminish the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals
over cases decided by the Court of First Instance which are exclusively
cognizable by inferior courts and thus relieve in some measure the congestion
of cases in the appellate courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the beginning, all cases decided by the Court of First
Instance involving factual issues were <span class="SpellE">appeal­able</span> to
the Court of Appeals as a matter of right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Note that no distinction was made as to cases coming from inferior
courts and cases originally filed in the Court of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before the Judiciary Law was amended, it
provided:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 29.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> The Court of Appeals shall have <u>exclusive appellate</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>jurisdiction over all cases, actions, and
proceedings not enumerated in section seventeen of this Act, pro­perly brought
to it from Courts of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
decision of the Court of Appeals in such cases shall be final:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Provided, however</u>, That the Supreme Court in its
discretion may, in any case involving a question of law, upon petition of the
party aggrieved by the decision and under rules and conditions that it may
prescribe, require by <i>certiorari</i> that the said case be certified to it
for review and determination, as if the case had been brought before it on
appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To avoid protracted litigations over cases coming from inferior
courts, like <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> cases, which could pass
through <u>four courts</u>, including this Court, the law­making body found it
expedient to abolish appeals to the Court of Appeals from judgments of the
Court of First Instance in cases decided by inferior courts and to allow the
Court of Appeals to review the said judgments by means of a petition for review
under certain conditions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, it enacted Republic Act No. 5433, which took effect on
September 9, 1968 and which amended sec­tion 29 by providing that decisions of
Courts of First Instance rendered after trial on the merits in the exer­cise of
their appellate jurisdiction, which <u>affirm in full the judgment of an
inferior court</u>, may be ele­vated to the Court of Appeals by the aggrieved
party only on <u>petition for review</u> and that the Court of Appeals may
entertain that petition when it shows <u>prima facie</u> that the Court of
First Instance "has committed errors of fact or of fact and law that would
warrant reversal or modification of the judgment or decision sought to be
reviewed".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For reference, section
29, as amended by Republic Act No. 5433, is quoted below:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 29.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeals</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court
of Appeals shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over all cases, actions,
and proceedings, not enumerated in section seventeen of this Act, properly
brought to it, except final judgments or decisions of Courts of First Instance
rendered after trial on the merits in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction,
which affirm in full the judgment or decision of a municipal or city court, in
which cases the aggrieved party may elevate the matter to the Court of Appeals
only on <u>petition for review</u>, to which the Court of Appeals shall give
due course only when the petition shows <u>prima facie</u> that the court has
committed errors of fact or of fact and law that would warrant reversal or
modification of the judgment or de­cision sought to be reviewed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court of Appeals shall be
final:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Provided, however</u>, That the Supreme Court in its
discretion may, in any case involving a question of law, upon petition of the
party aggrieved by the decision and under rules and conditions that it may
prescribe, re­quire by <i><u>certiorari</u></i> that the said case be certified
to it for review and determination, as if the case had been brought before it
on appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the other hand,
section 45 of the Judiciary Law originally provided that "Courts of First
Instance shall have appellate jurisdiction over all cases arising in municipal
and justice of the peace courts, in their respective provinces".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that no distinction was made between
cases exclusively cognizable by inferior courts and cases falling within the
concurrent juris­diction of inferior courts and the Court of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Republic Act No. 2613,
which took effect on August 1, 1959 and which enlarged the jurisdiction of
inferior courts in criminal cases, amended sections 45 and 87 by providing that
the decisions of justices of the peace of provincial capitals and city judges
in crimi­nal cases where the penalty does not exceed six years' imprisonment or
a fine of three thousand pesos, or both, shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
directly to the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court as the case may be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings in such cases shall be
recorded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In the meantime, Republic
Acts Nos. 3345, 3820 </span>and 3828 changed the designation of justice of the
peace and municipal judge into municipal judge and city judge,
respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The term "inferior
court" is now used to refer to municipal and city courts (SC Resolution of
December 23, 1963).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Republic Act No. 6031,
which took effect on </span>August 4, 1969, amended section 77 of the Judiciary
Law by providing that "all municipal and city courts shall keep records of
their proceedings in the same manner as courts of first instance" and
"all judgments deter­mining the merits of cases shall be in writing
personally and directly prepared by the municipal or city judge, stating
clearly the facts and the law on which they are based, signed by him, and filed
with the clerk of court".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
inferior courts became courts of record.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Republic Act No. 6031
also amended section 45 of the Judiciary Law by abolishing the trial <u>de novo</u>
pro­vided for in section 9, Rule 40 of the Rules of Court (when inferior courts
were not court of records) and by requiring the Court of First Instance in
deciding cases appealed from the inferior court to decide them </span>on the
basis of the record transmitted from the inferior court to the Court of First
Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Republic Act No. 6031
further amended section 45 by adopting the innovation introduced by Republic
Act No. 5433 in section 29 of the Judiciary Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That amendment or innovation is that the
decision of the Court of First Instance in cases exclusively cognizable by the
inferior court shall be final.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But in contrast with Republic Act No. 5433, Repub­lic Act No.
6031 (enacted less than a year from the enactment of Republic Act No. 5433)
provides that the decision of the Court of First Instance in cases exclu­sively
cognizable by the inferior court shall be final only when the factual findings
in the said decision are supported by substantial evidence and the conclusions
therein are not clearly against the law and jurispru­dence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another amendment introduced by Republic Act No. 6031 into
section 45 is that the decision of the inferior court in cases falling within
the concurrent jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance and an inferior
court shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> directly to the Court of
Appeals whose deci­sion shall be final, subject to review by this Court on
legal questions as provided in Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As amended, section 45 reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 45.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Appellate jurisdiction</u><span class="GramE">.-</span> Courts of First Instance shall have appellate
jurisdiction over all cases arising in city and municipal courts, in their
respective provinces, except over appeals from cases tried by municipal judges
of provincial capitals or city judges pursuant to the authority granted under
the last paragraph of Section 87 of this Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Courts of First Instance shall decide such appealed cases on
the basis of the evidence and records transmitted from the city or municipal
courts:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided,</u> That the
parties may submit memoranda and/or brief with oral argument if so
requested:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Provided, however</u>,
That if the case was tried in a city or municipal court before the latter
became a court of record, then on appeal the case shall proceed by trial <u>de
novo</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In cases falling under the exclusive original jurisdiction of
municipal and city courts which are appealed to the courts of first instance,
the decision of the latter shall be final:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><u>Provided</u>, That the find­ings of facts contained in said decision
are supported by substantial evidence as basis thereof, and the con­clusions
are not clearly against the law and jurisprudence; in cases falling under the
concurrent jurisdictions of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the
municipal and city courts with the courts of first </span>instance, the appeal
shall be made directly to the court of appeals whose decision shall be
final:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Pro­vided, however</u>, that
the Supreme C<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ourt in </span>its discre­tion
may, in any case involving a question of law, upon petition of the party
aggrieved by the decision and under rules and conditions that it may prescribe,
require by <i><u>certiorari</u></i> that the case be certified to it for review
and determination, as if the case had been brought be­fore it on appeal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is at once evident that Republic Acts Nos. 5433 and 6031
overlap or are in <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">materia</span></u>
with res­pect to the finality of the decision of the Court of First Instance in
cases exclusively cognizable by an inferior court such as <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">ejectment</span></span> cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both laws abo­lished appeal by record on appeal to the Court of Appeals
from the decision of the Court of First Instance in cases exclusively
cognizable by an inferior court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">are not, repeat, <span class="GramE"><u>are</u></span><u> not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to
the Court of Appeals</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Both Republic Acts Nos. 5433 and 6031, the former in section 29,
dealing with the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals, and the latter
in section 45, dealing with the appellate jurisdiction of the Court of First
Ins­tance, intend that litigation should, if possible, be ter­minated in the
Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">However, both amendatory
laws assume that the Court of First Instance is not infallible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, in <u>exceptional cases</u> the
rule on finality should not be enforced and the decision of the Court of First
Instance in the cases exclusively cognizable by an inferior court should be
reviewed by an appellate court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 5433 provides that the decision of the Court of
First Instance in that kind of cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">may
</span>be reviewed by the Court of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Appeals
by means of a peti­tion for review when </span>it is apparent that the Court of
First Instance committed errors of fact or of fact and law and that there is
some basis for possible reversal or modification of its decision
notwithstanding the fact that the Court of First Instance affirmed <u>in <span class="SpellE">toto</span></u> the inferior court's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Republic Act No. 6031, while allowing also the
review of the decision of the Court of First Instance in those same cases, does
not unmis­takably and explicitly indicate the appellate court that should
undertake the review and by what means the review should be made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That deficiency or silence has generated
controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Republic Act No. 6031
changed the grounds for re­view spelled out in Republic Act No. 5433.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act No. 6031 provides that the
grounds for review are that the factual findings in the decision of the Court
of First Instance in the said class of cases are not suppor­ted by substantial
evidence and that its conclusions are contrary to law and jurisprudence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is obvious that, as to the grounds for review, there is
repugnancy between the two amendatory laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Republic Act No. 6031, as the later law, should pre­vail and should be
deemed to have superseded Republic Act No. 5433 on the matter of the review by
the Court of Appeals of decisions of the Court of First Instance in cases
exclusively cognizable by inferior courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">But Republic Act No. 5433 should not be considered totally
abrogated by the later law because Republic Act No. 5433, in indicating that
the mode of review is by petition for review and that the Court of Appeals is
the tribunal to undertake the review, supplies the deficiencies of Republic Act
No. 6031 on these matters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether it is this Court or the Court of Appeals
that should review the decision of the Court of First Instance in cases
exclusively cog­nizable by inferior courts has been debated for a long time in
this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pros and cons have been
tho­roughly threshed out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One school of
thought believes that the petition should always be filed in this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of course, that solution would aggravate the congestion of cases in this
Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is said that hard cases make bad law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The converse is true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A bad law (meaning a law that is ambiguous
and deficient) makes cases hard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Republic Act No. 6031 is such a law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The lawmaking body did not indubitably clarify whether it was intended
to repeal Republic Act No. 5433 and where the petition for review should be
filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that if the only issue is whether the conclusions of the
Court of First Instance are in con­sonance with law and jurisprudence, then
that issue <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is a </span>purely legal
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be ventilated in
this Court by means of a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, as expressly
provided in the last proviso of section 45, as amended by Republic Act. <span class="GramE">No. 6031.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for review in that case should be in the form
prescribed in Rule 45 of the Rules of Court for an appeal from the Court of
Appeals, a form adopted by Republic Act No. 5440 which took effect on <st1:date year="1968" day="9" month="9">September 9, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">But if the issue is whether "<u>the findings of fact
contained" in the decision of the Court of First Instance "are
supported by substantial evidence</u>", which is not purely a legal issue,
or if that issue is raised toge­ther with the legal issue of whether the
conclusions of the Court of First Instance are in conformity with pertinent law
and jurisprudence, then the petition for review should be filed in the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">Those issues require an examination and evaluation of the
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As that function is the
prerogative of the Court of Appeals, the review in that case should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>by means of a petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Realizing the deficiencies
in Republic Act No. 6031, the Court of Appeals adopted on August 12, 1971 the
following resolution (67 O. G. 6715) which pres­cribes the filing of a petition
for review when the decision of the Court of First Instance in cases exclu­sively
cognizable by an inferior court is assailed for not being supported by
substantial evidence and because its conclusions are claimed to be contrary to
law and jurisprudence:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, Republic Act No. 6031 does not prescribe the
procedure to be followed by the Court of Appeals in the review of judgments of
the Courts of First Instance, in cases falling under the original exclusive

the Courts of First Instance are assailed for not being supported by
substantial evidence as ba<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sis thereof

allegations of the petition, the same is not <u>prima facie</u> meritorious or

shall deposit the amount of eighty pesos (P80.00) for costs within three days

Instance to elevate the whole record, including the oral (transcript of
stenographic notes) and documen­tary evidence, of the case to this Court within
ten (10) days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The answer of the
respondents, which shall also be in six copies, shall be accompanied with true

petition be heard on oral argument, which may or may not be granted at the
discretion of the Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the Yu spouses in filing their petition for
review in the Court of Appeals simply followed the said resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a correct implementation of Republic
Act No. 6031 which has been in force for more than eleven years now (See <span class="SpellE">Buenbrazo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Marave</span>, L-41144,
December 29, 1980, 101 SCRA 849 and <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> vs. CA,
56284, January 30, 1982, 111 SCRA 581).</p>

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DE CASTRO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">With how exhaustive and analytical are the main opinion and the
separate concurring opinion of Justice Vasquez on the "vexing"
question treated by them, it is hoped the following observations will not be mere
superfluities, much less devoid of any merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provision of Section 29 of the Judiciary Act, before and
after its amendment by Republic Act No. 5433, clearly showed a legislative
intent to place the greater burden in appeals from the decisions of the Court
of First Instance on the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What is reserved to the Supreme Court is the power to review decisions
in any case when they involve only questions of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, hard to ascribe to the
legislative body that in enacting Republic Act No. 6031, it intended to
eliminate altogether the Court of Appeals from the judicial process involving a
review of the aforementioned decisions and place the entire burden on the
Supreme Court, as would be the effect of the view that appeals from the
decisions of the Court of First Instance referred to in Republic Act No. 6031
should all go directly to the Supreme Court bypassing the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule has always been that if the questions raised are one of
fact or both fact and law, the appeal goes to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first ground mentioned in Republic Act
No. 6031 on the substantiality of the evidence is, in my humble opinion, if not
one involving solely a question of fact, one involving both question of fact
and law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mere fact that this ground is set apart from the other
ground, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that "the
conclusions are clearly against the law and jurisprudence" evinces an
intention to distinguish one from the other, insofar as the nature of the
question as may be raised from either of the two grounds, is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first ground has reference to the <u>evidence</u>
which has to be assessed and evaluated, which necessarily involves the
determination of what the fact proven or not proven is.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The separate mention of this ground from the
second, which explicitly involves question of law or jurisprudence, implies a
nature of the question arising from the first, different from that expressly
stated in the second ground which doubtlessly raises question of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first ground of "substantiality of evidence" could
perhaps be a question of law when the evidence has been evaluated by the Court
in such arbitrary or erroneous manner that the act would constitute a grave
abuse of discretion, amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But before making this conclusion, the
factual basis has first to be laid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
means coming to grip with a question of fact, and of necessity, making first a
conclusion of fact after assessing the evidence before making the legal
conclusion as to the commission of grave abuse of discretion by the lower
court.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is thus no evading the conclusion that when the appeal from
the decision of the Court of First Instance under Republic Act No. 6031 is
based on the first ground--substantiality of the evidence--what is raised is a
question of fact, or at least a mixed question of law and of fact, which makes
the appeal cognizable by the Court of Appeals, not directly or exclusively, by
the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Vasquez cited Section 22 of B.P. No. 129, which, to me, lends
support to the view that the Court of Appeals was never intended, under
Republic Act No. 6031, to be stripped of appellate jurisdiction over appeals
taken from decisions of the Courts of First Instance on cases appealed to them
from the inferior courts as therefore exercised by it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had that been the intention, which would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">be a </span>sudden and sharp departure from
the appeal procedure then <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">existing </span>and
being observed, Republic Act No. 6031 should have, in all likelihood, not
failed to indicate such intent with clear and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">unequivocal </span>terms.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>Acting C</i>.<i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result which upholds the jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeals to review the adverse judgment of the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> under the provisions of section 45 of
the Judiciary Act, as amended by Republic Act 6031 which took effect on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1969</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In essence, the conflict of views that arose in the Court after
the enactment of Republic Act 6031 is as to <u>where</u> the petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i> of the <u>final</u> decision of the Court of First
Instance acting as an appellate court in appealed cases exclusively originating
from the municipal and city courts should be filed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> One view
is that all such petitions for review should be filed with the Court of
Appeals, subject to the reserved jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of reviewing
on <i>certiorari</i> cases involving pure questions of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other adheres to the main opinion's
orthodox view that if questions of fact are involved, the petition for review
should be filed with the Court of Appeals; and that if the petition for review
involves pure questions of law, then the petition should be filed with the
Supreme Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Still a third view would
have all such petitions filed only with the Supreme Court, which would add to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">the </span>congestion of cases filed with
this Court.)</p>

<p class="BODY">I believe that the historical record sustains the first view and
shows that Republic Act 6031 was enacted to lessen the number of appeals that a
litigant could take in a case and to relieve the Supreme Court of having to
pass over appeals or petitions for review of cases originating from the
exclusive original jurisdiction of municipal and city courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Act provided for only one appeal
from cases falling under the exclusive original jurisdiction of municipal and
city courts - to the Courts of First Instance, further expressly providing that
the decision of the Courts of First Instance shall be <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">final</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">, </span>thus cutting off any further appeal to a higher court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Act made a proviso, however, that for
such finality of the decision of the Court of First Instance, acting as an
appellate court, to stand, the "findings of fact contained in the said
decision (must be) supported by substantial evidence as basis thereof and the
conclusions are not clearly against the law and jurisprudence." The
proviso involves mixed questions of fact and law, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>there must be substantial evidence to support
the findings of fact and the conclusions drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
"are not clearly against the law and jurisprudence;" and the
appellate court with proper jurisdiction over such mixed questions of fact and
law and with whom all petitions for review should be uniformly filed is the
Court of Appeals which is supposed to have under the Judiciary Act fifteen (15)
divisions com­posed of three (3) members each and is, therefore, fully equipped
to handle and dispose of all such petitions for review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should also be noted that the criterion
provided by the Act is the substantial evidence rule which does not involve a
painstaking review of evidence submitted during the trial in the municipal or
city court but merely the determination of the existence in the record of such
relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support the
findings and conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the mixed questions of fact and law
involved by the Act's proviso, and assuming that the petition raises a pure
question of law, there is nothing objectionable in having the Court of Appeals
pass upon and determine the same, subject to the reserved jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court over such questions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
last proviso of the third paragraph of the Act ex­pressly recognizes such
reserved and ultimate jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in cases involving pure
questions of law as vested in it by the Constitution [Art. X, section 5 (2)
(e)] and therefore provides that the Supreme Court, in its discretion, may in
such cases require by <i>certiorari</i> that the case be certified to it for
review and determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">In brief, although the statute's wording may have lacked the
requisite precision (specially if it is considered that section 29 of the
Judiciary Act was left standing when it should be deemed superseded by the
provisions of the Act), the law as it stands now under Republic Act 6031
provides for finality of the decision of the Court of First Instance in
appealed cases originating from the exclusive original jurisdiction of
municipal and city courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
correctness of such decisions may be, however, questioned under petitions for
review filed within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period with the
Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such petitions for
review are not appeals which are automatically given due course.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, upon consideration of
the peti­tion for review and a determination that the findings of fact in the
Courts of First Instance's decision are supported by substantial evidence and
that the conclusions are not clearly against the law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">and </span>jurisprudence, may deny the petition outright for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This generally puts an end to the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Parties who persist in still
filing a petition with the Supreme Court to review on <i>certiorari</i> the
Court of Appeals' determination get short shrift with an outright dismissal of
their petition and the consequent waste of time, effort and money and only in
rare cases where a substantial question of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">law </span>is involved are such petitions entertained by the Supreme
Court.</p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">*</span></span></a> No problem is encountered
regarding cases falling under the concurrent jurisdictions of the municipal and
city courts with the courts of first instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Act provides for one appeal directly to the Court of Appeals whose
decision shall be <u>final</u>, regardless of whether the question raised is
one of fact or of law, subject, of course, to the reserved jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' decision on certiorari.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform:uppercase">concurring o</span>PINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VASQUEZ, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">It may appear presumptuous for me to add to the exhaustive and
scholarly dissertation made by the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span><u> </u>of
the main opinion which truly deserves the gratitude of those who have
heretofore been vexed by question involved herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I only desire to throw in my observations on
some of the points discussed in the hope of adding clarity to the same.</p>

<p class="NUM">1. It is not very accurate to state that both R.A. 5433 and R.A.
6031 "abolished appeal by record on appeal to the Court of Appeals in
cases exclusively cognizable by an inferior court"; or that "such
cases are not <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the Court of
Appeals." <span class="GramE">(Decision, p. 7.)</span> The appeal by record
on appeal abolished by R.A. 5433 is only from the decision of a court of first
instance in a case appealed to it from an inferior court which <u>affirms</u> <u>in</u>
<u>full</u><i> </i>the judgment of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where the judgment of the court of first instance modified or reversed
that of the inferior court, the appeal to the Court of Appeals is by ordinary
appeal which needed a record on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither R.A. 5433 nor R.A. 6031 abolished appeals from the
decisions of the courts of first instance in such cases to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The effect of said laws is not
to do away with such appeals, but merely to change the mode of taking the
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After R.A. 5433 was enacted on
September 9, 1968, the appeal from the decision of a court of first instance in
a case appealed to it from an inferior court may be taken in one of two ways,
depending on the nature of said decision in relation to that of the inferior
court; namely, (1) by petition for review if the decision affirms in full that
of the inferior court; and (2) by record on appeal if it does not.</p>

<p class="BODY">After R.A. 6031 was enacted to amend Section 45 of the Judiciary
Law, R.A. 5433 was virtually re­pealed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Insofar as appeals from the decisions of the court of first instance in
cases appealed to them from inferior courts are concerned, the two laws are
irreconcilable and may not be applied together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appeal by record on appeal (authorized by R.A. 5433 in cases where the
court of first instance modified or reversed the decision of the inferior
court) was totally eliminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
R.A. 6031 did not provide expressly as to whether the decision of the court of
first instance in such cases may still be appealed, or if so, by what mode of
appeal, the implication is clear that despite the declaration that the decision
of the court of first instance shall be "final", an appeal may still
be taken to determine whether the statutory condition for such finality has
been complied with it, to wit, that "the findings of facts contained in
said decision are supported by substantial evidence as basis there­of, and the
conclusions are not clearly against the law and jurisprudence." It was in
the face of the fact that while an appeal is presumably allowed from such
decisions of the court of first instance, there is a void in the law as to how
such appeal may be <span class="GramE">taken,</span> the Court of Appeals issued
its Resolution dated August 12, 1971 (quoted in pp. 9-10 of the Decision).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Resolution, obviously due to the absence
of any mode of appeal provided for in R.A. 6031, adopted the mode prescribed in
R.A. 5433, which is by petition for review if the appeal is to be taken to the
Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quite understandably,
the said Resolution could not have provided for the mode or procedure if the
appeal shall be taken to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="NUM">2. My understanding of the problem as to whether the petition to
review the decision of the court of first instance in such cases should be
filed in the Supreme Court or in the Court of Appeals is that some Members of
this Court are of the opinion that the determination of whether the findings of
facts contained in the decision of the court of first instance "are
supported by substantial evidence" is a pure question of law, and hence,
the appeal in all such cases should be lodged with the Supreme Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main opinion does not share this view.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I join the same conclusion but not exactly on
the same grounds stated in the main opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">To my mind, the question of where to appeal a decision of the
court of first instance in a case appealed to it from an inferior court should
not be determined by finding out if the issue is whether the findings of facts
are supported by substantial evidence, or whether the conclusions are not
clearly against the law or jurisprudence, as the case may be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The main opinion holds that in the first
case, the appeal should be to the Court of Appeals, and in the latter, to the Supreme
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">My own view is that the appeal should be to the Supreme Court in
all cases wherein the exclusive jurisdiction over such appeals is vested in the
Supreme Court pursuant to the Constitution and Section 17 of the Judiciary
Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal to the Court of Appeals
is only proper in the cases not in­cluded in said category.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the only way to distinguish between
and delineate the respective appellate jurisdictions of the Court of Appeals
and the Supreme Court with respect to appeals from deci­sions of the courts of
first instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is fallacious, if not
erroneous, to adopt any other test.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The condition provided for in R.A. 6031 as to when a further
appeal from the decision of the court of first instance in appealed cases may
be entertained will be a thing of the past the moment the Judiciary
Reorganization Law (B.P. 129) shall become operative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 22 of this law provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 22.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Appellate jurisdiction</u> -- Regional
Trial Courts shall exercise jurisdiction over all cases decided by Metropolitan
Trial Courts, Municipal Trial Courts, and Municipal Circuit Trial Courts in
their respective territorial jurisdictions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such cases shall be decided on the basis of the entire record of the
proceedings had in the court of origin and such memoranda and/or briefs as may
be submitted by the parties or required by the Regional Trial Courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Regional Trial Courts in
such cases shall be <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> by petition for review
to the Intermediate Appellate Court which may give it due course only when the
petition shows <u>prima facie</u> that the lower court has committed an error
of fact or law that will warrant a reversal or modi­fication of the decision or
judgment sought to be reviewed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that the above-quoted provision no longer predicates
the finality of the decision of the court of first instance (now Regional Trial
Court) on the ground that the findings of fact contained therein are supported
by substantial evidence and the conclusions are not clearly against the law and
jurisprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it applies the
qualification prescribed in R.A. 5433 in determining whether the decision of
the court of first instance may be appealed by petition for review in cases
where it affirmed in full the judgment of the infe­rior court, to wit, that the
court of first instance committed errors of fact or of law that would warrant a
modification of reversal of the judgment sought to be reviewed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This change is not only a matter of
terminology.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>B.P. 129 in effect abandons
the substantial evidence rule in determining whether to give due course to the
petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under both tests, however, the question of where the petition to
review the decision should be filed is to be answered in the same manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither provision was intended to deviate
from the rule that the Supreme Court may not be deprived of its appellate
jurisdiction over cases provided for in the Constitution and other applicable
laws.</p>

<p class="NUM">4. Coming to the case at bar, the issue posed for resolution is
whether the Court of Appeals has the jurisdiction to entertain the petition for
review filed in said court by the herein petitioners to review the decision of
the court of first instance in a case appealed to it from an inferior
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the main opinion, it has been
stated that the issues raised in the said petition for review "require an
examination and evaluation of the evidence." On this assumption, there can
be no doubt that the appeal of petitioners by petition for review was properly
lodged in the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this basis, I concur in the conclusion reached in the main
opinion.</p>
