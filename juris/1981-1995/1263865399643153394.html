<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1987</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> filed a motion to set aside the
compromise agreement dated <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="5">May 15,
 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by the
trial court, thru respondent Judge Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Gustilo</span>
(the former presiding judge, Judge Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Silapan</span>
having already retired) in its Order dated November 27, 1987, the pertinent <span style="">portion of which reads as follows:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<span style="">It </span>appears
that on <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1985</st1:date>, the
former Presiding Judge of this Court <span style="">a</span>pp<span style="">roved the </span>said Compromise Agreement
and rendered a judgment on the basis thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is settled that a judgment approving a compromise agreement is final
and immediately <span class="SpellE">ex<span style="">ecuto</span>ry</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Samonte</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Samonte</span>, 64 SCRA 524).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion in question therefore cannot be granted as it has the effect
of annulling the judgment of this Court which has already become final and,
according to the plaintiff, already executed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Motion to Set Aside Compromise Agreement cannot even be
considered as a motion for reconsideration because the Court can no longer set
aside, amend or modify its judgment which has become final.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can the said motion be deemed as a
petition <span style="">for </span>relief under Rule 38
of the Rules of Court, since to set aside a judgment based upon a compromise
agreement under the said Rule, the petition for relief must be filed not later
than six (6) months from the date it was rendered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Bodiongan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ceniza</span>, 102 Phil. 750).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Court based on the Compromise Agreement was rendered
on <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the present Motion to Set
Aside Compromise Agreement was filed only on <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="6">June 24, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, under Section 3 of Rule 38, the petition for relief from
judgment should be filed within 60 days after the petitioner learns of the
judgment sought to be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in this case received a copy of the decision
based on the Compromise Agreement on <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="9">September
 19, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the instant
motion be construed as an independent action to annul a judgment, this Court
would not have jurisdiction over it inasmuch as under Section 9 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, the Judiciary
Reorganization Act of 1980, an action for the annulment of a judgment of the
Regional Trial Court falls under the exclusive original jurisdiction of the
Court of Appeals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Additionally, the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> have not
convincingly shown that defendant Mayor Enriquez was not authorized to sign the
Compromise Agreement in behalf of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>Rosario</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the Mayor has in his favor
the presumption that official duty has been regularly performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Sec. 5 [m], Rule 131,
Rules of Court.)</span> Likewise, they failed to sufficiently explain why and
how the terms and conditions of the Compromise Agreement have contravened the <span style="">law, </span>morals, good customs and public
policy." <span class="GramE">(pp. 41-42, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10,
 1987</st1:date>, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> filed a
manifestation and Motion praying that the proceedings be terminated and that
the case <span class="GramE">be</span> considered closed, which motion respondent
<span style="">judge </span>granted in his Order dated
<st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="12">December 24, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the said Order
reads-<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In support of his motion to terminate the proceedings, the
plaintiff argued that further trial in this case will be an exercise in futility,
considering that the issues raised by the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
have become moot and academic in view of the decision of the Court based on the
Compromise Agreement submitted by the plaintiff and the defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This contention appears to be well taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court based on the
Compromise Agreement has in effect resolved the issues raised by the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, i.e., whether the reclamation contract entered
into between the town of Rosario and the Salinas Development Corporation, the
predecessors-in-interest of the plaintiff, is null and void; and whether or not
there was actual reclamation done by the said entity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so, for the decision of the Court
based on the Compromise Agreement has impliedly recognized the validi<span style="">t</span>y of the said reclamation contract
and the fact that the tract of land divided between the plaintiff and the
defendant municipality of Rosario pursuant to the Compromise Agreement was the
product of the reclamation efforts undertaken by the Salinas Development
Corporation, which subsequently assigned its rights to the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The continuation of the trial in this case will be
useless.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Should the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>
fail to adduce evidence showing that the reclamation contract was null and void
and that no actual reclamation was undertaken by the Salinas Development
Corporation, the correctness and propriety of the decision of the Court based
on the Compromise Agreement would be strengthened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if they would succeed in proving that
the reclamation contract was null and void and that the area in question came
into being through the natural action of the sea and not through the
reclamation done by the Salinas Development Corporation, still the said
decision could no longer be set aside, inasmuch as it has already become final
and, according to the plaintiff, already executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The continuation of the reception of the
evidence for the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> clearly appears to serve
no purpose at all.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Manifestation and Motion dated <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1987</st1:date>, filed by the
plaintiff, is granted, and the trial of this case is declared terminated and
this case is considered closed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This order modifies the pre-trial order dated November 15,
1984 of this Court, insofar as the said order has allowed the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> to adduce evidence in support of their
contention that the land in question was not reclaimed by the plaintiff <span style="">or </span>his predecessor-in-interest but the
product of accretion, and that the reclamation contract between the defendants
and the Salinas Development Corporation was null and void.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In assailing the aforementioned Decision and Orders of the trial
court, petitioner Romeo Ordonez (one of the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>,
the other seven <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> did not join him in this
petition) raises the following issues, to wit:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1. Whether or not the lower court erred in stopping/preventing the <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span> from further presenting their evidence in
support of their Answer-<span class="SpellE">in­Intervention</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
lower court erred in approving the compromise agreement of May 20, 1985 and
rendering a decision based thereon dated May 24, 1985, <span class="SpellE">inspite</span>
of the clear lack of authority on the part of respondent <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span>
D. Enriquez to bind the Municipality of Rosario because of the absence of an
enabling ordinance from the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> of Rosario, <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>
empowering him to enter into said compromise agreement.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We answer both issues in the negative.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Intervention is defined as <span style="">a

them; the act or proceeding by which a third person becomes a <span style="">party </span>in a suit pending between others;

proceeding; an interlocutory proceeding dependent on or subsidiary to, the case

main action having ceased to exist, there is no pending proceeding whereon the

question was the result of accretion from the <span style="">sea </span>and that the Reclamation Contract
is null and void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly then, the
