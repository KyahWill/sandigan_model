1976), <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Maycong</span> and
one Elena Garcia saw Orlando <span class="SpellE">Primero</span> emerge suddenly
from the <span class="SpellE">talahib</span> along their path, brandishing a
bayonet at them (p. 17, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., August 5, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Elena Garcia ran away (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., August 30, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Maycong</span>
descended on the '<span class="SpellE">pilapil</span>' to her left side and also
tried to run away (p. 18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., August 5, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span>
stumbled, as a result of which, <st1:city><st1:place>Orlando</st1:place></st1:city>
grabbed her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and </span>pinned her down
on the ground (Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He held her neck
with his right hand and held her breasts with the left hand and kissed her
right cheek (pp. 19, 20, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1976</st1:date>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fighting back, she kicked <st1:city><st1:place>Orlando</st1:place></st1:city>

away (p. 23, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., August 5, 1976).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not long after, the father of <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Maycong</span>, who was then
tending his farm from where he heard the shouts for help, arrived (Ibid).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having learned of the attempt made on the

(pp. 3-5, Solicitor's Brief) <span class="GramE">(Decision, p. 10, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant, in turn, claims that the filing of these two (2) criminal
accusations was motivated by revenge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that he and the complainant were sweethearts who were engaged to get
married.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He lived in the house of the
complainant for three (3) months where he was practically treated by the father
of the complainant, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Maycong</span>,
as a son-in-law helping in the farm work and in the daily chores in the
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the planned marriage did
not take place because the complainant's family wanted an ostentations ceremony
which he (defendant) could not afford.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As an alternative, defendant suggested to complainant that they elope
but the latter refused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
the defendant left the complainant and married another woman, a decision which
was allegedly resented by the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, defendant raises the defense of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is argued that at the time the incident
was allegedly committed, he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span><span class="SpellE">Paniqui</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span> harvesting <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">palay</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>with some other farm laborers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He maintained that he worked there from <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6 oâ€™clock</st1:time> in the morning to past <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The foregoing testimony of the defendant was
corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sudaria</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayabyab</span>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court convicted the defendant of the two
(2) offenses charged in the two (2) separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
and sentenced him as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the accused Orlando <span class="SpellE">Primero</span>

Illegal Possession of a Deadly Weapon, punishable under PD 9, he is further
sentenced to a prison term of TEN (10) YEARS which is the maximum term imposed
by the law, with costs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"The bayonet, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>

according to law." (p. 12, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, affirming the judgment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the lower court, <span class="GramE">We</span> hereby sentence the defendant to

ordered confiscated in favor of the government." (pp. 15-16, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The respondent Court erred in its nonÂ­-consideration of the defense
of alibi interposed by the defendant.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">After
a careful perusal of the entire record of this case, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find no cogent reason </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">disturb
the findings of the respondent Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">With regard to the issue
of credibility, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot acquiesce with the argument
raised by the petitioner that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses,
being close relatives (father and niece) of the complainant, should not be
given weight and should be considered biased and self-serving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be </span>it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">remembered that mere relations cannot militate against the credibility
of a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither could it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">distort </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the testimony due from such witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In point is the ruling in the case </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">People v. <span class="SpellE">Libed</span> reported in 14 SCRA 410:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The fact alone of relationship to the victim does not destroy
a witness' credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not to be
lightly supposed that the relatives of the deceased would callously violate
their conscience xxx by blaming it on persons whom they know to be innocent
thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In this regard, it </span>is
relevant to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">restate herein that the </span>trial
court, which had the opportunity of observing the demeanor and deportment of
the witnesses, found the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses to have the
hallmarks of truth and credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, the trial court pertinently observed:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court is inclined to believe the claim of the
complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Angelita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maycong</span>, her father <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Maycong</span>, and her companion Elena Garcia, appear to be
credible witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They impressed the
Court as being innocent farm folks, a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">nd
</span>while appearance may be deceiving, their story is not incredible and was
entirely believable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being an unmarried woman
and in the prime of her <span class="SpellE">maindenhood</span> (she was 25 years
of age when she testified on <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="8">August 5,
 1976</st1:date>), what reason would <span class="SpellE">Angelita</span> have
for unnecessarily exposing herself if indeed the story of the accused violating
her honor was not true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her story was
corroborated in material aspects by the two other witnesses, her companion
Elena Garcia and her father <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Maycong</span>." (Decision, p. 12, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, it need not be emphasized that the trial court's
finding that the testimonies of the witnesses were reliable, being supported by
evidence of record, should be given credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, on matters of credibility the findings of the trial court are
accorded the highest respect (People v. <span class="SpellE">Cabanit</span>, 139
SCRA 94; People v. Jones, 137 SCRA 166; People v. <span class="SpellE">Canamo</span>,
138 SCRA 141; People v. Pasco, Jr., 137 SCRA, <span class="SpellE">Guita</span>
v. CA, 139 SCRA 576).</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue, <span class="GramE">We</span> regret to say
that the same is bereft of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
worth noting that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
respondent Court's decision makes mention of violation by the petitioner of
P.D. No. 9 for which he was sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of five (5)
years as minimum to ten (10) years as maximum, and wherein the bayonet was
ordered confiscated in favor of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It goes without saying that the Court of Appeals would not have
sustained the trial court's finding of petitioner's guilt as to the charge of
illegal possession of deadly weapon were it not convinced that a bayonet is a
"bladed, pointed or blunt weapon" decreed unlawful under P.D. No. 9.</p>

<p class="BODY">It can not be disputed that, ordinarily, the enumeration of
specified matters in a statute is construed as an exclusion of matters not
enumerated unless a different intention appears.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the maxim <span class="SpellE"><u>expressio</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>unius</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>est</u></span></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>eclusio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>alterius</u></span>
is only an auxiliary rule of statutory construction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not of universal application - neither
is it conclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be applied
only as a means of discovering legislative intent which is not otherwise
manifest and should not be permitted to defeat the plainly indicated purpose of
the legislature (Statutory Construction, Martin, sixth edition, 1984, pp.
71-72).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where a statute appears on its
face to limit the operation of its provisions to particular persons or things
by enumerating them, but no reason exists why other xxx things not so
enumerated should not have been included, and manifest injustice will follow by
not so including them, the maxim <span class="SpellE"><u>expressio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>unius</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>est</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>exclusio</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>alterius</u></span>
should not be invoked (Ibid, p. 79).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Applying the same in the instant case, it cannot be convincingly argued
that a bayonet is not a bladed, pointed or blunt weapon, possession of which
outside of one's residence is decreed by P.D. No. 9 to be illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True enough, if the carrying outside one's
residence of such weapons as fan knife, "<span class="SpellE">balisong</span>"
or club, which are less deadly than the bayonet, are prohibited under the law,
there is no logical reason why the bayonet should be exempted from the
prohibition.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as regards the defense of alibi, not only is it a weak
defense but also it cannot prevail over the positive identification of the
accused and by credible prosecution witnesses (People. v. <span class="SpellE">Obenque</span>,
147 SCRA 448; People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacada</span>, Jr., 142 SCRA 427,
People v. <span class="SpellE">Canturia</span>, 139 SCRA 280).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, defendant failed to prove that it
was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the incident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the decision appealed from
