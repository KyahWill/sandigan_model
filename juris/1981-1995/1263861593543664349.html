<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU
filed a petition for certification election with the Bureau of Labor Relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1987</st1:date>,
a group led by the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU picketed the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
office of petitioner at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner learned that
the said group consisted of slum dwellers and employees dismissed as early as
January, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the morning of the same day, Atty. Domingo Reyes, a conciliator from the
Department of Labor and Employment arrived at the office of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He informed the management that a Notice of
Strike was filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">by </span>the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In a </span>conference
organized by the conciliator and attended by the officers of petitioner, the
SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU demanded the reinstatement of the
dismissed employees of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the conference was going on, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU </span>picket
continued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As there was no settlement,
the group became unruly and started to harass petitioner's customers and other
employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner sought relief in
court. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In due time, the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU was ordered to desist from committing acts of
grave threats, grave coercion and disturbance of the peace, and from
barricading the business establishment of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After arrests were made, there was a lull.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1987</st1:date>,
the same group led by the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU picketed
the <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> office of
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the same acts of
harassment had been committed in the picket line, petitioner sought police
intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1987</st1:date>,
petitioner was furnished a copy of the notice setting the initial hearing of
the petition for certification election, as well as the petition for direct
certification filed by the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU, docketed
as Med-ARB Case No. R05-41-87 and now BLR Case No. A-6-205-87.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="20" month="4">April 20, 1987</st1:date>,
petitioner filed an "Answer With Motion To Dismiss the Petition For Direct
Certification" on the ground that the petition has no legal and factual
basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1987</st1:date>,
the Med-Arbiter dismissed the Petition for Direct Certification on the ground
that the same had been filed before the sixty-day freedom period.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
On <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1987</st1:date>, the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU interposed an appeal to the Bureau of Labor
Relations, and on <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1987</st1:date>,
the BLR Director penned the questioned decision in BLR Case No.
A-6-205-87.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the record clearly shows that both the ALCEE
and the LEA are duly registered unions of petitioner's employees in its two
separate offices, one at <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>the other at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The certificates of registration of both
unions appear to be authentic even considering that both unions were organized
and registered on the same date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of strong evidence to the contrary, both ALCEE and LEA must be
considered registered unions representing the employees of petitioner in two
separate offices.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, there is no denying that two separate collective
bargaining agreements were entered into between petitioner and the ALCEE on one
hand, and between petitioner and the LEA on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both agreements were to be in force until <st1:date year="1989" day="1" month="12">December 1, 1989</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, notwithstanding the observation of
public respondent that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">certificates
o</span>f registration were executed on the same dates thus casting doubt on
their authenticity, it appears that the two collective bargaining agreements
are notarized documents bearing the certifications of ratification and the
signatures of the ratifying employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The authenticity of both collective bargaining agreements must be
sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Examining the Petition for Direct Certification filed by the
SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU, it clearly appears that only
fourteen supposed employees of petitioner signed it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner contends, and this was never <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU, that those signatories are
dismissed employees of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
also appears that the said petition was filed before the sixty-day freedom
period prior to the expiration of the said collective bargaining agreements.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law is explicit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
petition filed before or after the sixty-day freedom period shall be dismissed
outright.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What could be immediately perceived in this case is that
notwithstanding the existence of two legitimate labor unions (ALCEE and LEA)
representing the employees of petitioner, and despite the existence of two
collective bargaining agreements as ratified by an overwhelming majority of the
said employees, the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU pretended to
represent the employees of petitioner by committing illegal acts of picketing and
by filing a petition for certification election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said petition had only fourteen
signatories and petitioner's contention that all of them were previously
dismissed employees was never <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">only </span>logical
conclusion is that the SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU had
questionable motives in filing the petition for certification election and in
resorting to illegal acts to coerce petitioner to allow it to intrude upon the
activities of two legitimate unions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
cannot agree with the perceptions of the public respondent who, without
supporting evidence, doubted the authenticity of the certificates of
registration of the two labor unions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Inasmuch as the authenticity of the certificates of registration has not
been successfully assailed, this Court cannot accept the gratuitous statement
of the public respondent that both unions are company unions, in the absence of
evidence to establish the imputation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The SMLCC-<span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>-KMU obviously does not
have any lawful basis in filing a petition for direct certification. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Indeed, by its coercive acts tending to harass
petitioner, it betrayed its motives to be far from sincere.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Decision of the Director of the Bureau of
Labor Relations dated <st1:date year="1987" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1987</st1:date>
in BLR Case No. A-6-205-87 is hereby SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The petition for certification election filed by the private respondent
is hereby DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
