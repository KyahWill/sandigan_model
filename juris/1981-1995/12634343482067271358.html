court's denial of a petition for relief from judgment, validly amend or modify
the decision sought to be overturned by such petition?</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the basic issue which confronts this Court in the instant
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Stripped of unnecessary details, the facts of this case, as
gathered from the pleadings, are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the dishonor of five (5) checks with a total value of
P52,800.00 which private respondent issued in favor of the petitioner after the
former failed to deliver 2,500 cavans of palay deposited with him by the latter
or pay the amount of P54,000.00 representing the value thereof, and to comply
with the obligation in respect to the set of earrings and a diamond ring
delivered by the petitioner's wife on 20 May 1964, petitioner instituted two
(2) criminal cases for estafa and filed an independent civil action for a sum
of money with preliminary attachment against the private respondent before the
then Court of First Instance (now Regional Trial Court) of Manila.  The latter was docketed as Civil Case No.
94781 and was assigned to Branch 26 thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 8 December 1965, private respondent executed a document

<p class="BODY">On 27 May 1975, petitioner filed an Amended Complaint which makes
specific reference to this so-called Compromise Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 August 1979, the trial court issued an order declaring the
private respondent "as in default" for his failure to appear at the
pre-trial and allowing the petitioner to present his evidence <i>ex-parte</i>.  The latter offered in evidence the
"Compromise Agreement", which was marked as Exhibit “L”.<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

that the interest shall be reckoned from 4 January 1966 pursuant to the
so-called Compromise Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 October 1980, the trial court issued a writ of
execution.  Private respondent filed a
petition for relief from judgment which, however, was denied.  He then filed a motion to reconsider the
said denial which was also subsequently denied.  A copy of this last denial order was received by the private
respondent on 1 March 1983.  The
following day, private respondent filed a notice of appeal.  On 2 August 1984, the trial court elevated
the records of the case to the respondent Court of Appeals.  The case was docketed therein as C.A.-G.R.

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court correctly resolved the first four (4) issues
explicitly against the private respondent.  More specifically, anent the second issue, it declared:</p>

<blockquote>"This brings us to the second issue:  whether or not a Petition for Relief is an available remedy.  Under Rule 38 of the Rules of Court, a
petition for relief from judgment ‘must be accompanied with affidavit showing
the fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence relied upon, and the facts
constituting the petitioner's good and substantial cause of action or defense,
as the case may be’.  Said grounds must
be<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>established in order to be
convincing.  The alleged excusable
negligence, accident or mistake relied upon by defendant-appellant could have
been avoided with ordinary prudence.  The alleged fraud could not have been committed by plaintiff-appellee
through mere inaction since he is not duty bound to personally notify the
defendant of court processes.  It is not
incumbent upon him to search for the address of defendant so that the latter
may be properly notified by the Court.  This is not the kind of fraud contemplated by law.  Bad faith cannot be presumed from inaction
where there is no duty to act.  The
grounds not having been clearly established, petition for relief will not
lie."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the fifth issue, the appellate court, amended the
dispositive portion of the decision appealed from by declaring that the
interest should run only from the date of the filing of the Amended
Complaint.  In support thereof, it made
the following disquisitions:</p>

<blockquote>"Finally, on the question of the validity of the award of
damages and attorney's fees, defendant-appellant further challenged the
amendment of the decision of October 31, 1979 adjusting the date for computing
the legal interest to start from January 4, 1966 instead of July 24, 1974, as
per original decision.  The rule is,
where a party has been declared in default, the amount of damages that should
be adjudged against him cannot exceed the amount alleged in the complaint even
if the complainants are able to prove during the reception of evidence a higher
amount of damages.  (Mario vs. Gaddi,
L-30860, March 29, 1972).  It appears in
this case that the amount of damages awarded is in accordance with the relief
prayed for in the Amended Complaint except that the legal interest should be
computed from the date of the filing of the Complaint, which is from May 27,
1975.  It would be different if the
defendant is not in default, plaintiff may be granted any relief that is
supported by the evidence, although not specified in his pleadings.  As to the propriety of the award of
attorney's fees, since plaintiff-appellee was compelled to litigate in order to
protect his interest, the Court<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> correctly granted the
relief as prayed for."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals decreed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing considerations, the
decision of the Court <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <u>quo</u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">, </span>being substantially in accordance with law, is hereby affirmed
with slight modification to reflect the date of computing the legal interest to
be from May 27, 1975, the date of filing the amended complaint.  Costs against defendant-appellant.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On 3 October 1989, petitioner filed a petition for relief (which
should have been, more appropriately, a motion for reconsideration) from
judgment to set aside the aforementioned modification decreed by the respondent
Court of Appeals on the ground that since the trial court's decision was
already final, it could no longer be amended.  It was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">only </span>on 18 April
1990 that the respondent Court promulgated a Resolution<a style="mso-footnote-id:

denying the said petition on the ground that the interest could not run from 4
January 1966 because the private respondent had not incurred in delay, there
being no proof of extrajudicial demand.  Under the first paragraph of Article 1169 of the Civil Code, the debtor
incurs in delay from the time the creditor judicially or extrajudicially
demands the fulfillment of the obligation.  In the absence of proof of extrajudicial demand, the date of the filing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>the amended complaint based on the
so-called Compromise Agreement, which was 27 May 1975, shall be the date
wherefrom computation of interest shall commence.<span style="font-size:11.0pt;

mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is so much circuitry in these assigned errors.  It is obvious that the petitioner does not
have a full understanding of a compromise agreement and a judgment based
thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the private respondent signed on 18 December 1975 is not a
compromise agreement although it is captioned as such.<span style="font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A compromise is a contract whereby the parties, by making
reciprocal concessions, avoid a litigation or put an end to one already
commenced.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It is "an agreement between two or more persons, who, for preventing or
putting an end to a lawsuit, adjust their difficulties by mutual consent in the
manner which they agree on, and which everyone of them prefers to the hope of
gaining, balanced by the danger of losing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> The
so-called Compromise Agreement sought neither to avoid litigation nor
explicitly put an end to the cases already commenced between the parties.  Since it was only the private respondent who
signed the agreement, it may not be considered a bilateral contract.  Rather, it is but a mere promise to pay
P66,500.00 on or before 4 January 1966 as a step towards the amicable
settlement of the case.  It does not, by
itself, settle the case or put an end to it.  It contemplates the execution of a formal act after payment shall have
been made.</p>

<p class="BODY">The parties did not submit any separate compromise agreement for
approval by the court.  What the court
received was the evidence for the petitioner which included the so-called
"compromise agreement" (marked as Exhibit "L"); judgment
was rendered on the basis of such evidence as thus adduced.  It is precisely for this reason that the
trial court awarded attorney's fees and ordered the private respondent to pay
interest plus the costs of the suit.<span style="font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, no judgment based on a compromise agreement was rendered
by the trial court.  The doctrine relied
on by the petitioner and underscored by numerous case citations -- that a
compromise agreement constitutes the law between the parties and that a
judgment based thereon is immediately final and executory -- is unfortunately
inapplicable in this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the mind of this Court, the real issue is whether or not the
respondent Court, having sustained -- and correctly -- the trial court's denial
of the private respondent's petition for relief from judgment, could, at the
same time, modify the decision sought to be overturned by such a petition.  The answer is in the negative.  The filing of the petition for relief from
judgment with the trial court was an unequivocal admission on the private
respondent's part that his period to appeal from the decision had already
expired.  Such was the incontrovertible
fact; besides, a petition for relief from judgment under Rule 38 of the Rules
of Court presupposes a final judgment<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> or
loss of the right to appeal.  The
affirmance by the respondent Court of the denial of the petition is a
confirmation of the existence of a final and executory judgment.  It can neither amend nor modify it.  "[N]othing is more settled in the law
than that when a final judgment becomes executory, it thereby becomes immutable
and unalterable.  The judgment may no
longer be modified in any respect, even if the modification is meant to correct
what is perceived to be an erroneous conclusion of fact or law, and regardless
of whether the modification is attempted to be made by the Court rendering it
or by the highest Court of the land.  The only recognized exceptions are the correction of clerical errors or
the making of so-called <i><u>nunc</u></i> <i><u>pro</u></i> <i><u>tunc</u></i>
entries which cause no prejudice to any party, and, of course, where the
judgment is void."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Court may have had in mind the second paragraph of Section 2 of Rule
41 which allows a party who appeals from an order denying a petition for relief
to assail the judgment on the merits on the ground that the same is not
supported by the evidence or is contrary to law.  Said section provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2.  <i>Judgments
or orders subject to appeal.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>A judgment denying relief under Rule 38 is subject to appeal, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in </span>the course thereof, a party may
also assail the judgment on the merits, upon the ground that it is not
supported by the evidence or it is contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">This provision, however, cannot be
construed as allowing a review of the decision on the specific ground therein
indicated if the denial of the petition for relief by the trial court is
sustained by the appellate court.  It
may only be done if the appellate court overturns such denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court then erred in modifying the decision of the
trial court.  Having sustained the trial
court's denial of the petition for relief filed under Rule 38 of the Rules of
Court, it had nothing more to do save to dismiss the appeal and make a
pronouncement that the decision of the trial court had long become firm, final
and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for the reason abovestated, the petition is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">GRANTED.  </span>That portion of the challenged decision of the respondent Court
