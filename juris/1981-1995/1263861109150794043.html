petitioner's husband, <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Vano</span>
is compensable under the Employees' Compensation Law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Vano</span>
was a letter carrier of the Bureau of Posts in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="7">July
 31, 1983</st1:date>, a Sunday, at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30
 p.m.</st1:time> <span class="SpellE">Vano</span> was driving his motorcycle with
his son as <span class="SpellE">backrider</span> allegedly on his way to his
station in <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span> for his work the following day,
Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As they were approaching <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Hinawanan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Loay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>,
the motorcycle skidded, causing its passengers to be thrown overboard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Vano's</span> head hit the
bridge's railing which rendered him unconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was taken to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Engelwood</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was declared dead on arrival due to severe hemorrhage.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Vano’s</span> widow, <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vano</span>, filed a death benefit claim under PD 626, <span class="GramE">as</span> amended, with the Government Service Insurance System
(GSIS).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1984</st1:date>, the GSIS denied the claim, citing the
following reason:</p>

<blockquote>“It appears on record
that your husband was on his way to his station when he died in a vehicular
accident he figured in a <st1:date year="1983" day="31" month="7">Sunday, July
 31, 1983</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Obviously, the
accident occurred outside of his time and place of work; neither was he
performing official duties at the time of its occurrence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the conditions for
compensability in accordance with the law have not been satisfied, to wit:<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">'1<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that</span> the employee must have been
injured at the place where his work requires him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">to be;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">'2<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that</span> the employee must have been
performing his offi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">cial functions; and</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">‘3<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>if</span> the injury is sustained elsewhere,
the employee must have been executing an order for his employer.” <span class="GramE">(p. 22, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vano's</span>
requests for reconsideration were denied by the <span class="GramE">GSIS,</span>
consequently, the case was elevated to the Employees' Compensation Commission
(ECC) for appropriate review under ECC Case No. 2658.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>a Decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1987</st1:date>, the ECC affirmed
the decision denying the claim of <span class="SpellE">Crispina</span> <span class="SpellE">Vano</span> because:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Under the employees' Compensation law, <span class="GramE">injuries
resulting from accidents while an employee is going to and from the place of
work is</span> not compensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Some
exceptions, however, are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>when the
injury is sustained at a place proximate to the work-place, when the employee
meets the accident while riding in a company vehicle and when he is on special
errand for his employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Section 1,
Rule III of the Amended Rules on Employees' Compensation)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"We note that the case at bar does not fall under any of the
foregoing exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the
subject employee's accident happened on a Sunday, a non-working day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the light of the foregoing, we cannot but
affirm respondent's denial of the claim." (pp. 13-15, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>;
p. 2, Decision, ECC Case No. 2658)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner then came to this Court on a petition for review
on <span class="GramE"><i>certiorari</i></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She alleges that since her husband was precisely commuting from his
hometown to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, where he would report for
duty as letter carrier the following day, when he met the accident, then his
consequent death should be compensated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Government Service Insurance System (GSIS)
reiterates its views and contends that the present provision of law on
employment injury is different from that provided in the old Workmen's
Compensation Act and is "categorical in that the injury must have been
sustained at work while at the workplace or elsewhere while executing an order
from the employer." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 69)</p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, the respondent Employees' Compensation Commission
stood firm in asserting that the death of <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Vano</span> is not the result of an employment accident as
contemplated by law hence petitioner is clearly not entitled to her claim for
death benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The case of <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Torbela</span> vs. Employees'
Compensation Commission (96 SCRA 260, 263, 264) supports petitioner's
contention of compensability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
said case, this Court held:</p>

<p class="2Q">"It is a fact that Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Torbela</span>,
Sr. died on March 3, 1975 at about 5:45 o'clock in the morning due to injuries
sustained by him in a vehicular accident while he was on his way to school from
<span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City, where he lived, to <span class="SpellE">Hinigaran</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental where the school of which he was
the principal was located and that at the time of the accident he had in his
possession official papers he allegedly worked on in his residence on the eve
of his death.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"The claim is compensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When an employee is accidentally injured at a point reasonably proximate
to the place of work, while he is going to and from his work, such injury is
deemed to have arisen out of and in the course of his employment."</p>

<p class="BODY">The same ruling was reiterated in the more recent case of <span class="SpellE">Alano</span> vs. Employees' Compensation Commission (158 SCRA,
669, 672):</p>

<p class="2Q">"In this case, it is not disputed that the deceased died while
going to her place of work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was at
the place where, as the petitioner puts it, her job necessarily required her to
be if she was to reach her place of work on time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was nothing private or personal about
the school <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">principal's being at the
place of the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was there
because her employment required her to be there."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We see no reason to deviate from the foregoing rulings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like the deceased in these two (2)
aforementioned cases, it was established that petitioner's husband in the case
at bar was on his way to his place of work when he met the accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His death, therefore, is compensable under
the law as an employment accident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby SET ASIDE
and the Government Service Insurance System is ordered to pay petitioner the
sum of Twelve Thousand Pesos (P12,000.00)) as death benefit and the sum of One
Thousand Two Hundred Pesos (P1,200.00) as attorney's fees.</p>
