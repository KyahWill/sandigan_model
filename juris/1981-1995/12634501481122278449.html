should have notified him so that he could have assisted the plaintiff when the
document denomina­ted as "Motion and Manifestation" was heard and a
copy thereof could have been furnished him;</blockquote>

enter into the case because he was not a party thereto;</blockquote>

contents embodied in the Motion and Manifestation and was not represented by
her Counsel, it is evident that the order of the Honorable Court dated August
13, <span style="">1979 changing the nature of the
decision dated February 14, 1979 is null and void; This is so because the Court
has already lost its jurisdiction over the case much more so when it allowed

Honorable respondent Judge summoned the petitioner to appear before her for
conference and petitioner, accompanied by her daughter Manuela <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> went to the Court as directed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that conference the Honorable respondent
Judge has shown her inte­rest to amend the decision dated February 14, 1979 by
telling herein petitioner and her daughter that there is evidence that
respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
is entitled to one sixth of the property located in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bangar</span>, La Union and it would be better to give his
share to avoid court litigation, and in fact they are relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That herein petitioner and her daughter
countered that the said one sixth portion was already delivered to the mother
of petitioner while both were still alive in payment of an indebtedness
incurred by the mother of respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> and that the evidence of transfer covering the said
one sixth portion is in the possession of respondent Joaquin Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> who is more fortunate because he finished his
College Education, hence they could not accede to the proposal of respondent
Honorable Judge.</blockquote>

himself an employee of the Court where the Honorable respondent Judge is
holding session went to the house of the petitioner requesting the latter to
sign a prepared document but the latter refused to sign reasoning out that she
did not know about what she would sign and her lawyer was not present.</blockquote>

document, which was presented to her by the person who went to her residence,
after few days thereafter a subpoena was sent to petitioner requiring her to <span style="">appear before the Office of the Deputy Clerk
of Court, Manuel Luis <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> on August 10, 1979,
which provides, 'fail not under penalty of law.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person who served the said subpoena
warned the petitioner to comply with the subpoena, otherwise, she would be arrested,
and because of the warning, petitioner went to the Office of the Deputy Clerk
of Court even without her lawyer or any of her children because she had no
companion in the house and just went to the Court with maid and without being
accompanied by any of her children or her attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon her arrival in the Office of the Deputy
Clerk of Court, the latter brought out a document and told petitioner to sign
the same but the latter at first refused reasoning out that she did not know
what she was signing about and her lawyer was not present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, she could not read and see what
she was signing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told the petitioner
that she would just sign the document in order that her case <span class="GramE">be</span>
terminated and in fact it is for her advantage.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That petitioner insisted to the person who was requiring her to affix
her signature on the document that she could not see and yet she could not read
it, but he was told again that the contents thereof is for her own advantage
and then her hand was held and guided where to affix signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the

<blockquote>“(t)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That Atty. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
B. Bermudez, Counsel for the petitioner, questioned the Deputy Clerk of Court,
Manuel Luis <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span>, the person pointed to by the
petitioner who required her to sign the document which later on was found to be
the 'Manifestation and Motion' dated June 25, 1979 which was the basis of the
Honorable res­pondent Judge in issuing her Order dated August 13, 1979, and
asked him why he subpoenaed said petitioner to appear before the Court on
August 10, 1979 and did not inform her Counsel considering that she is
represented by Counsel, and why he ordered her to affix her signature on the
above mentioned document and telling her further that what she was signing does
not affect her right and interest and that she would do so only in order that
her case be finally terminated, said Court personnel said that the petitioner
voluntarily affixed her signature which was vehemently denied by the
latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Deputy Clerk of Court
informed Counsel for petitioner that it was the Honorable respondent Judge who
ordered him to prepare the Manifestation and Motion and to issue the subpoena
requiring petitioner to appear before the Court on <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1979</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(u)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That petitioner and her Counsel also conferred
with the Honorable respondent Judge why these things had happened considering
that the case was already finally decided and still allowed respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> who <span style="">was not a previous party to enter into the
case without previous Motion and notification to the Counsel for the
petitioner, and the Honorable respondent Judge, claimed that there is sufficient
proof that respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
owns one sixth of the property located in <span class="SpellE">Consuegra</span>
and therefore it is the obligation of the petitioner and respondent Joaquin
Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> to give the said portion to respondent
Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in order to
avoid expensive Court litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
truth however is that the portion will go to respondent Joaquin Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> who is really interested to get said portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent Judge also told Counsel, Atty.
<span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> B. Bermudez that the petitioner had
allegedly agreed voluntarily to give to respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
<span class="SpellE">Peña</span> her share on the said one sixth <span class="GramE">portion</span> and to which the petitioner had vehemently denied. <span class="GramE">"(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 8-12.)</span></span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the respondent Judge to the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They all freely conferred among themselves later as the respondent Judge

in paragraphs O and p which states 'that few days thereafter, a person who
claimed himself an employee of the Court where the Honorable respondent Judge
is holding session went to the house of the petitioner requesting the latter to
sign a prepared document but the latter refused to sign reasoning out that she
did not know about what she would sign and her lawyer was not present; that
when the petitioner <span style="">did not sign the
document, which was presented to her by the person who went to her residence,
after few days thereafter a subpoena was sent to petitioner requiring her to
appear before the Office of the Deputy Clerk of Court, Manuel Luis <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> on August 10, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person who served the said subpoena
warned the petitioner to comply with the subpoena, otherwise, she would be
arrested, and because of the warning, petitioner went to the office of the
Deputy Clerk of Court even without her lawyer or any of her children because
she had no companion in the house and just went to the Court with maid and without
being accompanied by any of her children or her attorney.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon her arrival in the Office of the Deputy
Clerk of Court, the latter brought out a document and told petitioner to sign
the same but the latter at first refused reasoning out that she did not know
what she was signing about and her lawyer was not present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, she could not read and see what
she was signing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told the petitioner
that she would just sign the document in order that her case be terminated and
in fact it for her advantage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
petitioner insisted to the person who was requiring her to affix her signature
on the document that she could not see and yet she could not read it, but he
was told again that the contents thereof is for her own advantage and then her
hand was held and guided where to affix her signature.' Same allegations were
contained in their Verified Memorandum for the Plaintiff filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> B. Bermudez, counsel for
plaintiff-petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As alleged
therefore in said verified memorandum, the Court in view of the imputations or
irregularities committed by an employee of the Court enforcing the
plaintiff-petitioner to sign the Motion and Manifestation made her own investigation
regarding said circumstances and it turned out that said allegations and
imputations were not true and correct.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Confrontations were made with the Deputy Clerk of Court as well as the
employees of this Court regarding these imputations and the confrontations
showed that said imputations were a result of one's fertile imagination to suit
their purpose.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The allegation that a subpoena was sent to
plaintiff-petitioner to appear before the Court on <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1979</st1:date> is not a true information
regarding this matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in their
Annex "N", the sub­poena was addressed to both the
plaintiff-petitioner Regina Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcaritara</span>
and defendant?<span style="">respondent Joaquin

is therefore very clear that it is not only the presence of the
plaintiff-petitioner which was needed in the office but also that of the
defendant respondent Joaquin Sta. <span class="SpellE">Romana</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the purpose of said subpoena was only to
seek the signature of the plaintiff-petitioner and to force her into signing
the Motion and Manifestation, then it would appear illogical for the
defendant-respondent to be present on same date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is therefore manifest that the purpose of
calling both parties to appear in the office of the Deputy Clerk of Court was
in the desire to ultimately bring the parties to reconcile them as being
brother and sister and a cousin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since
there was no showing of animosity and discord among the parties with respect to
the motion and manifestation filed by <span class="SpellE">movant</span> Jose de
la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>, the Court issued an order approving the
motion and manifestation on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="8"><span style="">August 13, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of the fact that Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> is not a party to Civil Case No. 165-V, is of the
belief that there is no necessity of making respondent Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> a party to said civil case when both the

<p class="BODY">The version of the respondents is open to serious doubts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one thing, if the petitioner had in fact
voluntarily given her conformity to the Motion and Manifestation of Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> on <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="6">June 25,
 1979</st1:date>, why was it still necessary to subpoena the petitioner to
appear before the respondent judge on <st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="8">August
 10, 1979</st1:date>, for a conference?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the risk of repetition this is what happened on <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1979</st1:date> according to the respondent judge:</p>

<blockquote>"Since both the plaintiff-petitioner and defendant-respondent
were present, the respondent Judge called both of them and Jose de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> in her chamber for conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the conference the respondent Judge

<p class="BODY">And this is her explanation with respect to the subpoena:</p>

<blockquote>"It is therefore manifest that the purpose of calling both
parties to appear in the office of the Deputy Clerk of Court was in the desire
to ultimately bring the parties to reconcile them as being brother and sister
and a cousin."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We also note the undue haste in issuing a writ of execution to
enforce the Order of <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1979</st1:date>;
the writ was issued the following day without the benefit of a motion for its
issuance.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, as stated above, whichever version we accept, we have to
grant the petition and annul the orders of the respondent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Order of <st1:date year="1979" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1979</st1:date>, which was served on the parties on the same day had the
effect of a judgment which became final thirty (30) days thereafter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, when the respondent judge issued
the Order of <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1979</st1:date>,
which has the effect of modifying the previous order she was without
jurisdiction to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it
passes understanding why the respondent judge allowed respondent Jose<span style=""> de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> to file
a Motion and Manifestation when he was never </span>a party to the case which
had already been decided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it
was highly improper for the respondent judge to act on a paper supposedly
signed by the petitioner and which affected her rights when she was not
assisted by her counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
judge also deserves to be censured for her delay of more than six (6) months in
resolving the motion to set aside her Order of <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1979</st1:date>.</p>
