				<H3>JOSE O. TEODORO AND ESPARANZA ZACARIAS, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. GUILLERMO CARAGUE, AS INCUMBENT SECRETARY OF BUDGET AND MANAGEMENT AND MESSRS. ALBERTO ROMULO AND MANUEL ALBA, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Jose O. T<span style="">eodoro
</span>retired effective March 14, 1977 from the Philippine Foreign <span style="">Service </span>with the rank of Ambassador
under Rep. Act 1616.  At the time of his
retirement, his highest basic salary received was P29,866.00 per annum or
P2,488.83 per month.  Per leave credits
computation by the Office of the Personnel and Management Services of the then
Ministry (now Department of Foreign Affairs), he earned in the c<span style="">ourse of his about 31 </span><span style="">years of service in the</span><span style=""> </span>government a total of 285.96 working
days of unenjoyed leaves--275.082 days of which were earned abroad and the
remaining 10.834 days in the Home Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, petitioner Esperanza Zacarias retired from
the Foreign Service with the rank of Career Minister, effective June 20,
1980.  Her highest basic salary on the
date of her retirement was P3,112.00 per month.  Per computation by the Office of the Personnel and Management of
the then Ministry of Foreign Affairs she earned unenjoyed vacation leave
credits of 319.667 days and sick leave credits of 660.661 days, or a total of
980.328 days.  However, under the
Foreign Service Act (RA No. 708, as amended) and its implementing regulations,
she was entitled only to a maximum of 120 days vacation leave and 240 days sick
leave, or a total of 360 days leave, thereby forfeiting the excess of 620
days.  In the computation of the
compensable unused leave credits of petitioner Zacarias by the then Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, it was admitted and accepted that all her leave credits of 360
working days were earned abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since petitioner Teodoro retired in 1977, payment of his unspent
accumulated leave credits of 275.082 days earned abroad was computed in
accordance with applicable rules and regulations existing prior to the
effectivity on January 1, 1978 of Presidential Decree No. 1285, which
retirement unspent accumulated leave credits were payable in US dollars at the <u>exchange</u>
<u>rate</u> <u>of</u> <u>P2.00</u> <u>to</u> <u>US$1.00</u>.<span style="font-size: 33pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">So with that of the unenjoyed accumulated leave credits of
petitioner Zacarias, who, albeit retired effective June 20, 1980, had earned
the first 120 days of her unspent vacation leave credits and first 240 days of
her unused sick leave credits prior to January 1, 1978.<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, per computation by the Office of the Personnel and
Management Services of the then Ministry of Foreign Affairs, petitioner Teodoro
was entitled to US$15,000.00 for his 275.082 working days of unused leave
credits earned abroad.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent petitioner Zacarias’ petition, her 360 working days of
unused earned leave credits, computed at the exchange rate of P2.00 to US
$1.00, entitled her to a total leave pay of US$27,326.02.  But since she had already received from the
Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco, California the sum of US$16,327.22,
the same as deducted therefrom.  Upon
the other hand, the sum of US$2,899.10, which was deducted from said previous
payment as trust deposit, ought to be refunded and added to her total unpaid
leave pay, netting her the sum of US$13,846.90.</p>

<p class="BODY">The then Ministry of Foreign Affairs, referred both claims for <span style="">appropriate </span>action to the Commission
on <span style="">Audit, </span>which concurred with
the Ministry's <span style="">computations and passed
in audit petitioners' claims.  This was
relayed </span>in <span style="">a 1st Indorsement
dated July 30, 1984 to the Commission's resident Auditor at the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Informed of the action taken by the Commission on Audit, then
Foreign Minister Arturo Tolentino wrote the respondent Budget Minister
informing the latter that the Ministry "will pay the terminal leave
benefits of Mr. Teodoro and Miss Zacarias in U.S. dollars at the exchange rate
of P2.00 to $1.00".  Accordingly,
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested the release of P429, 558.00 to cover
the payments of petitioners’ terminal leave benefits, as converted to
Philippine pesos in accordance with the exchange rate at the time of payments
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the respondent Budget Minister denied the request and,
instead, released the amount of only P123,416.66 on the ground that under
Foreign Ministry--<span style="">Budget Ministry Order
No. 30-83 dated December 1, 1983, payments of petitioners’ claims for terminal
leave pay shall in Philippine pesos to be converted at the rate of exchange
prevailing at the time of retirement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved, herein petitioners filed before this Court a Petition
for Writ of <i>Mandamus</i> and Damages to compel then respondent Budget
Minister Manuel Alba to release to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs the sum of
P306,141 for payment of the balance due the petitioners on their respective
claims for terminal leave pay, docketed as G.R. No. 70242.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, this Court, in its Resolution promulgated on March 26,
1987, dismissed the aforesaid petition.  Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration and a <span style="">second Motion for Reconsideration of the
aforementioned Resolution, but both motions were denied in the Resolutions of
September 10, 1987 and November 12, 1987, respectively.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">About three (3) years after receipt on December 2, 1987 of the
aforesaid Resolution denying their Second Motion for Reconsideration,
petitioners filed on November 20, 1990 with this Court the instant Petition for
Review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition seeks to annul the Court's Resolutions dated
March 26, 1987, September 10, 1987 and November 12, 1987, all issued in G.R.
No. 70242 (Jose O. Teodoro and Esperanza Zacarias vs. Guillermo Carague as
Budget Minister), on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>a) Respondent Budget
Minister exceeded his jurisdiction and/or committed grave abuse of discretion
in denying the Minister of Foreign Affairs’ request for the release of the
amount covering petitioners' claims for terminal leave credits which was passed
in audit by the Commission on Audit; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) The disapproval
of the computations of petitioners’ claims for terminal leave credits in US
dollars at the exchange rate of P2.00 to US $1.00, is discriminatory since
other officers and employees of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs similarly
situated as petitioners were paid their <span style="">terminal
leave credits in accordance therewith.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The issues to resolve in this case are:</p>

<blockquote>a) Whether or not the grounds in support of the petition are
meritorious; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) If so, whether or not petitioners are entitled to the reliefs
demanded.<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We note that petitioners admit the decision in their case has
already long become final.  For all
intents and purposes, the instant case should ordinarily be already barred
since the old case, G.R. 70242 and the present case, G.R. 96004, have identity
of parties, subject matter, and cause of action.  For as we have already held, once a litigant's rights have been
adjudicated in a valid final judgment of a competent court, he should not be
granted an unbridled license to come back for another try (Santos vs.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 145 SCRA 238).</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering however the surrounding circumstances, We can temper
technical rules with substantive justice to grant the reliefs prayed for by the
petitioners <span style="">who </span>have devoted
long years of their lives to public service.  Rules of procedure are intended to promote, not to defeat substantial
justice, and therefore, they should not be applied in a very rigid and
technical sense (Calasiao Farmer's Cooperative Marketing Association, Inc. vs.
Court of Appeals, 106 SCRA 630).  Also,
it is within the inherent power and discretion of the Court to amend, modify or
reconsider a final judgment when “because of supervening events it becomes
imperative, in the higher interest of justice, to direct its modification in
order to harmonize the disposition with the prevailing circumstances, or
whenever it is necessary to accomplish the administration of justice."
(Galindez v. Rural Bank of Llanera, 175 SCRA 132 (1989]).  Besides no private individual will be
financially prejudiced should we overturn the final judgment in this case,
neither will the government be prejudiced because after all there is a price to
pay for the obtaining of distributive justice.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Some members of the Court, however, frown at the thought of
disregarding the principle of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> in the instant
case.  This frown is hopelessly
unrealistic, cruel, and verily most unkind.  Be it noted that this is not the first time in American or in Philippine
jurisprudence when the principle of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> has been set
aside in favor of substantial justice which is after all the avowed purpose of
all law and jurisprudence.  Thus, the
following are in point:<sub><o:p></o:p></sub></p>

<blockquote>"In this respect it has been declared that <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>,
as the embodiment of a public policy, must at times be weighed against
competing interests, and must, on occasion, yield to other policies.  The determination of the question is said to
require a compromise, in each case of the two opposing policies, of the
desirability of finality and the public interest in searching the right
result." (46 Am. Jur. pp. 402-403).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Underlying all discussion of the problem must be the
principle of fundamental fairness in the due process sense.  It has accordingly been adjudged that the
public policy underlying the principle of the <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> must
be considered together with <span style="">the policy
that a party shall not be deprived of a fair adversary proceeding in which to
present his case." (46 Am. Jur. </span><span style="">p. </span><span style="">403).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x <u>Res</u> <u>judicata</u> is to be disregarded if the
application would involve the sacrifice of justice to technicality." (159
SCRA 264, Republic v. De los Angeles).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming in <u>gratia</u> <u>argumenti</u> that the prior
judgment of dismissal with prejudice was validly rendered within the lawful
discretion of the court and could not be considered as an adjudication on the
merits, nonetheless the principle of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> should be
disregarded if its application would involve the sacrifice of justice to
technicality.  The application of the
said <span style="">principle, under the particular
facts obtaining, would amount to denial of justice and/or bar to a vindication
of a legitimate grievance." (Suarez vs. Court of Appeals, 193 SCRA 183
[1991].<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“It is rather too late in the day for petitioner to question now
the lack or excess of jurisdiction of the Appellate Court in rendering the said
decision on the alleged ground that said Court is precluded from reversing the
award of the lot on the ground of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.  It should be obvious to petitioner that the
defense of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> when not interposed either in a motion to
dismiss or in an answer is deemed waived." (Vergara vs. Ruque, 78 SCRA 312
[1977], citing Philippine Coal Miner's Union vs. CEPOC, 10 SCRA 784 [1964]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is axiomatic that for the doctrine of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
to apply, it is essential that the prior judgment, invoked as a bar to a
subsequent action or proceeding, be <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u> one on the
merits.  Equally perceptive is that if
the doctrine is not set up as a defense or ground of objection seasonably, it
is deemed waived; it cannot be asserted for the first time on appeal."
(Alvarez, Jr. vs. Court of Appeals, 158 SCRA 407<span style=""> [1988].<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The principle of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> should be
disregarded if its application would involve the sacrifice of justice to
technicality and/or a bar to <span style="">a v</span>indication
of a legitimate grievance." (Ronquillo vs. Marasigan, 5 SCRA 304, 312).<span style="font-size: 3pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The dispensation of justice and the vindication of legitimate
grievance should not be barred by technicalities." (Santiago vs. Ramirez,
8 SCRA 157).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Res</u> <u>judicata</u> <span style="">as a </span>defense is waived <span style="">when
not interposed </span>in <span style="">a </span><span style="">motion to dismiss or in an answer."
(Vergara vs. Roque, 78 SCRA 312).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Where <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> was raised as a defense only
in the motion for reconsideration, the same is already <span style="">deemed waived." (Pulido vs. Pulido, 117 SCRA 16).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"If <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> is not set up as a defense or
ground of objection seasonably it is deemed waived and cannot be assailed for
the first time on appeal." (Alvarez, Jr. <span style="">vs. </span>Court of Appeals, 158 SCRA 401).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Be it finally noted that if <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> is not set
up as a defense, it CANNOT be applied.  Clearly this would be a WAIVER.</p>

<p class="BODY">Going to the merits of the case, the then Minister of Budget
refused to release the amount represented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to
cover petitioners' claims for terminal leave credits, since they did not
conform with Joint Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Ministry of the Budget Order
No. 30-83 dated December 1, 1983, particularly Section 6 thereof, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 6.  The foreign
service portion of the terminal leave credits earned prior to 1 January 1978,
computed on the basis of highest salary received shall be converted to US
dollars at the rate of P2.00 to $1.00 pursuant to Department Order No. 35-67
dated 9 October 1967 and Sec<span style="">. 10 of
P.D. No. 1285, and <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>payable</u> <u>in</u> <u>Philippine</u>
<u>pesos</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>rate</u> <u>of</u> <u>exchange</u> <u>prevailing</u>
<u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>time</u> <u>of</u> <u>retirement</u>, resignation,
separation from the service or death." (Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Said Order which took effect on December
1, 1983 cannot apply retroactively to the claims of petitioners Teodoro and
Zacarias, who retired on March 14, 1977 and June 20, 1980, respectively.  The law applicable is Section 3 of Department
Order No. 35-67 dated October <span style="">9, 1967,
to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 3.  <u>Leave</u>
<u>credits</u>.  Upon application, the
money value of the leave credits earned abroad of any official, officer, or
employee who retires, resigns or dies while in the service <u>may</u> <u>be</u>
<u>paid</u> <u>to</u> <u>him</u> <u>in</u> <u>foreign</u> <u>currency</u> <u>at</u>
<u>the</u> <u>rate</u> <u>P2.00</u> <u>to</u> <u>$1.00</u>.  (Underscoring supplied).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It was not required that the foreign currency due the subject
officer or employee be paid to him in Philippine pesos to be converted at the
rate of exchange prevailing at the time of retirement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Section 10 of Presidential Decree No. 1285, which took
effect on January 13, 1978, provides:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 10.  <u>Accumulated</u>
<u>leaves</u>.  <span style="">Upon </span>retirement, death or separation from the service of any
officer or employee in the foreign service, unenjoyed vacation or sick leave
credits shall be computed on the basis of actual salary and shall be paid in
Philippine pesos and otherwise shall be on the same basis as home office
personnel who retire in the Philippines:  Provided, <u><span style="">That</span></u><span style=""> <u>any</u> <u>accumulated</u> <u>leaves</u> <u>earned</u>
<u>as</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>effectivity</u> <u>of</u> <u>this</u> <u>Decree</u>
<u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>paid</u> <u>to</u> <u>officers</u> <u>and</u> <u>employees</u>
<u>leaving</u> <u>the</u> <u>service</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>basis</u> <u>of</u>
<u>applicable</u> <u>rules</u> <u>and</u> <u>regulations</u> <u>existing</u> <u>prior</u>
<u>to</u> <u>this</u> <u>Decree</u>." (Underscoring supplied).</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As aptly observed by the Solicitor General:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Hence, to apply Joint Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Ministry
of the Budget Order No. 30-83 to accumulated leaves earned prior to the
effectivity of Presidential Decree No. 1285, would in effect be an amendment of
said Decree by the then Ministers of Foreign Affairs and Budget, which cannot
be countenanced."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Surely a law, such as Presidential Decree No. 1285 cannot be
amended by a simple Department Order.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, since other officers and employees of the then
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who were similarly situated as the petitioners,
were paid in Philippine pesos of the value in foreign currency of their
terminal leave credits earned abroad at the rate of exchange at the time of
payments thereof, then it will not only discriminate against but also cause
injustice to petitioners to be paid in Philippine pesos the money value in US
dollars of their terminal leave credits earned abroad at the rate of exchange
then prevailing at the time of their retirements.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>Premises considered</b>, the Court Resolved to ORDER
respondent Budget Secretary Carague to release to the Department of Foreign
Affairs the sum of P306,141.00 for the payment of the balance due petitioners
on their claims for terminal leave pay.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ROMERO, <i><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:</span></p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to dismiss the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues that confront the Court are the following:<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Whether the petitioners' unused leave credits earned abroad
should be paid at P2.00 to US$1.00, as provided in Section 10, P.D. 1285 and
Ministry of Foreign Affairs<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a>
Department Order No. 35-67 dated October 9, 1967 and whether the Minister of
Budget<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">**</span></span></a> was correct in using the rate of exchange
prevailing at the time of the retirement of the petitioners instead of at the
time of payment as petitioners would insist.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts that <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> has set in and the
Court, in its Resolution dated March 26, 1987, DISMISSED the earlier petition
docketed as G.R. No. 70242 for lack of merit; on September 10, 1987, DENIED
with FINALITY the motion for reconsideration; on February 9, 1989, DENIED the
second motion for reconsideration, on September 28, 1987, the Resolution of
March 26, 1987 became final and executory; and on March 9, 1989, the same was
recorded in the Book of Entries of Judgments are not open to question.  The Solicitor General admits that the case
has already long become final.  For all
intents and purposes, the instant case should ordinarily be already barred
since the old case, G.R. 70242 and the present case, G.R. 96004, have identity
of parties, subject matter, and cause<span style="">
of action.  For the Court has already
held, once a litigant's rights have been adjudicated in a valid final judgment </span><span style="">of </span>a competent court, <span style="">he should not be granted an unbridled license
to come back for another try.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I have legitimate reason for my apprehension that my colleagues, <span style="">in </span>reopening a final judgment in the
guise of tempering technical rules with substantive justice, have overthrown
the doctrine of the law of the case or, even worse, set into motion serious
budgetary complications because foreign service personnel who are similarly
situated would also have to be treated similarly, thus opening the floodgates
for administrative, as well as judicial claims for deficiency payments which
the Government may be in no position to make.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I also find quite strained the position and arguments <span style="">of the majority, to wit:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The then Minister of Budget refused to release the amount
represented by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to cover petitioners' claims for
terminal leave credits, since they did not conform with Joint Ministry of
Foreign Affairs - Ministry of the Budget Order No. 30-83 dated December 1,
1983, particularly Section 6 thereof, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Sec. 6. <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foreign
service portion of the terminal leave <span style="">credits
</span><span style="">earned prior to 1 January 1978,
computed on the basis of highest salary received shall be converted to US
dollars </span><span style="">at </span><span style="">the rate of P2.00 to $1.00 pursuant to
Department Order No. 35-67 dated 9 October 1967 and Sec. 10 of P.D. No. 1285,
and <u>shall be payable in Philippine pesos at the rate of exchange prevailing at
the time of retirement</u>, resignation, separation from the service or death.’
(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Said Order which took effect on December 1,
1983 cannot apply retroactively to the claims of petitioners Teodoro and
Zacarias, who retired on March 14, 1977 and June 20, 1980, respectively.  <span style="">The
law applicable is Section 3 of Department Order </span><span style="">No. </span><span style="">35-67 dated October
9, 1967, to wit:</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Section 3.   <u>Leave
credits</u>.  Upon application, the
money value of the leave credits earned abroad of any official, officer, or
employee who retires, resigns or dies while in the service <u>may be paid to
him in foreign </u><u><span style="">currency at the
rate of P2.00 to $1.00</span></u><span style="">.’ (Underscoring
supplied)</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It was not required that the foreign <span style="">currency </span>due the subject officer or employee be paid to him in
Philippine pesos to be converted at the <span style="">rate
of exchange prevailing at the time of retirement.</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, Section 10 of Presidential Decree No. 1285, which took
effect on January 13, 1978, provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Section 10.   <u>Accumulated
leaves</u>.  Upon retirement, death or
separation from the service of any officer or employee in the foreign service,
unenjoyed vacation or sick leave credits shall be computed on the basis of
actual salary and shall be paid in Philippine pesos and otherwise shall be on
the same basis as home office personnel who retire in the Philippines:  Provided, <u>That any accumulated leaves earned
as of the effectivity of this Decree may be paid to officers and employees
leaving the service on the basis of applicable rules and regulations existing
prior to this Decree</u><u><span style="">.</span></u><span style="">’ (Underscoring supplied.</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>As aptly observed by the Solicitor General:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'Hence, to apply Joint
Ministry of Foreign Affairs - Ministry of the Budget Order No. 30-83 to
accumulated leaves earned prior to the effectivity of Presidential Decree No.
1285, would in effect be an amendment of said Decree by the then Ministers of
Foreign Affairs and Budget, which cannot be countenanced.’</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Surely a <span style="">law, </span>such as
Presidential Decree No. <span style="">1285 cannot be
amended by a simple Department Order."</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">I am not persuaded.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">First:  The petitioners'
allegations do not find support in law <span style="">or
</span>jurisprudence.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The disallowed money value of petitioners' leave credits of
P306,141.00 in the requested amount <span style="">of </span>the
sum of P429,558.00 is due to the computation of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
at the prevailing exchange rate the time of payment (P20.00 to US$1.00), instead
of the prevailing foreign rate of exchange of P7.4285 to US1.00 as certified by
the Central Bank at the time of retirement <span style="">of Ambassador Teodoro and Ms. Zacarias, as prescribed under the Joint
Ministry Order No. 30-83 of the Office of the Budget </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">Management and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs dated December 1, 1983
based on Section 7, Presidential Decree No. 1285.</span><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of Presidential Decree No. 1285 reads:<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 7.   <u>Currency
conversion</u>.   - The basic salary of
foreign service personnel shall be paid in Philippine pesos or equivalent in <span style="">foreign currency at the Central Bank foreign
exchange conversion rate prevailing at the time of remittance.  Fluctuations in exchange rate shall be
compensated for through the overseas allowance established under this Decree <u>Retirement</u>
benefits, accumulated leaves and other similar privileges shall be paid to
foreign service personnel </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">pesos or equivalent in foreign </span><span style="">currency using </span><span style="">the prevailing Central Bank foreign exchange rate and subject to
applicable Central Bank rules and regulations in cases where foreign service personnel
retire abroad."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (Underscoring supplied) </span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, Section 6 of the Ministry Order No. 30-83
dated December 1, 1983 reads:<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section 6.   The
foreign service portion of the terminal leave credits <span style="">earned prior to 1 </span>January 1978, computed <span style="">on </span>the basis of highest salary received shall be converted to US
dollars at the rate of P2.00 to US$1.00 pursuant to <span style="">Department Order No. 35-67 dated 9 October 1967 and Section 10 of P.D.
No. 1285, and shall be payable in Philippine pesos at the rate of exchange
prevailing at the time of <u>retirement, resignation, </u></span><u><span style="">separation</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">from the service or
death."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> (Italics supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, under Ministry Order No. 30-83, the computation of the
terminal leave benefits of MFA personnel retiring from government service
earned prior to January 1, 1978 should be based on the <span style="">salary received and the resultant amount in dollar converted to
Philippine peso at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of retirement
considering that the <u>right to such benefit has become vested on petitioners
at the time of their retirement</u> from the government service, petitioner
Teodoro on March 14, 1977, and petitioner Zacarias on June 20, 1980.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Such statutory interpretation of Section 10, Presidential Decree
No. 1285 is in accordance with Article 1250 of the Civil Code which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Article 1250.  In case
an extraordinary inflation or deflation of the currency stipulated should
supervene, <u>the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the
obligation shall be the basis of payment unless there is an </u><u><span style="">agreement to the contrary</span></u><span style="">.  (Emphases supplied).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is <span style="">no </span>gainsaying
the fact that the basis of payment of petitioners' money value of their
terminal leave <span style="">pay </span>should be
fixed at the value of the currency at the time of the establishment of the
obligation -- which are the <span style="">respective
dates of retirement of petitioners because it is only then that the right to
collect the same from the government </span><span style="">as </span><span style="">employer becomes
vested.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II<span style="font-size: 2pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Second:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The respondent
Honorable Minister of Budget neither committed any grave abuse of discretion
nor acted <span style="">arbitrarily.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The authority of former Minister of Foreign Affairs Carlos P.
Romulo to issue MFA Order 30-83 is inherent in his power as Department Head to
promulgate rules to regulate the <span style="">internal
management of the agency he headed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the exercise of the above authority, MFA Order No. 30-83 was
issued to fill in the details of the manner of payment of the benefit under
P.D. 1285.  Thus, it provided that the
money value in dollars of terminal leaves shall be paid in Philippine pesos at
the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of retirement.  Clearly, there is nothing in MFA Order No.
30-83, which amended P.D. No. 1285.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only reason why petitioners may have felt short-changed by
MFA Order No. 30-83 is the fact that the rate of exchange as certified by the
Central Bank at the time of their retirement was P7.4825 per dollar whereas the
rate of exchange which may have prevailed at the time of payment increased to
P20.00 per dollar.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Third:  MFA Order No.
30-83 did not violate the equal protection clause.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners’ claim that MFA Order No. 30-83 violates the equal
protection and due process clauses of the Constitution is evidently baseless
because the provisions of MFA Order No. 30-83 apply to all those who are
similarly situated and did not single out the herein petitioners.<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even the cases of the other retirees cited by petitioners in the
instant Motion for Reconsideration, i.e., Ambassador A. Yango, Jose Abad,
Virginia B. Mendoza, Estelita B. Lozada and Felina Sta. Romana (Annexes A-E)
would show that the money value of their leave credits earned abroad were also
multiplied by the prevailing rates of exchange at the time of their retirement
to wit:   Ambassador Yango at P18.50;

Justice Edgardo Paras, the ponente of the majority opinion himself,
categorically postulated that the doctrine of the "Law of the Case"
which states that whatever has once been irrevocably established as the
controlling legal rule of decision between the same parties in the same case
continues to be the law <span style="">of </span>the
case, <u>whether correct </u><u><span style="">on </span>general
principles or not</u>, x x x.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Much as I want to temper justice with compassion considering that
the petitioners are now in the twilight of their lives and in poor health, <u>there
are no supervening events that warrant the Court's reconsideration</u>.  What is more, the issue raised in G.R. No.
70242, can no longer be relitigated anew since said issue has already been
resolved and finally laid to rest.  "<u>Hoc quidem per quam durum est sed ita lex scripta est</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">I hold that the petition is "clearly and plainly barred by <u>res</u>
<u>judicata</u>, and in such a manner as to leave no doubt or hesitation in the
mind of my brethren." More importantly, petitioners have not convinced me
that the herein case deserves to be reopened, by way of an exception to the
well-entrenched doctrine of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Res</u> <u>judicata</u>, I submit, lies.</p>
