that its provisions are wholly or in part contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public order, or public policy, will be enforced to the letter by the
Courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Application of this fundamental
principle is all that is required to resolve the controversy at bar.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The root of the dispute is traceable to loans obtained by the
Spouses Jose and <span class="SpellE">Eleuteria</span> <span class="SpellE">Escueta</span>
from the Rehabilitation Finance Corporation (RFC) in the aggregate sum of
P59,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The loans were secured by a
mortgage constituted by said spouses over land (and improvements thereon) owned
by them, covered by Transfer Certificates of Title Numbered 493 (39774) and 494
(39775) of the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Later, and with the consent of the RFC, the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>
created a second mortgage over the same property as security for a loan in the
amount of P16,000.00 obtained by them from the Spouses Antonio and Aurora
Tambunting.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
Both first and second mortgages were recorded in the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> defaulted in the payment
of both loans.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
consequently instituted an action of foreclosure of their second mortgage in
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a>
Some three months later, the RFC commenced proceedings for the extra-judicial
foreclosure of its first mortgage, which resulted in the sale at public auction
of the mortgaged property to the highest bidder, the RFC itself, subject to the
right of redemption of the mortgagors, the Escuetas.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a> The RFC then applied for and
obtained a writ of possession from the proper Court and in virtue thereof, took
possession of the foreclosed property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">About eight (8) months after the foreclosure sale, the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>, as second mortgagees, offered to redeem the
property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a>
The RFC agreed, subject to the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>’ right of
redemption as former owners thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">8</span></span></a> Their agreement was reduced to
writing, entitled "Deed of Conditional Sale." Under it, the RFC sold
the property in question to the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> for
P74,643.98, 20% of which (P14,928.89) was given as down payment, and the
balance was amortized over a period of ten (10) years.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">9</span></span></a>
The deed also contained the following stipulation,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">10</span></span></a>
among others:</p>

<blockquote>This contract may be revoked within one (1) year from <st1:date year="1955" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1955</st1:date> at the option of
the vendor should the former owner exercise his right to redeem the property
herein sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case the property is
redeemed or repurchased within said period by the former owner or his
successor-in-interest, the vendor shall refund to the vendees any and all
amounts that the vendees may have paid to the vendor under the conditional sale
with interest as provided for by law, rendering, thereby this instrument
automatically null and void and without effect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> took possession, and
commenced to collect the rentals from the tenants thereof after notifying them
of the deed of conditional sale in their favor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> In this connection, the deed also
provided that in the event of redemption by the former owner, "all rentals
collected will be deducted from the redemption price."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">About a month later, the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>
learned of the sale in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Three (3) days before the expiry of the
stipulated redemption period, the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>, having
been unable to raise the amount to effect redemption, assigned their right to
repurchase to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> Hernandez and <span class="SpellE">Candelaria</span> <span class="SpellE">Paguio</span> in
consideration of the sum of P15,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> On the day following, Hernandez
went to the RFC and exercised the right of redemption assigned to him by making
a deposit of P19,088.89, and formally undertaking to pay the balance of the repurchase
price in fixed monthly installments over a period of ten (10) years at 6%
interest per annum, these being the terms specified by the RFC for redemption,
set out in its Chairman's letter sent to the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>
three months after the foreclosure.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The RFC then notified the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
that their contract of conditional sale was deemed revoked in view of the
redemption by Hernandez, the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' successor-in-­interest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">5</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> wrote
to the RFC, "vehemently" protesting the acceptance by the RFC of the
redemption by the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> "as not in
accordance with law."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a> And some three weeks afterwards,
they instituted in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City, an action against the RFC, the <span class="SpellE">Escueta</span> Spouses,
and the Hernandez Spouses, for (1) the nullification of (a) the deed of
assignment by the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> in favor of the Hernandez
Spouses, (b) the latter's redemption of the property in question, and (c) the <span class="SpellE">RFC's</span> revocation of its deed of conditional sale with the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>; (2) the declaration of the validity of said
deed of conditional sale in their favor; (3) the payment of damages by the
defendants; and (4) the payment by the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>,
particularly, of rentals in arrears for their use and occupation of one of the
apartments standing on the mortgaged property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This action, docketed as Case No. 1686-P, was the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>'
second involving the same property, their first, Case No. 1565-P, being one for
the foreclosure of their second mortgage.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> also amended their complaint
in the first action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> They alleged that –</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the deed of assignment of
the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' right of redemption in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> was null and void because "fictitious or
simulated," and <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the Deed of Second
Mortgage of which the assignors and the assignees had notice;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the redemption sought to
be exercised by the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> was invalid because
(a) the amount deposited (down payment of P19,088.89) was not the full
redemption price (P55,000.00) exclusive of costs, insurance premiums, interest,
taxes, attorney's fees and liquidated damages, and (b) was not accompanied by
an offer to pay the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>' mortgage credit; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>if the verdict in Civil
Case No. 1686-P uphold the redemption by the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">RFC's</span> right to revoke its contract of
conditional sale with the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>, then the
latter's second mortgage should be enforced on the property in question.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The two cases were consolidated,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a> and decided jointly.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a>
The Trial Court's judgment went against the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>,
and disposed of the cases as follows:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the preliminary
injunction earlier issued, restraining the defendants from taking possession of
the property in question was lifted and set aside;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Deed of Conditional
Sale between the RFC (which had in the meantime become the Development Bank of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
[DBP]) and the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> was declared null
and void;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Deed of Assignment of
the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' right of redemption in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> was pronounced to be valid and subsisting; and<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
were ordered to refund to the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> "whatever excess rentals there may be from
plaintiffs' (<span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>') collection on the
mortgaged properties after deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the
down payment of P14,928.80 and the monthly amortizations paid by said
plaintiffs to defendant RFC under said Deed of Conditional Sale, and ** to pay
the costs."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> appealed to the Court
of Appeals, but there they fared no better.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That Court affirmed the Trial Court's decision <i>in toto</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
and subsequently denied the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> motion for
reconsideration.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
Hence, their present recourse to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>' submissions in this
Court are substantially the same as those they laid before both the Trial Court
and the Court of Appeals, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' deed of assignment in
favor of the Hernandez Spouses violated the terms of the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>'
mortgage' and was fictitious, to boot;</p>

<p class="BODY">2) even if the assignment were valid, there had been no valid exercise
of the right of redemption thereby assigned; and</p>

<p class="BODY">3) the assignment was "designed to deprive petitioners (<span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>) of the credit they extended; so that
petitioners are also entitled to the damages prayed for under the(<span class="SpellE">ir</span>) complaint."</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>' appeal must be
rejected and dismissed for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the matter of whether or not the assignment
was fictitious is an issue of fact and its resolution by the Court of Appeals
is, by firmly established and long observed principle, final and conclusive on
this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> right to redeem the property within one (1) year
from <st1:date year="1955" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1955</st1:date> was
never in any doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As much is explicit
in the Deed of Conditional Sale already referred to which documented the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>' redemption of the property as second
mortgagees and provided for its own automatic invalidation upon the exercise by
the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> (or their successor-in-interest) of
their own right of redemption within said period.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the theory of a fictitious transfer of the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' right of redemption is sustainable only on the
premise that such transfer somehow enlarged the scope of the right or extended
the period within which it might be exercised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It did neither, however.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its only
effect was to put the transferee in the shoes of the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>,
with exactly the same obligations to fulfill as <span class="SpellE">redemptioner</span>
and precisely the same period of time within which to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As far as the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>
were concerned, there was no advantage to be gained, no benefit to be derived,
no premium in simulating a transfer which altered none of the conditions for a
valid redemption, whether exercised by themselves or by a transferee.</p>

<p class="BODY">In short, the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> had nothing to
gain by going behind the scenes, as it were, and making redemption through a
dummy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even if it be assumed that
they in fact did so, that the redemption had been made for them and on their
behalf by the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> to whom; they had
"fictitiously" assigned their right of redemption, this would be
utterly inconsequential, not only because as already pointed out, there is no
question about their (the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>') being entitled
to redeem, but also because the redemption was made strictly according to the
terms -- as to down payment and other conditions -- laid down by the RFC
itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since, by the way, these terms
were precisely the same as those under which the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
were initially allowed to redeem, it is illogical and improper, to say the
least, for the latter now to impugn them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also untenable is the contention that the deed of assignment
executed by the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> in favor of the Hernandez
Spouses was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>'
second mortgage and therefore, inefficacious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A mortgagor, by encumbering his property, does not ordinarily lose the
right to sell the same or create another mortgage over it, although of course
obliged, when exercising said right, to preserve and maintain the superiority
of the prior mortgagee's rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
recognition of the propriety of subsequent encumbrances is implicit in the
grant of the right of redemption by Section 6 of ACT 3135, as amended, in cases
of extra-judicial foreclosure of mortgage, to "<i>any person having a lien
on the property subsequent to the mortgage or deed of trust under which the
property is sold</i>," in addition to the "debtor, his successors in
interest or any judicial creditor or judgment creditor of said debtor."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, the deed of second mortgage executed by the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> in favor of Aurora <span class="SpellE">Tambunting</span>,
married to Antonio L. Tambunting,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> does contain a provision that
"the property mortgaged shall not be * * the subject of any new or
subsequent contracts or agreements, saving and excepting those having
connection with the first mortgage with the RFC, without first securing the
written permission and consent of the MORTGAGEE." But the provision can
only be construed as directed against subsequent mortgages or encumbrances, not
to an alienation of the immovable itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>For while covenants prohibiting the owner from constituting a later
mortgage over property registered under the Torrens Act have been held to be
legally permissible,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> stipulations "forbidding the
owner from alienating the immovable mortgaged," are expressly declared
void by law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
It is clear then that the stipulation against "subsequent agreements"
above mentioned had not been breached by the assignment by the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> (to the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span>) of
their right of redemption in connection with the mortgage constituted in favor
of the R.F.C.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The assignment was not a
subsequent mortgage or encumbrance, licitly comprehended by the prohibitory stipulation,
but was actually a sale or conveyance of all their rights in the encumbered
real property -- in truth, an alienation of the immovable -- which could not
lawfully be forbidden.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, since
the subject of the assignment to the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> had
"connection with the first mortgage with the R.F.C.," it did not fall
within, but was explicitly excepted from, the prohibitory stipulation in
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it should not be
forgotten that since the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>, in their own
deed of conditional sale with the R.F.C., had accepted without demur the
provision that said contract could be revoked within one (1) year from
September 16, 1955 at the option of the RFC, as vendor, should the former owner
(<span class="SpellE">Escueta</span>) exercise his right to redeem the property;
and that the redemption of the property within said period by "the former
owner <i><u>or his successor-in-interest</u></i>" would render their
instrument of conditional sale "automatically null and void and without effect,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
they cannot now assume a position inconsistent with said provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The execution by the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span> of a
second mortgage over their property had the effect of subjecting the same
property to the payment of two obligations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both mortgage debts had to be paid by the mortgagors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If they failed to pay either or both, the
unpaid mortgagee had the right to look to the property for satisfaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Each mortgagee had the right to foreclose the
mortgage; but obviously, the second mortgagee's right was inferior and
subordinate to the first.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior
foreclosure by the second mortgagee could not affect the first mortgagee's
rights at all; and if the first mortgagee foreclosed first, the second
mortgagee had the right to redeem; i.e., pay the first mortgagee's credit,
together with all due interests and charges and thus acquire the property
mortgaged, subject to the right of redemption of the mortgagor.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the assignment by the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>
of their right of redemption (as regards both mortgage obligations) to the
Hernandez Spouses operated as a transfer of the property itself, together with
its recorded encumbrances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
acquisition by the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' rights over the property carried with it the
assumption of the obligations burdening the property, as recorded in the
Registry of Property, i.e., the mortgage debts in favor of the RFC (DBP) and
the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span>, by stepping into the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' shoes as assignees, had the obligation to pay the
mortgage debts, otherwise, these debts would and could be enforced against the
property subject of the assignment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span>, by the
assignment, obtained the right to remove the burdens on the property subject
thereof by paying the obligations thereby secured; that is to say, they had the
right of redemption as regards the first mortgage, to be exercised within the
time and in the manner prescribed by law and the mortgage deed; and as regards,
the second mortgage, sought to be judicially foreclosed but yet <span class="SpellE">unforeclosed</span>, they had the so-called equity of redemption.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> were perfectly within
their rights when they offered to redeem the property in question after it had
been foreclosed and acquired at public auction by the RFC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And it was correct for the RFC, in accepting
the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>' offer and acquiescing to their
redemption of the property, to<i> make such redemption subject to the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>' own right of redemption, which was <span class="SpellE">exigible</span> against the RFC itself</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence it was that the Deed of Conditional Sale
executed consequent upon that redemption between the RFC and the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>, expressly provided in language that could not
be made any plainer that – <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a></p>

herein sold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case the property is
redeemed or repurchased within said period by the former owner or his
successor-in-interest, the vendor shall refund to the vendees any and all amounts
that the vendees may have paid to the vendor under the conditional sale with

automatically null and void and without effect.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court has been cited to no fact or argument invalidating this
stipulation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
make no claim that their consent to the deed of conditional sale was in any
manner flawed, or that the stipulation is contrary to law, morals, good
customs, public order, or public policy.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> The stipulation is a perfectly legitimate
one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
are bound by it.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute either about the fact that the redemption by
the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span>, as assignees of the mortgagor
spouses, the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>, was made within the time and
in the manner laid down by law and the RFC itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their redemption was deemed by the RFC to
have been properly exercised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The RFC
therefore revoked its contract with the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>,
as it was bound to pursuant to the explicit provision thereof above quoted --
indeed, that contract was, by its terms, rendered "automatically null and
void and without effect" by the redemption -- and executed in the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span>' favor a deed of conditional sale,
substantially identical to that earlier signed in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor can there be any question about the effects of that
redemption by the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> as far as the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> are concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By reason thereof -</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
acquired the right to a refund of "any and all amounts that ** (they) may
have paid to the ** (RFC [DBP]) under the conditional sale with interest as
provided for by law;" and</p>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>their credit against
the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>, and their right to foreclose the second
mortgage given as security <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> -­- and now still
subject of Civil Case No. 1656-P of the CFI (now RTC) of <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City -- remained unaffected and intact, subject, of course, to the equity of
redemption which the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span> may exercise as
assignees of the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> is
DENIED, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals thereby challenged is
AFFIRMED, with the modification hereinafter decreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case is accordingly remanded to the Trial
Court for a determination not only of (1) the "excess rentals there may be
from plaintiffs' (the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>') collection on the
mortgaged properties" to be refunded by said <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
to the "defendants spouses <span class="SpellE">Escueta</span> and
Hernandez" -- counted from the date that the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>
were notified in writing by the RFC of the revocation of the deed of
conditional sale executed in their favor -- "after deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the down payment of P14,928.80 and the monthly
amortizations paid by said plaintiffs to defendant RFC under said Deed of
Conditional Sale," as ordained by the judgment of the Trial Court, but
also (2) the balance of the <span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span>' mortgage
credit against the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>, together with all
stipulated interests and charges, which the <span class="SpellE">Hernandezes</span>,
as assignees of the <span class="SpellE">Escuetas</span>, are bound to pay to the
<span class="SpellE">Tambuntings</span> within ninety (90) days from finality of
that determination, in default of which the property shall be sold at public
auction in accordance with the provisions of Rule 68 of the Rules of
