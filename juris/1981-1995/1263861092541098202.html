<p class="BODY">Culled from the decision of respondent Court of Appeals are the
following factual findings:</p>

<blockquote>"It is not disputed in the record that the Padre <span class="SpellE">Rada</span> market consisted of six parcels of land belonging to
different persons, one parcel of which with an area of 651.80 square meters is
owned by Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> So.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The petitioner's evidence shows that the Padre <span class="SpellE">Rada</span>
Market Operators Association, an unregistered partnership, constructed the
market with leasehold right from the owners of the lots (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
L &amp; L-1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lease with respondent
So was of an indefinite duration at a monthly rent of P3,500 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. E to E-14 &amp; G).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Petitioner has been the manager of said association
supervising the market, assigning market inspectors and collectors, and
collecting from stallholders and merchants (<span class="SpellE">biyaheros</span>)
doing business in the market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also
takes charge of rental payments of the market so that rental receipts issued by
So were all made out in his name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Exhibits 'E' to 'E-14').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Communications intended for the association are also addressed by So to
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And when So demanded the
liquidation of the alleged rental arrearages of the association, a letter to
this effect was sent to Cruz by the lawyer of So (Exhibit 'A'), and other
letters by So himself (Exhibits 'B', ‘G', 'G-1' and 'H').</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="4">April 18, 1977</st1:date>
Cruz received a letter from respondent advising him to pay the rentals in
arrears and to vacate the premises on or before <st1:date year="1977" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1977</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, nevertheless, continued
operating the market and paid the monthly rental to respondent for May 1977
without any protest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sometime in June, the petitioner was suddenly served a copy
of a temporary restraining order issued by the then Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch XXII, in its Civil Case No. 109218, which was an action
commenced against Cruz by So and one Antonio <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>,
Jr. to prohibit his market operation and collection of rentals (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., March 1, 1983, p. 4).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of said injunction proceeding commenced by So and <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>, Ricardo Cruz was compelled to stop his market
operations and collection of market fees from June, 1977 to March, 1982 or a
period of fifty-seven (57) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the expiration of the lease contract between Roman So and
Milagros de Leon, Ricardo Cruz immediately filed Civil Case No. 82-8098 in the

on March 31, 1982 to enjoin Roman So from leasing out the market to third
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon application of Ricardo
Cruz, a writ of preliminary injunction was issued on <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1982</st1:date>, enjoining Roman So from leasing the
market to third parties, renewing his contract with Antonio Gonzales, Jr.
and/or Milagros de Leon and from collecting rentals from stallholders thereat

<p class="BODY">On appeal, respondent court rendered the decision hereinbefore
mentioned, hence, the instant petitions which were consolidated by the
resolution of this Court on <st1:date year="1986" day="6" month="10">October 6,
 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 72313, Ricardo Cruz avers that respondent Court of
Appeals erred in reducing the lease period fixed by the trial court, and in
eliminating the compensation award to him for losses arising from his unlawful
dispossession of the Padre <span class="SpellE">Rada</span> Market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
So alleges, in G.R. No. 72326, that respondent court erred:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) in not declaring the lease to have been
validly terminated for non-payment of rentals; (2) in not holding that the
lease, being on a month-to-month basis, could be terminated at the end of every
month; (3) in applying Article 1687 of the Civil Code to extend the lease of
Cruz to December, 1986; and (4) in not ordering Cruz to pay rentals up to the
time of actual relinquishment of the premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue for resolution in this case is whether or not
Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> So could validly terminate his contract
of lease with Ricardo Cruz and enter into a new contract with third
persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A corollary issue is whether
Ricardo Cruz is entitled to have the term of his lease fixed for another and
longer period of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that there was a valid termination of the lease contract
executed between Ricardo Cruz and Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> So
for several reasons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, the applicable provision of the Civil Code states:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1687.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">period </span>for the lease has not been
fixed, it is understood to be from year to year, if the rent agreed upon is annual;
from month to month, if it is monthly; from week to week, if the rent is
weekly; and from day to day, if the rent is to be paid daily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is no debate that Ricardo Cruz pays his
rent monthly which thus makes his lease contract terminable at the end of every
month without need of any special notice to vacate.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> So may exercise his right to terminate
the contract at the end of any month even if any of the conditions of the
contract had not been violated,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
and such right cannot be defeated by the lessee's timely payment of the rent or
by his willingness to continue doing so.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, the contract of lease being on a month-to-month basis, Ricardo
Cruz cannot validly claim that the lease is for an indefinite period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1687 specifically provides that the
term is month to month if the rent is paid monthly, hence it is a lease with a
definite term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such lease contract
expires at the end of every month unless there is an implied or tacit renewal
thereof as when the lessee is allowed to continue enjoying the leased premises
for fifteen (15) days at the end of every month with the acquiescence of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
exception, however, cannot be invoked when notice to vacate is given to the
lessee in which case the contract of lease expires at the end of the month.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, Ricardo Cruz does not refute, and in fact he
even admits, that a notice to vacate was issued to him on April 18, 1977 by
Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> So informing him that their lease
contract would expire on April 30, 1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although payment of rental was made for the month of May, 1977 and
accepted by Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> So, this does not by itself
curtail the latter's right to terminate the lease contract at the end of every
succeeding month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is entitled to payment for the occupancy of his
premises even after the contract has expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, without explicitly admitting the breach, Cruz offers
the flimsy and unsubstantiated excuse that there is a pre-existing remittance
arrangement between the parties over the settlement of his rental arrearages
and erroneously postulates that, by virtue of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">said </span>arrangement, he cannot now be considered as in default.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
For all intents and purposes, the fact remains that the failure of Cruz to pay
the rents when due constitutes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>breach
of the contract of lease which gives rise to <span class="SpellE">So's</span>
right of rescission under Article 1191 of the Civil Code which states:</p>

<blockquote>“Art. 1191.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The power to
rescind obligations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is</span> implied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>reciprocal ones, in case one of the
obligors should not comply with what is incumbent upon him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The injured party may choose between the fulfillment and the
rescission of the obligation, with the payment of damages in either case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may also seek rescission, even after he
has chosen fulfillment, if the latter should become impossible.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The court shall decree the rescission claimed, unless there be just
cause authorizing the fixing of a period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that So acted well within his rights in
terminating his contract with Cruz and in entering into a new one with third
persons, without need of resorting to judicial action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This finds support in our ruling in the case
of <u>University</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <st1:country-region><st1:place><u>Philippines</u></st1:place></st1:country-region>
<u>vs</u>. <u>De</u> <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><u>los</u></span> <u>Angeles</u></st1:place></st1:city>,
<u>etc</u>., <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
which involved the question of whether the injured party may consider the
contract as rescinded even before any judicial pronouncement has been made to
that effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court, in holding in
the affirmative, ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"Of course, it must be understood that the act of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span>party in treating a contract as
cancelled or resolved on account of infractions by the other contracting party
must be made known to the other and is always provisional, being ever subject
to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">scrutiny and review by the proper
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the other party denies that
rescission is justified, it is free to resort to judicial action in its own
behalf, and bring the matter to court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then, should the court, after due hearing, decide that the resolution of
the contract was not warranted, the responsible party will be sentenced to
damages; in the contrary case, the resolution will be affirmed, and the
consequent indemnity awarded to the party prejudiced.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>In</u> <u>other</u> <u>words</u>, <u>the</u> <u>party</u> <u>who</u>
<u>deems</u> <u>the</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">contract</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u>violated</u> <u>may</u> <u>consider</u>

</span>For it is only the final judgment of the corresponding court that will
conclusively and finally settle whether the action taken was or was not correct
in law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>But</u> <u>the</u> <u>law</u>

<u>that</u> <u>he</u> <u>should</u> <u>exercise</u> <u>due</u> <u>diligence</u>
<u>to</u> <u>minimize</u> <u>its</u> <u>own</u> <u>damages</u> (Civil Code, </span>Article
2203).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We see no conflict between this ruling and the previous
jurisprudence of this Court invoked by respondent declaring that judicial
action is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">necessary for the resolution
of a reciprocal obligation, since in every case where the extrajudicial
resolution is contested only the final award of the court of competent
jurisdiction can conclusively settle whether the resolution was proper or
not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in this sense that judicial
action will be necessary, as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">without
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it, the extrajudicial resolution
will remain contestable and subject to judicial invalidation, unless attack
thereon should become barred by acquiescence, <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
or prescription." (Emphasis supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Ricardo Cruz further
maintains that the lease contract with Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
So is one with an indefinite period, no specific term having been agreed upon
by the parties, hence the court can legally fix a longer term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>He <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">invokes the second sentence of Article 1687 of the Civil Code which
states that even though a monthly rental is paid, and no period for the lease
has been set, the courts may fix a longer term for the lease after the lessee
has occupied the premises for over one year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As earlier stated, the
contract of Ricardo Cruz, being on a month-to-month basis, is a lease with a definite
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the contract of lease is
for a definite term, the lessee cannot avail of the benefits under Article 1687
which applies only if there is no definite term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>
that Article 1687 applies, Ricardo Cruz would still not be entitled to have the
term fixed for a longer period since his action was filed only after the
contract had expired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As held in <span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span>. <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Prieto</u></span> <u>vs</u>. <st1:city><st1:place><u>Santos</u></st1:place></st1:city>,

<blockquote>"Under this provision, if the period of a lease contract has not
been specified by the parties therein, it is understood to be from month to
month, if the rent agreed upon is monthly, as in the cases at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the contract <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">expires at the end of such month, unless, <u>prior</u>
<u>thereto</u>, the extension of said term has been sought by appropriate
action and judgment is, eventually, rendered therein granting said relief.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendants herein maintain that their lease contracts did not, and
could not, come to an end until after the court has fixed its lifetime and the
term thus fixed has expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This view,
is, to our mind, untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To begin
with, defendants assume that their contracts are without term, prior to the
judicial action authorized in said Article 1687, whereas the same provides that
the duration of lease contracts shall be yearly, monthly, weekly, or daily
depending upon whether the rental agreed upon is annual, monthly, weekly, or
daily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, said contracts
have a term fixed by law, and are not indefinite in duration, before said
judicial intervention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, said
Article 1687 merely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">gives </span>the
court <u>discretion</u> to extend the period of the lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court is <u>not</u> <u>bound</u> to
extend said term.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may legally refuse
to do so, if the circumstances surrounding the case warrants such action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" </span>(Emphasis
reproduced)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, under the factual features of this case, there is
nothing in the law which confers upon the lessee the preferential right to
occupy the premises over other prospective lessees when his lease contract has
been terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To require otherwise
will unduly deprive the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of his ownership
rights without due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, if Ricardo Cruz actually believed that he had every right
to continue with the lease of the subject premises, we find no plausible reason
for his inscrutable silence on and apparent acquiescence to the lease contract
executed by Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span> So with third persons in
1977.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His inexplicable inaction when
ordinary reason and prudence dictate that he should have done something about
it operates as an admission that his lease contract had been validly
terminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we are inclined, on equitable considerations, to allow the
period of extension provided for by the Court of Appeals, the grant thereof has
been rendered moot by the fact that Ricardo Cruz had recovered and has been in
possession of the premises since <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="5">May 4,
 1982</st1:date> when a writ of preliminary injunction was issued by the trial
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it appears that he
continues to do so up to the present, which is clearly beyond the 57-month period
fixed by the Court of Appeals, without paying the corresponding rentals for his
occupancy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, the
legal imperative is that Ricardo Cruz should pay Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
So a monthly rent of P3,500.00 starting May 4, 1982 until Cruz surrenders
possession of the leased premises to So.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Correlatively, Ricardo Cruz should immediately desist from operating the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">market and from collecting rentals from
stallholders occupying the premises of Roman <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
So and to peaceably surrender the said premises to So or the latter's
authorized representatives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
