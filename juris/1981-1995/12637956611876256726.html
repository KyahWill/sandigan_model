<p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with 
prayer for Preliminary Injunction seeking:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) to prohibit the 
respondents from continuing with the hearing and investigation of Administrative 
Case No. 2 filed by respondent Governor of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> 
against petitioner Mayor <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span> M. Palma, Sr. of the 
Municipality of Don Carlos, Province of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> and 
(b) to nullify Resolution No. 82-87 passed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, suspending him from 
office.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of this case are:</p>
<p class="BODY">On March 30, 1981, the Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> P. Estrada of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, 
at the instance of the offended parties <span class="SpellE">Nelia</span> <span class="SpellE">Arandel</span>, Clerk-typist and Susan <span class="SpellE">Palamine</span>, Clerical Aide, both of the Office of the Mayor of 
the Municipality of Don Carlos, Province of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, 
filed with the Court of First Instance of the same province, Criminal Cases Nos. 
2795, 2796 and 2797 <span class="GramE">against</span> petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teodulo</span> M. Palma, Sr., the duly elected and qualified Mayor 
of said Municipality.</p>
<p class="BODY">By virtue of the aforesaid three (3) separate cases, said offended 
parties in a sworn joint letter complaint, requested respondent Provincial 
Governor for an immediate administrative investigation for the purpose of 
suspending Mayor Palma from office pending final determination of these 
cases.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 6).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Attached to said 
letter are:<span>&nbsp; </span>three (3) copies of the Information for Acts of 
Lasciviousness against the Mayor (Annexes "B", "C" and "D"; Petition, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 7-9); the statements of the offended 
parties (Annexes "1-A" and "2"; Comment, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 30-34; Respondent's Brief, p. 3, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 60).<span>&nbsp; </span>Treating the same as a 
formal letter complaint, respondent Governor formally <span>informed the Mayor 
of the administrative charge </span>against him for Misconduct in Office (Annex 
"E", Petition<span>er; <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 10).<span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>Forthwith, the record of the administrative case against the Mayor 
was forwarded to the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> of the 
<st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Said 
body, after receipt thereof, set the case for hearing on <st1:date month="4" day="13" year="1981">April 13, 1981</st1:date> (Annex "F", Petition, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, <span>p. 11).<span>&nbsp; </span></span>After the 
hearing where complainants were required to testify and then cross-examined by 
petitioner's counsel, the former petitioned for the preventive suspension of the 
Mayor which was granted by respondent <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span> in its Resolution No. 82-87 (Annex "G", 
Petition, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 42).</p>
<p class="BODY">The Mayor accepted his preventive <span>suspension </span>from 
office as shown in his Office Order dated <st1:date month="2" day="15" year="1982">February 15, 1982</st1:date> (Annex "3", Comment of Respondent; 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p<span>. </span>35).<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Nonetheless, he filed this petition.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the resolution of <st1:date month="4" day="24" year="1982">April 24, 1982</st1:date> of the First Division of this Court (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 14), respondents were required to comment 
on the petition.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same was filed on <st1:date month="5" day="3" year="1982">May 3, 1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, 
pp. 25-35) while on <st1:date month="6" day="14" year="1982">June 14, 
1982</st1:date> petitioner filed an urgent motion for immediate issuance of 
Temporary Restraining Order (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
37-39).<span>&nbsp; </span>In the resolution of June 16, 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 40) the motion of petitioner to file 
therein a reply (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 19-23) to 
respondents' comment was granted; the petition was given due course and a 
temporary restraining order was issued enjoining the respondents from continuing 
with the hearing and/or investigation of the administrative case and from 
enforcing the order of suspension against petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's 
brief was filed on <st1:date month="9" day="9" year="1982">September 9, 
1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 57) while 
respondents' brief was filed on <st1:date month="9" day="27" year="1982">September 27, 1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 60).<span>&nbsp; </span>On October 1, 1982, 
the offended parties moved (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 62-64) 
for intervention and for admission of their attached brief (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 66) which was granted and the aforesaid 
brief noted <span>in the resolution of October 20, 1982 (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 68).<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the case 
was calendared for decision.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, <span>p. 
67).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The only issue raised in Petitioner's Brief is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT THE FILING AND PENDENCY OF THE AFORESAID THREE (3) 
SEPARATE INFORMATION FOR "ACTS OF LASCIVIOUSNESS" AGAINST AN ELECTIVE LOCAL 
OFFICIAL WOULD CONSTITUTE "MISCONDUCT IN OFFICE" WITHIN THE MEANING OF SECTION 5 
OF REPUBLIC ACT NO. 5185 WHICH MAY WARRANT THE FILING OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE 
COMPLAINT AGAINST HIM AND/OR HIS SUSPENSION FROM <span class="GramE">OFFICE.</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">There appears to be no controversy as to the filing of the 
criminal cases against the petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>The principal issue centers 
on the filing of the administrative case and consequent preventive suspension of 
petitioner based solely on the filing of the above-mentioned criminal cases.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that "Acts of Lasciviousness" although how 
numerous, do not fall within the category of "malfeasance and misfeasance" or 
"misconduct in the office" contemplated in Section 5 of R.A. No. 5185, and 
therefore cannot be the basis of the filing of a separate administrative case 
against an elective official and the preventive suspension of the latter.</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondents, alleging otherwise, maintain that the lascivious acts 
of the petitioner constitute misconduct under Article XIII, Section 1 of the 
1973 Constitution, re:<span>&nbsp; </span>"Accountability of Public Officers."</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>However, on September 1, 1983, petitioner filed a 
Manifestation and Prayer (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 69-71) 
informing </span>this Court that the three criminal cases filed against him were 
all dismissed by the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, 
Branch X in an Order dated February 24, 1983.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Annex "A", <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
72-79).</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, on the premise that the administrative case 
in question as well as the resulting preventive suspension is now bereft of any 
legal basis, petitioner now prays that judgment be rendered in accordance with 
his prayer in the petition.</p>
<p class="BODY">But, before the instant petition could be decided by the Supreme 
Court, the Provisional Constitution also known as the Freedom Constitution was 
promulgated in Proclamation No. 3, dated <st1:date month="3" day="25" year="1986">March 25, 1986</st1:date>, by President Corazon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>&nbsp;</span>Article III, Section 2 thereof, reads:</p>
<blockquote>"All elective and appointive officials and employees under the 1973 
Constitution shall continue in office until otherwise provided by proclamation 
or executive order or upon the designation or appointment and qualification of 
their successors, if such is made within a period of one year from <st1:date month="2" day="25" year="1986">February 25, 1986</st1:date>."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Under the above quoted provision of the Freedom Constitution, an 
incumbent Mayor, elected under the 1973 Constitution may be replaced by an 
"Officer-in-charge a specie of successor considered as within the ambit of the 
provision." (G.R. No. 73770, <span class="SpellE"><em>Topacio</em></span><em>, Jr. 
v. Pimentel</em>; G.R. No. 73811, <em>Velasco v. Pimentel</em>; G.R. No. 73823, 
Governors of the <em>Phil. v. Pimentel</em>; G.R. No. 73940, <em>The Municipal 
Mayors League of the Phil., et al. v. Pimentel</em>; and G.R. No. 73970, 
<em>Solis v. Pimentel, et al., </em>RESOLUTION; Court <em>En Banc</em> dated 
April 10, 1986).</p>
<p class="BODY">Coming back to the case at bar, it appears from the records of the 
Ministry of Local Government that petitioner who was obviously elected under the 
1973 Constitution, has been replaced by OIC Fabian <span class="SpellE">Gardones</span> as Mayor of Don Carlos, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">Thus, the question <span>now </span>confronting the Court, is 
whether or not, under the succeeding developments, the issue in the case at bar 
has become moot and academic.</p>
<p class="BODY">As a general rule, dismissal of an administrative case does not 
necessarily follow the dismissal of a criminal case, the <span>former requiring 
as </span>it does, only preponderance of evidence while the latter requires 
proof<span> </span>beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
<p class="BODY">However, in administrative actions against municipal officers, the 
Supreme Court in <span class="SpellE"><em>Festijo</em></span><em> v. Crisologo, et 
al. </em>(17 SCRA 868, 869 [1966]), classified the grounds for suspension under 
two categories, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) those related to the discharge of the 
functions of the officer concerned (neglect of duty, oppression, corruption or 
other forms of maladministration of office) and (2) those not so connected with 
said functions.<span>&nbsp; </span>Under the second category, when the crime 
involving moral turpitude is not linked with the performance of official duties, 
conviction by final judgment is required as a condition precedent to 
administrative action.</p>
<p class="BODY">The ground for filing of the administrative action in the case at 
bar and the suspension of petitioner Mayor is misconduct allegedly committed in 
the form of lasci<span>vious acts of the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Misconduct has been defined as "such as affects his 
performance of his duties as an officer and not </span><span>only 
</span><span>as affects his character as a private individual.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
such cases, it has been said at all times, it is necessary to separate the 
character of the man from the character of the officer." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Lacson</em></span><em> v. Roque, et 
al.,</em> 92 Phil. 456).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Now, as to whether or not, such misconduct of petitioner 
affects his performance of his duties as an officer and not only his character 
as a private individual, has been laid to rest by the ruling of the Supreme 
Court </span><span>in </span><span>an analogous case where it was held that 
while "it is true that the charges of rape and <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span> may involve moral turpitude of which a municipal 
official may be proceeded against </span><span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> 
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span>but before the provincial governor and 
board may act and proceed against the municipal official, a conviction by 
</span><span>final </span><span>judgment must precede the filing by the 
provincial governor of the charges and trial by the provincial board." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Mindano</em></span><em> v. Silvosa, et 
al.,</em> 97 Phil. 144-145 [1955]).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Indeed, there is merit in petitioner's contention that the 
same ruling applies to acts of lasciviousness which falls under the same 
classification as crimes against chastity.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, 
not only is a final judgment lacking, but the criminal cases filed against the 
petitioner were all dismissed by the trial court, for insufficiency of evidence, 
on the basis of its findings that the attendant circumstances logically point to 
the existence of </span><span>consent </span><span>on the part of the offended 
parties.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>(Order, <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Cases Nos. 
2795, 2796 and 2797, RTC, Br. X, <span class="SpellE">Malaybalay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 
77-79).<span>&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, there being no showing that the 
acts of petitioner Mayor are linked with the performance of official duties such 
as "neglect of duty, oppression, corruption, or other form of maladministration 
of office" (<span class="SpellE"><em>Festijo</em></span><em> v. Crisologo, et 
al.</em>, <em>supra</em>, pp. 872-873), there appears to be no question that the 
pending administrative case against him should be dismissed for lack of basis 
and the restraining order issued by the Court should be made permanent.</p>
<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, the replacement of petitioner Mayor by the 
Officer-in-Charge Fabian <span class="SpellE">Gardones</span> has rendered the 
issues of removal and suspension from office, moot and academic.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES</b> <span class="GramE"><b>CONSIDERED</b>,</span> 
judgment is hereby rendered DISMISSING:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) the administrative 
case filed against the petitioner for lack of basis and (b) subject petition for 
having become moot and academic.</p>
<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE"><strong>SO
