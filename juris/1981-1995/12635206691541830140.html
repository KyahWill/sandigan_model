when the latter was leaving the store of Mr. Lim <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span>
informed him that there was an accident and that they better go home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he, <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span> and
<span class="SpellE">Rojo</span> ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY">He admitted his signatures on Exhibits "D" to

<p class="BODY">In their brief, appellants <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarraya</span> c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">laimed </span>that
the trial court erred (1) in finding that the special complex crime of robbery
with homicide was committed and that they were guilty thereof; (2) in finding
that they were also guilty of frustrated homicide; (3) in finding that there
was conspiracy among them; and (4) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in
not appreciating the mitigating circumstance of voluntary surrender on the part
of <span class="SpellE">Tarraya</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

entered the store, Pedro Lim had </span>just <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Pedro Lim and Lope de Leon, a neighbor, were the first to arrive and they
attended to the victims who were lying prostrate on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Jesse Lim was looking for a piece of
cloth to wipe the blood of his father, he noticed that the drawer of the table
which contained the money was open and empty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was at the hospital where Pedro Lim was taken for treatment that he
came to know about the loss of the money in the drawer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim that appellants went to the store
of Pedro Lim for the purpose of buying flashlight bulb only is hard to believe

a sling shot, a piece of wood and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a

would like this Court to believe that Mrs. Lim allegedly rushed to help her
husband just after Mr. Lim was hit on the head with a flashlight by <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span>, then the latter transferred the flashlight to his
left hand and then pulled the '<span class="SpellE">supnit</span>' from his waist
with his right hand, but as the distance between them was too close (about a
meter away), there would have been no chance for <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span>
to transfer the flashlight from his right hand to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

the on-rushing Mrs. Lim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span> himself admitted that he stabbed Mrs. Lim several
times but can not remember the number of injuries he had inflicted, there was
sufficient time for <span class="SpellE">Tawat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tarraya</span>
to inflict the many wounds upon both Mr. and Mrs. Lim and to rob the money from
the table's drawer before they ran away.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;
