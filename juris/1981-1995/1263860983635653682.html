Australia, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>AUS$8,000.00

G.R. No. 55312 speaks of payment of </span>separation pay "effective as of
the end of the above three (3) year period."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">We </span>find substantive
merit in the first argument of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We believe that the Labor Arbiter had no factual or legal basis for
computing the award upon the basis of AUS$8,000.00 <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">per</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> <u>annum</u> </span>salary
received by private respondent while he was working in <st1:place><st1:city>Sydney</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Australia</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and
separation pay should have been computed on the basis of the P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> per month salary received by Fernandez while
employed in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by petitioner Grolier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
Fernandez sought reinstatement <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
his old position with Grolier in the </span></u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></u></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>from which he could expect to
receive only his old salary of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could <u>not</u> have reasonably expected
to receive as salary the Philippine peso equivalent of the number of Australian
dollars he was receiving as salary in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
had petitioner Grolier allowed him <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
resume his former position in the </span></u><st1:country-region><st1:place><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></u></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Reinstatement means restoration to a state or condition from
which one had been removed or separated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
One who is reinstated assumes the position he had occupied prior to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">his </span>dismissal and is, as an ordinary
rule, entitled only to his last salary in that position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had private respondent Fernandez been
reinstated either upon his initial request or as required by this Court, he
would have occupied his former position <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in
</span>Grolier in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>Comptroller and Executive
Administrator, and as such would have been entitled only to his previous salary
of P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> per month.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, it seems important to note that salary scales are based
upon or reflect, as economic facts, the standard of living prevailing in the
country and the purchasing power of the domestic currency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
monthly salary which respondent received from petitioner prior to his stay in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
was presumably a reasonable and satisfactory remuneration for the work done by
him, taking into account the standard of living and the cost of living in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
at that time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be supposed that
private respondent was promoted when he was sent to the <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
offices of the Grolier Society, Ltd. of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court in its Resolution in G.R. No. 55132
dated <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="12">27 December 1987</st1:date> had
stated that respondent Fernandez went to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
on company business, which means that his trip to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was related to the duties of the position he was then holding in Grolier in the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The apparently higher salary given to him
while working in <st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Australia</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">,</span> must be viewed in the light of the fact that the cost of
living and the standard of living in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
are higher than those prevailing in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
he was paid his salary in Australian dollars; but he had to pay for his
expenses in Australian dollars too.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There was in reality no increase in respondent's salary that was <span class="GramE">effected</span> merely because he was in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
what had in truth been effected was merely the adjustment of his salary on
account of the different, higher costs of living while in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Put a little differently, the AUS$8,000.00
per annum salary of private respondent while in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Australia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was equivalent to his P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> per month salary he
had been receiving in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent does not pretend that the
functions he was discharging in Australia (as an "accountant or financial
officer"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>)
were qualitatively different from the work he was carrying out in the
Philippines (as comptroller and executive administrator) or that his Australian
job involved much greater responsibility or required much higher technical
capabilities than his job here.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
it would appear that his job in <st1:city><st1:place>Sydney</st1:place></st1:city>
was more modest and less important than his job in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second point raised by petitioner Grolier is centered on the
interpretation of a phrase in our Resolution on the Motion for Reconsidering
ordering Grolier "to pay [Fernandez] separation pay based on the
applicable law or company practice, whichever is higher, <u>effective </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>of the end of the above three (3) </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">year period</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

underscored phrase referred to the period beginning <st1:date year="1978" day="3" month="2">3 February 1978</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1988" day="19" month="5">19 May 1988</st1:date>, a period of ten (10) years and three
(3) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We cannot sustain this
reading of our Resolution, for it would collide with present law and
jurisprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 4 (b), Rule 1,
Book VI of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code provides that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 4 (b).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case the establishment where the employee
is to be reinstated has closed or ceased operations or where his former
position no longer exists at the time of reinstatement for reasons not
attributable to the fault of the employer, the employee shall be entitled to <u>separation
pay equivalent</u> at least to one month salary or <u>to</u> one month salary <u>for
every year of service</u> whichever is higher, a fraction of at least six
months being considered as one whole <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">year."
</span>(Underscoring supplied)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent is entitled to separation pay equivalent to one (1)
month salary for <u>every year of service</u> since petitioner could no longer
reinstate h<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">im </span>in his old
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The period to be considered,
therefore, is that from 1 July 1964 -- when he commenced his employment with
the petitioner -- until 2 February 1978, which is the terminal date of the
three (3) year period set by this Court in determining the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
he is entitled to.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words,
respondent Fernandez is deemed to have been in the employment of petitioner
Grolier until the expiry of the three (3) year period during which he was
entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, or a total period of fourteen
(14) years and seven (7) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
conclusion is in line with the rulings of this Court too numerous to list here,
where awards of separation pay were computed from the start of employment up to
the time of termination thereof,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
including the period of imputed service for which he is entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, when the Court stated that private respondent was entitled
to "separation pay based on the applicable law or company practice,
whichever is higher, effective as of the end of the above three (3) year
period," it meant only that in the computation of separation pay, the
three (3) year period in respect of which <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
are awarded, must also be included (although private respondent had not
actually served during the last three [3] years), and that the salary rate
prevailing at the end of the three (3) year period of putative service should
be used in such computation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
showing that the monthly salary attached to the old position of respondent
Fernandez in petitioner Grolier had been upgraded to some amount higher than P4<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> per month.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that the public respondent Labor Arbiter acted in excess
of his jurisdiction in computing the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and
