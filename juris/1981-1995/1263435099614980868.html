Mariano, claims that the </span>appellate court erred in declaring the Deed of

null and </span>void and TCT No. 156493 in her name cancelled.  Emphasizing that the trial court's findings

asks Us to reverse the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">questioned
decision</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

Private respondents claim, however, that they were tricked by </span>petitioner
into signing over their property to her.  A question arises:  Is parol
evidence admissible to resolve the controversy between the parties?  Yes, it is admissible.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner claims that
the private respondents </span>approached her on October 28, 1986 for a loan of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">P250,000.00 on the security of a
mortgage on their lot </span>with an area of 2,035 square meters located at
Deparo, Kalookan City and covered by TCT No. 129613 in their names.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">On </span>January
15, 1987, they secured another loan of P250,000.00 on the basis of the same
security.  Forseeing their inability to
pay this when they become due, private respondents sold the same parcel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>land mortgaged to petitioner for an
additional P320,550.00 on September 29, 1987.  Thus, a deed of sale was drawn up on said date and a new TCT No. 156493
issued in petitioner's name..  However,
the private respondents refused to turn over possession of the land to her and
instead sued her for annulment of deed of sale and damages.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On the other hand,
private respondents' story is that all they wanted was to transform their small
piece of land, which they had inherited from their parents, into a
subdivision.  They looked for financiers
who would be able to lend them money for their project and petitioner expressed
her desire to help them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Being unschooled farmers,
and relying completely </span>on the trust and confidence they have on
petitioner, they signed the prepared mortgage forms that petitioner told them
to sign.  They first mortgaged their
land on October 28, 1986 for P250,000.00 with the condition that they were to
construct a house on said lot so that they would be able to secure another
P250,000.00 with the house and lot as security.  They received, however, only P150,000.00 for the first
mortgage.  After the house was
constructed, they were made to sign another document for another P250,000.00 on
January 15, 1987 for which they received again only P150,000.00.  Thereafter, petitioner told them that she
could easily secure a bank loan of P1,000,000.00 for their project but they had
to sign over their property to her as the bank would require that the property
be in her name for the loan to be processed.  Thus, trusting her completely, they signed on September 29, 1987 a
prepared deed of sale which petitioner handed over to them for their signature.  When they discovered that there was no loan
and that they were being asked to vacate their land, they took petitioner to
court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Private respondents sued
petitioner for annulment of the deed of sale and the cancellation of the
Transfer Certificate of Title in her name.  The trial </span>court, however, dismissed their complaint relying on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the validity of the deed of sale as the best
evidence of the transaction between the parties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

violence or undue influence (Art. 1330, New Civil Gode).  In fact, as early as 1919 in the case of

sale stated by the appellee is not true.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“2.  Appellee says in her
brief –</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The consideration of P320,550.00 stated in the deed of sale is
more consistent with the claim of the appellee that <u>it is in addition to the
previous loans of appellants in the aggregate amount of  P500,000.00'</u> (at pp. 13-14)</p>

<blockquote>In the course of her testimony however, the
appellee said the only consideration for the deed of sale was the P320,550.00
‘because the P500,000.00 is considered as a mortgage.’ (tsn, January 4, 1990,
p. 7)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  Appellee herself revealed the true nature of
the deed of sale when she said, on cross-examination, that the intention was
merely to secure a loan of P1M on the property, on her credit as a
businesswoman and that whatever the appellants owed her would be deducted from
the proceeds, to be paid to her, the appellants to assume the P1M mortgage <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">(<i>ibid</i>., </span>pp. 10-11).  Additionally, as stated earlier, the P1M
mortgage loan never materialized.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, having ostensibly acquired full ownership of the
land on September 29, 1987, appellee has not taken any step to get possession,
although the appellants stay on the premises.  As a matter of fact, her answer dated November 22, 1988 did not even
interpose any counterclaim on possession.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"These circumstances taken together lead to the conclusion
espoused by the appellants, that the deed of sale is a sham transaction, not
representing the true intent of the parties and that no consideration passed or
was received.  x x x.</blockquote>
