				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In Criminal Case No. 2254 of the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur, Abdula Bernardo, Bangon Tanog, Datu Mohamad, Ogka Moro, and several John Does were charged with the crime of Robbery in Band with Double Homicide and Frustrated Homicide committed, as follows: <blockquote> <p>"That on October 29, 1962, at about 4:00 P.M., more or less, in Sitio Tangalan, Barrio of Cawayan, Municipality of Alicia, Province of Zamboanga del Sur, Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, together with the other John Does who are still at large more than four of whom had firearms of different calibers and bladed weapons, conspiring, confederating and assisting one another, and with intent to gain by the use of force upon things and violence and intimidation against persons, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, feloniously and criminally assault and raid the said sitio of Tangalan with the use of their firearms and bladed weapons, killing Marcelo Tan <em>alias</em> Marcelo Kee and Pedro Fernandez and wounding Tomas Calamba as a result thereof, and thereafter, took and carried away cash in the amount of Nine Hundred Fifty (P950.00) Pesos, one rifle caliber 22 Squibman Serial No. 37564 worth Three Hundred Fifty (P350.00) Pesos, two men watches worth Seventy Four (P74.00) Pesos, one gold bracelet worth Fifty (P50.00) Pesos and various goods worth Two Hundred (P200.00) Pesos, belonging to said Ignacia Soria and thereafter, entered the house of Cirilo Payapaya and took one transistor radio (Sony) Serial No. 56552 worth Two Hundred (P200.00) Pesos and at the same time entered the house of Norma de Dumapat taking from her the amount of Three Hundred (P300.00) Pesos in cash, which make the total amount of Two Thousand One Hundred Twenty Four (P2,124.00) Pesos; to the damage and prejudice of the owners thereof."</p></blockquote> <p>Trial was held jointly and judgment was rendered on the case on March 11, 1967, whereby the said accused were sentenced, under the charge aforesaid, to suffer the death penalty and to pay jointly and severally the amount of P6,000.00 to the heirs of Marcelo Tan and another P6,000.00 to the heirs of Pedro Fernandez. When the aforesaid judgment was promulgated, however, only two accused, namely: Bangon Tanog and Datu Mohamad, were present since the accused Abdula Bernardo had died while in confinement, and the other accused Ogka Buhisan <em>alias</em> Ogka Moro jumped bail and has remained at large up to the present.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Subsequently, thereafter, the accused Datu Mohamad also died at the New Bilibid Prison Hospital on October 13, 1979,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> and the Court dismissed his appeal insofar as his criminal liability is concerned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></p> <p>The inculpatory facts of the case are as follows:</p> <blockquote> <p>"The evidence for the prosecution has satisfactorily established that at about 4:00 o'clock on the afternoon of October 29, 1962, a band of muslims, more than ten (10) in number, each one of whom was armed with either a carbine, a pistol, a shotgun, or a bladed weapon, arrived in four vintas at Sitio Tangalan, Barrio Cawayan, Municipality of Alicia, Zamboanga del Sur, and swooped down upon the hapless inhabitants of the locality. Once ashore, these marauders from the sea went on a rampage sending the unwary victims, men and women alike, scampering for safety, and seeking refuge in every nook and cranny. Some of the marauders entered the house of Ignacia Soria and, at gunpoint appropriated from her P950.00 cash, one Squibman Rifle worth P350.00 and several unsewed clothings worth P200.00. Immediately thereafter, the same group entered the store of Wee Kee and shot and killed Marcelo Tan (Exhibits 'A' and 'A-1') and Pedro Fernandez (Exhibits 'B' and 'B-1'), and also shot and wounded Tomas Calamba (Exhibit 'C'). A part of the group of marauders armed with carbines also went up the house of Norma Dumapat and at gun point also extorted from her P300.00.</p> <p>"During the brief moment that the marauders were in Tangalan, looting, plundering, pillaging, and killing, the panic-stricken inhabitants could only cringe with fear and abject surrender. When they finally went away, they left in their wake a pall of gloom and the gory cadavers of Marcelo Tan and Pedro Fernandez.</p> <p>"Four of the marauders, namely, Abdula Bernardo, Tangon Tanog, Datu Mohamad, and Ogka Moro <em>alias</em> Ogka Buhisan, were definitely identified by some residents of the sitio who had known them long before the commission of the offense."</p></blockquote> <p>Able counsel appointed for the accused contends that the trial court erred in finding the accused Bangon Tanog and Datu Mohamad guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime for which they are charged.</p> <p>The Court finds the appeal well taken. To begin with, there is no evidence whatsoever that would show that the accused Datu Mohamad had participated in the commission of the crime complained of. The only evidence that would incriminate him is contained in the affidavit of Marcela de Bungcaras wherein she stated that the said Datu Mohamad was one of the malefactors who went to their house and demanded money from her.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> However, Marcela de Bungcaras <em>never</em> testified as a witness. Since the findings of facts and the judgment must rest only and strictly on the evidence tendered, the accused Datu Mohamad should be absolved from liability, both criminal and civil.</p> <p>The evidence presented against the accused Bangon Tanog, consisting of the sole testimony of Ildefonso Berbesada, is, likewise, insufficient to prove the guilt of the said accused beyond reasonable doubt. Ildefonso Berbesada merely testified that he saw Bangon Tanog on board his vinta, sailing towards the landing of Imam Samat Medel, while he, Berbesada, was hiding at the base of a tree in a mangrove swamp. But, Berbesada did not testify, nor is there corroborative or similar testimony, that the accused Bangon Tanog anchored at the landing and joined in the rapine and pillage of the sitio. The testimony of Ildefonso Berbesada reads, as follows:</p> <blockquote> <table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"> <tbody> <tr> <td valign="top" width="10%">"Q</td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">Mr. Berbesada, where were you on October 29, 1962, at about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">I was in my house.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">While you were there in your house, did you take notice of anything that transpired which has a relation to the case that is being tried today?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">As what I have observed was that the people were in commotion.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Will you please tell the Court what this commotion was about?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">There was a shout: 'Bandits, bandits'.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">What were the people doing when you heard the shouting of <em>'Tulisan, tulisan'</em> or 'Bandits, bandits'?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">The people were running.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">On hearing this and seeing people running, what did you do?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">I jumped out of my house.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Where did you go?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">I went to the mangrove to a certain tree.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">What were you doing there?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">I was hiding there.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">While you were hiding there in that tree in the mangrove, did you notice anything that would occur to you as unusual at that particular moment?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">Not long later, while I was hiding I saw 2 vintas of the bandits passed by.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">How many vintas passed by?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">Four vintas.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">Will you please tell the Court where these vintas came from and if you knew where they were going?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;A</td> <td> <div align="justify">The vintas were going to the landing of Imam Samat Medel.</div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">&nbsp;</td> <td> <div align="justify"></div></td></tr> <tr> <td valign="top">"Q</td> <td> <div align="justify">What direction did they come from?</div></td></tr> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td></tr> <tr> <td colspan="2">"ATTY.
