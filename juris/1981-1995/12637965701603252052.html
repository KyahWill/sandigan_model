				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> which seeks to set aside
the decision of the Presidential Assistant for Legal Affairs, permanently
enjoining the Minister of Natural Resources and the Director of the Bureau of
Forest Development (BFD) from enforcing and implementing the decisions of the
Merit Systems Board and the resolutions of the Civil Service Commission which
ordered the appointment of the petitioner to the contested position of
Administrative Officer V in the Bureau of Forest Development.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1982</st1:date>,
the private respondent Filipina V. <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span>, who was a
training officer of the Bureau of Forest Development (<span class="GramE">BFD)</span>
was proposed for appointment to the position of Administrative Officer V, R-73,
Administrative Division of the BFD.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner herein and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Hermecio</span> M. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Agravio</span></span> who hold the positions of
Administrative Officer III, R-70 and Supply Officer V, R-70 respectively, filed
their protest against the proposal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the same date, the Director of the BFD sent a memorandum to
the respondent Minister stating that in the course of the deliberation of the
BFD Promotion Board, the latter found out that there are four BFD Personnel in
the Central Office who are considered "next-in-rank" to the position
of Administrative Officer V namely:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Meram</span>, Administrative Officer III, Range 70, assigned as
Chief of the Internal Control Staff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Hermecio</span> M.
<span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>, Supply Officer V, Range 70, Chief of the
Property Section, designated Asst. Chief of the Administrative Division from <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1981</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1982" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1982</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Malong</span>, Legal Officer,
Range 69, assigned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the Legal
Division.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Atty. Salome T. <span class="SpellE">Cansino</span>, Trial Attorney Range 69, assigned in the Legal
Division."</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 30-31)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his memorandum, the Director also pointed out that the Board found
that Mrs. Filipina V. <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span>, Training Officer, <span class="GramE">Range</span> 60, assigned in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Training</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> was <u>not</u> next-in-rank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1982</st1:date>,
the Civil Service Commission forwarded to the respondent Minister the protests
of the petitioner and <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span> for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1982</st1:date>,
the respondent Minister forwarded the permanent appointment of respondent <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> to take effect on <st1:date year="1982" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1982</st1:date>, as Administrative Officer V to the
Commission for appropriate action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his letter, the Minister explained that he assessed the
recommendation of the Promotions Board and considered also other aspects which
are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">vital </span>to the dynamism of the
service; and upon seeing that respondent <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> is
eminently qualified for the position, the person on whom he can repose his
trust and confidence, and who possesses the necessary integrity, <span class="SpellE">knowledgeability</span> and sound judgment, he decided to appoint
her to the said position for the best interest of the service.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the appointment was approved by the Commission
"subject to the final outcome of the protests against the appointment by <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> <span class="SpellE">Meram</span> and H. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1982</st1:date>,
the respondent Minister rendered a decision, embodied in two separate letters,
dismissing the protests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his letter
to the petitioner which was received by the latter on <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1982</st1:date>, the Minister assured her
"that when another opportunity comes, and I have had a chance to better
appreciate your qualities and capabilities, then I would certainly consider you
for the appointment to a more senior position."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner and <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span> appealed to the
Merit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Systems </span>Board (MSB)
pursuant to paragraph 2, Section 5 of Presidential Decree (P.D.) No. 1409.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1983</st1:date>,
the Merit Systems Board promulgated a decision in favor of <span class="SpellE">Hermecio</span>
M. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>, revoking the previous approval of the
appointment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of respondent <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> and directing the </span>Minister to appoint, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>her stead, <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>
to the contested position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its
decision, the MSB ruled:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>"Based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">on </span>the
foregoing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">qualifications </span>of the
contestants, this Board finds that all parties meet the eligibility
requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Meram</span> are
holders of bachelor's degree supplemented with at least 12 units in management
and/or public administration, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>, although a
third year in Commerce, has relevant in-service trainings/seminars which would
sufficiently offset his one year deficiency in college work and the required 12
units in management/public administration (CSC Res. No. 682, dated July 20,
1977). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Thus, all meet the education
requirement for the contested position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As to the required 5 years experience, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>
has been (an) Administrative<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>Officer
II for four years of progressively responsible <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">experience </span>in all phases of administrative functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same manner, <span class="SpellE">Meram</span>
has been a Disbursing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Officer for </span>more
than one year, a Budget Examiner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for </span>six
months, Cashier IV for five years, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">an
</span>Administrative Officer III for more than three years or a total of about
nine years and six months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand, the relevant experience of <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> consists of
three years in Training Assistant and about one year as Training Officer, which
experiences as <span class="SpellE">Trainor</span>, although may be considered,
are however less than the required five years of progressively responsible
experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, <span class="SpellE">Edralin's</span>
deficiency in the required experience may be offset by her relevant training
and academic <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">units </span>earned in
Master of Public Administration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing, it cannot be said that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span> does not qualify <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">for </span>the position, or that Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Meram's</span>
work experience are not suitable and relevant, and her education not
appropriate to the contested position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the contested position is not confidential in nature but
rather, belongs to the second level in the career service <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">so </span>that trust and confidence are not
the decisive factors in filling the position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Merit Promotion Plan established by the Bureau of Forest
Development shows that the positions considered next-in-rank to the contested

</span>Administrative Officer III (R- 70), Supply Officer IV (R-70), Senior
Legal Officer (R-69).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Meram</span> holds the position of Administrative Officer III, and
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>, Supply Officer IV.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> holds
the position of Training Officer (R-60) which is not listed as
next-in-rank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such being the case, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> is not, while Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Meram</span>
and Mr. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span> are next-in-rank employees to the
contested position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the latter
two should have been considered for the position of Administrative Officer V.</blockquote>

a third year Commerce student, however, has 13 years of relevant experience to
his credit and 23 relevant trainings completed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, for a period of 9 months, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>
was designated Officer-in-Charge, Administrative Division, pursuant to MNR
Special Order No. 359, series of 1981, and there is no showing that he failed
to discharge efficiently the duties and responsibilities of the position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Agravio</span>
is considered more competent and qualified than <span class="SpellE">Meram</span>."

<p class="BODY">Both the petitioner and respondent <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span>
filed motions for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1983</st1:date>, the MSB promulgated
another decision modifying the earlier one and appointed the petitioner, after
finding that <span class="SpellE">Agravio's</span> designation as Assistant
Officer-in-Charge was revoked because he had been ineffective in said position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> appealed to the
Civil Service Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1983</st1:date>, the Commission
dismissed the appeal and on <st1:date year="1984" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1984</st1:date>,
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">it </span>denied the respondent's

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1984</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> filed a letter-petition with the
Office of the President invoking Section 19(6) of P.D. No. 807.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her petition, <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span>
alleged that jurisdiction in promotional contests is lodged with the Ministry
head and appeal by the aggrieved party from decisions of said Ministry head
should be taken to the Office of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the Merit Systems Board and the Civil Service Commission had
no jurisdiction to act on petitioner's appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, on the other hand, filed a motion for execution of
the Commission's decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="6">June 14, 1984</st1:date>,
the Confidential Legal Assistant of the Office of the Presidential Assistant
for Legal Affairs directed the Commission to forward within fifteen (15) days
from receipt thereof, the entire records of the case in view of <span class="SpellE">Edralin's</span> appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1984</st1:date>,
the Commission rejected the order of the Office of the President, stating that
under Section 8, P.D. No. 1409, decisions of the Commission are subject to
review only by the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="10">October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">9, </span>1984</st1:date>, the Minister of

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1984</st1:date>,

to the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It seems that this letter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>taken cognizance of by then
President Marcos because on top of such letter appeared a note in his purported
handwriting which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the above note, Presidential Assistant for
Legal Affairs <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> furnished a copy of <span class="SpellE">Edralin's</span> letter with the President's marginal note to
Director Cortes of the BFD.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 19, 1985, the Director of the BFD issued a memorandum,
informing <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> that the matters which the President
was directing him to suspend are already <u>fait</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue presented in this case is whether or not the

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that by virtue of the above-quoted decree
which was promulgated on June <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">8, </span>1978,
the MSB and the Commission had validly acquired jurisdiction over her formal
protest to the exclusion of all other officials, boards or offices and that,
therefore, the respondent Presidential Assistant for Legal Affairs gravely
abused his discretion when he disregarded and declared as null and void the
decisions of the MSB and the resolutions of the Commission which had already
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and in fact, had already
been executed, enforced and implemented.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Solicitor-General contends that P.D. No.
807 vests exclusive appellate jurisdiction upon the Office of the President in
cases of appeal by a qualified next-in-rank employee from decisions of ministry
(department) heads arising from appointments in three (3) specific cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of them is when said employee is
contesting the appointment of one who is not next-in-rank. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Therefore, the petitioner's protest should
have been elevated to the Office of the President and not to the Commission,
much less to the Merit Systems Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">P.D. No. 807 was promulgated on <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

favor of one who is appointed by transfer and not next-in-rank, or by

in the decision of the MSB on January 13, 1983, the said board found that
respondent <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span> is not an employee who is
"next-in-rank" to the vacated position, and although there is no
mandatory nor peremptory requirement that persons next-in-rank are entitled to
preference in appointments (see <span class="SpellE">Taduran</span> v.
Commissioner of Civil Service, 131 SCRA 66), the very purpose of the civil
service law dictates that persons who are qualified and next-in-rank should be
given preferential consideration when filling up a vacated position through
promotion.</p>
