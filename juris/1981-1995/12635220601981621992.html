This is a petition to review by <em>certiorari </em>the order dated December 21, 1981 of respondent Pacito G. Mutia,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  then Presiding Judge of the Municipal Court (now Municipal Trial 
Court) of Plaridel, Misamis Occidental, which imposed as a condition in 
granting probation to petitioner Florentina L. Baclayon that she refrain
 from continuing with her teaching profession.
<p>
Petitioner, a school teacher, was convicted of the crime of Serious Oral
 Defamation by the then Municipal Court of Plaridel, Misamis Occidental,
 then presided by respondent Pacito G. Mutia for having quarrelled with 
and uttered insulting and defamatory words against Remedios Estillore, 
principal of the Plaridel Central School.  Her conviction was affirmed 
by the Court of Appeals (now Intermediate Appellate Court) and the 
appellate court, taking into account the aggravating circumstance of 
disregard of the respect due the offended party on account of her rank 
and age and the fact that the crime was committed in the office of the 
complainant in the public school building of Plaridel, Misamis 
Occidental where public authorities are engaged in the discharge of 
their duties during office hours, increased the penalty imposed by 
respondent judge and sentenced petitioner to one year, 8 months, 21 days
 of arresto mayor in its maximum period to 2 years and 4 months of 
prision correccional in its minimum period.
</p><p>
The sentence was promulgated on September 9, 1981.  On the same date 
petitioner applied for probation with respondent judge who referred the 
application to a Probation Officer.  The Post-Sentence Investigation 
Report favorably recommended the granting of petitioner's probation for a
 period of three (3) years.
</p><p>
On December 21, 1981, respondent Judge issued an order granting 
petitioner's probation, but modified the Probation Officer's 
recommendation by increasing the period of probation to five (5) years 
and by imposing the following conditions:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(a)  To present herself to the probation officer designated to 
undertake her supervision at such place as may be specified in the order
 within seventy-two hours from receipt of said order; </p>
  <p>
    (b)    To report to the Probation Office or any specified place 
designated by the Probation Officer at least once a month in person;
  </p>
  <p>
    (c)    To reside at the premise approved by the Probation Officer 
and not change her residence without prior written approval;
  </p>
  <p>
    (d)    To permit the Probation Officer to visit her house and place of work or an authorized Social Worker;
  </p>
  <p>
    (e)    To refrain from drinking intoxicating liquor to excess;
  </p>
  <p>
    (f)     To pay the cost;
  </p>
  <p>
    (g)    To satisfy any other condition related to the rehabilitation 
of the defendant and not unduly restrictive of her liberty or 
incompatible with her freedom of conscience; and
  </p>
  <p> (h)    To refrain from continuing her teaching profession."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner's plea for deletion of the last condition was rejected by 
respondent judge.  Hence, the petition at bar alleging grave abuse of 
discretion in the imposition of the said condition that petitioner 
should "refrain from continuing her teaching profession." The petitioner
 submits that said condition is not only detrimental and prejudicial to 
her rights but is also not in accordance with the purposes, objectives 
and benefits of the probation law and prays that the said condition be 
deleted from the order granting her probation.  On petitioner's motion, 
the Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining respondent 
judge from enforcing the said questioned condition.
</p><p>
The Court finds merit in the petition.
</p><p>
The conditions which trial courts may impose on a probationer may be 
classified into general or mandatory and special or discretionary. The 
mandatory conditions, enumerated in Section 10 of the Probation Law, 
require that the probationer should (a) present himself to the probation
 officer designated to undertake his supervision at such place as may be
 specified in the order within 72 hours from receipt of said order, and 
(b) report to the probation officer at least once a month at such time 
and place as specified by said officer.  Special or discretionary 
conditions are those additional conditions, listed in the same Section 
10 of the Probation Law, which the courts may additionally impose on the
 probationer towards his correction and rehabilitation outside of 
prison.  The enumeration, however, is not inclusive.  Probation statutes
 are liberal in character<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  
and enable courts to designate practically any term it chooses as long 
as the probationer's constitutional rights are not jeopardized.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  There are innumerable conditions which may be relevant to the 
rehabilitation of the probationer when viewed in their specific 
individual context.  It should, however, be borne in mind that the 
special or discretionary conditions of probation should be realistic, 
purposive and geared to help the probationer develop into a law-abiding 
and self-respecting individual.  Conditions should be interpreted with 
flexibility in their application and each case should be judged on its 
own merits - on the basis of the problems, needs and capacity of the 
probationer.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The very liberality of the probation should not be made a tool by trial courts to stipulate instead unrealistic terms.
</p><p>
Petitioner is a teacher and teaching is the only profession she knows 
and as such she possesses special skills and qualifications.  Thus, she 
was designated as District Guidance Coordinator and always designated as
 District-in-Charge whenever the District Supervisor is out of town.  
She is usually selected to represent her district in seminars, meetings 
and conferences.  She also excelled in her study of Child Study and 
Development.  It also appears that she is an outstanding member of the 
Misamis Occidental Girl Scout Council, having served as Physical 
Education &amp; Girl Scout Field Advisor of the District, Adviser of the
 District Girl Scout Leaders Association, Adviser of the District 
Federated Girl Scout Barangay Troop Committee, acts as resource person 
in District and Division Level Girl Scout encampments and re-elected 
Board Member of the Misamis Occidental Girl Scout Council.  To order the
 petitioner to refrain from teaching would deprive the students and the 
school in general the benefits that may be derived from her training and
 expertise.  While it is true that probation is a mere privilege and its
 grant rests solely upon the discretion of the court, this discretion is
 to be exercised primarily for the benefit of organized society and only
 incidentally for the benefit of the accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Equal regard to the demands of justice and public interest must be observed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>
  In this case, teaching has been the lifetime and only calling and 
profession of petitioner.  The law requires that she devote herself to a
 lawful calling and occupation during probation.  Yet, to prohibit her 
from engaging in teaching would practically prevent her from complying 
with the terms of the probation.
</p><p>
Respondents contend that petitioner's final conviction carries with it 
the accessory penalties in addition to the principal penalty of 
imprisonment; and since petitioner was sentenced to arresto mayor in its
 maximum period to prision correccional in its minimum period, she must 
likewise suffer the accessory penalties of suspension from public office
 and from the right to follow a profession or calling, and that of 
perpetual special disqualification from the right of suffrage.  This 
cannot apply to petitioner, however, because she was granted probation. 
 The imposition of her sentence of imprisonment was thereby suspended 
and necessarily, the imposition of the accessory penalties was likewise 
thereby suspended.
</p><p>
An order placing defendant on "probation" is not a "sentence" but is 
rather in effect a suspension of the imposition of sentence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  It is not a final judgment but is rather an "interlocutory judgment" 
in the nature of a conditional order placing the convicted defendant 
under the supervision of the court for his reformation, to be followed 
by a final judgment of discharge, if the conditions of the probation are
 complied with, or by a final judgment of sentence if the conditions are
 violated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
</p><p>
In view of all the foregoing, the Court grants the petition and hereby 
orders that paragraph (h) of the questioned order granting probation 
which requires that petitioner refrain from continuing with her teaching
 profession be deleted.  The temporary restraining order is hereby made 
permanent.  No costs.
