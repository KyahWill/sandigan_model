				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the decision of the Court of
First Instance of Manila, Branch IV, which dismi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">s</span>sed the complaint in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case earlier filed with the City Court of Manila, Branch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">XIII. </span>The respondent court reversed
the decision of the city court after finding the latter without jurisdiction
over the case on the ground that no demand was made by petitioner as required
by Section 2, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court. On a find­ing <span class="GramE">that</span>
only a question of law was involved, the Court of Appeals certified the case to
us for deci­sion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Eduardo M. <span class="SpellE">Lesaca</span> is the
owner of the properties located at <st1:street><st1:address>80-0 <span class="SpellE">Chica</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> and 29-F, <span class="SpellE">Isla</span> de Romero, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
both leased to respondent, Tan Chun, on a month-to-month basis, payable in
advance within the first five days of each month, at the rate of P770.00 and
P562.00 rentals per month respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1974">April 15, 1974</st1:date>,
the petitioner sent two letters to the respondent, advising him of an increase
by 50% in the rentals for both premises, to take effect in <st1:date month="5" day="1" year="1974">May 1, 1974</st1:date>. The increased rate was subsequently
reduced to 25%, hence, <st1:street><st1:address>80-0 <span class="SpellE">Chica</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street> was raised from P562.00 to P702.50 and 29-F
<span class="SpellE">Isla</span> de Romero, from P770.00 to P962.50 rentals per
month.</p>

month-to-month lease effective M<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a</span>y,
1975. This letter will therefore, serve as the demand to pay the increased
rental <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">and/or to vacate said
premises."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 25, 1975, the respondent sent by regis­tered mail to the
petitioner, a Metro Bank and Trust Company Check, dated June 25, 1975 in the
sum of P2<span class="GramE">,310.00</span> in payment for rentals in arrears for
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>29-F <span class="SpellE">Isla</span>
de Romero premises and a Consolidated Bank and Trust Company Check dated June
25, 1975 in the amount of P1,686.00 for the 80-0 <span class="SpellE">Chica</span>
premises. Both payments were based on the old rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner referred the matter to his lawyer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who </span>filed a complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> before the City Court of Manila. The petitioner
alleged in his complaint that the premises are commercial in nature and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that the </span>respondent does business
under the names "Philippine Cotton Mop Manufacturing" and "Ever
Ready Hardware".</p>

<p class="BODY">In an amended decision, the above court rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">judgment </span>ordering the respondent to
vacate the premises in question and to pay increased rentals beginning May,
1975 until he actually vacates said premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his appeal to the Court of First Instance, the respondent
contended that "the inferior court erred in assuming jurisdiction over
this case and/or in not holding that the present action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
is premature."</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned decision of the respondent court states inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span>:</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration filed by the peti­tioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was </span>denied by the lower court, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hence this </span>petition for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only question to be resolved in this petition is whether or
not the demand to vacate provided under Section <span class="GramE">2,</span>
Rule 70 of the Rules of Court in unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
cases is required by the circumstances of the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above rule provides:</p>

<blockquote>Rule 70, Sec. 2. - <u>Landlord to proceed </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">against tenant only after demand</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. No </span>landlord, or his legal

to comply<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>with the conditions of
his lease, unless the tenant shall have failed to pay such rent or comply with
such conditions for a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">period </span>of
fifteen (15) days or five (5) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">days </span>in

serving written notice of such demand upon the person found on the premises, or
by posting such notice on the premises if no persons be found thereon.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner maintains that the contract of lease between him and
the respondent is on a month-to-month basis which terminates at the end of each
month, with­out the necessity of a special demand. Therefore, the above-quoted
rule does not apply as the action instituted by him is for the termination of
the lease because of the expiration of its term. He cites the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of <u>Co <span class="SpellE">Tiamco</span> v.
Diaz</u> </span>(75 Phil. 672) where the court ruled that "a demand is a
pre-requisite to an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>,
when the action is 'for failure to pay rent due or comply with the conditions
of his lease', and not where the action is to termi­nate the lease because of
the expiration of its terms."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A </span>lease contract
"on a month-to-month basis" provides for a definite period and may be
terminated at the end of any month. <span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Rantael</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 97 SCRA 453; Cruz v. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, Jr.,
120 SCRA 497).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, when respondent Tan Chun refused to pay the
increased rentals for the month of May, 1975, the lease contract was deemed
terminated as of said month, not only because of the letters sent to him by the
petitioner informing him that the lease was to be terminated effective May,
1975, but more so by his refusal to pay the increased rate while remaining in
the premises. <span class="GramE">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Vda</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Considering that <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> was
occupying the premises in question on a month to month basis, it can not be
denied that appellant had the right to terminate the lease at the end of any
month. The contract bet­<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ween </span>the
parties herein must therefore be deemed terminated upon <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
refusal to pay the P60.00 monthly rental demanded by appellant — <span class="GramE">which</span> does not appear to be exorbitant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Bulahan</u></span><u>, et

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The rule is settled that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">owner of </span>the land leased has the right not only to terminate the
lease at the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">expiration of the term, </span>but
also to demand a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">new </span>rate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>rent. The tenant or lessee has the
option either to accept the new rent or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">vacate

<p class="BODY">We distinguish the facts of this petition from the <span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span><u>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Murga</span></u> case, 25 SCRA 441, where the Court applied the
ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Manotok</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Guinto</span></u>,
101 Phil. 383, as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">
</span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <span class="SpellE">x</span> We, </span>however,
do not find such notice (the alternative either to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">pay </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">increased </span>rental
or otherwise to vacate the land) to be the demand con<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">templated </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">by </span>the Rules of Court in 'unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>'
cases. When after the notice the appellant elected to stay, he thereby merely
assumed the obligation of paying the new rental and could not be ejected <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">until </span>he defaulted in said obligation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and necessary demand was </span>first
made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Such was the ruling in <span class="SpellE"><u>Vda</u></span><u>.
de </u><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Murga</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>because in said case, the lease
contract provided that upon its expiration, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
had the option <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>purchase the
improvements introduced by the lessee on the leased premises; but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the event that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> did not exercise such option, then the contract was
auto­matically renewed. Therefore, the court correctly ruled that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>more definite demand to vacate was
necessary to give the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">lessor</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the right </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">eject the </span>lessee <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">from
the premises. However, in the present </span>case, the petitioner had the right
to terminate the lease at the end of every month as he did so in May, 1975,
when the lessee refused to pay the increased rentals. The lessee, therefore,
had no alternative but to vacate the premises and his refusal made him a <span class="SpellE">deforciant</span> who could be ousted judicially without the need
of the more specific demand he insists upon. Furthermore, even assuming that
there was a need for such a demand in the instant case, we believe that the
alternative demand to pay the increased rental onto vacate the premises is
sufficient under the law to enable the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to
bring an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case because as stated earlier,
the lessee lost all his rights to remain in the premises upon the expiration of
the lease contract in May, 1975. There <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is,
</span>there­fore, no need for a more definite and unconditional demand to
vacate as he had no legal right to remain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">in
</span>the premises. In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">PNB v.
Animas</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, (117 </span>SCRA
735) where similarly, the possessor had no right to remain in the premises, we
ruled:</p>

demand was made upon the defendant to leave the premises that her possession
became <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">unlawful."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the above-cited case, we construed the demand made by the
petitioner to vacate the premises or to deliver the fruits of the land
sufficient to make the respondent's possession of the premises illegal. The
demand in the case at bar should be construed in the same manner.</p>
