				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On June 27, 1990, petitioner JISSCOR Independent Union (JIU)
filed a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>petition for
certification election among the rank-and-file employees of the Jacinto Iron
and Steel Sheets Corporation (JISSCOR) before the Med­-Arbitration Unit of the
Department of Labor and Employ­ment (DOLE), National Capital Region, Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">By agreement of the petitioner, JIU, the inter­venor SMJ-ALU and
the JISSCOR management, the Med-Arbi­ter issued an Order on August 29, 1990,
setting the certification election on September 4, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on the appointed date, instead of an election, as
previously agreed upon by all the parties, another pre-election conference was
held in the Depart­ment of Labor and Employment.  Another agreement was entered into by JIU, JISSCOR and SMJ-ALU,
providing that the election would be conducted on September 6, 1990 from 8:00
A.M. to 3:00 P.M., and that "the mandatory five (5) days posting is hereby
waived by agreement of the parties" (p. 172, Rollo),</p>

<p class="BODY">The results of the certification election held on September 6,
1990 were the following:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:60.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"JISSCOR Independent Union

<blockquote>(p. 21, Rollo.)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The JIU, which obtained only the second highest number of votes,
registered a protest in the minutes of the election stating that:  "we file protest on the following
grounds using visor, emblem" (p. 174, Rollo).<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On September 11, 1990, the JIU filed a formal protest before the
Department of Labor, National Capital Region, on the following grounds:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">“I.</span>  The election was conducted very disorderly and irregular (sic) as there
was no compliance of (sic) mandatory posting of notice of certification
election and necessary list of qualified voters in accordance to (sic) Section
1 of Rule VI of the Implement­ing Rules and Regulations;<span style="font-size:
12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">II.</span>  The lack of the required posting had mislead (sic) and/or misinformed
the voters/workers of the manner of voting, thus it resulted to some spoiled
votes;<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">III.</span> Escorting of workers by SMJ?ALU
officers and members, especially a certain Rene Tan from their place of work to
the election registration;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">IV.</span> Forcing the workers to vote for
SMJ-ALU by posting of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>very big
streamer with print­ed words:  Vote!
Samahang Manggagawa Ng JISSCOR-ALU at the entrance front door of the chapel
where the election was held;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">“V.</span>  Forcing the workers to vote for SMJ-ALU by wearing of sunvisors and pins
with printed words:  Vote! SMJ-ALU
before and during voting inside the polling place (chapel)." (pp. 45-46,
Rollo.)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1990, Med-Arbiter Tomas F. Falcon­itin issued an
Order declaring the September 6, 1990 certification election null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 12, 1990, the winner, respondent SMJ-­ALU appealed to
the DOLE Secretary and prayed that it be declared the sole and exclusive
bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employees of JISSCOR.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 18, 1991, a decision was rendered by the Secretary of
Labor and Employment granting the appeal of SMJ-ALU and setting aside the Order
dated November 21, 1990 of the Med-Arbiter.  A new order was entered certifying SMJ-ALU as the sole and exclusive
bargaining agent of all the rank-and-file workers of JISSCOR pursuant to the
results of the certification election conducted on September 6, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time, the JIU filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i>
alleging that the public respondents commit­ted grave abuse of discretion
amounting to excess of jurisdiction in certifying SMJ-ALU as the sole and
exclusive bargaining agent of the rank-and-file employ­ees of JISSCOR.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3, Rule VI, Book V of the Omnibus Rules implementing the
Labor Code provides that the grounds of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a
</span>protest may be filed on the spot or in writing with the representation
officer and shall be contained in the minutes of the proceedings.  Protests not so raised are deemed waived.</p>

<p class="BODY">The minutes of the certification election show, however, that JIU
only protested against the use of emblem, visor, pin.  Hence, other "protests [such as the posting in the chapel
entrance of a huge streamer with the words:  "Vote! Samahang Manggagawa ng JISSCOR-ALU"] not so raised are
deemed waived" (Sec. 3, Rule VI, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing
the Labor Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the petitioner's contention that the
non-posting of the notice of the certification election as prescribed by
Section 1, Rule VI, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code
misled and <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">confused the
workers regarding the mechanics of the election.  The petitioner is estopped from raising that issue for it signed
an agreement with the private respondent to waive the mandatory five (5) days
posting of election notices.  The
doctrine of estoppel is based on grounds of public policy, fair dealing, good
faith and justice, and its purpose is to forbid one to speak against his own
act, representations, or commitments to the injury of one to whom they were
directed and who reasonably relied thereon (PNB vs. Court of Appeals, 94 SCRA
357).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The results of the certification election belie the petitioner's
allegation that the workers were misinformed about the election for the records
show that out of 104 eligible voters, 99 were able to cast their votes and only
3 were spoiled ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the alleged use of sunvisors, pins, emblems and the posting of
a huge streamer, the Undersecretary found:</p>

<p class="2Q">"x x x nothing in the records shows that the alleged wearing
of sunvisors and pins, the posting of huge streamers, as well as the alleged
escorting of voters by SMJ-ALU have unduly pressured, influ­enced, vitiated, or
in any manner affected the choice of the workers of their bargaining
agent." (p. 49, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">That finding of fact of the head of an administra­tive agency is
conclusive upon the court (Reyes vs. Minister of Labor, 170 SCRA 134).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no grave abuse of discretion on the
part of the public respondents, the Secretary and Undersecretary of Labor and
Employment, in rendering the questioned decision, the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
is hereby DISMISSED.  The questioned
decision of the Under­secretary of Labor, by authority of the Secretary of
Labor, is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>

Quiason, JJ., <span style="font-style:normal">concur.</span></span><br>
