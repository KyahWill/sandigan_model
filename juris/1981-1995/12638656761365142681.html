the judgment of the trial court, with costs against the defendants-<span style="">appellants.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their petition for review of that decision, the petitioners
allege that the Court of Appeals erred:</p>

estate </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">result of accretion;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is unmeritorious and must be denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The finding of the Court of Appeals that there<span style=""> had </span>been <span style="">accretions to </span>the lots of the private respondents who did not
lose the ownership of such accretions even after they were separated from the
principal <span style="">lots </span>by the sudden
change of course of the river, is a finding of fact<span style=""> which is </span>conclusive on this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That finding is <span style="">supported by </span>Art. <span style="">457 </span>of
the New <span style="">Civil </span>Code which <span style="">provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 457.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
owners of lands adjoining the banks of rivers <span class="GramE">belong the
accretion</span> which they gradually receive from the effects of the current
of the waters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(366)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accretion benefits a riparian owner when the following requisites
are present:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the deposit be
gradual and imperceptible; (2) that it resulted from the effects of the current
of the water; and (3) that <span style="">the land
where accretion takes place is adjacent to the bank of a river (Republic vs.
CA, 132 SCRA 514).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">All these requisites of accretion are present in <span style="">this case for, as the trial court found:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> River did move year by year from 1919 to 1968 or

period, the <span class="SpellE">alluviun</span> (sic) deposited on the other
side has become greater in area than the original lands of the plaintiffs in
both cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Still the addition in every

said <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename>

one time mayor of Solana, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, said <span style="">so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Arturo

Solana Cadastre was executed in 1950 it overlapped portions of <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span> Cadastre executed in 1919.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This could not have happened if that part of <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span> Cadastre was not eroded by the overflow of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These testimonies cannot be destroyed by the

</span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span>
<span class="GramE">(p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court confirmed that the accretion on the western
bank of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> had been going on from 1919
up to 1968 or for a period of 49 <span style="">years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was </span>gradual and imperceptible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only when Lot No. 3351, with an original area
of 5 hectares described in the free patent that was issued to <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Melad</span> in June, <span style="">1956, was resurveyed in 1968 did it become </span><span style="">known </span><span style="">that 6.6 hectares had been added to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lot No. 3351, covered by a homestead patent issued in June, 1950 to
Pablo <span class="SpellE">Binayug</span>, grew from its original area of 18
hectares, by an additional 50 hectares through alluvium as the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cagayan</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">River</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> gradually moved to the east.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These accretions belong to the riparian
owners upon whose lands the alluvial deposits were made (<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Tuason</span>, 9 Phil. 408; Director of Lands vs. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, 87 Phil. 806).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for this principle is because, if lands bordering on streams
are exposed to floods and other damage due <span style="">to</span> the destructive force of the waters, and if by virtue of law
they are subject to encumbrances</span> and various kinds of easements, it is
only just that <span style="">such <span style="">risks or </span>dangers as may prejudice the
owners </span>thereof should in some way be compensated by the right of
accretion (Cortes vs. City of Manila, 10 Phil. 567).</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents' ownership of the accretion to their
lands was not lost upon the sudden and abrupt change of the course of the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> River in 1968 or 1969 when it reverted to its old
1919 bed, and separated or transferred said accretions to the other side (or
eastern bank) of the river.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Articles 459
and 463 of the New Civil Code apply to this situation.</p>

<blockquote>"Art.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>459<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever</span> the
current of a river, creek or torrent segregates from an estate on its bank a
known portion of land and transfers it to another estate, the owner of the land

that he removes the same within two years."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Art. 463.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whenever the
current of a river divides itself into branches, leaving a piece of land or
part thereof isolated, the owner of the land retains his ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>He</u> <u>also</u> <u>retains</u> <u>it</u>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the case at bar, the sudden change of
course of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place> as a result of a strong
typhoon in 1968 caused a <span style="">portion </span>of
