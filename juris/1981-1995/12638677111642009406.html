				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Before <span class="GramE">Us</span> are two petitions filed by <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Talag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Joaquin, Mariano <span class="SpellE">Talag</span>,
Maria <span class="SpellE">Talag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> <span class="SpellE">Talag</span> and Heirs of Francisco <span class="SpellE">Talag</span>
(hereafter "petitioners").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
first is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> (G.R. No. 84431) under Rule
45, and the other is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with
preliminary injunction/restraining order (G.R. No. 86053).</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts appear undisputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> Joaquin (now
deceased) and his second wife Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> (also
deceased) were the owner's of two parcels of land/fishponds located in <span class="SpellE">Paombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> with areas of
201,296 square meters, and 76,635 square meters, or a total of 28 hectares,
more or less as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. 17840 and 22388
of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 26, 1958, the Joaquin spouses executed a document of
sale of this property for and in consideration of P32,000.00 in favor of <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Joaquin (daughter of <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span>
Joaquin by his previous marriage), and <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangil</span> (nieces of Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>),<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
whose names Transfer Certificate of Titles Nos. 21456 and 31455 were issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, even after the execution of said sale, the Joaquin
spouses continued to perform acts of ownership and possession over the property
by leasing the same and collecting rentals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1966 the Joaquin spouses leased said property to <span class="SpellE">Feliza</span>
<span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario and her children <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Talag</span>, et al. (petitioners herein) for 4 years and
collected the rentals.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In 1969, <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> Joaquin died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His widow, Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>,
continued in acts of ownership of the property.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In 1970 she renewed the lease of the property to the <span class="SpellE">Talags</span>
for four (4) years, and collected the rentals.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1972, after the termination of the lease the <span class="SpellE">Sangils</span> for the first time asserted their claim of title
and right of possession over these two fishponds by filing Civil Case No. 4160
for recovery of possession with damages in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> against <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Joaquin
(their co-vendee who did not join their cause) and the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1974, Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, despite the
fact that she was no longer the registered owner of the fishponds again
extended the lease of the <span class="GramE">fishponds</span> to petitioners <span class="SpellE">Talag</span> for four (4) years and collected the rentals.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1978</st1:date>,
Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> again extended the lease for four (4)
years <span style="">to </span>the <span class="SpellE">Talags</span>
and collected the rentals.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
And on <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1979</st1:date>,
she again extended the <span style="">lease </span>agreement
<span style="">with </span>said petitioners up to <st1:date year="1997" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1997</st1:date>, (a period longer
than the lifespan of private respondents) and collected the rentals of P600<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the aforesaid civil case the title and right of possession
over the fishponds in question are in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Sangils</span> claim 3/4 portion of the property
predicated on the aforementioned deed of sale and transfer of titles in their
names.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The original complaint claimed
that petitioners were in possession of the 28 hectares of the fishponds, but
was subsequently amended twice with the allegation that defendants were in
legal possession of two (2) hectares of fishponds only, against the categorical
statements of petitioners that they are in possession of the entire 28
hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners (including <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Joaquin who was a co-vendee of <span class="SpellE">Sangils</span> who filed a separate answer) likewise claim that
the sale was simulated and fictitious and it was not intended to transfer title
to the <span class="SpellE">Sangils</span>; that the sale was devised merely to
insure Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana's</span> ownership of the fishpond
from any possible claim of <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span> Joaquin's children
of his previous marriage; that the consideration which was exceedingly low was
never paid by the supposed vendees; that even after said sale in 1958, the <span class="SpellE">Joaquins</span> continued acts of ownership by leasing the
fishponds and collecting rentals; that after the death of <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span>
Joaquin, Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span> extended the lease of the
fishponds as owner to petitioners <span class="SpellE">Talag</span> and collected
the rentals; that the <span class="SpellE">Sangils</span> never protested and it
was only 14 years after the sale that the complaint for recovery of possession
was filed in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On motion of petitioners, the trial court then presided by then
Judge <span class="SpellE">Floreliana</span> Castro <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
(later Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals) issued an order enjoining
private respondents <span class="SpellE">Sangils</span> from interfering with and
disturbing petitioners’ peaceful possession of the fishponds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents questioned said order in
a <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition proceeding in the Court of Appeals docketed
as AC-<span style="">G</span>.R. No. 01491 but the
petition was denied in its orders of August 30 and October 22, both of 1973.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial then proceeded in the lower court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In October, 1975, private respondents filed a<span style=""> </span>motion for the appointment of a
receiver of said fishponds but this was denied by then Judge <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paras</span> (now a member of
this Court) in an order of March 24, 1976,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
on the grounds, among others, (a) in cases involving disputes concerning title
and possession as in this case, the remedy of receivership is not proper; (b)
the property involved here does not fall under the instance of being
irreparably<span style=""> </span>on materially
injured as required by law to warrant receivership; and (c) the petition for
receivership was vague about what properties receivership was sought whether 28
hectares or <span style="">2 </span>hectares.</p>

<p class="BODY">Over 9 years later, private respondents reiterated their motion
for receivership but this was denied<span style=""> </span>by
then Presiding Judge <span class="SpellE">Zotico</span> <span class="SpellE">Tolete</span>
in the order of <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1985</st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>considering “the conflicting interest
of both parties” of which there is as yet no final determination.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Private respondents then
filed a motion for <span style="">reconsideration of
said order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time Presiding Judge <span class="SpellE">Braulio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Dayday</span> of the trial
court granted the motion in an order of </span><st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="1"><span style="">January 27, 1986</span></st1:date><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> by appointing one Felipe Salazar as receiver
upon filing a bond of P60<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration filed by
petitioners </span>was <span style="">denied in an
order of </span><st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="6"><span style="">June 30, </span>1986</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioners filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with
restraining order or preliminary injunction in the <span style="">Court </span>of Appeals docketed as <span style="">AC-G.R. No. <span class="GramE">SP-09481, <span style="">wherein they sought to annul and restrain the enforcement of the
aforesaid orders of </span></span></span><st1:date year="1986" day="27" month="1"><span class="GramE"><span style="">January 27,
 1986</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style=""> and </span></span><st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="6"><span class="GramE"><span style="">June 30, 1986</span></span></st1:date><span class="GramE"><span style=""> of the trial court.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
due course, a decision was rendered by the appellate court on </span><st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="8"><span style="">August 3<span class="GramE">,1987</span></span></st1:date><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i>

 1986</span></st1:date><span style=""> with costs
against petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration of said decision filed by
petitioners was denied in a resolution of the appellate court of July 28, 1988
by modifying its decision limiting the receivership to seven (7) hectares of
the property corresponding to the share of <span class="SpellE">Remigia</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangil</span> it appearing that <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sangil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangil</span> withdrew from the case and/or were no longer
interested in the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioners filed the herein petition (G.R. 84431) for
review on <i>certiorari</i> praying that the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
decision of the Court of Appeals of August 3, 1987 and resolution of July 28,
1988 be reversed and set aside, and in lieu thereof, judgment be rendered
denying receivership in Civil Case No. 4160 of the now Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meanwhile, private respondents filed two (2) motions for
reconsideration of the resolution of the Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1988</st1:date>, which motions were
opposed by petitioners on the ground that the appellate court had lost
jurisdiction over the case by the filing of the present petition in this
Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1988</st1:date> the appellate court issued a resolution
granting the motions for reconsideration extending the receivership to
twenty-one (21) hectares out of the twenty-eight (28) hectares of the property
appearing that <span class="SpellE">Restituta</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangil</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Sangil</span> are still
interested <span style="">in </span>the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioners filed in this Court the instant petition in
G.R. No. 86053 for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary
injunction or restraining order seeking the annulment of said resolution of the
Court of Appeals of <st1:date year="1988" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1988</st1:date>
for having been rendered without jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="5">May 15, 1989</st1:date>,
this Court resolved to deny the petition as the establishment of a receivership
and the consequent appointment of a receiver is a question of fact and
dependent principally on the discretion of the Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the filing of a motion for
reconsideration, <span class="GramE">We</span> took a second <span style="">look </span>at the issues raised by
petitioners and found that a reversal <span style="">is
</span><span style="">in </span>order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court through Judge <span class="SpellE">Dayday</span> in
the order of <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1986</st1:date>
granting the motion for reconsideration of private respondents stated:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>While</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>true</u> <u>that</u> <u>the</u>

<u>should</u> <u>be</u> <u>declared</u> <u>null</u> <u>and</u> <u>void</u> <u>on</u>
<u>the claim</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>defendants</u> <u>that</u> <u>it</u> <u>was</u>

<u>or</u> <u>simulated</u> <u>sale</u></span><span style="">, </span><span style="">it is a </span><span style="">well-</span><span style="">known doctrine of law that a Torrens title is generally, conclusively,
presumed to be </span>legally <span style="">issued to
the person or persons appearing therein to be the owner of the property covered
thereby.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And the </span>only <span style="">way to overcome such presumption is to
present clear, convincing </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">strong evidence to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u><span style="">At</span></u><span style=""> <u>the</u> <u>present</u>

presumption in favor </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">plaintiffs.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"Therefore, by correct
</span>legal thinking and sound factual reasoning, the plaintiffs, <span style="">by virtue of their Torrens title which has
not yet been declared null and void, should be considered to have successfully

may be properly </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">adequately preserved and </span><span style="">administered during the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">pendency</span></span><span style=""> of the litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(The case has been pending for more than 10
years already)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is clearly admitted by the <span style="">trial </span>court <span style="">that </span>the respective claims of the parties have yet to be determined
and that petitioners have just started the presentation of evidence, and yet it
forthwith arrived at <span style="">a </span>conclusion
that private respondents have a clear legal right to the property as they have
a title over the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not so
much consider the need of giving petitioners the opportunity to present all
their evidence to prove their claim that said sale is fictitious and simulated
before venturing into an opinion.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of the appellate court its role was solely to determine
if the trial court committed a grave abuse of discretion in granting the
receivership based on the undisputed facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, it went beyond the scope of its authority by discussing the
disputed aspects of the case on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It analyzed the reasonableness of rentals, alleged laxity in the records
keeping of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Talag</span>, and his failure to get
receipts of rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It overlooked the
fact that the <span class="GramE">receipt of payments of rentals are</span>
reflected in the lease agreements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
made the observation that since it was Atty. <span class="SpellE">Talag</span>
who notarized the deed of sale he is<span style=""> </span>now
<span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to question the legality of the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court should have also
considered that although Atty. <span class="SpellE">Talag</span> notarized the
deed of sale, he and the other petitioners still continued to deal with the <span class="SpellE">Joaquins</span> and upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Sixto</span>
Joaquin with Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>, as owners and <span class="SpellE">lessors</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>C<span style="">an </span>this not be <span class="GramE">an <u>indicia</u></span><span style=""> </span>that the said deed of sale was only
simulated?</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, in the resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="7">July 28, 1988</st1:date> the appellate court made a finding that
petitioners were inept in the management of the fishponds and that the
extension of the lease up to 1997 is anomalous.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the other hand, petitioners contend that they have taken <span style="">good </span>care of the fishpond, improved
and developed the same and spent over P850<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
which they will establish during the trial and that they can prove that the
lease agreements entered into are regular and the rentals were duly received by
Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court should have realized the petitioners were
just beginning to present evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
should be allowed to adduce all evidence before any conclusion should be
arrived at on the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
the appellate court practically pre-empted the authority of the trial court to
decide the case on the merits even while the trial on the merits was hardly
halfway through.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it is there are many questions that need to be considered as
against the deed of sale and title of private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did it take private respondents 14 years
after the sale to go to court?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why is it
that their co-vendee <span class="SpellE">Victorina</span> Joaquin did not join
their cause and instead joined the <span class="SpellE">Talags</span> as one of
the petitioners asserting that the sale is fictitious and <span class="GramE">simulated.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Is the price of P32<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
adequate for 28 hectares?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did the <span class="SpellE">Joaquins</span> and thereafter Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
continue to perform acts of ownership after the sale and the <span class="SpellE">Sangils</span> never complained until 14 years later?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did Maria <span class="SpellE">Laxamana</span>
file a separate action for annulment of this sale and a motion to intervene in
Civil Case No. 4160 seeking nullification of the sale?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why did private respondents ask for delivery
of possession of only two (2) hectares in the second amended complaint and now
seek receivership over twenty-one (21) hectares?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These are among the many questions that
remain to be answered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this can be
resolved only after the trial on the merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">As it is now, the question of title <span style="">and </span>possession to the fishponds cannot be determined nor is
there any clear indication one way or the other.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the appointment of a receiver is improper and has <span style="">no </span>basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power to <span style="">appoint a receiver </span>should not be exercised when it is likely to

<p class="BODY">As to the petition in G.R. No. 80653, the Court finds that while
it is true petitioners have already filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in
this Court questioning <span style="">the decision of
the </span>appellate court of August 3, 1987, and the resolution of July 28,
1988, nevertheless, the appellate court has not lost jurisdiction over the case
as private respondents filed their timely motions for reconsideration of the
resolution of July 28, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, the resolution of the appellate court of November 15, 1988
granting said motions for reconsideration and <span style="">extending </span>receivership to twenty-one (21) hectares portion of the
property, should be struck down to be without lawful basis <span style="">as </span>hereinabove discussed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To this extent the petition must be granted.</p>
