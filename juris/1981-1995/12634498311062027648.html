				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Mayuga</span>, <span class="SpellE">KBL</span> candidate, was
proclaimed on <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1980</st1:date>
as the duly elected mayor of San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> by
the Board of Canvassers with a majority of 30 votes following the elections of <st1:date year="1980" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 8, 1980, private respondent German M. <span class="SpellE">Tenorio</span>, the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party
candidate filed an election protest against petitioner, alleging that the
ballots in voting centers Nos. 4-A, 6-A, 8, 9, 9-A, 9-B, 10, 10-A, 13 and 14
were not correctly appreciated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1980</st1:date>,
private respondent German M. <span class="SpellE">Tenorio</span> amended his
petition by adding voting centers Nos. 2, 2-A and 4-B.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1980</st1:date>,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mayuga</span> filed his answer with
counter-protest and interposed as affirmative defense, among others, that the
petition and amended petition were both filed out of time and hence
respondent's cause of action has prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 29, 1980, petitioner objected to the revision of the
ballots from voting centers Nos. 2, 2-A and 4-B on the ground that the
amendment including ballots from the aforesaid three (3) voting centers, was
filed out of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1980</st1:date>,
respondent judge gave due course to the amended protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then filed with the Commission on Elections a petition
to declare null and void the respondent Judge's order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1980</st1:date>, <span style="">insisting that the inclusion of the three (3)
additional voting centers in </span>the <span class="GramE"><span style="">amended</span></span><span style=""> petition was filed beyond the period fixed by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an order dated </span><st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="1"><span style="">January 23, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Commission on Elections dismissed the
peti­tion on the ground that it has no jurisdiction over petitions for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> involving election cases cognizable by the
Courts of First Instance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 6, 1981, upon motion of private respondent, the
respondent Judge issued an order setting the revision of ballots from voting
centers Nos. 2, 2-A and 4-B in San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">Hence,
this petition.</span></span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner claims that
substantial amendments to election protests must be filed within the period for
the filing of the original protest itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This position is correct under the cases decided prior to </span><st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="2"><span style="">February
 26, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, by virtue of its
rule-making authority, the Commission on Elections promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="2"><span style="">February
 26, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, Resolution
No. 1451, Section 5, Rule II of which provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Substantial and Formal Amendments.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- After the case is set for hearing, no <span style="">amendment to the allegations affecting </span>the
merits of the controversy shall be allowed except by leave of Court and only
upon such ground as will serve public interest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But such leave may be refused if it appears to the Court that the motion
to amend was made with intent to delay the action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any amendment in matters of form may be
permitted at any stage of the proceedings" (see Section 185[b], PD No.
1296 or the Revised Election Code of 1978; Sections 2[2] and [8], Art. XII,
1973 Constitution).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Neither the validity of said Resolution
No. 1451 nor the authority of the Commission on Elections to promulgate the
same has been challenged.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the pretension of petitioner, the original protest
was filed within the period prescribed by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be stressed that the amended petition was filed on
March 4, 1980 by virtue of the aforesaid <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>
Resolution No. 1451 promulgated on February 26, 1980, long before petitioner,
as <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, filed on March 10, 1980 his answer to
the protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In his answer, petitioner
specifically denied paragraph 5 of the amended petition referring to the
questioned voting centers Nos. 2, 2-A and 4-B.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the relevant portion of the challenged order of the
respondent Judge reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As stated, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> filed his
answer to the amended motion of protest on March 10, 1980, specifically denying
paragraph 5 of the amended petition (referring to the allegation concerning
Voting Centers 2 and 2-A of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Calangay</span> and Voting Center No. 4-B in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pansipit</span>, San Nicolas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>)
which were not alleged in the original motion of protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Protestee</span> in his
answer averred --</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 67.5pt; text-indent: -24.75pt;">'3.1<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Calangay</span>, Voting Centers 2 and 2-A and in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Pansipit</span>, Voting Center
No. 4-B, there were no marked ballots appreciated by the election committee in
favor of the respondent.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 67.5pt; text-indent: -24.75pt;">'3.2<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>
that some ballots contained the word '<span class="SpellE">Meralya</span>', the
same cannot be considered as identifying marks, but votes intended for '<span class="SpellE">Marella</span>', a candidate for the Provincial Board.'</p>

<blockquote>"From the foregoing answer of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
he was not caught by surprise and placed to a disadvantage as to justify a
rejection of the amended motion of protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, the action of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>,
by answering specifically the amendments in question paved the way for the
admission of the amended motion of protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> has not yet
made an answer to the original motion of protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No delay was intended by the protestant when
he filed his amended motion of protest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The truth is he is much more interested in terminating this protest than
anybody else.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This situation obtaining
in this case is only one among the different situations confronting the courts
today.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This situation occurring in the
past elections, not having been provided for solution by law except by
jurisprudence, must have prompted the Commission on Elections to promulgate on
February 26, 1980, Resolution No. 1451 governing Rules on Election Contest.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The law providing for a period within which an election
protest should be filed is Mandatory but the law providing for amendments to
the election protest is permissive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, because this case has not yet been set for hearing when the
amendment was made, the law allows the protestant to amend his motion of
protest even without leave of court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This, to the mind of the Court is the liberal interpre­tation of Section
5, Rule III of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Rules on Election Contest
(Resolution No. 1451, promulgated on February 26, 1980).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary interpretation will be repugnant
to the fundamental rule that election laws should be liberally construed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span class="GramE">"<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(</span>pp. 19-20, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>
Resolution No. 1451 of <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="2">February 26,
 1980</st1:date> has modified the previous rulings on the matter of substantial
and formal amendments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the
resolution, as long as the case has not been set for hearing, substantial
amendments affecting the merits of the protest shall be allowed when public
interest could be sub-served thereby and when such amendments are not intended
to delay the action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the substantial amendment, as heretofore
stated, was effected before any responsive pleading was filed by herein
petitioner, and consequently, the case had not yet <span style="">been set for </span>hearing on March 4, 1980, because petitioner filed
his answer only on March 10, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> FOR LACK OF MERIT, THE PETITION IS HEREBY
DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NO COSTS.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DE CASTRO, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not a dissent from how the present petition is disposed
of on the merits, for on the assumption that in making such disposition, this
Court is properly exercising jurisdiction, I would fully concur therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I only wish to reiterate my dissenting
opinion in the case of MARIANO J. PIMENTEL, et al., versus COMMISSION ON
ELECTIONS, et al., promulgated <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="12">19
 December 1980</st1:date>, under which I would hold that <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>
to which the present petition was originally filed has jurisdiction to
entertain said petition, and should not have dismissed it as it did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>My dissenting opinion is quoted hereunder in
full as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"While I am in agreement with the rejec­tion of the argument
of private respondents in support of their view that <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>
has juris­diction to entertain the petition filed by them because it would
trace the said jurisdic­tion to the Rules of Court, not to a law or the
Constitution which alone can confer jurisdiction, I believe that when the law
conferred appellate jurisdiction on <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span> (Section
196, Revised Election Code 1978) in election cases originally tried and decided
by the Court of First Instance, which jurisdiction used to pertain to the Court
of Appeals, the law, at least impliedly, transferred along with such appellate
jurisdiction the competence <span class="GramE">to</span> issue writs of <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition, <i>mandamus</i>, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
any appellate court, such as the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span> in election
contests appealed to it from the Court of First Instance, in order to
effectively exercise its appellate jurisdiction, must have at least the
authority to issue such writs in the same manner that such is conferred upon
the Court of Appeals in aid of its appellate jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In transferring jurisdiction over appealed
election contests to the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>, it can reasonably
be assumed that the law intended to transfer also such power as is deemed
necessary, if not indispensable, "in aid of the appellate
jurisdiction" conferred on the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason perceivable why the
transfer is only partial, not total, for as stated in 11 Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>, p. 139, the jurisdiction to issue the writs may be
expressly or <u>impliedly</u> conferred by consti­tutional or statutory
provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From this legal approach, the
source of the power or jurisdiction of <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span> over
petitions such as the petition in <span class="GramE">question,</span> is the
law, the Revised Election Code of 1978, not the Rules of Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To hold that <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span> has no
jurisdiction to entertain the petition for <i>certiorari</i> etc. would be to
leave no other court to which recourse may be had than the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But from the provision of the Revised
Election Code of 1978 giving the appellate jurisdiction over election cases
decided originally by the Courts of First Instance to the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>,
and the provision of the Constitution limiting the power of the Supreme Court
to exercising only <i>certiorari</i> jurisdiction over decisions, orders and
resolutions of the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>, I am unable to <span style="">say </span>that the intention of the 1978
Election Code is to disperse or divide the authority over an election case
filed in the Court of First Instance by giving to the Supreme Court
jurisdiction to issue writs of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>
against orders of the Court of First Instance but giving to the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span> the jurisdiction over the ultimate appeal from the
decision of said court in the very same election case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is more easy to say, with full legal
rationality, that the grant of appellate jurisdiction over election cases filed
in and decided by the Court of First Instance, carries with it the power to
issue writs of <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> when
necessary in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, as indeed, it cannot be denied
that, if it was such aid with the Court of Appeals, it must be so in the same
way with the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As additional support for the view that <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>
has jurisdiction to take <span style="">cognizance </span>of
petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, etc., in aid of its appellate jurisdiction,
the following propositions are submitted:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 196 of the
1978 Election Code having conferred on the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span>
the jurisdiction to review by appeal "any decision rendered by the Court
of First Instance" in specified election cases, I submit that the
supervisory power or jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span> to
issue writs of <i>certiorari</i>, etc., in aid of its appellate jurisdic­tion,
must co-exist with and be a complement to its appellate jurisdiction to review
by appeal the final orders and decisions of the Court of First Instance, in
order to have a complete supervision over the acts of the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it would be highly preposterous to
deprive the <span class="SpellE">COMELEC</span> the power or jurisdiction to
review interlocutory orders of the Court of First Instance, which need
immediate relief thru a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, etc., as the plain,
speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, but it has such power
or jurisdic­tion when the question is brought to it by appeal, at a time when,
more often than not, damage has already been done, just because the law failed
to confer expressly said jurisdiction, although, as already adverted to, it can
be fairly inferred from the transfer to it by the Election Code of the jurisdiction
which used to pertain to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it may be true
that the provisions of the Rules of Court, specifically Section 4, Rule 65,
under which petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, etc., "may also be filed with
the Court of Appeals if it is in aid of its appellate jurisdic­tion", if
standing alone, cannot confer jurisdiction, being neither a constitutional
provision nor a legislative enactment, it should be noted that the aforesaid
provision merely echoed by way of restatement of the provision of Section 30 of
the Judiciary Act, which grants to the Court of Appeals jurisdiction to issue
writs of <i>certiorari</i>, etc., "in aid of its appellate
jurisdiction." Consequently, it may be permissible to say that the
aforesaid provision of the Rules of Court, being backed up by a substantive
law, is just as good as the law itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For, indeed, the provision of the Rules of Court alone and by itself,
cannot confer the jurisdiction referred to independently of the provisions of
the Judiciary Act which gives substantive vitality to the provision of Section
4 of Rule 65, not similarly given to other provisions of the Rules of Court
having no counterpart in law or the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, reference to certain provisions of the
Rules of Court which are mere reproductions of existing statu­tory or
constitutional provisions (such as the rights of an accused granted by the
constitution the pertinent provisions of which have been repeated in the Rules
of Court) may well be considered as reference to the law or the constitution
itself.</p>
