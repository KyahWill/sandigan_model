<p class="BODY">The people of <span class="SpellE">Digon</span> in <span class="SpellE">Margosatubig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> must still be talking every <span>now </span>and then of 
the strange killings that shook their barrio on that tragic morning of May 23, 
1973, when three girls were slain, the youngest <span>only </span>five years 
old, under the most mystifying and shocking circumstances.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even 
now the townsfolk are probably still asking, not without a tinge of 
superstitious fear, the nagging, unanswered questions in this macabre 
case:<span>&nbsp; </span>Why?<span>&nbsp; </span>Why the blameless victims?<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="GramE">And why the ruthless manner of their 
slaying?</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Consider the carnage and the girls who </span><span>fell 
</span><span>before the bloodied knife:<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Nastae</span>, 21 years old, 
stabbed once to death, ears severed; <span class="SpellE">Canda</span> <span class="SpellE">Carluman</span>, 7 years old, stabbed once, hemorrhaging to death; 
and Mona <span class="SpellE">Carluman</span>, 5 years old, stabbed twice to 
death, ears severed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> These were 
Nature's creatures still on the threshold of their lives, and yet they were cut 
<span class="GramE">down</span> in the innocence of their youth without mercy and 
without reason.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The day following the massacre, prodded perhaps by <span>a sense 
not only of duty </span>but also of outrage, a joint PC-police posse arrested 
seven persons <span>in </span>Barrio <span class="SpellE">Talanusa</span>, 
<span>to wit:<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, </span>Solomon <span class="SpellE"><span>Totoy</span></span><span>, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Tundag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sinfroso</span> <span class="SpellE">Masong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mohamod</span> <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> and <span class="SpellE">Balbino</span> <span class="SpellE">Estrera</span>, all suspected of the killings.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> Found in their possession and confiscated 
were two home-made shotguns, one .38 caliber home-made pistol with two live 
bullets, five hunting knives with scabbards, an undershirt with Latin words 
arranged in a mystic design, a pair of trousers, four bottles of oil, and two 
human ears.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Wilfredo</span> Rojas, 
their alleged leader, was arrested later in <span class="SpellE">Malangas</span>, 
also of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, and turned over to the <span class="SpellE">Margosatubig</span> police.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">After investigation, all the suspects were charged with the murder 
of the above-named victims in three separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> to which they all pleaded not guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Later, on motion of the prosecution and 
over the objection of the other defendants, <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Estrera</span> were discharged so they could be used as state 
witnesses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Every one of the remaining 
defendants was provided with counsel <em>de oficio</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);"> [7]</sup>. An extended trial followed and decision 
was finally rendered on <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="1">January 27, 
1975</st1:date>, convicting all of them and sentencing them to death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The lone exception was <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span>, who, because of 
the mitigating circumstance of minority, was meted out the lesser penalty of 
eight years and one day of <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><em> 
mayor</em> to fourteen years, eight months and one day of <em>reclusion 
temporal</em>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> All the accused were 
also held <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable for the civil indemnity of 
P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, to be paid to the heirs of each of the 
three victims.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The sentence of death has brought the case to this Court on 
automatic review.<span>&nbsp; </span>The records are voluminous.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
accused-appellants are raising factual and legal questions which opposing 
counsel have discussed knowledgably and with commendable spirit and 
earnestness.<span>&nbsp; </span>We shall rule upon these issues presently.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the basis of the testimonial and documentary evidence 
presented at the trial, the following is substantially what happened before and 
during the tragic incident, as the lower court saw it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Sometime in January 1973 there arrived in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Talanusa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Margosatubig</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, a stranger from 
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tuboran</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malangas</span>, of 
the same province, bringing with him <span class="SpellE">wordly</span> wares and 
presumably also his own concept of the spirit.<span>&nbsp; </span>His name was <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Rojas.<span>&nbsp; </span>During his stay, he befriended 
the other accused, whom he taught to pray the "Our Father," the "Hail Mary," and 
the "I Believe," in profession of the Christian faith as he understood 
it.<span>&nbsp; </span>He also sold them on credit what he called "<span class="SpellE"><em>anting-anting</em></span>" oil which, he claimed, would, when 
rubbed on their bodies, protect them from injury.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Rojas returned to <span class="SpellE">Talanusa</span> in April of 
the same year, staying there for two <span class="GramE">weeks,</span> and then 
again in May, joining his new-found friends as usual in drinking wine and in 
reciting the prayers he had taught them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> All this was leading to the tragic events 
that would transpire later that month by the sea in <span class="SpellE">Digon</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On that fateful morning of <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1973</st1:date>, Rojas <span>and his companions went to the 
church in <span class="SpellE">Talanusa</span>, where they prayed, rubbed the 
amulet oil on their bodies, and </span>girded themselves as if preparing for 
battle.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rojas was armed with a shotgun and a knife.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Estrera</span> also had a shotgun and a knife.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Tundag</span> carried a revolver and a knife.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Esmael</span>, <span class="SpellE">Masong</span>, 
Solomon <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> were armed with knives.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Villarin</span> alone had no weapons.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rojas told them 
they were going to <span class="SpellE">Digon</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">Together, these eight then proceeded to their destination, about a 
half-hour's walk away.<span>&nbsp; </span>Arriving at the seashore where the massacre 
was soon to take place, they immediately surrounded the copra kiln to prevent 
escape of the persons in the enclosure.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the "<span class="SpellE"><em>tapahan</em></span>" were <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Nastae</span>, the eldest in the group, and the <span class="SpellE">Carluman</span> sisters, <span class="SpellE">Dalma</span>, <span class="SpellE">Canda</span>, Mona and <span class="SpellE">Lina</span>, their ages 
ranging from ten years to one.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rojas approached <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and pretended to be looking for a person named <span class="SpellE">Yoyong</span>, continuing in casual conversation when he received a 
negative answer.<span>&nbsp; </span>The girls did not appear to be apprehensive as 
yet.<span>&nbsp; </span>Suddenly and without warning, Solomon <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> fired at <span class="SpellE">Dalma</span>, but his gun 
jammed.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rojas then pulled out his knife and swung at <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>, fatally wounding her in the left side of her body 
with one stab.<span>&nbsp; </span>The second victim was <span class="SpellE">Canda</span>, whom Rojas stabbed (or shot?) in the head, resulting 
in her bleeding to death.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rojas finally turned on the smallest 
girl in the group, the terrified Mona, whom he stabbed twice in the stomach and 
in the back, also killing her.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is not certain when this 
actually happened — whether before or after <span>they had died — but to make 
the gory crimes even more bizarre, the ears of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> 
and Mona were severed, by whom it is also not clear.<span>&nbsp; </span>At any rate, 
after the butchery was done, Rojas ordered the group to run, and run they did 
together from the bloody sands.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> 
</span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>They had not reckoned with <span class="SpellE">Dalma</span> 
who, with her sister <span class="SpellE">Lina</span>, had escaped the killing by 
fleeing to the nearby sea and hanging on to a log until the men had left.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> She would live to tell about the terrible 
bloodbath she had seen and survived and to point to the accused as the brutal 
killers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It was <span class="SpellE">Dalma</span> and the two state 
witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estrera</span>, who supplied the details in the above narration<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Although there are a number of 
inconsistencies in their testimony, due probably to the general confusion that 
characterized the incident, we accept the factual findings of the trial 
judge.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial judge has a superior competence in this 
regard.<span>&nbsp; </span>After all, as we remarked in an earlier case,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> it is the trial judge who has the 
opportunity to observe the witnesses and assess their demeanor, to mark every 
nuance of tone or pause of hesitation or flush of face, and to deter</span>mine, 
by the totality of his impressions and the plausibility of their testimony, if 
what they are saying should be rejected or believed.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The trial judge described <span class="SpellE">Dalma</span> as 
sincere and straight-forward, relating her story without hesitation and sticking 
to it despite rigid cross-examina</span>tion.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> The <span class="SpellE">naivete</span> of 
the ten-year old girl was especially impressive and, together with her detailed 
remembrance of her harrowing experience, convinced the court that she was 
telling the truth.<span>&nbsp; </span>As for state witnesses <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estrera</span>, while it has 
been argued that their testimony came from a polluted source, they being 
themselves co-conspirators with the accused, it <span>is </span>noteworthy that 
their own respective accounts of the tragedy were consistent with each other and 
tallied essentially with <span class="SpellE">Dalma's</span> narration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Thus settling the factual issues, we now address ourselves 
to the several legal questions raised by the accused-appellants in their 
assignment of errors.<span>&nbsp; </span>Specifically, they claim that the lower 
court erred in finding that there was a conspiracy among them; in imposing upon 
them collectively the sentence of death; </span><span>and in considering against 
them the aggravating circumstances of <span class="SpellE"><em>cuadrilla</em></span>, dwelling and evident premeditation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Additionally, Solomon <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> challenges his supposed confession on the ground that 
it was taken in violation of the Bill of Rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY">A conspiracy exists when two or more persons come to an agreement 
to commit a crime and decide to commit it.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> While it is desirable that the conspiracy 
be proved by direct evidence, like an express understanding among the plotters 
affirming their commitment and defining their respective roles, it may 
nevertheless be established at times by circumstantial evidence only.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> Thus, to repeat established doctrine, 
where the accused move in concert toward a common purpose, conspiracy may be 
inferred from their joint acts and design, without need of direct evidence of 
the criminal agreement.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> We have held 
in many cases that the conduct of the accused before, during and after the 
commission of the crime, are circumstances that can show whether or not there 
was a conspiracy among them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case at bar, it is not disputed that the accused, in 
the morning of the killings, gathered at the church in <span class="SpellE">Talanusa</span> and observed what might be compared to the 
ceremonies of warriors before a battle:<span>&nbsp; </span>prayers for victory, 
anointing with oil against injury and death, and girding for combat.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Surely, one does not make such solemn 
preparations if the destination were a harmless party, as claimed by the 
accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> The record shows that Rojas, 
the "commander" as he was called, simply told the group they were going to <span class="SpellE">Digon</span>, but he did not have to spell out their 
mission.<span>&nbsp; </span>If only because of the formidable arsenal they were 
carrying, the accused could not but have known that their object was more 
sinister than merrymaking and drinking and feasting at a social 
gathering.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was certainly a more deadly purpose, and all of 
them were aware of this.</span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It has been established that upon their arrival in the 
"<span class="SpellE"><em>tapahan</em></span>" at <span class="SpellE">Digon</span> 
at about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="11"><span>eleven 
o'clock</span></st1:time><span> of that fatal morning, the accused immediately 
positioned <span class="GramE">themselves</span> around the copra 
</span><span>kiln </span><span>enclosure, surrounding it to prevent the five 
girls inside from leaving.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> One 
wonders why, if they were not acting in concert, they at once so placed 
themselves as to form a ring around the structure </span><span>in </span><span>a 
veritable siege of their defenseless and unsuspecting prey.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Notably, every one took his spot as if by prearrangement, without need of 
the leader assigning to them their respective positions, in what some — if they 
had a sense of the occult — would call a circle of death.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>There is no evidence that when Solomon <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> suddenly attempted to shoot <span class="SpellE">Dalma</span>, the rest of the group was surprised, objected or 
remonstrated.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nobody stopped Rojas when he started killing the 
astonished and terrified victims.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was no protest <span class="GramE">either when the ears of <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> and Mona 
were cut off on Rojas's orders and</span> wrapped in leaves for safekeeping.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> Everything was done apparently according 
to a preconceived design.<span>&nbsp; </span>The group knew beforehand what was going 
to happen for, indeed, they had planned it that way.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, as a 
final touch, after the massacre was over, Rojas ordered the men to run, and 
obediently they did, fleeing the scene of the crimes at the same time and 
together.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It is the above acts of the accused, and not necessarily the 
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Esmael</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estrera</span> as co-<span class="GramE">conspirators, that</span> 
have established the conspiracy.<span>&nbsp; </span>These two state witnesses merely 
corroborated the principal account given by the unhesitant <span class="SpellE">Dalma</span>, who had seen everything and told it in every 
harrowing, unforgettable detail.</p>
<p class="BODY">The conspiracy having been established, it must now visit equal 
punishment on all the conspirators, on the legal theory that the act of one is 
the act of all.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> This is settled 
jurisprudence.<span>&nbsp; </span>There is no need to harp on it.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Indeed, even if it be argued that some did less than the others, it 
cannot be denied that their very participation in the conspiracy added to its 
strength, emboldened the actual killer, and contributed to the success of the 
common design.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the eyes of the law, each conspirator is a 
co-principal <span>and equally guilty with the other members of the plot.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is true that in <em>People v. Nierra</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> this doctrine was relaxed in favor of the 
</span>two <span>accused who, although adjudged as co-conspirators, were 
nonetheless held to be accomplices only and so entitled to a lesser penalty than 
that imposed on the other defendants.<span>&nbsp; </span>In that case, however, the 
participation of one was limited to introducing the killer to the other plotters 
and delivering the murder weapon to him and the other merely acted as look-out 
while the crime was being committed.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, however, 
every one of the accused acted in concert and was present at the scene of the 
crime while it was being committed and as an equal partner of the rest performed 
his designated part to complete its execution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>There is no question that the killings were committed with 
treachery, to qualify the crimes to murder.<span>&nbsp; </span>Treachery exists when 
the offender commits any crime against persons, employing means, methods or 
forms in the execution thereof which tend directly and specially to insure its 
execution, without risk to <span class="GramE">himself</span> arising from any 
defense which the offended party might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> In the instant case, the offended parties 
were young defenseless girls confronted by eight full-grown men armed with guns 
and knives who, to make a surprise attack, pretended to be looking for 
someone.<span>&nbsp; </span>Three bloody corpses, the victim of their guile and their 
</span>superior strength and number, attested to the success <span>of their 
wicked plot.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We reject the finding by the trial court of dwelli</span>ng 
and band as separate aggravating circumstances.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> Even the Solicitor General believes that 
dwelling should not have been considered because the "<span class="SpellE"><em>tapahan</em></span>" in which <span>the murders were committed 
was a separate structure and did not form part of the building where the victims 
were residing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> As for band, it is 
unquestionable that </span><span class="SpellE"><em>cuadrilla</em></span> <span>is 
absorbed by treachery since its employment was consciously adopted to insure the 
execution of the plot without risk to the criminals, by reason of their number, 
let alone their strength, from any defense the offended parties might make.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>But evident premeditation is another matter and is correctly 
appreciated as an aggravating circumstance that will increase the 
penalty.<span>&nbsp; </span>The rule is that under normal conditions, when the 
conspiracy is directly established with proof of the attendant deliberation and 
selection of the method, time and means of executing the crimes, the existence 
of evident premeditation may be taken for granted.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> In case of implied conspiracy, however, 
</span>there must be proof as to how and when the plan was hatched and the time 
that elapsed before it was carried out, so it can be determined if the accused 
had sufficient time between its inception and its fulfillment to dispassionately 
consider the commission of the crime and its consequences.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> As this Court has repeatedly held, there 
should be a showing that the accused had the opportunity for reflection, that he 
had <span>the </span>chance to weigh the <span style="font-style: italic;">pros</span> and <em>cons</em> of the deed he was 
planning, and that he nonetheless persisted in carrying out his criminal 
design.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY"><span>From the facts found by the lower court, there was such a 
showing.<span>&nbsp; </span>It would appear that the plan to murder the girls was 
conceived perhaps as early as during the meetings in April and May between Rojas 
and the other members of the group, or at the very latest when they all 
assembled in the church at <span class="SpellE">Talanusa</span> before they made 
</span>the trip to <span class="SpellE">Digon</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even as they 
were mouthing their prayers, they had already made up their minds, or perhaps 
were only affirming a decision reached earlier, to kill the girls in <span class="SpellE">Digon</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They knew then where they <span>were 
going.<span>&nbsp; </span>They knew what they were going to do.<span>&nbsp; </span>Between 
the time they left the church in <span class="SpellE">Talanusa</span> and 
</span>until they arrived in <span class="SpellE">Digon</span> - a good thirty 
minutes' walk over a two-kilometer stretch during which they would have had 
nothing in mind but their mission - they had sufficient time to reflect on the 
acts they were about to commit, to consult their conscience on the justification 
for the crime they were planning, and to desist, if they wanted to, from 
carrying out their deadly purpose.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Coming now to Solomon <span class="SpellE">Totoy's</span> 
extrajudicial confession which he asks us to invalidate, all we have to do is 
test it against the requirements of Article IV, Section 20, of the 1973, 
Constitution.<span>&nbsp; </span>This statement was obtained from him on 
</span><st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="5"><span>May 28, 1973It is 
therefore covered by </span><span class="SpellE"><em>Magtoto</em></span> <em>v. 
</em><span class="SpellE"><em>Manguera</em></span><span class="SpellE"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> and other subsequent cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup> holding that this section should be given 
only prospective operation from </span><st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1"><span>January 17, 1973</span></st1:date><span>, when that Constitution 
was ratified.</span></st1:date></p>
<p class="BODY">The said provision categorically states that "any person under 
investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain 
silent and to counsel and to be informed of such right." The record does not 
show that this requirement was observed.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, there 
merely appears in the opening paragraph of the said confession the vague 
statement that:</p>
<blockquote>"The affiant has been informed of his rights under the Constitution 
of the Republic of the Philippines, and under the state of Martial Law, and the 
nature of the investigation, and without violence, intimidation, force nor 
reward the affiant declared as follows:</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<table align="center" border="0" width="60%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<div align="left">"xxx</div></td>
<td>
<div align="center">xxx</div></td>
<td>
<div align="right">xxx"</div></td></tr></tbody></table><span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">This surely does not suggest compliance with the constitutional 
mandate.<span>&nbsp; </span>The rights which <span class="SpellE">Totoy</span> was 
entitled to know were <span>not </span>specifically communicated to him.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Being informed of his "rights under the Constitution of the Republic of 
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>" 
did not mean he was informed particularly of his right to remain silent and to 
be assisted by counsel during his custodial investigation.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was 
not told he did not have to answer if he did not feel like answering.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He was not told he <span>had </span>a right to be assisted by 
counsel.<span>&nbsp; </span>He was not given a chance to retain counsel <em>de 
parte</em> if he wanted to, and neither was he offered the services of counsel 
<em>de oficio</em><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>Not knowing about his right to 
counsel, he could not have waived it; and in any case, the waiver, to be valid, 
<span>would have needed the assistance of counsel under the ruling announced in 
<em>People v. Galit</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> which is 
still the prevailing <span class="SpellE">doctine</span> notwithstanding the 
reservations of some members of this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In fine, what we see here is a superficial observance of the 
requirements of the Bill of Rights through a mere recitation by rote of the 
sacramental <span class="GramE">advise</span>, which was inadequate to begin 
with.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was no sin<span>cere effort or desire to apply the 
guarantees of Section 20 that could have protected the suspect from the rash and 
<span class="SpellE">uncounseled</span> statements he subsequently made, knowing 
</span>no <span>better.<span>&nbsp; </span>That statement is, of course, not 
admissible against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY">We end on this note of perplexity and regret.<span>&nbsp; </span>From 
the legal viewpoint, motive need not be established as long as the defendants 
have been directly identified, as in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup> Even so, the townspeople of <span class="SpellE">Margosatubig</span>, mindless of such legal niceties, are probably 
still musing over that bloody attack on that pleasant morning in May thirteen 
years ago when three young girls perished by the seashore in <span class="SpellE">Digon</span> at the hands of eight intruders.</p>
<p class="BODY">Was there perhaps a ritual killing on that tragic shore?<span>&nbsp; 
</span>There are those who suggest the hand of a fanatic religious group 
animated by a deadly hostility to Muslims, including innocent girls and children 
like the victims in this case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> Others 
see hidden meanings in the Latin inscriptions and cryptic designs on the shirt 
Rojas was wearing that fateful morning when, as one possessed, he slew and slew 
and slew.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The severed ears are 
especially intriguing and could perhaps reveal an esoteric purpose behind the 
savage knives the killers wielded in cold blood against their innocent 
prey.<span>&nbsp; </span>Still the question probes and lingers:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Why?<span>&nbsp; </span>The answer lies in the warped mind of the stranger 
from <span class="SpellE">Tuboran</span> who came <span>with his magic amulet oil 
and taught his believing followers to pray with him — and 
kill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">All the accused-appellants are guilty of the three crimes of 
murder, qualified by treachery and aggravated by evident premeditation.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Rejected as aggravating circumstances are band, because it is already 
absorbed by treachery; dwelling, because the "<span class="SpellE"><em>tapahan</em></span>" was not part of the victims' residence; 
and cruelty, because it has not been shown that the ears of the two victims were 
severed while they were still alive.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>WHEREFORE</span></b><span>, as above modified, the

on all the accused-appellants for each of the murders.<span>&nbsp; </span>The civil
