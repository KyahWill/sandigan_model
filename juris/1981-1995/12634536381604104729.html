his hand inside his pocket; that for fear of being attacked (<span class="SpellE"><u>tirahin</u></span>), he suddenly drew with his left hand a gun
tucked in his left waist, cocked it and fired at the victim five (5) times;
that thereupon, he and his five (5) companions fled but a policeman gave chase
and when overtaken, he did not resist the arrest and surrendered the fatal gun;
that the victim was seated facing towards him and with the victim's right hand
inside the pocket; that the above-said gun (.38 caliber pistol) was owned and
licensed in the name of <span class="SpellE">Evangelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Savellano</span>,

<p class="BODY">Belen <span class="SpellE">Gacias</span>, 18 years old, single,

at around 12:00 in the early morning of April 25, 1969, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Anies</span>, after paying
their drinks, suddenly stood up and shot the victim Jaime Cruz five (5) times

sitting alone at his table, was facing the counter and in the process of
lighting a cigarette when frontally shot by accused-appellant with a short,
chromium-plated gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After shooting the
victim Jaime Cruz who fell down, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Constante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Anies</span> ran in a limping manner and his five (5)
companions likewise fled from the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, Sgt. Domingo Castro (also referred
to as <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> Castro) also of the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Police Department and the owner of <span class="SpellE">Daling's</span> Restaurant, gave chase and succeeded in arresting
the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">There was no exchange of words before the shooting incident
either among the group of accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Constante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Anies</span> or between said group and the victim Jaime Cruz
(pp. 16-30, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1969" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1969</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Dr. Alberto M. Reyes,
Medico-Legal Officer of the National Bureau of Investigation testified that </span>he
conducted the <u>post</u> <u>mortem</u> examination on the corpse of the victim
Jaime Cruz, and set forth his findings in Necropsy Report No. N-69-559
consisting of two <span class="GramE">pages,</span> marked Exhibit "D"
afore-quoted (pp. 68-69, Folder of Exhibits).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had photographs taken of the dead body under his direct supervision
and control (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "D-1", "D-2",
"D-3", "D-4" and "D-5", pp. 70-75, Folder of
Exhibits).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <u>post</u> <u>mortem</u>
examination showed that there were six (6) gunshot wounds on the body with

"D-5b" (p. 70, Folder of Exhibits) from gun­shot wound No. 2 marked
as Exhibit "D-5a" and the same was submitted to the National Bureau
of Investigation Ballistics Division for examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He believes that gunshot wound No. 2 marked
as Exhibit "D-5a" is a re-entry <span class="GramE">wound, that</span>
is the reason why the direction of the wound is slightly bent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the same bullet which caused
the wound marked Exhibit "D-2a" could have caused wound No. 2 marked
Exhibit "D-5-2".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, he
stated that the gunshot wounds marked Exhibits "D-2c",
"D-2d" and "D-2e" <span class="GramE">have</span> the same
diameter and they all correspond to a .38 caliber bullet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also believes that any of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>gunshot wounds could have caused
the immediate death of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Judging from the trajectory of the bullets causing the gunshot wounds,
Dr. Reyes testified that the assailant was possibly in front and slightly on a
higher level than the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
possible that the victim was sitting down when fired upon by the
assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The wounds on the body of the
victim could have been inflicted frontally.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He further opined that any of the six (6) gunshots could have caused the
victim to move from his position (pp. 8-14, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1969" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1969</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As set forth in the Toxicology Report No.</span>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Erdulfo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Grimares</span>,
a ballistic expert of the National Bureau of Investigation, testified that Sgt.

City Police Depart­ment submitted to their office a pistol caliber .38 with
Serial No. 4-9946 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G-1"), <span class="GramE">five /5/</span> fired cartridge cases caliber .38 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "G-2", "G-3", "G-4",

<p class="BODY">From the laboratory examination he conducted, he found that the
five /5/ cartridges (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">"G-2",
"G-3", "G-4", "G-5" and "G-6") and the
test cartridges of the evidence firearm, showed similar individual characteristics.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise by making a comparison between the
deformed jacketed <span class="GramE">bullet</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"G-7") and the test bullet, he found that the evidence bullet had
been fired from the firearm marked Exhibit "G-1", the gun used by the
appellant in shooting the victim (pp. 14-21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
June 10, 1969).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Anies</span> testified that past <st1:time minute="30" hour="11">11:30</st1:time>

roommate, <span class="SpellE">Evangelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Savellano</span>,
left the house to visit a cousin of his.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Admittedly, the gun was taken out without the prior consent and
knowledge of the owner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From his
cousin's house, accused-appellant took a ride and alighted in front of <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> because he was hungry then (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., July 9, 1969).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He entered a certain restaurant (<span class="SpellE">Daling's</span>

looking at him sharply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jaime Cruz stood

<span class="SpellE">Anies</span> also stood up and sensing that he was in a

<p class="BODY">After shooting the victim, accused-appellant left the restaurant

testimonies of the prosecution wit­nesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly rejected appellant's version.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies of the appellant and his
alleged companion at the time of the bloody incident cannot prevail over the
unbiased and categorical extra-judicial statement of Belen <span class="SpellE">Gacias</span>,
the waitress, who executed her written statement at about 1:10 in the early
morning of April 25, 1969, about one hour from 12:10 that same early morning,
the time of the shooting, and who undisputedly was an eyewitness to the
shooting incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was certainly in

could have concocted such a detailed narration of events against the appellant
within a short period of time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the above-said extra-judicial statement executed by Belen <span class="SpellE">Gacias</span> shortly after the killing, she declared that it was
appellant <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> <span class="SpellE">Anies</span>
who suddenly stood up from his seat, walked towards the victim Jaime Cruz,
pulled a gun from his waist and fired at the victim face to face.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The above-mentioned extra-judicial statement and testimony of
Belen <span class="SpellE">Gacias</span> are strongly supported by other evidence
borne out by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Firstly, there
<span class="GramE">is</span> the <u>post</u> <u>mortem</u> findings and the
testimony of the medico-legal expert, Dr. Alberto Reyes, which show that the

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected appellant's plea of self-defense, and

been consistently held by this Court over a span of 60 years (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Ardisa</span>, L-29351, Jan. 23, 1974, 55 SCRA 245, 254; People

recently reiterated in the case of People vs. Pay-an (L-39089-90, July 31,

<blockquote>"Self-defense, like alibi, is a defense which can easily be
concocted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled in this
jurisdiction that once an accused had admitted that he inflicted the fatal
injuries on the deceased, it was incumbent upon him, in order to avoid criminal
liability, to prove the justifying circumstance claimed by him with clear,
satisfactory and convincing evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
cannot rely on the weakness of the prosecution but on the strength of his own
evidence, 'for even if the evidence of the prosecution were weak it could not
be disbelieved after the accused himself had admitted the killing."'<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Verily, appellant's plea

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Appellant claims that the
trial court erred when it failed to take into account his being lame </span>in
determining the reasonableness of the means employed by him in defending
himself against aggression by the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to emphasize that a determination of the second
requisite of self-defense -- reasonable necessity of the means employed to
prevent or repel the attack, is only indispensable if the element of unlawful
aggression is present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
"unlawful aggression is the main and most essential element to support the
theory of self-defense and the complete or incomplete exemption from criminal
liability; without such primal requisite it is not possible to main­tain that a
person acted in self-defense within the terms under which unlawful aggression
is subordinate to the other two conditions named in Article 8, No. 4 (now
Article 11, par. 1) of the Penal Code (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Carrero</span>,
No. 3956, Jan. 10, 1908, 9 Phil. 544, 546)."</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged aggression on the part of the deceased was not
established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, "there is no
occasion to speak here of the 'reasonable necessity of the means employed' or
of 'sufficient provocation' on the part of one invoking legitimate
self-defense; because both circumstances presuppose unlawful aggression which
was not present in the instant case" (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Yuman</span>,
No. 43469, Aug. 21, 1935, 61 Phil. 786, 788).</p>

<p class="BODY">If there was any aggression at all, the same could not have come
from the deceased who was alone sitting at his table as his lone companion was
in the comfort room at the time of the occurrence.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE fully agree with the observation of the trial court that it is
highly inconceivable for the deceased, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who
had at that time a lone </span>companion to dare perform any act that would
provoke a fight with appellant's group of six (6) persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be sheer foolhardiness, if not
totally a suicidal act, inasmuch as the deceased was completely unarmed at the
time of the occurrence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the language
of the trial court, it certainly would require a lot of guts on the part of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt"> </span>the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Appellant claimed that he

<span class="SpellE">nakaputi</span>' and was sure that deceased was referring to
him because when he turned <span class="GramE">around,</span> he saw the deceased
looking at him sharply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As above-noted, </span><span class="GramE">We</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">find it highly
incredible considering the numerical superiority of the group of the
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At most, deceased must have
accidentally hit the chair of appellant it appearing that the seating
arrangement of the tables was such that the table occupied by the deceased was
next to that occupied by the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Besides, even admitting
that the deceased kicked appellant's chair, uttered the threatening remarks
"<span class="SpellE">Yayariin</span> <span class="SpellE">natin</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span>," stood up and acted as if to pull something from
his pocket, such actions do not warrant the appellant's act of shooting the
victim who was completely unarmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
attitude and behavior do not constitute the unlawful aggression contemplated
under paragraph 1, Article 11 of the Revised Penal <span class="GramE">Code, that</span>
would justify an act of the accused to snuff out the life of the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In order to consider that an unlawful aggression was actually
committed, it is necessary that an attack or material aggression, an offensive
act positively determining the intent of the aggressor to cause an injury shall
have been made; a mere threatening attitude or intimidating attitude is not
sufficient to justify the commission of an act which is punishable <u>per</u> <u>se</u>,
and allow a claim of exemption from liability on the ground that it was
committed in self-defense" (U.S. vs. Guy-<span class="SpellE">sayco</span>,
No. 4912, March 25, 1903, 13 Phil. 292, 295, 296).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Moreover, in the case of
U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Carrero</span>, <u>supra</u>, it was held that
"the theory that by the simple belief of a person that he would be
attacked, a deadly blow may be inflicted on the ground of self-defense, even
though it be with a stick, is not authorized by the law nor is it a doctrine
established by the decision of courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the judgment of the supreme court of Spain, dated October 31, 1889,
not only was the belief of the individual who was obliged to defend himself
considered but also the hostile attitude and other acts which, in the opinion
of the court, were considered as real and ostensible acts of aggression; and in
other deci­sions of October 30, 1884, March 19, 1885, and November 15, 1889, a
uniform doctrine was established to the effect that a threat even if made with
a weapon, or the belief that a person was about to be attacked, is not
sufficient, but that it is necessary that the intent be ostensibly revealed by
an act of aggression or by some external acts showing the commencement of
actual and material unlawful aggression."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">WE are not unmindful of the decision of the Supreme Court of
Spain to the effect that "the act of a person in retreating two steps and
placing his hand in his pocket with a motion indicating his purpose to commit
an assault with a weapon is aggressive, because the movements and motions,
revealed clearly by external acts show the commencement of an unlawful
aggression which the accused was justified to prevent by preparing himself to
repel it" (June 26, 1891 Decision, 48 <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Crim</span></span><span class="GramE">. 862, cited
in <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, G., Commentaries on the Revised Penal
Code, 5th Ed., p. 27; Reyes, L.B., The Revised Penal Code, Book I, 1977 Ed., p.
180).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this ruling merely
justifies preparation for self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unless there is an overt act of aggression, beyond a mere verbal threat
or inti­midating posture, there is no occasion to kill in self-defense as there
is no physical assault on his person.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the above question has been fully settled in the 1908
case of U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Carrero</span>, <u>supra</u>, wherein the
accused alleged having acted merely in self-defense in view of the attitude of
the deceased, who, after insulting him, thrust his hand into his pocket as if
for the purpose of drawing a dagger or a pocket knife and that in order to
defend himself, because he believed that the deceased, owing to the latter's
attitude, was about to attack him, he struck him with the stick he had provided
himself with, in consequence of which the deceased fell to the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was held in said <span class="SpellE">Carrero</span> case that
there was no attack or aggression made by the deceased upon the accused to
justify the violent assault by the latter with a stick, for it was not shown
that the deceased carried any weapon or deadly instrument, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">so that there was not an actual or even
imminent peril of an attack upon the accused.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The above ruling was
reiterated in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Calantoc</span>
(L-27892, Jan. 31, 1974, 55 SCRA 458, 461).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, this Court through Justice Ramon C. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
succinctly declared that "the alleged act of the victim in placing his
hand in his pocket, as if he was going to draw out something, cannot be
characterized as unlawful aggression."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Likewise, in the later
case of People vs. Tan (L-22697, Oct. 5, 1976, 73 SCRA 288, 292), accused,
claiming that he had acted in legitimate self-defense, said that he shot the
deceased because the deceased was in the poise of taking something from his
pocket which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">accused thought was a pistol.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court, however, ruled that the attitude

justify the appellant to shoot him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

only about one and one-half <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(1½) </span>meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above-said exculpatory testimony of the accused-appellant
only serves to accentuate that his story is devoid of truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It contradicts his earlier testimony that he
shot the victim at a distance of about three (3) meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order that treachery may be appreciated, it is necessary to
prove the manner in which the victim was attacked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A careful perusal of the records would show
that the qualifying circumstance of treachery (<span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>)
is indeed present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In recalling the
manner in which the assault was perpetrated by the appellant, witness Belen <span class="SpellE">Gacias</span> testified that appellant, after paying for their
drinks, <u>suddenly stood up,</u> face the deceased and shot the latter; <u>that
the deceased was sitting and lighting a cigarette at the time he was shot</u>;
and that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">there was no </span>exchange
of words before the shooting either from the group of appellant or from the
group of the deceased (pp. 18-19, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., June 9,
1969).</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no denial that the mode of the attack was treacherous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records are replete with proof that the
victim was unarmed and alone since his lone companion was in the comfort room
at the time of the attack; that he was completely unaware of the attack because
it was made in an unexpected manner as it was suddenly made and he was seated
while in the act of lighting a cigarette.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The victim therefore did not have the slightest opportunity to defend
himself nor had he any inkling of an impending assault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the appellant fired five (5) shots
at the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The above conclusion
holds true notwithstanding that the attack was frontal (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Doria</span>, 55 SCRA 435, 450; citing People vs. Noble, 77 Phil.
193).</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the pretension of the accused-appellant that the
trial court erred when it ruled that the killing was characterized by <span class="GramE">treachery,</span> must necessarily fall.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fourth issue raised by appellant, <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">We</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt"> </span>find no necessity to discuss the same for it will not affect
the penalty to be imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The killing of Jaime Cruz by appellant <span class="SpellE">Constante</span>
<span class="SpellE">Anies</span> is murder qualified by treachery, but without
any mitigating or generic aggravating circumstance.</p>
