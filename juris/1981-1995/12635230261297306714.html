Accused-appellants Mario Navoa, Rafael Navoa, Ricardo Sitchon (accused 
Mario Saguinza was discharged and utilized as a state witness) were 
found by the then Court of First Instance of Bataan, Fifth Judicial 
District, Branch II, "guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
murder as charged, defined, and penalized under Article 248 of the 
Revised Penal Code, and sentenced each to suffer an impri足sonment of 
SEVENTEEN (17) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY TO TWENTY (20) 
YEARS; further they are hereby ordered to indemnify jointly and 
solidarily the heirs of the victim, Tomas Izon, in the amount of 
P20,000.00".
<p>
The three accused appealed to the then Court of Appeals (now the 
Intermediate Appellate Court).  In a Decision, dated April 11, 1984, the
 Intermediate Appellate Court affirmed the findings of the Trial Court 
but modified the imposable penalty to <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.  Pursuant to our rulings in People <em>vs. </em>Daniel<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> ; People <em>vs. </em>Ramos<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> ; and People <em>vs. </em>Centeno, et al.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
 , the Appellate Court refrained from entering judgment and forthwith 
certified the case and ele足vated the entire records to this Court for 
review, the matter being within our exclusive appellate jurisdiction.
</p><p>
After a careful review of the evidence on record, we agree with the 
findings of fact and the conclusions of law in the appealed Decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  We, therefore, adopt it <em>in toto</em> and append it as an integral part of this Decision (Annex "A").
</p><p>
The testimonies of eyewitness Baltazar de la Rosa, and of the accused, 
Mario Saguinza, who had turned state witness, furnish ample evidence to 
sustain conviction.  Saguinza's declaration in open Court also revealed 
the motive of the three accused.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  Appellants' defense of alibi is unavailing as against their positive 
identification by eyewitness Baltazar de la Rosa and proof of their 
motive.  As to the issue raised by the defense on the credibility of 
prosecution witnesses, suffice it to re-state the time-tested doctrine 
that the findings of the Trial Court on witnesses' credibility is 
entitled to the highest respect by Appellate Tribunals unless there 
appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence 
which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been 
misconstrued, which is absent in the case at bar.
</p><p>
The penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, which is the medium period 
of the penalty prescribed for Murder, is appropriate in the absence of 
any mitigating or aggravating cir足cumstance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, we affirm the judgment of conviction imposed upon Mario 
Navoa, Rafael Navoa, and Ricardo Sitchon and sentence them to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, and to indemnify, jointly and solidarily, the heirs of the victim, Tomas Izon, in the amount of P30,000.00.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
</p><p>
With proportionate costs.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Plana, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De La Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J., (Chairman),</em> in the result.
