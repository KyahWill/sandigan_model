				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These consolidated petitions seek the reversal of the Decision of
29 November 1990 of the Court of Appeals annulling the Order of 9 October 1989
of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch 133, which cancelled the notice
of <i>lis pendens</i> on the certificate of title of petitioner Ramon V. Roxas,
and the Resolution of 4 September 1991 denying reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 101760, petitioner-spouses John and Flora KUYKENDALL
were the owners of a parcel of land situated at 520 P. Zamora St., Makati,
Metro Manila, which was leased to respondent-spouses Andres and Gloria DY for
the past seventeen (17) years at the time Civil Case No. 89- 4129, from which
this incident arose, was instituted.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The last written contract of lease between the KUYKENDALLs and
the DYs expired on 31 December 1986; however, the DYs continued to occupy the
subject property on a month-to-month basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the KUYKENDALLs decided to sell the property.  On 28 August 1988, they informed the DYs of
their intention and gave the latter until 30 September 1988 within which to
tender an offer to purchase.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
But the DYs never replied to the notice.  Thus, on 12 October 1988, the KUYKENDALLs advised the DYs of the
expiration of the period within which they could have submitted an offer to
purchase the subject property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 March 1989, the DYs finally offered to purchase the
property in question for P4.5 million.  This was flatly rejected.  Instead,
the KUYKENDALLs quoted a selling price of P5.5 million which was to be valid
for two (2) weeks only or until 10 April 1989.<span style="font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 April 1989, the KUYKENDALLs made a written offer to sell the
property to petitioner Ramon V. ROXAS for P5.521 million in G.R. No.
101728.  The offer was accepted.  On 10 April 1989, the KUYKENDALLs and ROXAS
discussed the terms and conditions of the sale.  The following day they closed the deal with the execution of a
Letter-Agreement of Sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 April 1989, the DYs tendered another offer to buy the
property, this time for <s>P</s>5.5 million, but it was made after the
expiration of the two (2) weeks given them.  The KUYKENDALLs therefore informed the DYs that no further action could
be taken on the new offer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 May 1989, the KUYKENDALLs and ROXAS executed the Deed of
Absolute Sale and confirmed the previous Letter-Agreement to Sell.  On 22 May 1989, ROXAS was issued Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 162636 by the Register of Deeds of Makati.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 June 1989, the DYs commenced an action against the
KUYKENDALLs and ROXAS for Annulment of Deed of Sale and Specific Performance
before the Regional Trial Court of Makati.  The case was raffled to Branch 133.  At the same time, the DYs caused the annotation of a notice of <i>lis
pendens</i> on the certificate of title of ROXAS with the Register of Deeds of
Makati under Entry No. 76223.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 30 June 1989, ROXAS moved for the cancellation of the notice
of <i>lis pendens</i>.  Hearings on the
motion were then conducted on four (4) different dates.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 October 1989, the trial court ordered the cancellation of
the notice of <i>lis pendens</i>.  It
noted that the DYs "failed to present evidence bearing out the allegations
of the complaint,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, the inscription on the certificate of title must be cancelled.  On 29 January 1990, reconsideration of the
order of cancellation was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The DYs thus elevated their cause to the Court of Appeals which,
on 29 November 1990, granted them redress by setting aside the order of
cancellation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The appellate court ruled that "(c)ancellation of a notice of <i>lis
pendens</i> during the pendency of the suit is the exception to the general
rule and must only be resorted to by the court sparingly and only on
exceptional circumstances."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
And, since the trial court denied the affirmative defense of ROXAS that the
complaint stated no cause of action, the annotation of the notice cannot be
said to be for the purpose of molesting ROXAS.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 September 1991, the appellate court denied the motions for
reconsideration filed by the KUYKENDALLs and ROXAS, prompting both parties to
institute separate petitions for review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 February 1992, upon motion of counsel for
respondent-spouses, G.R. Nos. 101728 and 101760 were ordered consolidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their respective petitions, the KUYKENDALLs and ROXAS fault
the Court of Appeals for upholding the inscription on the certificate of title
simply on the basis of the bare allegations of the complaint.  The appellate court allegedly ignored the
fact that hearings were conducted to determine if the DYs were truly entitled
to the annotation on the certificate of title and that it was only thereafter
that the trial court ordered the cancellation of the notice of <i>lis pendens</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The consolidated petitions are meritorious.  Under Sec. 24, Rule 14, of the Rules of
Court, the notice of <i>lis pendens</i> "x x x may be cancelled only upon
order of the court, after proper showing that the notice is for the purpose of
molesting the adverse party, or that <u>it is not necessary to protect the
rights of the party who caused it to be recorded</u>."<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, there are two (2) grounds for the cancellation of a
notice of <i>lis pendens</i>, i.e., that the notice is for the purpose of
molesting the adverse party; and, that <u>it is not necessary to protect the
rights of the party that caused it to be recorded</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">A cursory review of the assailed decision shows that the
appellate court limited itself only to the first ground, i.e., that the notice
is for the purpose of molesting the adverse party, in determining whether or
not the notice of <i>lis pendens</i> should be cancelled.  It apparently held the strained view that
cancellation of the notice of <i>lis pendens</i> during the pendency of the
suit must be resorted to sparingly and only under exceptional
circumstances.  This is patent error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 77 of P.D. 1529, otherwise known as the "Property
Registration Decree," provides that cancellation of the notice may be
effected even before final judgment if there is proper showing that any of the
grounds for its cancellation exists.  Specifically, it provides –</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 77. <i>Cancellation of <u>lis pendens</u></i> – <u>Before
final judgment, a notice of <i>lis pendens</i> maybe cancelled upon order of
the court</u>, after proper showing that the notice is for the purpose of
molesting the adverse party, or that it is not necessary to protect the rights
of the party who caused it to be registered x x x x" (underscoring
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the cancellation of a notice of <i>lis pendens</i>, being a
mere incident to an action, may be ordered at any given time by the court
having jurisdiction over it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But, while a notice of <i>lis pendens</i> cannot ordinarily be
cancelled for as long as the action is pending and unresolved, the proper court
has the authority to determine whether to cancel it under peculiar
circumstances, e.g., where the evidence so far presented by the plaintiff does
not bear out the main allegations in the complaint.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, while the filing of the notice may not have
been for the purpose of molesting the adverse parties, still, if it is later
shown that the inscription is not necessary to protect the right of the DYs
over the subject property, then it should be cancelled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court conducted hearings on the motion for cancellation
of the notice on four different occasions.  In these hearings, evidence by the parties in support of their
respective allegations was received by the trial court and, on the basis
thereof, it concluded that the DYs were not entitled to the inscription of the
notice on the certificate of title of Ramon V. Roxas because they did not have
any actionable right over the subject property.  We are not inclined to disturb these factual conclusions
considering that these findings were no longer passed upon or reviewed by the
Court of Appeals which, in effect, sustained them.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> is
<i>GRANTED</i>.  The Decision of 29
November 1990 of the Court of Appeals is <i>REVERSED</i> and <i>SET ASIDE</i>,
and the Order of 9 October 1989 of the Regional Trial Court of Makati, Branch
133, is <i>REINSTATED</i> and <i>REITERATED</i>.</p>
