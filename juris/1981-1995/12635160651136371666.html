NLRC,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> we upheld the NLRC when it considered additional documentary evidence submitted by the parties <b><i>on appeal</i></b> to prove their contentions.&nbsp; Too long settled is the rule that technicality should not be permitted to stand in the way of equitably and completely resolving the rights and obligations of the parties.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>We now come to the rights of private respondent as a probationary employee at the time of his illegal dismissal.<br><br>Article 281 of the Labor Code provides: <br><br><blockquote>"<b><i>Probationary employment</i></b> shall not exceed six (6) months from the date the employee started working, unless it is covered by an apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer period.&nbsp; <b><i>The services of an employee who has been engaged on a probationary basis may be terminated for a just cause</i></b> or when he fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the employer to the employee at the time of his engagement.&nbsp; An employee who is allowed to work after a probationary period shall be considered a regular employee."</blockquote><br>It is true that probationary employees do not enjoy permanent status but they can only be removed from their work during their probationary period for a valid reason.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> In the case at bench, private respondent was re-employed with Hacienda Colisap for barely two (2) months when he was dismissed without a just cause and without due process.&nbsp; The evidence of private respondent proving this fact cannot be overturned by the flimsy contention of petitioner that he did not cause the former's dismissal as he was abroad at that time.<br><br>In <b><i>Pines City Educational Center v. NLRC,</i></b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> the Court <b><i>en banc</i> </b>ordered the reinstatement of unlawfully dismissed probationary employees and payment of their full backwages, <i>viz</i>:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br><blockquote>"With respect to private respondents Richard Picart and Lucia Chan, both of whom did not sign any contract fixing the periods of their employment nor to have knowingly and voluntarily agreed upon fixed periods of employment, petitioners had the burden of proving that the termination of their services was legal.&nbsp; <b><i>As probationary employees, they are likewise protected by the security of tenure provision of the Constitution.&nbsp; Consequently, they cannot be removed from their positions unless for cause.</i></b><i></i>&nbsp; x x x We concur with these factual findings, there being no showing that they were resolved arbitrarily. <b><i>Thus, the order for their reinstatement and payment of full backwages and other benefits and privileges from the time they were dismissed up to their actual reinstatement is proper, conformably with Article 279 of the Labor Code, as amended by Section 34 of Republic Act No. 6715, which took effect on March 21, 1989. It should be noted that private respondents Roland Picart and Lucia Chan were dismissed illegally on March 31, 1989, or after the effectivity of said amendatory law.</i></b>" (citations omitted)</blockquote><br>In accord with Article 281 of the Labor Code and existing case law, the public respondent correctly ordered the reinstatement of private respondent and the payment of his backwages and other benefits and privileges due him from the time of his dismissal up to his actual reinstatement.&nbsp; We take notice that the controversy arose on <b><i>July 5, 1990</i></b> after the effectivity of R.A. No. 6715, amending section 279 of the Labor Code on <b><i>March 21, 1989</i>.</b><br><br>We will next resolve whether public respondent erred in additionally granting <b><i>backwages</i> </b>and <b><i>separation pay</i> </b>to private respondent.<br><br><b><i>Backwages</i></b> and <b><i>separation pay</i></b> are distinct reliefs given to alleviate the economic damage suffered by an illegally dismissed employee.&nbsp; Payment of <b><i>backwages</i></b> is specifically designed to restore an employee's income that was lost because of his unjust dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> On the other hand, payment of <b><i>separation pay</i></b> is intended to provide the employee money during the period in which he will be looking for another employment.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Considering the purpose behind the grant of <b><i>separation pay</i></b>, it was grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondent to order the payment of <b><i>separation pay</i></b> as it is <b><i>inconsistent with its ruling reinstating the private respondent.</i></b>&nbsp; Their inherent inconsistency is self-evident and needs no further elaboration.<br><br>Finally, we reject petitioner's submission that there is no substantial evidence to support the public respondent's award of wage differentials to private respondent. The ruling of the public respondent clearly repudiates petitioner's charge and we quote:<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br></div><br><blockquote>"Lastly, on the award of differential pay, We find no merit in the respondent's submission that there is no showing that the complainant-appellant was underpaid, or that the payrolls show that the complainant was receiving P183.75 daily.<br><br>The complaint clearly alleged that the complainant was only receiving P73.50 a day upon his termination on July 5, 1989.&nbsp; With respect to the payrolls there is nothing therefrom that can clearly convince Us that the amount of P183.75 was the complainant's daily wage as the period covered for such payroll is not indicated.&nbsp; It merely states that for the period ended May 10, 1990 and May 17, 1990, it did not reflect the number of days worked by the complainant-appellant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></blockquote><br>We are bound by this appraisal of evidence made by the public respondent considering its support by the records of the case.<br><br><b>IN VIEW HEREOF,</b> the assailed Decision is AFFIRMED with the MODIFICATION that the award for separation pay is deleted.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br>SO ORDERED.<br><br><i>Narvasa, C.J., (Chairman), Regalado,</i> and <i>Mendoza, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><br><br><hr align="LEFT" noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> NLRC Decision of December 10, 1992, reversing the Decision dated June 23, 1992 of Labor Arbiter Merlin D.
