<p class="BODY">Domingo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> are brothers of the full blood who together with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">their </span>respective spouses are the
registered co-owners in fee simple in equal shares <u>pro</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>indiviso</u></span>, of two (2) parcels of land both situated
in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Lambakin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Marilao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> covered by
Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. T-228169 and T-229353 issued by the Register
of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and his spouse, <span class="SpellE">Mely</span> Tan were president and treasurer, respectively, of <span class="SpellE">Sonice</span> Enterprises, Inc., a family corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1983</st1:date>,
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and his spouse went abroad and came back
only on <st1:date year="1983" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
applied for a loan with Planters Development Bank (the bank for short) offering
as collateral the aforementioned properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As the bank knew that these properties were owned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>common by the two brothers, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> was required to execute a real estate mortgage in favor
of the bank duly signed by Manuel and Domingo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1983</st1:date>
spouses Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mely</span>
Tan caused the execution of a falsified deed of absolute sale of the share of
Domingo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and his spouse over the property in their
favor (Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and his spouse) for a consideration
in the amount of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of said falsified document, said
properties were transferred and registered solely in the name of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> under TCT Nos. T-52.275(M) and T-52.276(M) both issued
on <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1983</st1:date> by the
Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon presentation of said titles, the bank granted a loan in the
amount of P5 Million to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mely</span> Tan in their capacity as president and treasurer of <span class="SpellE">Sonice</span> Enterprises, Inc., secured by a joint real estate
and chattel mortgage executed by the spouses covering the two parcels <span class="GramE">of</span> land together with the improvements thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon failure of the spouses to pay their loan obligation to the
bank, the latter instituted an extrajudicial foreclosure of said properties,
and being the highest bidder in a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">public
</span>auction a certificate of sale in favor of the bank was issued by the
sheriff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the spouses Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mely</span> Tan failed to
exercise their right of redemption within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period, the ownership of the properties was consolidated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">in </span>the name of the bank and new
certificates of title were issued to it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon discovery of the fraud, the spouses Domingo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> <span class="SpellE">Siu</span>
Ken filed a complaint for annulment of the deed of sale and joint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">real </span>estate and chattel mortgage
against the spouses Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mely</span>
Tan and the bank in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In

share of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">his spouse </span>in the subject properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was because of such falsified document
that the sole title to the said properties was transferred and registered in
the name of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and his spouse and new
certificates of title were issued to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

granted Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and spouse the loan applied for
after said spouses executed the real estate and chattel mortgage of the
properties and its improvements to secure the loan of P5 Million.</p>

<p class="BODY">No doubt petitioner bank is an innocent mortgagee for value who
in good faith relied on the clean title of the mortgagors covering the
properties in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In accepting
such a mortgage it is not required that such a mortgagee-bank should make a

the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">share </span>of Domingo <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and his spouse in the property to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and his spouse was falsified, and that the transfer of
the sole title of the properties in the name of Manuel <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
and his spouse was the result of such a forgery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no notice of any flaw in the title
