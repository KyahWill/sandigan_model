incident on 1 November 1979, has charged ANTONIO <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Dolores, 42, married, with having robbed her of her virginity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">ANA was born on 10 November 1967 (Exhibit "A").  She, her mother, three sisters, the youngest
being one (1) year old, and two brothers, lived in an apartment on the third
floor of the Tenement Apartment Building at Punta, Sta. Ana, Manila.  The father works overseas.</p>

<p class="BODY">ANTONIO, with his wife Eloisa and a seven-year old son, who
suffers from a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">physical defect due </span>to
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cerebral palsy, occup</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ied</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> another apartment in the same tenement, not far</span> from
ANA's.  He and his wife operate a small
store on the ground floor of the tenement building.  The store has a bodega for empty softdrinks bottles located
behind shelves which serve as a partition (TSN, 14 June 1983, p. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">ANA has a first cousin, more or less of the same age, Luzviminda
Domingo, who also lived in a unit on the third floor of the same tenement
house.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 1 November 1979, Luzviminda, at around 11:30 in the morning,
informed ANA that ANTONIO wanted her (ANA) to go down to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">his </span>store because he was going to give
her a birthday present, with the additional message that "siyaâ€™y (Mang
Tony) nagsisisi na at mabait."</p>

<p class="BODY">According to ANA, when so informed, she was at home watching over
her baby sister.  Later in the day, at
around 1:30 P.M., she went down to ANTONIO's store as bidded and asked ANTONIO
for her gift.  ANTONIO then told her to
enter the store to see the gift.  ANA
went inside, looked around but saw no present.  When she looked back, ANTONIO was already behind her, "pushed (her)
towards the down step and even pushed (her) inside the mezzanine," causing
her to fall face down on the floor.  Thereafter, she recounted:</p>

June 1982, pp. 4-5).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When ANA stepped out of the store, she was seen by her cousin,
Luzviminda, who was about to call her so they could take a bath.  Luzvimida asked ANA why she was looking so
pale, touched her, and because Luzviminda thought that ANA had caught a fever,
they both decided to forego their bath and to just go up to their apartments
(ibid., p. 6).</p>

<p class="BODY">Fearful of ANTONIO's threat, ANA kept the incident of 1 November 1979
to herself until five (5) months later, or on 9 May 1980.  At around 2:30 P.M. of that date, ANA went
to ANTONIO's store to buy a bottle of softdrinks.  ANTONIO told her to serve herself.  When she was drinking, ANTONIO took advantage of her and touched
her breasts.  Soon thereafter, ANTONIO's
wife, Eloisa, arrived at the store.  According to ANTONIO and Eloisa, the latter scolded ANA for buying
softdrinks without payment.  Frightened,
ANA ran out.  ANTONIO then told his wife
that ANA had paid for her drink and advised his wife to go to ANA's apartment
to apologize to ANA's mother.  ELOISA
allegedly did but because the mother was out the apology was extended to the
grandmother instead (TSN, 14 July 1983, pp. 12-13).</p>

<p class="BODY">According to ANA, however, ELOISA quarreled with the grandmother
and revealed to the latter the happening between her and ANTONIO.  The information was relayed to ANA's mother,
who, the day after, proceeded forthwith to the Sta. Ana Police Station where
ANA reported not only the 9 May 1980 incident but also that of 1 November 1979
and all other attempts on her person by ANTONIO (TSN, 9 July 1982, pp. 6-8).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon advice by the police, ANA and her mother proceeded to the
NBI for medical examination, which was conducted on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">13 May 1980, but the results of which were released only on 22 August
1980 upon subpoena by the Investigating Fiscal (RTC Decision, p. 24,
Rollo).  The NBI findings (Exhibit
"B," Original record, p. 37) showed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>â€œ1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>No evident sign of extragenital injury noted
on the body of the subject at the time of examination.</blockquote>

<blockquote>â€œ2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Hymen, intact, and its orifice small (2.0 in
diameter) as to preclude complete penetration by an average-sized, adult
Filipino male organ in full erection without producing any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">genital </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">injury."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Impatient, however, over
the non-release of the results of the NB medical report, mother and daughter
went to the PC Crime Laboratory at Camp Crame for another medical examination
on 23 May 1980 (TSN, 9 July 1982, p. 15).  The </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">results revealed a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">different conclusion, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fleshy-type hymen with a deep, healed laceration at 9 and a shallow healed
laceration at 3 o'clock positions.  x x

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On 14 December 1981,
ANA's mother filed a Complaint for Rape for the incident of 1 November 1979
against ANTONIO before the then Court of First Instance of Manila.  Apparently, the Investigating Fiscal had
dismissed the other charges contained in ANA's affidavit of "abuse four or
five times on different occasions, particularly, on 1 November 1979, 23
February 1980, 19 March 1980, 9 May 1980 and in another occasion the date of
which was not ascertained" (Decision, pp. 1 &amp; 3; Original record, p.
102; </span>Exhibit "DD").  Upon review, however, the filing of the present case for the incident of
1 November 1979 was directed by the City Fiscal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony in open Court, ANTONIO flatly denied any alleged
rape on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">1 </span>November 1979,
contending that he was out for lunch at around 1:30 P.M. of that day and that
it was his wife who was then tending the store.  He and his wife alternate in taking care of the place.  Since it was All Saints Day, they had many
customers, aside from the fact that in front of the store is a parking lot for
jeepneys and drivers mill around.  ANTONIO denied having instructed Luzviminda to send ANA down to his
store.  In fact, he claims that he had
never seen her on 1 November 1979 nor up to the date he testified on 14 July
1983 (TSN, 14 July 1983, pp. 9-10) because she lives in another tenement
house.  According to him, neither had he
seen ANA the whole day of 1 November 1979 (ibid., p. 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 May 1980, ANTONIO admitted that ANA was in his store buying
softdrinks and he had told her to serve herself because he was attending to
customers.  It was then that his wife
arrived and scolded ANA for not paying for her drink and uttered bad words
against her.  He then told his wife to
apologize to ANA's mother.  His wife
allegedly obeyed and apologized to the grandmother because the mother happened
to be out (ibid., pp. 10-12).</p>

<p class="BODY">ANTONIO's line of defense is further predicated on an alleged
pattern of extortion by ANA's mother.  It is claimed that through the Barangay Captain she had first asked for
P200.00 for the humiliation suffered by her daughter at his hands and
subsequently increased it to P1,000.00 (ibid., pp. 12-14).  The mother allegedly told ANTONIO that if he
could not give her the latter amount, she would file <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">a </span>case against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After trial, the Court <u>a</u>
</span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quo</span></u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The records disclose that
the transcripts of </span>stenographic notes containing the testimonies of ANA
were not included among those transmitted to this Court.  The list of transcripts forwarded by the
lower Court neither included the dates when ANA testified, particularly, 14 May
1982 and 15 June 1982.  It is for this
reason that the decision in this case has been considerably delayed, and it was
only after the Solicitor General had called the attention of the Court to the
missing transcripts; after investigation by the Office of the Court
Administrator; and after the lower Court personnel concerned were required to
show cause why they should not be disciplinarily dealt with, that the "lost"
transcripts were found "under a cabinet" and finally transmitted to
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The defense faults the
Court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>â€œ1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in failing to rule that
the filing of this rape case was designed to extort money from the accused-appellant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>â€œ2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in omitting to acquit
the accused-appellant because his guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in being â€˜more
inclinedâ€™ to believe the medical findings of the Philippine Constabulary Crime
Laboratory (PCCL) medico-legal officer and in totally disregarding the medical
findings of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) medico-legal
officer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense points out that the incident was allegedly committed
at about high noon on All Saints Day, when all the nearby stores in the
tenement house were open to customers and when there were numerous persons
milling around the stores.  Given this
"public setting", it is argued that ANTONIO would not have dared, let
alone succeeded, in committing the crime imputed to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jurisprudence is replete, however, with cases holding that rape
can be committed even in places where people congregate:  in parks, along the roadside, within the
school premises, and even inside the house where there are other occupants
(People v. Viray, G.R. No. 41085, 8 August 1988, 164 SCRA 135, citing People v.
Opena, G.R. No. 34954, 20 February 1981, 102 SCRA 755 and People v. Aragona,
G.R. No. 43752, 19 September 1985, 138 SCRA 869).  It is not necessary that the place where rape is committed be
isolated.  Besides, in this case, the
criminal act was perpetrated in the mezzanine of the bodega, behind the
partition made of shelves, away from public view.  More, there is only one other store on the ground floor of the
tenement building (TSN, 14 June 1983, p. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">Aware of the <u>caveat</u> that the testimony of a woman crying
rape must be scrutinized with extreme caution, we have meticulouly reviewed the
evidence and have arrived at the conclusion that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">ANTONIO's </span>guilt has been established by clear and satisfactory
evidence.  Contrary to his assertion,
the testimonies of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ANA </span>and
Luzviminda were not tainted with patent inconsistencies.  Their declarations convincingly show that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ANTONIO </span>had instructed Luzviminda to
tell <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ANA </span>to go to his store so
he could give her a birthday present.  ANA went as instructed.  While
inside the bodega of the store, she was sexually abused until the odious act
was interrupted by a female voice calling for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">ANTONIO.  </span>Luzviminda
testified that she saw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ANA </span>coming
out of the store looking pale.  At the
same time, she also saw accused-appellant with his trousers unzipped <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(TSN, 30 </span>April 1982, p. 15).</p>

<p class="BODY">The assertion that the rape charge was fabricated for the purpose
of extorting money from ANTONIO is far from persuasive.  On the contrary, there is also evidence
disclosing that it was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ANTONIO, </span>accompanied
by the Barangay Captain, who went to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ANAâ€™s
</span>apartment offering P5,000.00.  Much later, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">ANTONIO's </span>neighbor
upped the offer to P10,000.00, which was neither accepted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">(TSN </span>on rebuttal, 12 September 1986,
p. 4).  Taken in the light of the
circumstances of this case, it is unthinkable for a child or her mother to
fabricate a case of rape and falsely accuse ANTONIO just because of the latter's
refusal to pay Two Hundred Pesos (P200.00), or even One Thousand Pesos
(P1,000.00).  It is unimaginable for
them to undergo the expense, trouble and inconvenience of a public trial, not
to mention the scandal, embarrassment and humiliation such action inevitably
invites, as well as to subject ANA to an examination of her private parts, and
to sell her honor and being for mercenary considerations.  No other motive can be ascribed to
complainants in filing the rape charge except that of a desire for justice and
redress for a despicable wrong inflicted (People v. Cayago, G.R. No. 47398, 14
March 1988, 158 SCRA 586).</p>

<p class="BODY">ANTONIO had also enmeshed himself in contradictions.  In his testimony on 14 July 1983, he
insisted that the present charge is a mere fabrication and that ANA never went
to his store on 1 November 1979; while Luzviminda is unknown to him as she
resides in another tenement; that he had not seen her until that date (14 July
1983) and, therefore, could not identify her (pp. 9-10).  On 6 September 1983, however, he declared
that Luzviminda was not residing in the same tenement building but "is a
cousin of the Prior family" (p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">5).  </span>In other words, Luzviminda was not
totally unknown to him.  He even knew
her relationship with ANA'S family.  Again, on 13 October 1983, he testified that he and his wife take turns
in taking lunch.  On 1 November 1979, he
went up to his apartment at 12:00 noon ahead of his wife to take his lunch and
that he returned to the store after 20-30 minutes.  His wife then went upstairs and stayed there for about an hour
(pp. 11-12).  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">At </span>the subsequent hearing on 8 November 1983, however, he stated
that it was his wife who first went upstairs to take her lunch.  When cornered by the Fiscal, he replied that
"he cannot remember anymore because of the lapse of time" (p. 2).  Further, he stated that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ANA </span>did not go to his store on 9 May
1980, only to contradict himself the next instant to say that she did (p.
3).  Then, too, he declared that when <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ANA </span>was at the store, his wife was
"maybe she was upstairs" only to state later that she had followed
him to the store (p. 3).  All of which
prompted his lawyer to ask for continuance because <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">ANTONIO </span>was ostensibly not feeling well.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The foregoing cast
serious doubts, indeed, on the credibility of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">ANTONIO, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">particularly,
his denials of the criminal imputation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The defense additionally
faults the Trial Court for being "more inclined" to believe the
medical findings of the PC Crime Laboratory (PCCL) and in totally disregarding
the NBI medical report.  The physical
examination findings of the two agencies are admittedly contradictory.  The NBI </span>certified to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ANA's </span>virginity; the PCCL reported her
non-virginity.  The defense then submits
that the two reports should cancel each other leaving a void, with no evidence
remaining to convict ANTONIO.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Suffice it to state that
even without any medical certificate, the testimonial evidence on hand
sufficiently </span>establishes ANTONIOâ€™s culpability beyond reasonable
doubt.  In fact, it is not even necessary
that the raped victim be medically examined (People v. Orteza, 116 Phil. 424
[1962]; People v. Salazar, L-37791, 30 October 1979, 93 SCRA 796).  Moreover, the NBI conclusion merely
"preclude(d) complete penetration." From the testimony of ANA herself,
full penetration was not effected because she had moved to the left when she
felt pain in her private part, and the detestable act was interrupted when a
female voice called for ANTONIO (TSN, 7 June 1982, p. 5).  In other words, the NBI finding did not
preclude slight penetration.  The
important factor is the extent of such penetration, it being sufficient that
the labia has been penetrated (People v. Salazar, <u>supra</u>; People v.
Aballe, L-45087, 23 October 1984, 132 SCRA 641).</p>

<blockquote>"Complete or total penetration of complainant's private organ
is not necessary to consummate the crime of rape.  The slightest of penetration is sufficient.  Neither is the rupture of the hymen essential
for the crime of consummated rape.  It
is enough that there is proof of entrance of the male organ within the labia of
the pudendum" (People v. Aragona, L-43752, 19 September 1985, 138 SCRA
569).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">All told, the evidence convincingly establishes that there was
carnal knowledge of ANA by ANTONIO on 1 November 1979 when ANA was barely twelve
(12) years old.  Statutory rape has been
committed.  There need have been no
force or intimidation nor should the young victim have been deprived of reason
or otherwise unconscious (Article 335, Revised Penal Code; People v. Celis,
L-26977, 30 September 1970, 35 SCRA 129; People v. de la Cruz, L-28810, 27
March 1974, 56 SCRA 85).</p>

<p class="BODY">Not only is conviction justified by the evidence.  It is also in keeping with the role of the
State as <u>parens</u> <u>patriae</u> by virtue of which it is mandated to
provide utmost protection to those of tender years.  The injury inflicted in cases of rape of this nature is not to
the unfortunate minor victim alone.  It
causes consternation on her entire family and offends the sensibilities of
society as a whole.  The rigorous
application of the penal law is called for (People v. Baylon, L-35785, 27 May
1974, 57 SCRA 114).</p>
