Civil Case </span>No. Q-45139, against Central Bank and Ramon V. Tiaoqui to
annul MB Resolution No. 596, with prayer for injunction, challenging in the
process the constitutionality of Sec. 29 of R.A. 269, otherwise known as
"The Central Bank Act," as amended, insofar as it authorizes the
Central Bank to take over a banking institution even if it is not charged with
violation of any law or regulation, much less found guilty thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On 1 July 1985, the trial court temporarily restrained
petitioners from implementing MB Resolution No. 596 "until further
orders", thus prompting them to move for the quashal of the restraining
order (TRO) on the ground that it did not comply with said Sec. 29, i.e., that
TSB failed to show convincing proof of arbitrariness and bad faith on the part
of petitioners; and, that TSB failed to post the requisite bond in favor of
Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 19 July 1985, acting on the motion to quash the restraining
order, the trial court granted the relief sought and denied the application of
TSB for injunction.  Thereafter, Triumph
Savings Bank filed with Us a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of
the Rules of Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

questioned MB resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on 9 August 1985, Central Bank and Ramon Tiaoqui filed
a motion to dismiss the complaint before the RTC for failure to state a cause
of action, i.e., it did not allege ultimate facts showing that <u>the action
was plainly arbitrary</u> and <u>made in bad faith</u>, which are the only
grounds for the annulment of Monetary Board resolutions placing a bank under
conservatorship, and that TSB was without legal capacity to sue except through
its receiver.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">On 9 September 1985, TSB filed an urgent motion in the RTC to
direct receiver Ramon V. Tiaoqui to restore TSB to its private management.  On 11 November 1985, the RTC in separate
orders denied petitioners' motion to dismiss and ordered receiver Tiaoqui to
restore the management <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>TSB to
its elected board of directors and officers, subject to CB comptrollership.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the orders of the trial court rendered moot the petition
for <i>certiorari</i> then pending before this Court, Central Bank and Tiaoqui
moved on 2 December 1985 for the dismissal of G.R. No. 71465 which We granted
on 18 December 1985.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

September 1986, the appellate court, upheld the orders of the trial court thus
-</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners' motion to dismiss was premised on two grounds,
namely, that the complaint failed to state a cause of action and that the
Triumph Savings Bank was without capacity to sue except through its appointed
receiver.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Concerning the first ground, petitioners themselves admit
that the Monetary Board resolution placing the Triumph Savings Bank under the
receivership of the officials of the Central Bank was done without prior
hearing, that is, without first hearing the side of the bank.  They further admit that said resolution can
be the subject of judicial review and may be set aside should it be found that
the same was issued with arbitrariness and in bad faith.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The charge of lack of due process in the complaint may be
taken as constitutive of allegations of arbitrariness and bad faith.  This is not of course to be taken as meaning
that there must be previous hearing before the Monetary Board may exercise its
powers under Section 29 of its Charter.  Rather, judicial review of such action not being foreclosed, it would be
best should private respondent be given the chance to show and prove arbitrariness
and bad faith in the issuance of the questioned resolution, especially so in
the light of the statement of private respondent that neither the bank itself
nor its officials were even informed of any charge of violating banking laws.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In regard to lack of capacity to sue on the part of Triumph
Savings Bank, we view such argument as being specious, for if we get the drift
of petitioners' argument, they mean to convey the impression that only the CB
appointed receiver himself may question the CB resolution appointing him as
such.  This may be asking for the
impossible, for it cannot be expected that the master, the CB, will allow the
receiver it has appointed to question that very appointment.  Should the argument of petitioners be given
circulation, then judicial review of actions of the CB would be effectively
checked and foreclosed to the very bank officials who may feel, as in the case
at bar, that the CB action ousting them from the bank deserves to be set aside.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x  x</blockquote>

set aside, and that the civil case pending before the RTC of Quezon City, Civil
Case No. Q-45139, be dismissed.  Petitioners allege that the Court of Appeals erred -</p>

prior notice and hearing be afforded to all parties in administrative
proceedings.  Since MB Resolution No.
596 was adopted without TSB being previously notified and heard, according to
respondents, the same is void for want of due process; consequently, the bank's
management should be restored to its board of directors and officers.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that it is the essence of Sec. 29 of R.A. 265
that prior notice and hearing in cases involving bank closures should not be
required since in all probability a hearing would not only cause unnecessary
delays but also provide bank "insiders" and stockholders the
opportunity to further dissipate the bank's resources, create liabilities for
the bank up to the insured amount of P40,000.00, and even destroy evidence of
fraud or irregularity in the bank's operations to the prejudice of its depositors
and creditors.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

Petitioners further argue that the legislative intent of Sec. 29 is to repose
in the Monetary Board exclusive power to determine the existence of statutory
grounds for the closure and liquidation of banks, having the required expertise
and specialized competence to do so.<span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Contrary to the notion of
private respondent, Sec. 29 does not contemplate prior notice and hearing
before a bank </span>may be directed to stop operations and placed under

as amended by E.O. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">289) provides for the
filing of a case within ten (10) days </span>after the receiver takes charge of
the assets of the bank, it is unmistakable that the assailed actions should
precede the filing of the case.  Plainly, the legislature could not have intended to authorize "no
prior notice and hearing" in the closure of the bank and at the same time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">allow a suit to annul it on the basis of
absence thereof.</span></p>

We held that a previous hearing is nowhere required in Sec. 29 nor does the
constitutional requirement of due process demand that the correctness of the
Monetary Board's resolution to stop operation and proceed to liquidation be
first adjudged before making the resolution effective.  It is enough that a subsequent judicial
review be provided.</p>

We reiterated that Sec. 29 of R.A. 265 does not require a previous hearing
before the Monetary Board can implement its resolution closing a bank, since
its action is subject to judicial scrutiny as provided by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be emphasized that Sec. 29 does not altogether divest a
bank or a non-bank financial institution placed under receivership of the
opportunity to be heard and present evidence on arbitrariness and bad faith
because within ten (10) days from the date the receiver takes charge of the
assets of the bank, resort to judicial review may be had by filing an
appropriate pleading with the court.  Respondent TSB did in fact avail of this remedy by filing a complaint
with the RTC of Quezon City on the 8th day following the takeover by the
receiver of the bank's assets on 3 June 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">This "close now and hear later" scheme is grounded on
practical and legal considerations to prevent unwarranted di<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">s</span>sipation of the bank's assets and as

<blockquote>"xxx the banking business is properly subject to reasonable
regulation under the police power of the state because of its nature and
relation to the fiscal affairs of the people and the revenues of the state (9
CJS 32).  Banks are affected with public
interest because they receive funds from the general public in the form of
deposits.  Due to the nature of their
transactions and functions, a fiduciary relationship is created between the
banking institutions and their depositors.  Therefore, banks are under the obligation to treat with meticulous care
and utmost fidelity the accounts of those who have reposed theirs trust and
confidence in them (Simex International [Manila], Inc., v. Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>Appeals, 183 SCRA 360 [1990]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is then the Government's responsibility to see to it that

<p class="BODY">Section 29 of R.A. 265 should be viewed in this light; otherwise,

misplaced in view of factual circumstances </span>therein which are not
attendant in the present case.  We ruled
in <i>Banco Filipino</i> that the closure of the bank was arbitrary and
attendant with grave abuse of discretion, not because of the absence of prior
notice and hearing, but that the Monetary Board had no sufficient basis to
arrive at a sound conclusion of insolvency to justify the closure.  In other words, the arbitrariness, bad faith
and abuse of discretion were determined only after the bank was placed under
conservatorship and evidence thereon was received by the trial court.  As this Court found in that case, the
Valenzuela, Aurellano and Tiaoqui Reports contained unfounded assumptions and
deductions which did not reflect the true financial condition of the bank.  For instance, the subtraction of an
uncertain amount as valuation reserve from the assets of the ban<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">?????</span>, result in its net
worth or the unimpaired ca<span style="background:yellow;mso-highlight:yellow">?????</span>
surplus; it did not reflect the total financial <span style="background:yellow;
mso-highlight:yellow">?????</span> of Banco Filipino.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the same reports showed that the total assets of
Banco Filipino far exceeded its total <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">liabilities.  Consequently, on the basis thereof, the
Monetary Board had no valid reason to liquidate the bank; perhaps it could have
merely ordered its reorganization or rehabilitation, if need be.  Clearly, there was in that case a manifest
arbitrariness, abuse of discretion and bad faith in the closure of </span><i>Banco</i>
<i>Filipino</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by the Monetary
Board.  But, this is not the case before
Us.  For here, what is being raised as
arbitrary by private respondent is the denial of prior notice and hearing by
the Monetary Board, a matter long settled in this jurisdiction, and not the
arbitrariness which the conclusions of the </span>Supervision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and Examination Sector (SES), Department II,

action of the Monetary Board to forbid the institution to do business in the

by the examining department of the Central Bank; (b) report by said department
to the Monetary Board; and (c) </span><i>prima facie</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">showing that its continuance in business

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">In<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp; </span>sum, </span>appeal to procedural due process cannot just outweigh the
evil sought to be prevented; hence, We rule that Sec. 29 of R.A. 265 is a sound
legislation promulgated in accordance with the Constitution in the exercise of
police power of the state.  Consequently, the absence of notice and hearing is not a valid ground to
annul a Monetary Board resolution placing a bank under receivership.  The absence of prior notice and hearing
cannot be deemed acts of arbitrariness and bad faith.  Thus, an MB resolution placing a bank under receivership, or
conservatorship for that matter, may only be annulled after a determination has
been made by the trial court that its issuance was tainted with arbitrariness
and bad faith.  Until such determination
is made, the status quo shall be maintained, i.e., the bank shall continue to be
under receivership.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the second ground, to rule that only the receiver may
bring suit in behalf of the bank is, to echo the respondent appellate court,
"asking for the impossible, for it cannot be expected that the master, the
CB, will allow the receiver it has appointed to question that very
appointment." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Consequently, only </span>stockholders
of a bank could file an action for annulment of a Monetary Board resolution
placing the bank under receivership <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and</span>

<blockquote>“x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>in requiring that only
the stockholders of record representing the majority of the capital stock may
bring the action to set aside a resolution to place a bank under conservatorship
is to ensure that it be not frustrated or defeated by the incumbent Board of
Directors or officers who may immediately resort to court action to prevent its
implementation or enforcement.  It is
presumed that such a resolution is directed principally against acts of said
Directors and officers which place the bank in a state of continuing inability
to maintain a condition of liquidity adequate to protect the interest of
depositors and creditors.  Indirectly,
it is likewise intended to protect and safeguard the rights and interests of
the stockholders.  Common sense and
public policy dictate then that the authority to decide on whether to contest
the resolution should be lodged with the stockholders owning a majority of the
shares for they are expected to be more objective in determining whether the
resolution is plainly arbitrary and issued in bad faith."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is observed that the complaint in this case was filed on 11
June 1985 or two (2) years prior to 25 July 1987 when E.O. 289 was issued, to
be effective sixty (60) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">days </span>after
its approval (Sec. 5).  The implication
is that before E.O. 289, any party in interest could institute <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">court </span>proceedings to question a
Monetary Board resolution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">placing </span>a
bank under receivership.  Consequently,
since the instant complaint was filed by parties representing themselves to be
officers of respondent Bank (Officer-in-Charge and Vice President), the case
before the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">should </span>now
take its natural course.  However, after
the effectivity of E.O. 289, the procedure stated therein should be followed
and observed.</p>
