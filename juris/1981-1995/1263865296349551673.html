adverse, peaceful and notorious possession thereof for the last 32 years from
1938 until 1970 when this case was filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Faytaren</span>.</p>

executed a deed of extrajudicial partition, wherein they recognized and
affirmed the sale of five hectares of Parcel B by their parents to the spouses <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Manrique</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, some of the heirs sold their

<p class="BODY">Upon denial of his motion for reconsideration, <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span> filed the present petition anchored mainly on the
validity of the sale to him of subject land by P. <span class="SpellE">Lazo-Mampusti</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the sale, premised on Sec. 20 of CA 141, was
belatedly questioned in the Court of Appeals which, nonetheless, ruled in favor
of <span class="SpellE">Faytaren</span> over <span class="SpellE">Rabe's</span>
objections based on Art. 1409 of the new Civil Code, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The general rule is that defenses and objections not pleaded
in the answer are deemed waived (Section 2, Rule 9, Rules of Court), and that
issues not raised before the lower court cannot be considered for the first
time on appeal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(Ng
</span><span class="SpellE">Cho</span> Ohio v. Ng Ding, 1 SCRA 275).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This rule is not, however, absolute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, Article 1409 of the N<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">ew </span>Civil
Code provides that the right to set up the defense of illegality of inexistent
and void contract cannot be waived.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contract between <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> purports to alienate, convey or transfer <span class="SpellE">Lazo's</span> ownership of subject land, which at that time was
still public land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1409 of the
New Civil Code expressly declares as <span class="SpellE">inexisting</span> (sic)
and void from the beginning those contracts prohibited or declared void by
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 20 of the Public Land
Act, if the applicant for public land alienates or transfer his rights before
the issuance of the homestead patent to him, said transfer is null and void if
it is without the previous approval of the Director of Lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, there is no affirmative
showing that previous approval of the transfer was obtained from the Director
of Lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The transfer, therefore, is
null and void.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is well settled that a void contract can neither be
confirmed nor ratified (<span class="SpellE">Menil</span> v. Court of Appeals, 84
SCRA 413; <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>,
1 SCRA 691).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, the
recognition and confirmation by the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> of the sale of the subject land to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span> are bereft of any
legal force and cannot validate the sale." (pp. 89-90, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the petition before Us, <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span>
disputes the conclusion of the Court of Appeals in that Sec. 20 cannot apply in
the case at hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 20 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 20.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If at any time <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">An analysis of the foregoing provision reveals that <span class="SpellE">Faytaren's</span> reliance on Sec. 20 is misplaced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 20 contemplates a situation where an applicant
(considered as such because his application has already been approved) wishes
to transfer his homestead rights to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><u>bona
fide</u> purchaser (not for speculation) in which case the approval of the
Director of Lands must be obtained prior to such transfer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the provision applies only in cases of transfers made <u>after
a homestead application has </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">been </span>approved,
but before the corresponding patent is </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">issued</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span>(Sec.
118 of CA 141 would govern <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>transfer
made <u style="text-underline:words">after</u> the issuance of the homestead
patent).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing in the present case that at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>time of the sale in 1938 an
application was, in fact, filed by the <span class="SpellE">Mampusti</span>
spouses, or if on<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">e has </span>been so
filed, that the same was already approved at the time of the sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Since </span>the
approval of the Director of Lands is a prerequisite only when an application
has been approved, obviously, Section 20 does not apply in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been established that the <span class="SpellE">Mampusti-Lazo</span>
heirs were <u>never</u> in physical possession of subject lot (pp. 83-84, CA
Decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), Neither has it been disputed that
the <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span> spouses were in adverse occupancy and
possession thereof for more than 32 years, which in effect had ripened into
ownership, by reason of the inaction and complacency not only of <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> herself from whom
the property was acquired, but also of her surviving heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We
</span>agree with the trial court that:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
such inaction and indifference on the part of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> to take legal steps to recover the property from
the <span class="SpellE">Rabes</span>, coupled with their tacit approval and
recognition of the right of the said couple over the property after the latter
was purchased in 1938 from their mother <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> up to 1970 when it was placed under receivership,
constituted <span class="SpellE">laches</span> on their part, they having slept
on their rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, whatever
transactions they might have entered in relation to the subject landholding
with third parties like Leon <span class="SpellE">Faytaren</span>, as in these
cases, did not amount to anything and did not effect (sic) whatsoever the right
and interest of the <span class="SpellE">Rabe</span> couple over the property,
which after its purchase by them from <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, was automatically transferred to them and segregated
from the mass of land belonging to the couple <span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mampusti</span> and <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By and large, therefore, there is no dispute that not only
TCT No. T-40129 but also all the titles that preceded the same, except OCT No. 3521,
should be as they are hereby declared null and void, it being clearly
ventilated in the evidence that said titles were issued without any leg to
stand on because the property embraced by said titles already belonged to the <span class="SpellE">Rabes</span> whose right thereto had been vested to them from the
time they purchased the land in 1938 from the deceased <span class="SpellE">Potenciana</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>." (pp. 51-52, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> in this case is a
necessary consequence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For to adjudge
respondent <span class="SpellE">Faytaren</span>, owner of the disputed lot,
solely on the basis of its having been erroneously included in their
certificate of title would indeed be “a sad day for the law for then, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We </span>shall be
attaching full faith and credence to a Torrens certificate of title oblivious
of the demands of justice and anchoring our decision solely on a narrow and
literal reading of a statutory prescription, devoid of any shadow of moral
right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, <span class="GramE">We</span>
