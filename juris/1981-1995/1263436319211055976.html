				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Accused ROGELIO RAMOS Y CABAYU, a 36-year old Bible History
teacher and principal of a Catholic high school, was charged before the
Regional Trial Court of Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, with the rape of one of his
graduating students, 16-year old Soledad Puzon.  His defense is that the young <i>Cagayana</i> voluntarily
submitted herself to him in exchange for allowing her to graduate after she was
allegedly found to have taken a "Crispa" t-shirt belonging to a
classmate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not believe the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> It
convicted him of rape, sentenced him to <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">reclusion </span>perpetua</i> and to pay the offended party moral
damages in the amount of P10,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Like the trial court, we find the accused guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying in her native dialect <i>Ibanag</i>, Soledad Puzon, a
16-year old fourth year high school student of the Lyceum of Abulug, Cagayan,
narrated that she was instructed by the accused, who was her school principal
and teacher in Bible History, C.A.T. and Pilipino, to bring her parents to his
house on 20 September 1981 at around two o'clock in the afternoon as she was
being accused of stealing a T-shirt belonging to a classmate,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">that </span>if she failed to bring
her parents, she would not be admitted to class the following school day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
However, she could not take her parents along that appointed day and time as
her mother had a headache.  Nonetheless,
she proceeded to the house of the accused to inform him that she and her
parents would see him the following Monday morning instead.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> As
she reached the house of her principal?teacher, she stood outside the
roadside and delivered to him the message that her mother could not make it
that afternoon.  But she could hardly be
heard because of the lingering wind from a weakening storm.  The accused asked her to go inside the
house.  She innocently obliged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Unfortunately, his wife and children were not in the house.  They were supposedly in Laoag for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">interment </span>of a relative.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon reaching the balcony, the accused suddenly pulled her and brought her to
the bedroom.  She struggled but the
accused overpowered her and boxed her on the stomach.  There she was ravished until his lust was satisfied.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused then allowed her to leave but not before threatening her with
expulsion from school should she squeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Afraid, she went home and did not report the incident to anyone.  Two days later, not being able to control
herself, she recounted her ordeal to two friends in school, Melinda Maguddatu
and Lita Dumayas, who commiserated with her.  When Mr. Daquioag, a first cousin of her mother and an instructor in
school, saw her crying with her friends, he inquired what was wrong.  Unable to keep it bottled inside any longer
she<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">narrated her ordeal.  When her
parents saw her crying, she also told them what happened.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On 24 September 1981, she executed a sworn statement before
P/Cpl. Antero Tapiru.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> On
25 September 1981, she underwent a gynecological examination performed by Dr.
Lydia S. Depra-Ramos, Municipal Health Officer of Abulug, which yielded the
following findings:  "External
genitalia showed defloration with slight swelling of the mons pubis;
[I]ntroitus revealed a hymen with healed laceration, showing sharp coaptible
borders without congestion; admits easily one finger; [S]mear from vaginal
fornices examined and revealed no spermatozoa."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
On 29 September 1987, she signed and then filed her complaint for rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused testified that the complaining
witness admitted having stolen the T-shirt, and in the afternoon in question,
voluntarily offered her womanhood in exchange for the chance to graduate.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, despite the fact that he was fully aware of his position as principal of
the school in which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">complaining witness
was a student and at the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">s</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ame time the latter's teacher, he was unable
to resist the tempting offer she presented with her open dress and sweater.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, accused-appellant contends that the trial court
erred in accepting with precipitate credulity the testimony of the complainant
as the true version of what transpired between her and the accused that fateful
afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have said time and again that in rape cases it is not unusual
for conviction or acquittal to depend almost entirely on complainant's
testimony due to the extremely private nature of the offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, more often than not, the issue boils down to credibility.  The findings of the trial court on
credibility, by reason of its opportunity to observe the manner and deportment
of witnesses when they testify, are generally viewed as correct and entitled to
the highest respect, except where it appears that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">some facts of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">weight </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">substance </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">have been
overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied by the court.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the records shows that the trial court was not
remiss in this regard.  It did not
overlook, misunderstand nor misapply any fact of weight and substance.  On the contrary, we agree with its findings
that complainant's account was entirely credible as evident from the transcript
of stenographic notes.  As the trial
court clearly observed, her account was given in a clear and straightforward
manner.  Hence, the argument that there
are inconsistencies between the sworn statement of Soledad given before P/Cpl.
Tapiru and her testimony in open court deserves scant consideration since it is
not an uncommon phenomenon that affidavits are prepared by someone other than
the affiant himself, and thus they are usually incomplete due to suggestions,
or want of suggestions and inquiries necessary for the accurate recollection of
all relevant details.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> And
as a consequence of this expected inaccuracy, it has been consistently held
that in case of conflict between an affidavit and court testimony, the latter
prevails.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Certainly, this is not fatal to the
cause of the prosecution.  After all,
the supposed discrepancies merely refer to minor and trivial matters resulting
from the natural fickleness of memory which tend to strengthen rather than
weaken credibility as they erase any suspicion of a rehearsed testimony.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, we subscribe to the accepted and well-reasoned belief
that no young and decent Filipina would willingly undergo the expense, trouble
and inconvenience of a public trial, suffer the scandal, embarrassment and
humiliation that such an action entails, as well as allow an examination of her
private parts if her motive were not to bring to justice the person who had
abused her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if we give serious regard to the claim of the accused that
Soledad told him that "(he) can do what (he) like(s) to her" if only
to allow her to graduate,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
still he had to use force in making her submit to him.  The rebuttal testimony of Soledad is
revealing -</p>

<p class="BODY">This is rape through force; for, at that time, contrary to the
claim of the accused, Soledad did not offer her maidenhood to him, and the
latter had no reason to take it from her against her will.  He was the school principal and her teacher in
Bible History and other subjects.  He
had no business having sexual intercourse with his student even assuming she
had told him that he could do whatever he wanted with her in exchange for an
opportunity to graduate.  For one, she
did not mean by that statement to include sexual intercourse.  Thus, he had to use force.</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise flawed is the contention that it is not possible for
rape to be committed in a house located at the most thickly populated area in
the community where the neighbors could easily hear a woman scream, especially
at two o'clock in the afternoon.  For
rape can be committed even in places where people congregate -- in parks, along
the roadside, within school premises, and even inside a house where there are
other occupants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The neighbors need not hear the screams of the offended party for rape to be
consummated.  It can be committed even
at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">noontime,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> for lust is no respecter of time or place.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Aside from the fact that
the accused could not presume what his neighbors were doing at 2 o'clock in the
afternoon and conclude that they were wide awake in their houses, the
complaining witness testified that whenever she tried to scream the accused
covered her mouth and punched her in the stomach, effectively stiffling her
outcries.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The trial court found this credible; and
rightly so.  For it must be stressed
that the law does not impose a burden on the rape victim to prove resistance;
what needs only to be proved is the use of force or intimidation by the accused
in having sexual intercourse with the victim.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The accused then questions the sufficiency
of the prosecution evidence to prove force, and that aside from the absence of
physical violence on the person of complainant, the torn underwear presented to
establish violence was submitted to the police only four (4) days after the
alleged rape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The absence of marks of violence on complainant's body does not,
by itself, negate rape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a> This
is explained in the case of Soledad by the fact that she was examined five (5)
days subsequent to the dastardly act, or on 25 September 1987, only after she
had mustered enough courage to disclose her ordeal to her parents.  Understandably, by that time, what bruises
she might have sustained by reason of the force exerted by appellant may have
already disappeared.  Indeed, the
accused did not even have to exert much effort to cow Soledad into submission
considering his undeniable moral ascendancy<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> over
her, the fact that she was then being investigated by the accused regarding a
stolen T-shirt, and her determination to graduate from high school.  To our mind, these circumstances put
together undermined her innate resistance.</p>

<p class="BODY">For sure, a life behind bars for thirty years or so is a heavy
penalty considering that the accused is supposed to be a man of wisdom and virtue,
tasked to guide the young and the innocent; consequently, he is expected to
leave the confines of his prison walls already an old man.  But this is a just punishment for a school
administrator and mentor who, taking advantage of his otherwise lofty position,
ravaged a young girl entrusted to his care, and now destined to a lifetime of
bitterness over her coerced debauchment.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no reason to reverse the factual findings of the
court <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a quo</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>we accordingly affirm its conclusion
that the accused-appellant Rogelio Ramos y Cabayu is indeed guilty of having
