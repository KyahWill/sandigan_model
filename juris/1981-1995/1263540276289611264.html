				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Davao City, Branch VIII, 11th Judicial Region finding defendant-appellant Eduardo Alcaraz guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of MURDER and sentencing him as follows:<br><blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the guilt of the accused Eduardo Alcaraz of the crime of Murder under Art. 248 of the Revised Penal Code proven beyond reasonable doubt, he is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>RECLUSION PERPETUA</i>, to indemnify the heirs of Arturo Aquino in the sum of P12,000.00, with costs <i>de oficio</i>."</blockquote>The amended information charged the defendant-appellant and one Crispin Cantutay with the crime of murder as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about January 10, 1978, in the City of Davao, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused conspiring, confederating together and helping one another, with treachery and evident premeditation, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously and with intent to kill and armed with a kitchen knife, attacked, assaulted and stabbed one Arturo Aquino, thereby inflicting upon him the following injuries, to wit:<br><br><center>x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x</center><br>which injuries caused his death.<br><br>"That the commission of the foregoing offense was attended by the aggravating circumstances, to wit:<br><blockquote>"1.&nbsp; That the offender Crispin Cantutay has been previously punished for an offense to which the law attaches an equal or greater penalty or for two or more crimes to which it attaches a lighter penalty;<br><br>"2.&nbsp; That the crime was committed in consideration of a price, reward or promise;<br><br>"3.&nbsp; That the wrong done in the commission of the crime was deliberately augmented by causing other wrong not necessary for its commission."</blockquote></blockquote>The evidence for the prosecution is summarized in the People's brief as follows:<br><blockquote>"On January 10, 1978, Arturo Aquino was found dead inside his car parked at the Insular Village, Davao City.&nbsp; He sustained multiple wounds in different parts of his body (Exhibit "A").<br><br>"On January 22, 1978, a special police team was formed to track down the killers of Arturo Aquino (t.s.n., p. 42, Dec. 12, 1981).&nbsp; Sometime on January 24, 1978, on the basis of information previously given by an unidentified telephone caller that a certain Ben Delgado was responsible for Aquino's death, Crispin Cantutay alias Ben Delgado was lo­cated and was requested by the police to shed light on the killing (t.s.n., pp. 149-165, <i>ibid</i>).&nbsp; Crispin Cantutay subsequently executed an extra-judicial confession admitting authorship of the death of Arturo Aquino and implicated one Boy Luna as his co-conspirator (Exhibit "D").&nbsp; In view of the revelation made by Crispin Cantutay, Boy Luna was apprehended, after some effort, in Manila and brought to Davao City (t.s.n., pp. 208, 220-223, <i>ibid</i>).<br><br>"Boy Luna denied any participation in the killing of Arturo Aquino (t.s.n., p. 40, Apr. 14, 1982).&nbsp; A confrontation was subsequently arranged between Crispin Cantutay and Boy Luna, at which instance, the former retracted his statement implicating the latter but at the same time pointed to one 'Rolly de los Santos' as his companion in slaying Arturo Aquino (t.s.n., pp. 59-62, <i>ibid</i>).<br><br>"Since the police department had no file on a 'Rolly de los Santos', the files of other sections were looked into and from the files of the A.N.D.U. (Anti-Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs Unit), the police investigators were given a picture of one 'Rolly de los Santos' who had been previously arrested as a marijuana user (t.s.n., p. 29, Dec. 8, 1982, Morning Session).&nbsp; At about noontime of February 6, 1978, the police investigators apprehended 'Rolly de los Santos' whose real name turned out to be Eduardo Alcaraz.&nbsp; In the afternoon of February 6, 1978, Eduardo Alcaraz was brought to the City Fiscal's Office wherein he, upon confrontation with Crispin Cantutay, broke down and admitted his criminal participation in killing Arturo Aquino (t.s.n., pp. 31-32, <i>ibid</i>).&nbsp; Thus came about the respective extra-judicial confessions of Crispin Cantutay and Eduardo Alcaraz (Exhibits "E" and "F").<br><br>"On February 13, 1978, Crispin Cantutay and Eduardo Alcaraz conducted a re-enactment of the crime.&nbsp; A criminal case for murder was subsequently filed against the two.&nbsp; However, on March 6, 1979, Crispin Cantutay was shot to death.&nbsp; Hence, trial proceeded only against Eduardo Alcaraz which eventually led to his conviction."</blockquote><br>On February 13, 1981, Dr. Juan M. Abear, MD., FPAFP., DFM., examined the body of the deceased.&nbsp; The medico-legal report submitted by Dr. Abear shows the following:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="8%">"= </td><td width="92%">Rigor mortis all over the body except the toes. </td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"=</td><td><p>&nbsp; Wound incised, 7.0 c.m. long, edge clean cut, gaping medial extremities rounded and lateral Extremities sharp oriented horizontal, located in the anterior aspect of the left neck, penetrating the underlying tissue, muscle and severing the common carottid artery and veins of the left neck; 5.0 c.m. long oriented horizontally, edges clean cut, gaping, both extremities sharp located in the anterior aspect of the left wrist, penetrating the underlying tissue and blood vessels, 5.0 c.m. long oriented horizontally edge clean cut, both extremities sharp, gaping located in the lateral aspect of the left wrist penetrating the underlying tissue, muscle; 4.0 c.m. long, edges clean cut, both extremities sharp, gaping oriented horizontally located in the posterior aspect of the left wrist, penetrating the underlying tissues, 5.5 cm. long, edges clean cut, both extremities sharp, gaping located in the anterior aspect of the right wrist; 8.0 c.m. long edges clean cut, both extremities sharp, slightly gaping, pale in color, oriented horizontally located in the left breast at the level of 6th ICS directed backwards, downwards and medially penetrating the underlying tissue, muscle and abdominal cavity and penetrating the left lobe of the liver; 7.0 c.m. long oriented horizontally, edges clean cut and pale in color located in the umbilical region 4 c.m. above the navel, penetrating the underlying tissues.</p></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"= </td><td><p> Wound incised 4.0 c.m., edges clean cut, both extremities sharp, very pale in color, bloodless, located in the dorsum of left foot, medial aspect at the angle of the distal leg and foot.</p></td></tr><tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">"CAUSE OF DEATH: HEMORRHAGES SECONDARY TO MULTIPLE WOUNDS."</td></tr></tbody></table></blockquote>The defendant-appellant on the other hand claims that his extra-judicial confession is inadmissible as evidence against him as it was obtained through force and intimidation and was prepared without the assistance of counsel.&nbsp; The defense evidence is summarized in the defendant-appellant's memorandum as follows:<br><blockquote>"On January 10, 1978, police authorities found the dead body of Arturo Aquino with multiple wounds.&nbsp; A blood stained knife was found on the floor of his car.&nbsp; The family of the deceased offered a reward for the informant as to the killer.&nbsp; On January 22, 1978, a special police team was created to investigate the case.&nbsp; On January 24, 1978, the special police team apprehended Crispin Cantutay.&nbsp; Before the end of January, 1978, a certain Boy Luna was apprehended at Manila and brought to Davao City for investigation.&nbsp; On February 6, 1978 at about 11:00 in the morning, while trying to get a taxi for Major Besario, the herein appellant Eduardo Alcaraz was forcibly apprehended by members of the special police team at the gate of the P.C. Compound of Davao City.&nbsp; At the time of the arrest, the members of the special police team were armed and they did not have a warrant of arrest.&nbsp; At around 2:00 in the afternoon, Eduardo Alcaraz was brought to the Fiscal's Office where then Special Counsel Joel Hipe was conducting a preliminary investigation of Crispin Cantutay.&nbsp; Eduardo Alcaraz was not investigated.&nbsp; Special Counsel Joel Hipe instructed the special police team to bring the appellant and Crispin Cantutay to the Office of the Police Investigation Division where their alleged statements were taken (Exhibits "E" &amp; "F").&nbsp; On the basis of these extra-judicial statements hurriedly prepared on February 6, 1978 without the presence and benefit of counsel Eduardo Alcaraz and Crispin Cantutay were charged with the murder of Arturo Aquino.<br><br>"On February 13, 1978, while Eduardo Alcaraz was being detained by the special police team, he was made to participate in the re-enactment of the alleged crime with Crispin Cantutay and members of the special police team, the jail warden and police escorts from the city jail, as well as the brothers of the deceased.&nbsp; After the appellant and his co-accused were instructed as to what do do, they were brought to Insular Village and pictures were taken during the incident.&nbsp; From Insular Village, the appellant was brought back to the city jail where he was being detained without any warrant of arrest.&nbsp; The warrant of arrest for Eduardo Alcaraz was brought to the city jail only on February 18, 1978.<br><br>"On February 21, 1978, the appellant Eduardo Alcaraz was made to sign another statement without counsel.&nbsp; The arraignment of Eduardo Alcaraz and Crispin Cantutay was initially scheduled on February 22, 1978, and Atty. Roberto Sencio was the first counsel <i>de oficio</i> of both accused in 1978.&nbsp; Prior to their arraignment, he filed a motion for medical examination of both accused because when he saw them, they had several injuries on several parts of their bodies.&nbsp; At the arraignment, Judge Martinez ordered the City Health Officer to examine the accused Cantutay while in Court.&nbsp; It was found that Cantutay had wounds on his lips and his eyes were swollen with several bruises and contusions on his back and buttocks.&nbsp; Upon order of the Court, the herein appellant Eduardo Alcaraz was also examined by the doctor and at the time of the examination, his gums were swollen, he had a wound on the right eye and contusions on several parts of his body.&nbsp; On the basis of the medical certificates issued by the City Health Officer, Judge Martinez issued an order specifically stating that the confessions were obtained by force and were therefore 'worthless'.&nbsp; Crispin Cantutay was arraigned on February 27, 1978 and Eduardo Alcaraz was arraigned on March 3, 1978.&nbsp; Both accused pleaded not guilty.<br><br>"On January 19, 1979, the Puericulture Building housing Branches III and IV of the Court of First Instance was razed by fire, destroying the record of this case.&nbsp; On February 12, 1980, a petition for Reconstitution of destroyed judicial records was granted.&nbsp; Although the initial hearing of this instant case was set on January 14, 1981, actual trial started only on May 13, 1981.&nbsp; Trial was with respect to the herein appellant Eduardo Alcaraz only as Crispin died on March 6, 1979.<br><br>"During the trial of this case, Pat. Alberto Eramis and Pat. Pedrito Collado who were members of the special police team testified that they were told by Crispin Cantutay that his companion in killing Arturo Aquino was a certain Boy Luna.&nbsp; Patm. Eramis testified that he apprehended Boy Luna, that Boy Luna was his friend, and that Boy Luna was subsequently released.&nbsp; Later, Crispin Cantutay allegedly told him that his companion in killing Arturo Aquino was Rolly de los Santos who was detained at the CANU.&nbsp; According to the testimony of both Patm. Eramis and Patm. Collado, they did not go to the CANU office, but they instead went to the office of the Anti-Narcotics Division Unit (ANDU) which keeps separate and different records from that of CANU.&nbsp; According to the prosecution witnesses Patm. Eramis and Patm. Collado, the ANDU did not have a record of Rolly de los Santos.&nbsp; Both witnesses testified that they were looking for Rolly de los Santos on February 6, 1978 when they saw Eduardo Alcaraz and apprehended him at noon.&nbsp; To justify why they apprehended Eduardo Alcaraz, they claimed that an unidentified person at the ANDU gave them a picture of Eduardo Alcaraz and said that he is Rolly de los Santos (Tsn. 7-8-81, pp. 48-49; Tsn. 1-27-83, p. 81).&nbsp; During the cross-examination, Patm. Collado testified that they went to the ANDU instead of the CANU because the people at the ANDU were their 'companions'.&nbsp; The prosecution did not present Crispin Cantutay, nor the person at the ANDU who allegedly gave the police officers the picture of Eduardo Alcaraz and who told them that the appellant is Rolly de los Santos.<br><br>"During the trial, the herein appellant Eduardo Alcaraz, repudiated the sworn statement dated February 6, 1978 (Exhibit "F").&nbsp; He testified that he was forcibly taken by the members of the special police team without any warrant of arrest, that he was mauled and maltreated, that he was forced to admit that he was Rolly de los Santos and forced to sign the sworn statement, and that he did not have counsel at that time because he was told that he would be killed if he told anyone what they did to him.&nbsp; The defense proved during the trial that a certain Rolly de los Santos was apprehended by a group force of CANU and ANDU and detained by the CANU at the PC Barracks.&nbsp; Captain Lazarraga who also testified for the defense stated that Rolly de los Santos and Eduardo Alcaraz are two different persons."</blockquote>The defendant-appellant raises the following assignment of errors in his brief.<br><br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>IN FINDING THE EXTRA-JUDICIAL STATEMENT OF ACCUSED EDUARDO ALCARAZ (EXHIBIT "F") AS ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE AND AS A VOLUNTARY CONFESSION OF GUILT;<br><br><center>II</center><br>IN NOT BELIEVING THE TESTIMONY OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT AND CONCLUDING WITHOUT EVIDENCE THAT THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT KNEW CRISPIN CANTUTAY, ARTURO AQUINO, AND ROLLY DE LOS SANTOS, AND THAT 'CRISPIN CANTUTAY KNEW HIM TO BE EDUARDO ALCARAZ;<br><br><center>III</center><br>IN BASING ITS DECISION OF CONVICTION OF APPELLANT ON HEARSAY TESTIMONY OF THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION;<br><br><center>IV</center><br>IN CONVICTING APPELLANT WHO AT THE TIME OF THE ALLEGED OFFENSE WAS UNDER DETENTION AND CUSTODY OF THE CONSTABULARY ANTI-NARCOTIXS UNIT (CANU).</blockquote>The defendant-appellant assails his extra-judicial confession which he says is violative of Section 20, Article IV of the 1973 Philippine Constitution because it was obtained through force and intimidation.&nbsp; The People's brief argues that the extra-judicial confession is voluntary because it is filled with details only the accused could have known.&nbsp; The defendant-appellant testified:<br><blockquote><table  ="" width="100%" border="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" width="11%">"Q </td><td width="89%">When they arrested you, did they bring you any warrant of arrest?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A</td><td> No, Ma'am.</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"Q </td><td>How did they arrest you, can you narrate?</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">"A </td><td>When I was on the street, the two policemen, passed by, Patm.
