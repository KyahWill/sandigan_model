				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Who shot Jesus Dapilos in the middle of the night?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution said it was Ramon Abaya, and
the trial court agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Abaya
demurs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He says he was four hundred
kilometers away when the killing occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The incident happened on <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="10">October
 15, 1981</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening, in Taguig, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court found that at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9 o'clock</st1:time>
of that same evening, Jesus Dapilos and Ambrosio Dumaya, security guards at the
Pennel Commercial premises, went out of the compound on orders of their
supervisor, Reynaldo Tassara, to buy a mosquito coil at a store seventy yards
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the way back, they passed by a
group of men drinking liquor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of
them was a soldier, the herein accused-appellant, who invited Dapilos and
Dumaya to join them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dumaya accepted a
drink but Dapilos excused himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
the two walked away, they heard Abaya say, obviously to Dapilos, "May araw
ka rin." This was an angry threat.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two hours later, four shots were fired into the Pennel compound, the
first two at an interval of 20 minutes and the last two in quick
succession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third hit Dapilos in the
arm and lung, and he shouted out in pain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Dumaya, who had gone to sleep and was awakened by the shots, got up and
found Dapilos <span class="GramE">bleeding</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He immediately got a flashlight and focused
it outside in search of the culprit until he sighted Abaya about ten yards
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Abaya was furtively looking from
left to right as he walked away carrying an armalite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was still wearing his fatigue
uniform.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dumaya could clearly see
Abaya's face.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meantime, Tessara, who had attended to Dapilos and found that he
needed medical help, slipped out of the compound through the back <span class="GramE">way</span> for fear he might be attacked if he left by the front
gate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He rushed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">to </span>the police station.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Six policemen, including Dapilos's brother, accompanied him to the
Pennel compound, but by the time they arrived the victim was already dead.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Two empty armalite shells were found in front of the compound by
the police investigators.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The autopsy, on which the medical examiner later testified, revealed that
Dapilos died of cardio-respiratory arrest due to shock and hemorrhage secondary
to the gunshot wounds.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although the killing happened <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>1981, it was only about three-and-a-half months later that
Dumaya came forward to denounce Abaya <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as
</span>the killer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having been
transferred to the Pennel warehouse in San Marcelino, Manila, he finally
summoned the courage to make a formal statement on January 26, 1982,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and testify later on what happened in the evening of October 15, 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of this statement, an intensive investigation was
conducted by the National Bureau of Investigation, resulting in the filing of
murder charges against Abaya in the Regional Trial Court of Pasig on <st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="1">January 13, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the version of the prosecution, Abaya offered the defense
of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the killing, he
was assigned and billeted at Camp Bagong Diwa, but he claimed that he had been
given a vacation by his first sergeant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had then gone to Isabela, where he stayed from <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="10">October 13 to 18, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, there is no written evidence of such
leave of absence; and no less importantly, Abaya did not present the sergeant
who supposedly gave him the leave or any relative or friend to testify that he
did stay in Isabela on the said dates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What the record did disclose was that Abaya, having joined the armed
forces in 1974, was discharged in 1982 for absence without leave.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his brief, the accused-appellant argues that the purely
circumstantial evidence submitted against him was not sufficient to establish
his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
maintains that the prosecution did not present the other security guards and
the supposed drinking companions of Abaya to corroborate the testimony of
Dumaya and Tessara.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is even suggested
that Dapilos must have been shot by one of his own colleagues in the security
force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense also contends that
the testimony of the prosecution witnesses suffered from many inconsistencies,
let alone the fact that it was inherently unbelievable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is up to the parties to determine for themselves whether it is
necessary to present corroborative evidence or to rely alone on its principal
evidence if they believe this to be sufficient.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
If the defense felt that the persons not called by the prosecution would
contradict or at least not support Dumaya and Tessara, there was nothing to
prevent it from calling them as its own witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that it did not would reflect on its
own negligence unless the accused-appellant was apprehensive that their
testimony would not advance his cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the claimed inconsistencies, we have repeatedly said that
minor lapses in the testimony of the witness do not necessarily brand him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>liar as long as such testimony is on
the whole consistent and believable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The point is also made that Abaya hardly knew the victim and that
there was no motive whatsoever to link him to the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even assuming Abaya had offered a drink that
was declined by <span class="GramE">Dapilos,</span> such rejection could not have
generated the provocation that ultimately led to the murder of Dapilos.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, motive is not necessary if a positive
identification has been made of the culprit, as in this case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
While it is true that Dumaya did not actually <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">see </span>the shooting of Dapilos by Abaya, Dumaya categorically
declared that he saw Abaya minutes after the shooting walking away from the
Pennel compound with an armalite in his hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, the muttered threat, "May araw ka
rin" suggests that the incident of the declined drink was not as light as
that but indeed must have filled the accused-appellant with an unreasoning
resentment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A refusal of an invitation
to drink causes different reactions in different persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To some it is a matter lightly dismissed and
instantly forgotten; to others it is a serious affront calling for angry
reprisal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To Abaya, evidently, it was an
affair of honor that had to be settled through the muzzle of a gun.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also asks why, if the killing occurred in 1981, it
took Dumaya more than three months to make his accusation and the NBI almost
three years before it could conclude its reports.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Dumaya, as he himself
confessed, the reason was fear of Abaya, who had already shot Dapilos and might
do the same to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only after he
had been assigned to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, away
from the slums where Abaya was living, that Dumaya finally decided to make his
statement against the accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As for the delay in the investigation of the case, the reason was Abaya
himself, who disappeared soon after the killing and could not be questioned by
the NBI agents.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The other arguments raised by the defense are, in the view of the
Court, too insubstantial to deserve comment and cannot weaken the finding that
the evidence is conclusive enough of the guilt of the accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the mere fact that Judge Alfredo C.
Flores did not preside at the trial of this case in its entirety, having taken
over only when the last defense witness was to be presented, did not detract from
the validity, much less the correctness, of his decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The full record was available to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is evident from the knowledgeable and
analytical decision he has written that he thoroughly examined the testimonial
and documentary evidence before him and carefully assessed the credibility of
the witnesses with the seasoned perceptiveness he has developed as a trial
judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with his decision finding the accused-appellant guilty
of murder, with the qualifying circumstance of treachery, and sentencing him to
<u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, there being no generic aggravating or
mitigating circumstances, plus payment of civil indemnity of P30,000.00 to the
victim's heirs, and the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court repeats its warning that weapons and wine do not mix
well and become a dangerous combination that has often enough resulted in
mindless injuries and, worse, useless loss of lives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This admonition is especially addressed to
the officers of the law, the soldiers and policemen who are licensed to carry
firearms to protect and not to prey upon the people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are seriously advised that when they
take liquor while they are carrying arms, they might be deprived of that proper
control they should always exercise in the use of their weapons, which may then
become irresponsible instruments of destruction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is what obviously happened to the
accused-appellant in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>,
with costs against the accused-appellant.</p>
