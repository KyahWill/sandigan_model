<p class="BODY">The private respondents, as plaintiffs in the Court of First
Instance of Laguna, alleged in their complaint:</p>

<blockquote><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"That they are the
children and legal heirs of the deceased spouses Gabriel Alora and Tarcila
Alzona of Biñan, Laguna, who during their lifetime purchased from one Melecio
Legasto the disputed 1/3 portion of Lot 581 consisting of 205.66 sq. meters,
evidenced </span>by </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">an ancient
document dated April 28, 1930 (Exh. A); that this Melecio Legasto, bought the
same 1/3 portion of said Lot 581, from the original owner, Roberto Almoro,
predecessor-in-interest of herein defendants, </span>except </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Pedro de la Cruz, on June 10, 1917, evidenced
by public instrument (Exh. B); that immediately after the sale to their father
Gabriel Alora in 1930, the latter, declared the said disputed 1/3 portion of
Lot 581 in his own name, under Tax Declaration No. 9386 (Exh. C), which said
Gabriel Alora executed on July 11, 1931, and paid its corresponding </span>land
</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">taxes, as shown by Exhibit E; </span>that
</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Gabriel Alora likewise fenced
the disputed land in question; built a small resthouse; they also helped
Gabriel Alora plant vegetables and other plants over the questioned premises;
that </span>it </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">was </span>only </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in 1961 when they came to know that the
entire Lot 581, which included the disputed 1/3 portion therein was donated by
Roberto Almoro in favor of his protegees and adopted daughters, Roberto Almoro
and his wife being childless, sometime in January, 1948, and on August 5, 1948
also donated the disputed 1/3 part thereon in favor of the defendant Pedro de
la Cruz; that despite demands </span>to</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> reconvey the questioned premises herein defendants, except Pedro de la
Cruz, still refuses to do so hence the present recovery suit." (pp.
1-2.  CA Decision on pp. 30-31, Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Pedro de la Cruz executed on May 31, 1961 a "Salaysay"
renouncing all his rights over any portion of Lot 581.  The defendants subsequently had the entire
property subdivided, then caused the registration of the subdivided lots in
their respective names and the issuance of Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.
T­-21306, T-21307, T-21308 and T-21309 of the Laguna Registry of Deeds on
September 20, 1961.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer, the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs'
cause of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">action </span>had already
prescribed, and that the deeds of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">sale
(Exhibits A and </span>B) as well as the certifications issued by the Acting
Register of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Deeds (Exhibits L, M </span>and
N) attesting that said deeds are copies of the originals long filed in his
office, are fake and falsified.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the lower court rendered the assailed judgment on
August 5, 1975.  The defendants appealed
to the Court of Appeals which affirmed the trial court's decision <u>in</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">toto</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">.  </span>It held that
prescription had not set in because the plaintiffs discovered in 1968 that the
defendants (herein petitioners) had registered the entire Lot 581 in 1961, and
they filed their complaint for reconveyance in 1968 also.  Therefore, the ten-year prescriptive period
had not yet elapsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It upheld the authenticity and due execution of the deed of sale
for these were ancient and genuine documents written on paper which had turned
yellow with age but remained unblemished by alterations or circumstances of
suspicion.  The documentary stamps
appended thereto were those of that era, still bearing the name
"Philippine Islands." Moreover, the plaintiffs had tax
declarations:  (1) Tax Declaration No.
9386 dated July 11, 1931 (Exh. C), together with Tax Receipt (Exh. D); and (2)
Tax Declaration No. 1776 (Exhibit E-1) for 1948, also in Gabriel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Alora's name.  </span>These tax declarations cancelled in part Roberto Almoro's
Tax Declaration No. 6824 for Lot 581.  Moreover, they have been in peaceful, open, and continuous possession of
the one-third portion.  The petitioners'
attempt to assail these findings of the CA must fail for they are factual.  It is a cardinal rule that in petitions for
review under Rule 45 only legal issues may be raised.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' reliance on the registration of the entire Lot 581
in 1961 to secure their ownership over the disputed portion is misplaced.  The deed of donation (Exh. F) which Almoro
made in favor of the petitioners, was void with respect to the one-third
portion which he had already sold.  The
petitioners acquired only the portion, which still belonged to their
donor-benefactor.  The portion which he
no longer owned but conveyed to the petitioners was impressed with a trust in
favor of the true owners, the private respondents (Amerol, et al. vs.
Bagumbaran, 154 SCRA 396).</p>

<p class="BODY">While land registration is a proceeding <u>in</u> <u>rem</u> and
binds the whole world (Moscozo vs. CA, 128 SCRA 70), the simple possession of a
certificate of title under the Torrens system does not necessarily make the
holder a true owner of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">all</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>the property described therein.  If a person obtains a title under the
Torrens system, which includes by mistake or oversight land which can no longer
be registered under the system, he does not, by virtue of said certificate
alone, become the owner of the lands illegally included (Coronel vs. IAC, 155
SCRA 270, citing Ledesma vs. Municipality of Iloilo, 49 Phil. 769, 773;
Caragay-Layno vs. CA, 133 SCRA 718).</p>

<blockquote><i>"Registration does not vest title</i>.  <i>It is not a mode of acquiring property</i>.  <i>It does not give the holder any better
right than what he actually has, especially if the registration was done in bad
faith</i>.  <i>The effect is that it is
as if no registration was made at all.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"x x x Settled is the rule that a donor cannot lawfully
convey what is not his property." (De Guzman vs. CA, 156 SCRA 701.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, finding no reversible error in the decision of
the Court of Appeals, the petition for review is denied with costs against the
petitioners.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
