<p class="BODY">On 10 November 1988, the MTC issued an order declaring that the

knowledge of one Maria Pura, a deaf-mute, retarded and an embecile (sic)

<p class="BODY">Accused entered a plea of not guilty upon arraignment<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and trial proceeded thereafter on various dates with the prosecution presenting
Dr. Artemio G. Capellan, Noel Abela and Elena Alim as its witnesses for its
evidence in chief, and Elvira Collantes as its witness on rebuttal.  The accused took the witness stand in his
own defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 December 1989, the trial court promulgated its decision<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
convicting the accused of the crime of rape, the dispositive portion of which
was quoted earlier.  According to the
court, rape was committed because Maria Pura, being deaf-mute and mentally retarded,
cannot give consent; it was determined that moral compulsion, amounting to
intimidation, was employed by the accused.  Said the court:</p>

<blockquote>"The victim being mentally retarded could not be asked
questions as what (sic) happened to her although she sometimes understands
(sic) some questions.  The circumstances
appearing as seen by Noel Abele shows (sic) that sexual intercourse was
committed on the person of Maria Pura a mentally retarded, deaf-mute.  Maria Pura being mentally retarded could not
actually give consent in order that she could have sexual intercourse with the
accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court could not even say as testified that force was employed
upon the victim but the appearance of the woman alone and her physical
condition could not stop any physical force.  However, for the reason that the accused has been known to the woman who
(sic) even slept, though outside of their house in an attachment, moral
compulsion which is tantamount to intimidation was employed by the accused when
the sexual intercourse happened.  It is
a sorry state that the victim could not testify.  The Court however, is convinced that rape was committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused when confronted by the family of the victim denied
having sexual intercourse with Maria Pura.  However Maria Pura, although a deaf-mute when asked by Collantes and by
Noel Abela, and by the sister Elena Alim pointed to the accused to have
committed, (sic) such a dastardly act.  She pointed to the accused when asked as to what happened.  There is no reason for Maria Pura to tell a
lie.  Being (sic) of unsound mind and
laughing (sic) at the time when she was investigated, only shows (sic) that
there was sexual intercourse through moral compulsion which the court believes
is intimidation.  That she should <span style="">give </span>consent, such question when
subjected to all doubts and understanding (sic) would show that this woman who <span style="">is </span>mentally retarded and a deaf-mute
could never give consent to any sexual intercourse committed on her by the
accused.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT OF THE CRIME CHARGED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In support of the alleged error, he
contends that reasonable doubt exists in this case because:  (a) the scene of the crime is well populated
and inhabited; since it was daytime and there were many people outside the
house when the incident occurred, it is possible that another man or a neighbor
of the Puras, and not the accused, assaulted Maria Pura; (b) he is on parole
and knew that if he violated the terms and conditions thereof, he would be
rearrested to serve the unexpired portion of his sentence; it was, therefore,
unlikely that he would commit another crime; (c) there is no reliable
eyewitness to the crime; and (d) he manifested his honesty by not denying that
he slapped Noel Abela after the latter<span style="">
made fun of him (the accused) when he came out of the toilet.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the morning of September 14, 1988, Elvira Collantes, left
her forty-year old sister Maria Pura in their house located at Magallanes St.,
Masbate, Masbate to go to the market.  Maria was cross-eyed, mute, retarded and a polio victim, standing less
than four feet who could only nod her head and make signs to be able to
communicate.  She can crawl but cannot
stand unsupported.  (TSN, October 23,
1989, p. 4; TSN, April 26, 1989, p. 3; TSN, June 22, 1989, p. 9; TSN, October
10, 1989, pp. 3-4, 6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Maria was left alone in the house with Maximo Race, Jr. also known as
Jun, who during that time had asked Elvira for permission to use the toilet
built outside the house.  Since Race had
been using the toilet in the past with their permission, she agreed.  She knew Race because he often sleeps
outside the extension of the Pura house, particularly in the Pura store which
is attached to the house (TSN, October 23, 1989, pp. 3, 5; TSN, June 22, 1989,
pp. 3, 8).</blockquote>

<blockquote>At around 10 a.m. of the same day, Noel Abila, son of Elena Alim
both of whom lived in the Pura residence together with Maria, had just come
home from school when he heard a voice.  He immediately ran to the kitchen where the voice came from and saw Race
putting his pants on (TSN, June 22, 1989, p. 4; TSN, October 20, 1989, p. 3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Noel then saw his Aunt Maria in the dining room.  She was laughing at Race.  Noel let Maria sit on a chair.  When Noel asked his Aunt Maria what Race did
to her she moved her body forward and backward in a push-pull movement.  Noel thereupon accused Race of raping Maria
and threatened to report the incident.  Race slapped Noel and went out of the house to the place where he drinks
liquor (TSN, June 22, 1989, pp. 5,6; TSN, October 23, 1989, p. 4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Noel afterwards informed his uncle Glen Collantes, husband of
Elvira Collantes of the incident.  Glen
brought Race to Maria Pura, who pointed at Race.  When Glen asked Maria what Race did to her <span style="">she again made </span>the push-pull
movement.  Maria was laughing (TSN, June
22, 1989, pp. 7, 8, 10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Elena Collantes, who was working at D'SAN Restaurant, went home upon
learning of the incident.  Elena,
together with their mother 'Azon', later went to the Municipal Hall to lodge a
complaint (TSN, October 10, 1989, pp. 4-8).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>After the complaint <span style="">was<i> </i></span>filed,
Maria was examined by Dr. Artemio Capellan, the Municipal health officer, in
their house, the following day (TSN, October 10, 1989, p. 8; TSN, April 26,
1989, pp. 3, 5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The results of the examination were stated in a medical certificate
issued by Dr. Capellan (Exh. "A").  To wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">'For External
examination:</p>

<p class="2Q">Fairly developed and fairly nourished, mentally retarded, mute,

<p class="2Q">Contusion, abrasion nor (sic) hematoma were not found in the body

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 0.1in; text-indent: 0.5in;">Conclusion:</p>

<p class="3Q">1.  No extra genital
injuries were noted on the person of Maria Pura.</p>

examination:</p>

<p class="3Q">a) Presence of human semen and dead sperm were (sic) noted.? </p>

<blockquote>Maria had sexual contact because the speculum can be inserted into
her without difficulty.  She had an old
healed hymeneal laceration caused a day before.  Some of the sperm found in her vagina were living at the time
they were examined (TSN, April 26, 1989, p. 4)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused denies the commission of the
crime.  He summarizes his story in his
Brief as<i> </i>follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x x x </span>In the
morning of September 14, 1988, he asked Elvira Pura-Collantes’ permission to
use their toilet.  Elvira is a younger
sister <span style="">of Maria.  </span>Said toilet is <span style="">outside the Puras’ house.  He did <u>not</u> </span>go to their kitchen
nor borrowed (sic) cellophane from Noel Abela.  When he came out of the toilet Noel shouted at him and teased him.  He got angry and slapped Noel and threw one
of his slippers, to (sic) the latter.  Noel ran away crying and called for his mother who <span style="">is </span>working in a restaurant.  Noel's mother arrived home and scolded him
(accused).  It is <u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> </span>true that he raped Maria Pura.  The Puras are just angry with him because he slapped Noel.  The nearest house to the Puras is only a
meter away.  And there were many people
around when he slapped Noel (TSN, pp. 2-7, October 20, 1989)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no difficulty in agreeing with the trial court's
conclusion that the accused had sexual intercourse with Maria Pura on the date
as charged.  Although there was no
eyewitness to the act, the confluence of the facts and circumstances unerringly
establishes the commission of the act.  The Solicitor General correctly enumerates these facts and
circumstances:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(1)<span style="font: 7pt " times="" new="" roman";"="">&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span><!--[endif]-->Upon examining Maria the following day, Dr. Capellan, the
Municipal Health Officer, noticed the presence of "human semen and dead
sperm", thus indicating that she had sexual intercourse within the past
twenty-four (24) hours.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There can be no doubt that if the carnal knowledge was
accomplished under any of the circumstances enumerated in Article 335 of the
Revised Penal Code, the foregoing circumstantial evidence would have been
sufficient to support a conviction for such a crime pursuant to Section 4, Rule
133 of the Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 4.   <i><span style="">Circumstantial evidence, when sufficient. -- </span></i>Circumstantial

</span><!--[endif]-->The combination of all the circumstances is such as to produce
a conviction beyond reasonable doubt."</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing disquisitions render utterly ineffectual and reduce
to naught accused's assigned error and the arguments in support thereof.  But did the act of the appellant constitute
the crime of rape as defined under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code?  To arrive at the answer, the following
crucial issues must be resolved:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether the information properly charges the
accused with the commission of rape; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>assuming that it does, whether the evidence

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The proper complaint and information for rape must clearly
describe the specific circumstances which would make the carnal knowledge of a
woman qualify as such under Article 335.  Otherwise stated, the same must concretely describe the crime of rape in
any of the specified forms to duly inform the accused of the nature of the
accusation;<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">The accusatory portion of the information in this case reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about September 4, 1988, in the morning thereof,
at barangay Magallanes, Municipality of Masbate, Province of Masbate,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniosly
(sic) have carnal knowledge of one Maria Pura, a deaf-mute, retarded and an
embecile (sic) against the latter's will and consent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As can be readily seen, it does not specifically describe any of
the circumstances under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code.  It is evident that the information was
hurriedly and poorly crafted for aside from the deficiency abovementioned, the
2nd Assistant Provincial Prosecutor even wrongly spelled the words <u>feloniously</u>
and <u>imbecile</u>.  This
notwithstanding, the allegation therein that the accused had sexual intercourse
with a woman who is retarded and an imbecile implies that the victim was not in
full possession and control of her moral reasoning faculty; this is sufficient
enough to have alerted the accused that the charge against him is for rape
under the circumstance that the woman is deprived of reason.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">And now on the second issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be recalled that the trial court convicted the accused
based on two circumstances:  (a) the use
of intimidation and (b) the inability of the offended party to give consent
because she is "a deaf-mute, retarded and an embecile (sic)".</p>

<p class="BODY">The first is definitely without basis as no evidence was adduced
to prove it.  The trial court merely
inferred this from what it describes as "moral compulsion" which it
ascribes to the fact that "the accused has been known to the woman who
(sic) even slept, although outside their house in an attachment." These
are inferences running riot which elementary logic and common sense reject.</p>

<p class="BODY">What has to be determined then is whether the offended party,
Maria Pura, before, during and even after the sexual intercourse on 14
September 1988, suffers from mental retardation or imbecility which deprived
her of reason at the time the appellant had carnal knowledge of her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without an admission by the accused, this Court's task of
resolving this issue would have been difficult as it would be entirely
dependent on:  (a) the conclusion of the
trial court that Maria Pura is "a deaf mute, retarded and an embecile
(sic)"; this conclusion is principally anchored on exactly the same
allegation in the information; (b) the finding by Dr. Capellan, entered in his
physical and medical examination report, that she is mentally retarded; (c) the
testimony of Noel Abela that when the victim was asked what the accused did to
her, she demonstrated a push-pull movement and was laughing while looking at
the accused; and (d) the court's view of the woman when she <span style="">was brought to the court.  On that occasion the following transpired:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No expert witness was presented to testify on Maria Pura's
imbecility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fortunately for the Prosecution, the appellant readily admitted that
Maria Pura is mentally deficient:</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in his Brief, he states:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case at bar, the evidence for the prosecution was not
scrutinized with extreme caution.  To
stress, there is no reliable eyewitness to the crime charged.  <u>The</u> <u>alleged</u> <u>rape</u> <u>victim</u>
<u>is</u><span style=""> </span><u>physically</u> <u>and</u>
<u>mentally</u> <u>deficient</u> <u>being</u> <u>a</u> <u>deaf-mute,</u> <u>retarded</u>

<p class="BODY">Maria Pura was then incapable of giving rational consent to the
sexual act.  In effect, she <span style="">is </span>deprived of reason.  In <i><span style="">People
vs. Manlapaz</span></i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>which involves a 13-year old girl
with the mentality of a 5-year old child, this Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"Sexual intercourse with a woman who is deprived of reason or
with a girl who is below twelve years of age is rape because she is incapable
of <span style="">giving<i> </i></span>rational
consent to the carnal intercourse.  ‘Las
mujeres privadas de razon, enajenadas, idiotas, imbeciles, son incapaces por su
estado mental de apreciar la ofensa que el culpable infiere a su honestidad y,
por tanto, incapaces de consentir.  <i><span style="">Pero no es condicion precisa que la carencia
de razon sea completa, basta la abnormalidad o deficiencia mental que solo la
disminuye, sim embargo, la jurisprudence es discordante? (II Cuello Calon,
Derecho Penal, 14th Ed., 1975, pp. 538-9).<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>?<i>Comete violacion el que yace con mujer que no tiene
normalmente desarrolladas sus facultades mentales (19 nov. 1930); aqui esta
comprendido el yacimiento con debiles o retrasados mentales</i> <span style="">(11 mayo 1932, 25 feb. 1948, 27 sept. 1951);
constituye este delito el coito con una niña de 15 </span><span style="">años </span><span style="">enferma de epilepsia genuina que carece de capacidad para conocer el
valor de sus actos (2 marzo 1953); el yacimiento con </span><i>oligofrenicas</i>
<span style="">(mentally deficient persons) (28 abril,
24 octubre, 1956, 19 feb. 1958); </span><span style="">x
x x? </span><span style="">(Ibid, note 3).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The same rule prevails in American jurisprudence.  ‘There can be no question but that a
copulation with a woman known to be mentally incapable of giving even an
imperfect consent is rape' (State vs. Jewett, 192 At. 7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>'An accused is guilty of the crime of rape when it is established
that he had sexual intercourse with a female who was mentally incapable of
validly consenting to or opposing the carnal act? (65 Am Jur 2nd 766
citing State vs. Prokosch, 152 Minn. 86, 187 NW 971; Cokeley vs. State, 87 Tex.
Crim. 256, 220 SW 1099; 31 ALR 3rd 1227, sec. 3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>`In this species of rape neither force upon the part of the man nor
resistance upon the part of the woman forms an element of the crime.  If, by reason of any mental weakness, she is
incapable of legally consenting, resistance is not expected any more than it is
in the case of one who has been drugged to unconsciousness, or robbed of
judgment by intoxicants.  Nor will an
apparent consent in such a case avail any more than in the case of a child who
may actually consent, but who by law is conclusively held incapable of legal
consent.  Whether the woman possessed
mental capacity sufficient to give legal consent must, saving in exceptional
cases, remain a question of fact x x x.  It need but be said that legal consent presupposes an intelligence
capable of understanding the act, its nature, and possible consequences.  This degree of intelligence may exist with
an impaired and weakened intellect, or it may not? (People vs. Boggs, 290
Pac. 618 citing People vs. Griffin, 49 Pac. 711 and People vs. Peery, 146 Pac.
44)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This rule has been reiterated by this Court in the following
decisions which upheld convictions for the crime of rape:  <i><span style="">People
vs. Gallano,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where the 31-year old victim had the
mental level of a 7-year old child; <i><span style="">People
vs. Asturias,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where the 17-year old victim had the
mental level lower even than that of a 7-year old child; <i>People vs. Sunga,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
where the 23-year old victim, had the mentality of an 8 to 9-year old child;
and <i>People vs. Palma</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
where the victim was a 14-year old retardate with an intellectual capacity
described as "borderline mental deficiency".</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <i>Asturias </i>case, this Court in effect held that if
the mental level of a woman above twelve (12) years old is that of a child
below twelve (12) years old, even if she voluntarily submitted to the bestial
desires of the accused, or even if the circumstances of force or intimidation,
or of the victim being deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious are absent,
the accused would still be liable for rape under the third paragraph of Article
335.  The reason for this is that if
intercourse with a victim under twelve (12) years old is rape, then it should
follow that carnal knowledge of a woman whose mental age is that of a child
below twelve (12) years of age would also constitute rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">Affirmance of the decision appealed from is thus inevitable.  The accused cannot be permitted to escape
from the wrath of the law.  Having
succumbed to his bestial instinct and desire to <span style="">satisfy his animal greed by preying on a defenseless imbecile who ought
to be the object of sympathy, he has become a two-legged beast which civilized
society must hold in prison in order that he may answer for </span><span style="">his </span><span style="">evil deed.  However, there </span>is
<span style="">a need to modify both the amount of
indemnity awarded to the offended party </span>and the credit of four-fifths
(4/5) of the accused's preventive imprisonment.  Also, the appreciation of the aggravating circumstance of <i><span style="">reiteracion </span></i>should be set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pursuant to</span> <i><span style="">People vs. Arenas,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> which involves the rape of a mentally
retarded woman, the indemnity to be paid should be increased to
P40,000.00.  The four-fifths (4/5)
credit, on the other hand, is improper.  Accused is entitled to be credited with the full time of his preventive
imprisonment under the first paragraph of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code
and not under paragraph two, which prescribes the four-fifths (4/5) credit,
since there is no evidence that he did not agree to abide by the same
disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted prisoners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court likewise
erred in appreciating the aggravating circumstance of</span> <i><span style="">reiteracion</span></i><span style="">.  </span><span style="">This circumstance is not alleged in the
information.  The prosecution did not
prove it.  Upon cross-examination of the
accused by the Prosecutor, over the objection of the defense counsel, the only
information elicited is that the accused had earlier been convicted for the
crime of homicide, had served the sentence and had later been released</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact of his being out on parole <span style="">was </span>brought out upon questioning by the court after the
termination of the cross-­examination.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> It
would thus be unfair to appreciate <i><span style="">reiteracion
</span></i>against the accused.  Besides, for the same to exist, it is <span style="">necessary that "the offender has been previously punished for an </span>offense
to which the law attaches an equal or greater penalty or for two or more crimes
to which it attaches a lighter penalty."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>

punishable by <i>reclusion temporal.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a> That
