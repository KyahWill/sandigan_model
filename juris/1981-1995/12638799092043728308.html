the time when the amended information was admitted by respondent court on May

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General submits that there was no inordinate delay because
from the time that Antonio <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> filed his
Complaint Affidavit on June 29, 1983<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
numerous incidents presented themselves for resolution during the preliminary
investigation; that the delay was not caused by inaction on the part of the
investigating officials but, instead, the intervening period was consumed by
the investigations and reinvestigations conducted; and that the preliminary
investigation conducted in the consolidated cases did not become ripe for
resolution until October 27, 1987 when the affidavit of Roberto <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> was submitted on behalf of Gonzales to the
Investigation and Prosecution Office of the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Tatad</u></span> case relied upon by
petitioner Gonzales, we there held that a delay of three (3) years <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">in </span>the termination of the preliminary
investigation by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> constitutes a
violation not only of the constitutional right of the accused under the broad
umbrella of the due process clause but also under the constitutional guarantee
of speedy disposition of cases as embodied in Section 16 of the Bill of Rights
(both under the 1973 and 1987 Constitutions).</p>

<p class="BODY">In so ruling, we took into consideration the peculiar
circumstances attendant to that particular case, namely, that political
motivations played a vital role in activating and propelling the prosecutorial
process; that there was a blatant departure from established procedures
prescribed by law for preliminary investigation; and that the long delay in
resolving the case under preliminary investigation cannot be justified on the
basis of the facts on record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
apparent, from a perusal of the records, that such considerations do not obtain
in the case at bar, hence, the doctrine enunciated in <span class="SpellE"><u>Tatad</u></span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>clearly inapplicable hereto.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">While there may seem to
have been a delay in the termination of the preliminary investigation involved
in the case at bar, the same cannot be imputed solely to the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its questioned resolution, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> recounted the incidents which contributed
largely to the delay and which are attributable to petitioner Gonzales and his
counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to recover the <span class="SpellE">Lambaklad</span> from <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>

counsel of accused-<span class="SpellE">movant</span>, informing him
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">zerox</span>

September 8, 1987, Hon. <span class="SpellE">Templonuevo</span> reset the hearing
of the cases to September 30, 1987, due notice of which was given to
complainant; respondent, through his counsel; and the concerned officials of
the BFAR as shown by their respective signatures appearing in a subpoena, a

letter dated September 30, 1987, prayed for the resetting of the <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> examination scheduled that day on account of
a letter he received from Mr. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> and the
hearing was reset to October 15, 1987, with the conformity of complainant <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> and due notice to the concerned officials of the
BFAR (<span class="SpellE">zerox</span> copy of the handwritten letter of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Daguna</span> is herewith attached as Annex <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">'J' </span>and <span class="SpellE">zerox</span>

Roberto <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>, which tended to favor greatly the
exoneration of accused­-<span class="SpellE">movant</span> Gonzales, Hon. Juan <span class="SpellE">Templonuevo</span> on January 4, 1988, submitted his consolidated
Resolution for dismissal to Honorable Raul M. Gonzales who approved it on
January 28, 1988.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“k) Complainant <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> filed on February 8, 1988, a Motion for
Reconsidera­tion and Manifestation, attacking the correctness of the

Equally applicable is the balancing test used to determine whether a defendant
has been denied his right to a speedy trial, or a speedy disposition of a case
for that matter, in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant
are weighed, and such factors as length of the delay, reason for the delay, the
defendant's assertion or non-assertion of his right, and prejudice to the
defendant resulting from the delay, are considered.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In the present case, it will be noted that it was only on<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>August 22, 1988 when the complaint
including Roberto <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span> as an accused, together
with herein petitioner, was filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
original information charging petitioner and <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
with a violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, was
filed on May 5, 1989.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the filing
of said information, petitioner filed several motions<a style="mso-footnote-id:

before the Office of the Ombudsman and the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
seeking reconsideration and re-evaluation of the case and praying for the
suspension of the proceedings in Criminal Case. No. 13563 during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the resolution of these motions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
ordered the conduct of a preliminary investigation against <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
and, subsequently, the amended information was filed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, therefore, apparent and <span class="SpellE">irremissible</span> that the delay is equally chargeable to
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, he cannot now seek
the protection of the law to cover up for his own actuations or benefit from
what he now considers the adverse effects of his own conduct in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the postulation of petitioner that the information in
the present case was filed only after the filing of a second motion for
reconsideration, supposedly contrary to Rule 13(c) of Administrative Order No.
3 issued by the <span class="SpellE">Tanodbayan</span> on December 1, 1979, is
devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged second
motion for reconsideration referred to by herein petitioner involves the
resolution of dismissal of the three consolidated cases (TBP Case Nos.
83-01547, 84-00787 and 84-02338) issued by Special Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Templonuevo</span>, the first being the motion to reconsider the
resolution of Special Prosecutor Mendoza ordering the dismissal of TBP Case No.
83-01547.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold, however, that while
there were two motions for reconsideration filed, it is erroneous to consider
the later motion as a second motion for reconsideration by reason of the fact
that the two motions for reconsideration were filed against two different
resolutions issued after the conduct of two different preliminary
investigations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In effect, therefore, the first motion for reconsideration was
filed by virtue of a preliminary investigation conducted by Prosecutor Mendoza
whereas the subsequent motion for reconsideration was filed as a result of the
preliminary investigation conducted by Prosecutor <span class="SpellE">Templonuevo</span>
which is different and distinct from that conducted by Prosecutor Mendoza.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The concept of a second motion for
reconsideration is one which seeks a further reconsideration of an order or
resolution which denied the first motion for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such is not the case here as above
explained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, there was no
violation of the administrative order adverted to by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, on the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
