<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">that respondent submitted the aforesaid
certificates to enable him to collect his salary; and that at the time the
docket of his court was audited from July 5, 1972 to August 4, 1972, the said
cases had not yet been decided (pp. 1-4, Adm. Case No. 269-J, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent, in his answer
filed on January 12, 1973, admitted the termination of the hearing and
submission for decision for more than 90 days of </span>the aforesaid
twenty-three (23) cases at the time he prepared and submitted the questioned
certificates of service, but denied however that he knew or should have known
that the contents thereof were false since he did not know and neither was his
attention called to those cases pending decision for more than 90 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that in preparing the
certificates, he relied on the corresponding monthly reports prepared and
submitted by the clerk of court which reflect, among others, the number of
cases and their status pending at the end of the month and the reports covering
the aforesaid certificates of service showed no cases pending decision for more
than ninety days; that he relied on the monthly reports of the clerk of court
because of the legal presumption that a public <span style="">officer </span>has performed faithfully his duties and that he was not
aware of any previous occasion wherein any such report did not truly reflect
the status of all cases pending in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>; that the
clerk of court, whose duty is to prepare such report, is in the best position
to know not only the number of cases pending but also their status; that while
it is admitted that the twenty-three (23) cases referred to in the complaint
were not yet decided when the docket of his court was audited from July 5, 1972
to August 4, 1972, nevertheless, all the aforesaid cases were already decided
as of October, 1972; that at the time he assumed office on July 16, 1962, there
were nearly 400 pending cases in his court, many of which were partially tried
by his predecessors but without transcripts of stenographic notes and at the
time the complaint was filed in November, 1972, the total number of cases was
reduced to only 69; that respondent had been in the government service for more
than thirty-one (31) years having risen from the ranks without the help of any
politician, his appointment to the Judiciary being upon the recommendation of
the then Secretary of Justice; that during his more than 31 years of service,
he was never charged administratively; that he would not jeopardize his career
by submitting the questioned certificates of service if he had actual knowledge
or had reason to believe that the clerk of court's monthly reports, on which he
based his certificates, were incomplete or inaccurate and could not be relied
upon; and that at most he <span style="">could only be
guilty of simple neglect (pp. 16-24, </span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span></span><span style="">A.C. No. 269-J, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In OUR resolution of <st1:date year="1973" day="24" month="5">May
 24, 1973</st1:date>, WE referred this case to Justice Emilio <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> of the Court of Appeals, for investigation, report
and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="8">August 28, 1973</st1:date>, the Investigating
Justice submitted his report stating that the charges of serious misconduct and
inefficiency against respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> were
not substantiated and that there is no evidence to show that he knowingly
submitted the false certificates to collect his salaries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he found respondent judge guilty of
negligence for not having taken the necessary precautions to verify every now
and then <span class="SpellE">whethere</span> there are still cases pending for
decision beyond 90 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But considering
that respondent had been a career man for about 32 years who rose from the
ranks primarily on the basis of his competence and integrity, that he has never
been charged administratively except now, and that his record of service and
efficiency as a judge is above-board, the Investigating Justice recommended
that tempering justice with mercy, the respondent judge be cleared of the
charges but with a warning that a repetition of such negligence in the
performance of his duty will be dealt with more severely (pp. 43-55, A.C. No.
269-J, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1975</st1:date>,
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> was charged with gross

failure to decide two (2) civil cases within the ninety-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period for deciding cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Docketed as

issued an order, stating <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that these two cases shall be deemed submitted for decision after the filing by
the parties of their respective memoranda; that pursuant to said order the
parties submitted their respective memoranda, but it was only on May 30, 1973,
or after a period of about five (5) years that the respondent judge rendered
his decision in the said cases in violation of Section 5 of R.A. 296 and
Memorandum Circulars No. 9 dated February 6, 1952 and No. 17 dated March 14,
1963 respectively, of the Department (now Ministry) of Justice, which require
judges of the Courts of First Instance to decide cases submitted for decision
within 90 days from the date of submission thereof; that there is also a very
strong possibility that respondent judge may have made misrepresentations if
not falsifications with respect to the submission of certificates of service
and the drawing of his salaries within a period of five (5) years from the time
the aforesaid cases <span style="">were submitted for
decision up to May 30, 1973 when</span> <span style="">he

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In his comment dated

and docketed as Administrative Matter No. 1310-CFI, <span class="SpellE">Florentina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Castrence-Pance</span> charged respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> with delay in the rendition of the decision in her

the present (pp. 1-2, Adm. Matter No. 1310-CFI, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon being required to
comment, the respondent Judge filed one on August 27, 1976 alleging among
others, that the delay in the rendition of the decision in Civil Case No. A-845
was not intentional and may be attributed to the none too perfect recording and
filing system of his court; that a draft of the decision was already
transcribed sometime in May 1976, and was discovered among the files of the
cases submitted for decision, after another one was dictated and was about to
be transcribed by the stenographer (pp. 5-6, Adm. Mat. <span class="GramE">No.
1310-CFI, rec.).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The last case involving
respondent Judge </span><span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, which was docketed
as Administrative <span style="">Matter No. 340-CFI,
arose out of his failure to submit his certificates of service since October,
1975 despite reminders sent to him and the withholding of his salary since
January, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span>then Executive
Officer, now Deputy Court Administrator, Arturo B. Buena issued a memorandum
dated April 22, 1977, addressed to the then Acting Judicial Consultant, now
Minister of Justice, Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, recommending
that an audit tem, <span class="SpellE">preferrably</span> composed of lawyers,
be sent to respondent's court at <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, to audit the cases therein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="7"><span style="">July 7,
 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, this Court
resolved to <span class="SpellE">solidate</span> Administrative Matter No.
997-CFI with </span>Administrative Case No. 269-J for the reason that the
issues raised in the former case are encompassed in the latter case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 28, 1977 respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
wrote to the late Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro and admitted the
non-submission of his certificates of service since October, 1975 up to the
present, but explained that the same does not mean that he has not rendered the
service required of him, and that it was his fear and mistaken belief that he
could not truthfully submit his certificates of service for the months when
there are cases submitted and pending decision for more than 90 days; that he
had hoped to clear first his docket of these cases and thereafter submit is
overdue certificates of service, but he failed, and instead, the cases
submitted for decision increased; that it is only now that he realized that he
could have truthfully made those certificates of service without possibly being
guilty of falsification by stating therein the cases then pending decision for
more than 90 days so that his superiors in Manila could have known that he is
still performing his duties; and that he also attends to matters not connected
with cases pending in court, in that, persons familiar with him would come for
advice regarding contemplated suits one intends to file against another, and in
that way, he has prevented some cases from reaching the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent further stated that as of June,
1977, his case load was 136 but he has some 19 cases (14 civil and 5 criminal)
pending decision for more than 90 days; that he hopes to finish the said cases
in two months as he has no legal researcher and his clerk of court, who is a
sick man, could not be of help; that it is his heart condition which caused him
to slow down in his work upon the advice of his physician; that long before his
appointment to the Judiciary in 1962, he had an enlarged heart with murmurs and
had to undergo treat­ment; that fortunately, after several months, he recovered
and it was only in 1968 that his ailment recurred; that in 1976, a medical
check-up revealed the same heart condition he had in 1962 and 1968, but
seemingly in a more advanced degree.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent then requested that he be given two (2) months leave so he
could concentrate his full time to the writing of the decisions in the cases
which have been pending for more than 90 days and that thereafter, he be
allowed to retire in view of his ailment (pp. 13-16, Adm. Mat. <span class="GramE">No. 340-CFI, rec.).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated September 27, 1977, this Court consolidated
Administrative Case No. 269-J, Administrative Matter No. 997-CFI,
Administrative Matter No. 1310-CFI, and Administrative Matter No. 340-CFI; and
authorized respondent Judge not to hold trials in his court until December 31,
1977 provided that he shall submit to the Court a monthly report commencing
October of at least seven decisions written and promulgated by him in order
that by the end of 1977 all the cases submitted for decision as of September
27, 1977 shall have been terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was also stated that the Court shall only approve respondent's request for
optional retirement after full compliance with the aforesaid directive.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the aforesaid resolution, respondent judge informed
this Court on <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1977</st1:date>
that he has cancelled all trials in his court effective <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1977</st1:date> until <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1977</st1:date>, with the view of deciding on
or before <st1:date year="1977" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1977</st1:date>,
all cases submitted for decision as of September, 1977.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1977</st1:date>,
Deputy Court Administrator Arturo B. Buena sent a telegram to the respondent
judge reminding him to submit his monthly report of decisions written and
promulgated beginning October 1977, as required by the <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1977</st1:date> resolution of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records, however, reveal no further
communication from him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1980</st1:date>,
Deputy Court Administrator Romeo D. Mendoza, sent an audit team composed of
Attys. Umberto T. <span class="SpellE">Ancajas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Romanito</span>
A. <span class="SpellE">Amatong</span> to <span class="SpellE">Alaminos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, in order to conduct a physical inventory,
examination and evaluation of the case records and docket books of the
respondent's court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a thorough
examination of the records of cases in the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> of
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, the audit team, in its
reports dated July 22 and 31, 1980, stated that, contrary to what was declared
in the monthly report of cases for March 1980 submitted by the respondent that
there are no cases pending decision, respondent judge has thirty-six (36) cases
pending and submitted for decision as of March 31, 1980, thirty (30) cases of
which were pending decision beyond the 90-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it was discovered that
out of the nineteen (19) cases reported by the respondent in his letter dated
July 27, 1977 to the late Chief Justice Fred Ruiz Castro to be pending decision
for more than 90 days as of June 30, 1977, it appears that respondent was able
to dispose of only ten (10) of these cases, as nine (9) of these cases together
with two (2) unreported cases were still pending decision as of December 31,
1977 and remained undecided as of March 31, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further reported that respondent judge
suffered a heart attack and was confined at the Philippine Heart Center in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> from <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="6">June 9 to 23, 1980</st1:date> and this was
followed by a more serious heart attack on <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1980</st1:date> for which he was confined at the <st1:place><st1:placename>UST</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> (pp. 29-48, Adm. Mat. <span class="GramE">No. 340-CFI, rec.).</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with Administrative Case No. 269-J, WE have gone
over the records and WE do not fully agree with the recommendation of
Investigating Justice Emilio A. <span class="SpellE">Gancayco</span> that
respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> be cleared of all the
charges against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is undisputed
that respondent judge prepared and submitted his certificates of service dated
August, 1968; January, February, March, May, June and August, 1969; January,
March, April, May and December 1970; April, 1971 and March, 1972, where he
certified that all civil and criminal cases which had been submitted to him for
decision had been decided within the ninety-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the records reveal otherwise, for at the
time he prepared and submitted the different certificates, there were still 23
cases as specified in the complaint which had already been terminated and had
in fact been submitted for decision but remained pending and undecided for more
than ninety days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent contends however that he did not intentionally or
knowingly falsify the aforesaid certificates because he had no knowledge nor
was his attention called to those cases pending decision for more than 90 days
at the time he submitted the different certificates and that he relied solely
on the monthly reports of cases of the clerk of court, which showed no cases
pending decision for more than 90 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in that contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent, as the incumbent judge, ought to
know those cases submitted to him for decision particularly those cases pending
decision for more than ninety days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of fact, he is supposed to keep his own record of the cases submitted
for decision so that he could act on them promptly and without delay, mindful
of the mandate in Section 5 of Republic Act No. 296, also known as the
Judiciary Act of 1948, that judges should decide cases submitted for decision
within <span style="">ninety </span>days from
submission and to certify to the fact that there are no cases pending decision beyond
that period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is expected that he
should be more diligent and more vigilant in attending to cases submitted for
decision as well as in the preparation of his monthly certificates of service
by verifying every now and then whether there are cases pending decision for
more than ninety days; because he could be held accountable for any error or
falsification in his certificates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
respondent cannot now escape liability for falsification of his certificates of
service with the lame excuse that he has no knowledge of those cases pending
decision for more than ninety days at the time he submitted his certificates of
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nor could he give the excuse
that his attention was not called to the cases pending decision beyond ninety
days because he need not be reminded of his deadlines by a subordinate court
employee like the clerk of court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Court
employees are not the guardians of a judge's responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge is personally and directly
responsible for the proper discharge of his judicial functions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, his total reliance on the monthly
report of cases of the clerk of court cannot but be frowned upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is manifest that respondent had not
instituted some form of control over his court records especially those of
cases submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, the falsification committed by the respondent judge in
connection with his monthly certificates of service, which was resorted to in
order to collect his salary, amounts to serious mis­conduct being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Section 5 of Republic Act 296.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that "for serious
misconduct to exist, there must be a clear showing that the act complained of
was corrupt or inspired by an intention to violate the law or was in persistent
disregard of well known legal principles" (<span class="SpellE">Dy</span> <span class="SpellE">Teban</span> Hardware &amp; Auto Supply Co. vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Lauro</span> L. <span class="SpellE">Tapucar</span>, and related
cases, A.M. 1720, A.M. 1911, A.M. 2300-CFI, promulgated on January 31, 1981,
citing In re:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Impeachment of Hon.
Antonio <span class="SpellE">Horilleno</span>, 43 Phil. 212 <i>[</i>1922<i>]</i>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More­over, the falsification, made more <span style="">patent </span>by the fact that there were not
only one but several falsified certificates involved, is condemnable
considering that it was committed by a person occupying a judicial position and
sworn to uphold the majesty of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the charge of gross inefficiency for failure to dispose of the
23 cases specified in the complaint within the 90-day period, respondent
admitted that the 23 cases were already submitted for decision and that the
same remained pending and undecided for more than 90 days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise admitted that at the time his
docket was audited from <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="7">July 5, 1972</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1972" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1972</st1:date>, the
aforesaid 23 cases were then still pending decision but he asserted that the 23
cases were already decided as of October, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, this claim is belied by the fact that Civil Case No. A-421 and
A-424, two of the 23 cases submitted for decision and now subject of
Administrative Matter No. 997-CFI, were both submitted for decision on <u><span style="">November 15, 1968</span></u><span style=""> </span>but it was only on <u><span style="">May 30, 1973</span></u><span style="">, </span>or a period of about five (5) years <span style="">that </span>the respondent judge rendered his
decision in the said cases.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it appears from the audit team's reports of July 22 and
31, 1980, and the respondent admits, that Land Registration Case No. A-111, one
<span style="">of the aforesaid 23 cases, was submitted
for decision first on </span><st1:date year="1970" day="11" month="5"><span style="">May 11, 1970</span></st1:date><span style=""> and then on </span><st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="3"><span style="">March 20, 1974</span></st1:date><span style=""> but was still pending at the time of the
audit in June, 1980 (p. 34, Adm. Mat. <span class="GramE">No. 340-CFI, rec.).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the same case was submitted for
decision twice invites suspicion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
there is no question that the aforesaid case was not decided as of October,
1972 as claimed by the respondent nor was it decided within ninety days from
the date of sub­mission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This prolonged and undue delay in the rendition of decisions in
no less than 23 cases of respondent's court, is a patent violation of Section
5, R.A. 296 which requires judges to determine or decide motions, special
proceedings, petitions and all civil and criminal cases submitted within a
period of ninety (90) days from the date of their submission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">WE have reminded the
judges to act with dispatch in the disposition of cases assigned to their
respective <span class="SpellE">salas</span> in order to alleviate the present
clogged condition of court dockets, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We must once more impress upon the members of the Judiciary
their sworn duty of administering justice without undue delay under the <span style="">time-honored precept that justice delayed, is
justice denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The present clogged
condition of the courts' docket in all levels of our judicial system cannot be cleared
unless each and every judge earnestly and painstakingly takes it upon himself
to comply faithfully with the mandate of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No less important than the speedy termination
of hearings and trials of cases is the promptness and dispatch in the making of
decisions and judgment, the signing thereof and filing the same with the Clerk
of Court" (Castro vs. <span class="SpellE">Malazo</span>, A.M. No. 1237-CAR,
August 21, 1980).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It may also be added that no less than the 1973 Constitution has
enjoined that all "public officers and employees shall serve with the
highest degree of responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and <span style="">efficiency, and shall remain accountable to
the people" (Sec. 1, Art. XIII)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We</span> have already declared that "In
the administration of justice, it is expected that men who wield authority
should be the paragon of honesty and efficiency if only to preserve sacred and
inviolate the trust and confidence of the people" (The Philippine Trial
Lawyers Association, Inc. vs. Garcia, A.M. No. 2356-CTJ, October 30, 1980).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, in spite of all the glowing achieve­ments cited by
the respondent judge in his answer, such as being able to reduce the cases
pending in his court from 400 at the time he assumed office on <st1:date year="1962" day="16" month="7">July 16, 1962</st1:date>, to 69 in January,
1973, it is obvious that he was remiss in the performance of his official
duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the unreasonable delay in the disposition of the aforesaid 23
cases, and for his false certificates of service, he should be subject to
administrative sanctions.</p>

<p class="BODY">With reference to Administrative Matter No. 997-CFI, there is no
need to discuss the charges of gross negligence and misconduct filed by
complainant Andres <span class="SpellE">Maglipon</span> against respondent judge
because the two civil cases submitted for decision in 1968 and decided only in
1973 (Civil Case No. A-421 and A-424), upon which the same is based, are
likewise included as bases of Administrative Case No. 269-J, where WE earlier
held that respondent is administratively liable for his false certificates of
service and for his failure to decide the 23 cases, which as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, included Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">A-421
and A-424, within the ninety-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In Administrative Matter No. 1310-CFI, complainant <span class="SpellE">Florentina</span> <span class="SpellE">Castrence-Pance</span>
charged respondent with delay in the disposition of her case, Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">A-845.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records
disclose that Civil Case No. A-845 was submitted for decision on <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1975</st1:date> but the same
remained pending up to the time the present complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1976" day="21" month="6">June 21, 1976</st1:date> with this Court, or
about six (6) months after the case was submitted for decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It then appears that the respondent judge
violated the ninety day period provided for by Section 5, Republic Act No. 296
within which to decide a case submitted before him for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge's explanation that the delay in the
disposition of Civil Case No. A-<span class="GramE">845,</span> was due to the
none too perfect recording and filing system of his court merits, as heretofore
stated, condemnation as it reflects his lack of elementary knowledge of court
management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could be faulted for not
maintaining or <span class="SpellE">devicing</span> a better recording and filing
system in his court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, he should <span style="">have kept in his own files and under his
supervision</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a record of cases submitted for decision so
that his </span><span style="">memory will not fail
him or any disorderliness in his court docket will not affect the speedy
disposition of cases submitted for decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, note should
also be taken of the fact that respondent, apparently because of the
administrative charges filed against him, opted not to submit his monthly
certificates of service from October, 1975 up to November, 1977 (p. 45, A.M.
No. 340-CFI, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was due,
according to the respondent, to his fear and mistaken belief that he could not
truthfully submit his certificates of service for the months when there <span class="GramE">are cases submitted and pending decision</span> for more than 90
days and that he had hoped to clear first his docket of these cases and
thereafter submit his overdue certificates of service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, there were 19 cases pending
decision beyond 90 days that had accumulated as of June, 1977, allegedly
because of respondent's recurring heart ailment and his advanced age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And despite the fact that respondent was
authorized on September 27, 1977 not to hold any trial until December 31, 1977
so he could decide all the afore­said 19 cases, he was able to dispose of only
ten (10) cases while nine (9) cases together with two (2) unreported cases
remained pending and undecided as of December 31, 1977, as found by the audit
team created under Adminis­trative Matter No. 340-CFI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent judge retired
on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="17" month="11"><span style="">November 17, 1980</span></st1:date><span style=""> having reached the compulsory retirement age of 70.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">WE find the recommended penalty of Deputy Court Administrator
Romeo D. Mendoza, which consists of a fine equivalent to respondent's salary
for six (6) months, as too light considering that there was a total of 24 cases
involved in the instant administrative cases, and as of March 31, 1980,
respondent had thirty-six (36) cases pending decision, thirty (30) of which
were pending decision beyond 90 days, including the eleven (11) undecided cases
as of December 31, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In addition, Land Registration Case No.</span> A-111, which is one
of the 23 cases involved in Administrative Case No. 269-J and submitted for
decision on May 11, 1970, appeared to have been submitted for decision again on
March 20, 1974 and remained pending decision as of March 31, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that respondent's inattention to his
official duties, which resulted in the delay in the disposition of several
cases, continued even after the filing of the administrative charges against
him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, THE COURT HEREBY FINDS RESPONDENT JUDGE
