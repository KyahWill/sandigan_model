				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue as to whether or not an action for annulment of sale, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> or similar proceeding is a previous question
before an action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> may proceed is the focus of the dispute in this
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners were the registered owners of a parcel of land
located in <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>, Laguna covered by Transfer
Certificate of Title No. T-35475 of the Register of Deeds of Laguna with an
area of about 240 square meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
mortgaged the same to the Luzon Development Bank (LDB for short) for the sum of
P10,000.00 payable in installments in five years beginning <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As petitioners defaulted in the payment of the loan the LDB extra
judicially foreclosed the mortgage on <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1981</st1:date> so the property was sold at public auction to LDB as the
highest bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon failure of the
petitioners to redeem the property within one year from the sale, title over
the same was consolidated in favor of LDB on September 13, 1982 so that
petitioners’ title was cancelled and TCT No. T-89122 was issued to LDB.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1986</st1:date>,
LDB filed in the Regional Trial Court of Laguna a petition for the issuance of
a writ of possession docketed as RTC SLRC Case No. 111-83-C.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners filed an opposition thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="2">February
 26, 1986</st1:date>, the trial court issued an order authorizing the Clerk of
Court to issue the corresponding writ of possession which was returned
unsatisfied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1986</st1:date>, LDB filed a motion for demolition
which was opposed by petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless the trial court granted the motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration of said order
was filed by petitioners wherein it was alleged that LDB was no longer the
owner of the property inasmuch as it had already sold the same to spouses
Cecilia de Ramos and Cesar de Ramos and the title thereto of LDB had been
cancelled and replaced by TCT No. T-89122 in the name of said Ramos spouses,
who have elected to file an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case
against petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was
granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioners filed an action against the Ramos spouses and LDB in the Regional
Trial Court of Laguna for annulment of sale, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
of property with damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The suit was
docketed as RTC Civil Case No. 1031-86.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1986</st1:date>,
the Ramos spouses filed an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
against petitioners in the Municipal Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Calamba</span>,
Laguna docketed as Civil Case No. 2405.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners filed their answer with cross claim alleging among others
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the annulment case before the
RTC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On motion of LDB the said cross
claim was dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1987</st1:date> a decision was rendered
ordering petitioners to vacate the property in question within sixty (60) days
from receipt thereof, to pay attorney’s fees in the amount of P2,000.00 and the
cost of the suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The counterclaim was
dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners appealed the
decision to the Regional Trial Court of Laguna but the same was affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They filed a petition for review in the Court
of Appeals wherein on October 7, 1988 a decision was promulgated dismissing the
petition with costs against petitioners.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> A
motion for reconsideration filed by petitioners was denied by the appellate
court in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="2" month="3">March 2,
 1989</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile the annulment case was dismissed by the trial court on
the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.
<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Petitioners appealed to the Court of
Appeals wherein on September 21, 1988 a decision was rendered setting aside the
appealed order of dismissal and remanding the records to the lower court for
further proceedings and adjudication on the merits.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
In said case the appellate court ruled that the petition for a writ of
possession is not a bar to the prosecution of the annulment case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the herein petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
wherein petitioners raise as errors allegedly committed by the appellate court
in grave abuse of discretion, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the failure to declare that the Municipal Trial Court has no
jurisdiction over the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case due to
the failure to allege in the complaint that private respondents Ramos spouses
had prior physical possession of the property; and (2) that the proceedings in
said unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case should be suspended
pending the resolution of the action for annulment of the sale, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> and damages pending before the Regional Trial
Court of Laguna.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1989</st1:date>
the petition was denied for failure of petitioners to sufficiently show that
the respondent court had committed any reversible error in its questioned
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration
was filed by petitioners to which an opposition was filed by private
respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties were then
required to submit their simultaneous memoranda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This requirement has been complied with by
the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the first issue, petitioners contend that as they continued to
be in physical possession of the property and in the absence of the
jurisdictional allegation in the complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
that private respondents had prior physical possession of the property the
lower court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the questioned decision of the respondent court dated <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1988</st1:date>, the following
disquisition was made:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the provisions of Rule 70 of<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp; </span>the Rules of Court, an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case may be filed by an landlord, vendor or <u>vendee</u> (like herein private
respondents) against whom the <u>possession</u> of any land or building is
unlawfully withheld after the expiration or termination of the right to hold
possession by virtue of any contract express or implied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners’ right to possess the property in
question terminated from the moment they ceased to be the owners thereof and
the transfer of said ownership to Luzon Development Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was bolstered by the issuance of a writ
of possession turning over the possession thereof to the Bank, which in turn
transferred its right of ownership or possession to private respondents, who in
turn became the owners thereof entitled to its possession with the issuance in
their name of the title to the property.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Premises considered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find
no reversible error of law or fact in the decision under review."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in forcible entry cases the plaintiff must allege
and prove that he was in prior physical possession of the property in
litigation until he was deprived thereof by the defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, in unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
cases, the plaintiff need not have been in prior physical possession of the
property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The second issue is likewise devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pending in the Regional Trial Court (RTC),
Laguna is an action for the annulment of the sale to private respondent, the
foreclosure of mortgage, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> and
damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners claims that the
proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case must be suspended
until after the said annulment case is resolved by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court takes note of the fact that some lessees, realizing
that the action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> will be filed
against them shortly, "jump the gun" on the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
by going to court first.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They institute,
for instance, actions for consignation of rentals, or for specific performance
of alleged agreement for renewal of lease or as in this case for annulment of
the sale, etc.</p>

<p class="BODY">The advantage of having the question of possession of the leased
premises determined in such an ordinary action of consignation, breach of
contract or annulment of sale, instead of a summary <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit, are obvious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings are
not summary, and presumably would take longer than an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
judgment against the lessee is not immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
and there is no need to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond to
stay execution, and the remedy of preliminary mandatory injunction is not
usually available to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question is, may the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
such an action for consignation or specific performance, or annulment of a
sale, as in this case, be successfully pleaded in abatement of an action for
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Court has invariably given a negative answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Lim <span class="SpellE">Si</span> vs. Lim,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
the lessee disagreed with the increased rental rate imposed by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and brought in the Court of First Instance (CFI) a
suit for consignation of rentals praying that the court fix the rate thereof
and he be authorized to remain in the premises in the meantime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> moved to
dismiss, arguing that the issue raised should not be resolved in an action of
consignation but in an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
did in fact file an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> action against the
lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court dismissed the
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In sustaining the dismissal this
Court citing <span class="SpellE">Pue</span>, et al. vs. Gonzales,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
held that consignation -</p>

<blockquote>"is not the proper proceedings to
determine the relation between landlord and tenant, the period of life of the
lease of tenancy, the reasonableness of the amount of rental, the right of the
tenant to keep the premises against the will of the landlord, etc. (which)
questions should be decided in a case of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> or
<span class="SpellE">detainer</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left:1.0in;text-indent:-1.0in">and ruled as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The principle **exactly covers the
point at issue, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>., that the disagreement between a <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and a lessee as to the amount of rent to be paid by
a lessee cannot be decided in an action of consignation but in that of forcible
entry and unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> institutes when the lessee refuses to pay the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> the rents that he has fixed for the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may also be added that consignation is
proper when there is a debt to be paid, which the debtor desires to pay and
which the creditor refuses to receive, or neglects to receive, or cannot
receive by reason of his absence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
purpose of consignation is to have the obligation or indebtedness
extinguished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, plaintiff
seeks to have the obligation determined and fixed, hence his action should not
be one of consignation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>For the foregoing reasons, we hold that plaintiff has no cause of
action against defendant under the facts alleged in his complaint; that consignation
is not the proper remedy; that it is the defendant who has the right or cause
of against the plaintiff because the latter refuses to pay the rents fixed but
does not leave the property; and that if the plaintiff claims that the amount
of rents demanded by the defendant is unreasonable and he desires to have it
fixed judicially, he may set forth the above facts as defenses in the action of
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> filed by the defendant against him.**"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same ruling was rendered by this Court in <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Mirasol</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
where an action for specific performance to compel the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
to renew the lease was held to be a proper defense in the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the same vein this Court held that an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
or action for <span class="SpellE">reivindicatoria</span> or quieting of title or
injunction or reformation may not be pleaded in abatement of an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE">Quiambao</span> vs. Osorio,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
invoked by petitioners cannot support their cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In said case, the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
suit was sought to be suspended on the ground of the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of an administrative case in the Office of the Land Authority where the
agreement of sale of the lot in question, on which respondents based their
prior possession, had already been cancelled by the Land Authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, this Court held the prudent course for
the trial court to do is to hold the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
proceeding until after the determination of the administrative case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no analogy in the facts of the said
case with the present case.</p>
