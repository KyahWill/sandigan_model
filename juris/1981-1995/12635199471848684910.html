<p class="BODY">It should be noted that the aforequoted agreement contained no
time frame within which the plans; working drawings and specifications had to
be submitted to ENDEL under item 5 (c).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But ENDEL contends<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> that said
plans and working drawings had to be finished within three (3) months from the
date of agreement, or by </span><st1:date year="1972" day="30" month="4"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">April 30, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1972</st1:date>,
the plans mentioned in item 5 (b) of said agreement were approved by the
Engineering Department of Ayala Securities Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1972</st1:date>,
GONZALES acknowledged payment of the amount of P20,000.00 under item 5 (b).<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

By then, he had received from ENDEL the total amount of P30,000.00 as even
before the execution of said agreement he had received the amount of P10,000.00
specified in item 5 (a).</p>

<p class="BODY">In early May, 1972, ENDEL, through its President Enrique Galan,
allegedly expressed verbally its desire not to proceed with the construction of
the condominium considering that the working drawings had not yet been
completed within the period promised.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

pursuant to item 5 (c).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In December 1972,
GONZALES demanded from ENDEL the payment of P20,000.00 under item 5 (c), which
was rejected by the latter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">March 2,

rescission or cancellation of its contract with GONZALES before the then Court
of First Instance of Rizal, Branch VI (CC No. 17441).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ENDEL essentially averred that GONZALES'
neglect and delay in completing the drawings and specifications within three
(3) months, or by April 30, 1972, conformably with the practice of architects,
to enable ENDEL to complete plans for its financing and make public
announcements of said project resulted in great damage and prejudice to it as
to warrant rescission and cancellation of the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To further justify cancellation, ENDEL
further alleged that at the time the working drawings and specifications were
delivered to it, big disastrous floods had already wrought considerable damage
in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> and that the declaration of Martial Law in
September of 1972 resulted in certain restrictions on non-governmental
projects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>ENDEL thus prayed for
rescission of the contract; the return to it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the amount of
P30,000.00 with interest; damages in the amount of P100,000.00 representing

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Traversing the Complaint,
GONZALES, as defendant below, alleged that 1) he was neither negligent nor in
delay nor aware of any practice that plans and working drawings should be
submitted within three </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">(3) </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">months from the agreement; 2) assuming that
there was delay, the same was due to ENDEL's refusal to discuss with him the
preparation of said drawings and specifications; 3) that at no time prior to
the demand made by him of the balance from ENDEL did the latter inform him of
its desire to abandon the construction of the proposed building and that had he
been so informed, he would not have incurred expenses in preparing the working
drawings and specifications, which portion of the agreement entailed the
greatest expense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>GONZALES then prayed
for the dismissal of the Complaint and counterclaimed for payment of the
balance of P20,000.00; moral damages in the amount of P20,000.00; attorney's
fees and other equitable remedy.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
