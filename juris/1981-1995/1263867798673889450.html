(<i>Rollo</i>, p. 45)<br><br>Anent the charge of misconduct and habitual drunkenness, respondent claimed that the incident on March 31, 1989 complained of, was indeed regrettable.&nbsp; While he also admits that after lunch, on said date, he took a bottle or two of beer, he claimed that he is not a habitual drinker, as alleged by the complainant.&nbsp; He also claimed that whenever he drinks, he drinks outside office hours.&nbsp; Moreover, he claimed that the quarrel between him and Gilbert G. Solis, was cause by personal misunderstanding, which was immediately patched up.<br><br>Regarding the charge of unauthorized absences and tardiness in reporting for duty, respondent contended that the records would show that he has filed the corresponding vacation or sick leave applications.&nbsp; The alleged unauthorized absences were due to health reasons and hence, notice thereof and the filing of the required application for sick leave could not be filed within the prescribed period.&nbsp; He too admits that sometimes he is tardy in reporting for duty, especially on Mondays following weekends, whenever he goes to his hometown some kilometers away from Dumaguete City.&nbsp; But again, this is few and far between.&nbsp; Respondent denied that he has been loafing during office hours.&nbsp; In his defense, he claimed that he takes a few minutes rest after doing his work or during coffee breaks at a place near the court buildings.<br><br>Respondent finally claimed that he honestly believed that he conducted himself in the performance of his duties at his best and if he conducted himself to the prejudice of the service such behavior was not intended and without malice.<br><br>We find the explanation of the respondent unsatisfactory.&nbsp; He was not able to refute the accusations made against him.&nbsp; As can be noted in his comment, the reasons given by the respondent are on the contrary, demonstrative of whimsical and abusive acts of a government employee which are prejudicial to the best interest of the service.<br><br>The conduct and behavior of everyone connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice, like the courts below, from the presiding judge to the lowest clerk, should be circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility (<i>Montemayor v. Collado</i>, 107 SCRA 258).&nbsp; A public office is a public trust and all public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people.&nbsp; This Court cannot countenance any act or omission which diminish or tend to diminish the faith of the people in the Judiciary.<br><br>Premises considered, the Court Resolved to hold respondent liable as charged.<br><br><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> a FINE of Four Thousand Pesos (P4,000.00) is imposed on respondent Romeo Eullaran, payable to this Court within ten (10) days from notice with STERN WARNING that a repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.&nbsp; Let a copy of this resolution be attached to respondent's personal records.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Narvasa, (Chairman), Cruz, Gancayco, </i>and <i>Griño-Aquino, JJ.</i>, concur.</div>
