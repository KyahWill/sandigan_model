partial due course, in respect of the award of damages, in this appeal by <i>Certiorari</i>
from the Decision of respondent Court of Appeals,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> in CA-G.R. No. 65524-R, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Panay</span> Electric Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> and Luzon Surety Co., Inc."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>, was employed
in 1952 by petitioner company as a bill collector.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To guarantee fulfillment of his obligations
as such, he posted in favor of petitioner two surety bonds in the total amount
of P4,000.00, with his co-respondent, Luzon Surety Co., Inc., as surety.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Contending that, an
auditing report presented by the accounting firm of <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Gorres</span> and <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> in
January, 1965, showed that <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> had incurred a shortage in his collections for a
period of 7 1/2 years in the sum of P12,155.68, petitioner filed against him
and the surety company a suit for reimbursement on </span><st1:date year="1966" day="22" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June 22, 1966</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Prior thereto, or, in February, 1965, private respondent had not been
allowed by petitioner to continue working.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his Answer filed on <st1:date year="1966" day="31" month="10">October
 31, 1966</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> denied the shortage,
attributing it to erroneous accounting, and prayed for attorney's fees in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sum of P800.00 and actual damages in the sum
of P500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, in an Amended Answer
dated </span><st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 14.0pt">October 6, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">,
which was admitted by the lower Court, <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span>
alleged in an additional counterclaim that he was dismissed without cause and
prayed for reinstatement with back salaries and damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent surety company disclaimed any
liability because of <span class="SpellE">Sarabia's</span> refusal to admit the
shortage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court found the shortage to be only in the amount of
P41.85; that the case was the product of "either a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span>
frame-up or a mistake in accounting"; and ordered <span class="SpellE">Sarabia's</span>
reinstatement with back wages from January, 1965; the payment to him of moral
damages of P20,000.00, exemplary damages of P10,000.00, attorney's fees of
P5,000.00, and expenses of litigation of P1,000.00, and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint as against the surety company
was dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals affirmed the amount of the shortage
and the reinstatement ordered, but modified the judgment by limiting <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to the monthly salary of P180.00 for a period of
three years, or the total sum of P6,480.00, as actual damages, P10,000.00 as
moral damages, P5,000.00 as exemplary damages, P2,000.00 for attorney's fees
and expenses of litigation, and costs, all such amounts to bear legal interest
from the date when the judgment in this case shall become final, until fully
paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reinstatement was conditioned upon
<span class="SpellE">Sarabia's</span> physical fitness, who was said to be
"at present old and sick," and upon presentation of a duly verified
certification by a Government physician.</p>

<p class="BODY">That <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> did not actually incur any
shortages except for the amount of P41.85 is a factual finding that is binding
upon this Court in the absence of established exceptions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the error in the shortage, we
agree that petitioner need not have terminated his services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is thus entitled to reinstatement and
backwages<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in the total sum of P6,480.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that reinstatement and additional damages were prayed
for only in an Amended Answer filed approximately six years after the original
Answer does not bar it on grounds of prescription and <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original Answer had already alleged
termination of services on account of shortage of collections, which shortage <span class="SpellE">Sarabia</span> disputed and was, in effect, an allegation that
termination was without cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reinstatement
prayed for merely supplemented and amplified the fact <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">of </span>termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
amendment which merely supplements and amplifies the facts originally alleged
relates back to the date of the commencement of the action and is not barred by
the statute of limitations the period of which expires after service of the ori­ginal
complaint but before service of amendment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The award of moral damages is uncalled for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In filing the present case, petitioner had
not acted with malice, fraud, or in bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It relied solely on the letter of the accounting firm of <span class="SpellE">Sycip</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gorres</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
such reliance was misplaced, for, as found by the Court of Appeals, that letter
was "only a brief letter mentioning some summarized findings which are
unverified and <span class="SpellE">undetailed</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It even stressed the fact that there are
unascertained differences 'due to unavailable records and/or customer's credit
balances due to overpayment'.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither are exemplary damages proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner had not acted in a “wanton,
fraudulent, reckless, oppressive, or malevolent manner".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span>Based on the accounting findings,
incomplete though they may have been, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">petitioner
</span>cannot be blamed for trying to protect itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grant of attorney's fees and expenses of liti­gation of
P2,000.00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">is,
</span>we find, just and equitable.</p>

modified by the elimination of the award of moral damages and exemplary
