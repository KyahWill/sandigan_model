				<H3>SPOUSES TEODORICO MARFIL, AND TEODORA ESPAÑOLA, COMPLAINANTS,
VS. JUDGE ORLANDO CUACHON, 5TH MUNICIPAL CIRCUIT COURT OF ISABELA,
MOISES PADILLA, NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>DE CASTRO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a verified complaint dated March 17, 1980 complainants charged
respondent Judge Orlando Cuachon of the 5th Judicial Circuit Court of Isabela -
Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental, with "gross ignorance of the law and
acts unbecoming a Judge."</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint alleged that on December 10, 1979, Maria Soto Vda.
de Gonzales, an aunt of the wife of respondent, filed a criminal complaint
against herein complainant Teodorico Marfil, for violation of Presidential
Decree No. 772 (Anti-Squatting Law), before the sala of respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent allegedly took cognizance of the
case, and after conducting the first stage of the preliminary examination
wherein the aggrieved party Maria Soto Vda. de Gonzales and her witnesses were
investigated, respondent on January 8, 1980 , issued a warrant for the arrest
of Teodorico Marfil and fixed the bail at P1,000.00; that on the basis of such
warrant complainant Marfil was apprehended on January 18, 1980 and
detained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was also alleged that on
February 22, 1980 the accused-complainant hired the services of a counsel who,
on the same day, filed a petition for referral of the criminal case to the
Ministry of Agrarian Reform due to the tenancy aspect of the case, with prayer
that the accused-complainant who is under detention be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For failure of respondent to order the
release of accused-complainant, an urgent motion to quash the criminal action
dated March 6, 1980, was filed by the latter's counsel, which motion was
however, not favorably acted upon by respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainants prayed that respondent be
removed from his office.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment and answer dated May 16, 1980 respondent Judge
averred that when a complaint is filed in court, it becomes a routinary matter
to accept the same and con­duct a preliminary examination for the purpose of
the issuance of a warrant of arrest; that on January 8, 1980 he issued a
warrant of arrest; that on January 23, 1980 he issued a subpoena for the
parties to appear on February 12, 1980, and on the latter date, the aggrieved
party and the Station Commander of Moises Padilla, Negros Occidental, were
present, but the accused appeared without counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge further alleged that, being
aware of the relationship of the wife to the aggrieved party, he an­nounced
during the said hearing that the case was called for a possible amicable
settlement; that when he found that there was no possibility for an amicable
settlement, he issued an order on the same date inhibiting himself from trying
the case; that having inhibited himself, he could no longer act on the petition
for referral dated February 22, 1980 and motion to quash, dated March 6, 1980,
or order the release of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint is meritorious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph 1, Section 1, Rule 137 of the Revised Rules of Court clearly
pro­vides:</p>

<blockquote>"No judge or judicial officer shall sit in any case in which
he, or his wife or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor
or otherwise, or in which he is related to either party within the sixth degree
of consanguinity or affinity, or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed
according to the rules of the civil law, or in which he has been executor,
administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any
inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without
the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon
the record."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above rule is mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Strict compliance with the stringent rule on disqualification on account
of relation­ship between the judge and one of the parties serves not only to
protect the rights of the parties and assure an impartial administration of
justice but also to prevent erosion of the people's confidence in the
judiciary.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is in the essence of due process that a judge, sitting in a case, be at all
times wholly free, impartial and in­dependent.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an admitted fact that the aggrieved party in Criminal Case
No. 449 is the aunt of respondent's wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, notwithstanding such relationship and the above-quoted prohibition,
respondent took cognizance of the case, conducted a preliminary examination,
issued a warrant of arrest by virtue of which complainant was detained and set
the case for hearing on February 12, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These actuations of respondent Judge opened to question his ability to
act with the cold neutrality of an impartial Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot, but censure him for these
acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His alleged effort to settle the
case amicably could, therefore, be a mere guise to per­suade the complainant to
leave the land in question, to favor the suffered aggrieved party in the
Criminal Case, with the added disadvantage on the part of complainant who was
then under detention.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that respondent judge subsequently inhibited himself
after it became evident that no possible amicable settlement could be reached
by the parties does not extenuate his culpability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judge has violated the salutary
norm that a judge should always strive to preserve judicial integrity and
discharge his task with deep concern to the cause of justice in accordance with
the legal norms, which is the manifestation of the rule above cited, of which
respondent counsel pretend ignorance of; otherwise such ignorance is
inexcusable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of Hurtado vs. Judalena and Judge Bonong,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1, Rule 137 of the Revised Rules of Court enumerates
without ambiguity the cases in which any judge or judicial officer is dis­qualified
from acting as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said section,
in no uncertain terms, expressly prohibits a judge or judicial officer from
sitting in a case where he is related to either party within the sixth degree
of consanguinity or affinity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
mandatory.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, it is not
denied that the respondent judge is the brother of the respondent Isabel G.
Judalena and their close relationship notwithstanding, and despite the
prohibition mentioned above, the respondent judge took cognizance of the case
and issued the contro­versial order directing the issuance of a writ of
preliminary injunction, after which he inhibited himself from sitting on the
case for the same reasons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such action,
to our mind, is reprehen­sible as it erodes the all important confidence in the
impartiality of the judiciary."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, respondent judge is
hereby REPRIMANDED with warning that a repetition of similar act will be dealt
with more severely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of this
decision be attached to his personal record.</p>
