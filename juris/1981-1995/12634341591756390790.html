<p class="BODY">On 15 November 1975, private respondents filed a motion to

the case on the ground that the plaintiff's cause of action, if any, is barred
by the statute of limitations because the application for Free Patent and the
Original Certificate of Title, copies of which are annexed to the complaint,
are dated 18 March 1974 and 6 May 1974, respectively -- more than ten (10)
years prior to the filing of the complaint.  It is contended that an action for annulment of title and/or
reconveyance of real property resulting from fraud must be filed within four
(4) years from the discovery of the fraud, pursuant to <i>Gerona vs. De Guzman</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

patents constitutes constructive notice to the whole world.  Accordingly, the four-year period during

alleging therein that (a) as clearly alleged in paragraph 11 of the complaint,
since the fraud was discovered in the early part of 1985, the four-year period
had not yet expired when the complaint was filed; (b) as alleged in paragraph
12 thereof, since private respondents are not the owners of the three-fourths
(3/4) portion of the parcel of land covered by both the Free Patent and
Original Certificate of Title, they do not have just title thereto; for
purposes of prescription, just title must be proved; there should then be a
hearing on the merits for them to prove just title; and (c) as also alleged in
said paragraph 12, the petitioner is in the open, public, adverse and exclusive
possession, in the concept of an owner, of the said three-fourths (3/4)
portion; private respondents could not have acquired ownership over the entire
lot.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

denying for lack of merit the motion to dismiss.  The denial is based on the principle that prescription does not
run against co-owners in a co-ownership.  The order states:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The plaintiff in opposition to the motion to dismiss argued
that the cases cited by the defendants are not applicable in the present
case.  First, the parties are
co-owners.  As a general rule
prescription does not lie between the parties.  Article 494, par. 5, New Civil Code provides:</blockquote>

shall run in favor of a co-owner or co-heir against his co-owners or co-heirs
so long as he expressly or impliedly recognizes the co-ownership<span style="">.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>To further buttress the legal basis for the denial by the court of
the motion to dismiss, plaintiff cited the case of Santos <span style="">vs. </span>Heirs of Crisostomo, 41 Phil. 342,
Bargayo versus Camunof (sic), 40 Phil. 857.  Three conditions must be present in order that a co-owner becomes an
exclusive owner of the others’ share by prescription.  These conditions are:  (1)
He <span style="">must </span>make known to the other
co-owners that <span style="">he </span>is definitely
repudiating the co-ownership and that he is claiming complete ownership over
the entire property; (2) The evidence of repudiation and knowledge on the part
of the others must be clear and convincing; and (3) Continuous, open, public,
adverse possession.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendants in their motion to dismiss never alleged that they
are in open, continuous, public and adverse possession of the property in
question as against the plaintiff.  Likewise, in their manifestation and motion dated July 14, 1986 after
they received the opposition to the motion to dismiss filed by the plaintiff
never (sic) denied their participation in the extra-­judicial participation
(sic), Annex "P" of the complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, it is clear that the doctrine laid down by the
Supreme Court in the cases of Balbin and Gerona (supra) <span style="">is </span>the general rule on prescription with respect to the four
years (sic) period to file action based on fraud <span style="">which </span>is not applicable to co-owners and co-heirs in the absence
of <span style="">the </span>three conditions laid
down in cases (sic) of Santos and Camunof (sic) (supra.)."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents filed a motion to set aside this order, <span style="">which the </span>trial court denied in its

contend that Article 494, </span>par. 5 of <span style="">the New Civil </span>Code is <span style="">not
applicable considering that there was an open repudiation </span>of <span style="">the </span>co-ownership by the defendants way
back on (sic) March 18, 1974 when they filed <span style="">an </span>application for free patent over the entire property.  This was further confirmed on May 6, 1974
when OCT NO. P-9345 was issued in the name of Leoncio Navarette married to

seeking the nullification and the setting aside of both the 1 September and 1
October 1986 orders of the trial court.  The petition was docketed as C.A.-G.R. SP No. 10389.  As grounds <span style="">therefor, they allege that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

promulgated on 27 July 1987, the respondent Court set aside the abovementioned
orders and directed the respondent trial judge to dismiss the complaint on the
principal ground that since the action is based on fraud, it should have been
filed within four (4) years from the issuance of the title on 6 May 1974.  Thus, it declared:</p>

<blockquote>"1. There is no
controversion from respondents against the petitioners’ assertion that on March
18, 1974, the late Leoncio Navarette (Maria Mendoza's late husband) filed an
application for Free Patent over the disputed property (Lot 668, Case I,
Paombong Cad. 297) and that on May 6, 1974 Original Certificate of Title No.
T-9345 was issued in the name of ‘Leoncio Navarette, married to Maria Mendoza,
xx xx xx.’ (p. 9, rec.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Eleven years after the issuance and registration of the above
title, the private respondent, Domingo <span style="">J.
</span>Mendoza, filed his above complaint, for the annulment of title and
partition of the above property.  The
title sought to be annulled was issued <u>May</u> <u>6,</u> <u><span style="">1974</span></u><span style=""> </span>(sic), while the complaint to annul the same and for partition
of the property covered by the said title, was filed <u>July</u> <u><span style="">24,</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>1985</u> (sic).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The titling of the property by the petitioners is denounced by the
private respondents as having been done ‘illegally, fraudulently and in evident
bad faith.’ (p. 37, rec.).  The action
for nullification of title and for partition of the property is based on
fraud.  The private respondent's theory
is that Article 494, paragraph 5 of the Civil Code of the Philippines contols
(sic) the situation.  Article 494 reads,
as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-align: center; text-indent: 0.9pt;" align="center">x x x</p>

<p class="2Q">'No prescription shall run in favor of a co-owner or co-heir
against his co-owners or co-heirs so long as he expressly or impliedly
recognizes the co-ownership.  (400a)'</p>

<blockquote>The private respondent's theory is without foundation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Prescription can, and thus, run (sic) against a co-owner,
particularly, where the property has been brought under the operation of the
Land Registration Act.  The Land
Registration Act declares the title over a registered land to be
incontrovertible.  (Sec. 38.  ‘Gerona, et al. vs. De Guzman, et al.,’ 11
SCRA 153, gives the reason why prescription can run against co-owner (sic)
where one of them asserts title against the former, x x x).</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is clear then that not having brought the action for partition
of the property within the reglementary period, the private respondents' cause
of action has been barred by prescription.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The ground for the dismissal of the private respondents' complaint
for annulment and partition is, therefore, indubitable and in line with
jurisprudence, must be dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The statute of limitations commenced to run against the private

same, and then obtained a certificate of title over the property on May 6,
1974.  From this date, which is a notice
<u>in</u> <u>rem</u> of the repudiation of the co-ownership among the parties,
by the petitioners, prescription commenced to run.  The private respondents had four years from May 6, 1974 within
which to file their action based on fraud.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

which they subsequently complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown earlier, the trial court denied the motion to dismiss
upon the theory that the general rule is that prescription does not run among
co-owners and that the requisites for the application of the exception thereto,
among which is the need for continuous, open, public and adverse possession of
the property on the part of the party who claims prescription, are not apparent
from a reading of the complaint; on the contrary, said complaint alleges that
the petitioner is in such possession over three-fourths (3/4) thereof.  Upon the other hand, respondent Court of
Appeal's exposition is premised on the assumption that the complaint is based
on fraud; therefore, the same should have been filed within four (4) years from
the issuance of the original certificate of title.  Anent the issue of prescription among co-owners, the respondent
Court ruled that the filing of the application for a Free Patent amounted to a
renunciation of the co-ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of prescription among co-owners is totally irrelevant;
hence, the discussions thereon by both courts are exercises in futility which
proceed from a misreading of the complaint.  Co-ownership is not at all involved in this case.  This is very clear from the allegations in
the complaint which unmistakably show that whatever co-ownership existed among
the heirs of Teodoro Mendoza over the estate he left behind was terminated on
11 April 1963 when said heirs executed the deed of extrajudicial settlement,
with private respondent Maria Mendoza Navarette waiving all her rights to the
said estate.  As a consequence thereof,
three-fourths (3/4) of the property was adjudicated to the petitioner while the
remaining one-fourth (¼) share went to the surviving spouse, Eugenia Aquino,
both of whom secured separate tax declarations for their respective lots.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint likewise suggests that the lot subject of the
application for a Free Patent by Leoncio Navarette is private land and the
three-fourths (3/4) portion thereof, which petitioner has been openly,
publicly, adversely and exclusively possessing in the concept of owner, was
included illegally, fraudulently and with evident bad faith by Leoncio in said
application as he is not the <u><span style="">real</span></u><span style=""> <u>owner</u> </span>of said portion.  Petitioner thus asks, <i>inter alia</i>, for
the annulment or cancellation of the original Certificate of Title over the lot
covered by the Free Patent.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What the lower court should have done then was to defer its
resolution on the motion to dismiss for the reason that the ground invoked
therein is not indubitable.  This is one
of the options a trial court may avail of whenever confronted with a motion to
dismiss.  The other options are (a) to
grant the motion, (b) to deny it, and (c) to allow the amendment of the
pleading.  Section 3, Rule 16 of the
Rules of Court provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 3.  <i>Hearing
and order</i>. -- <span style="">After </span><span style="">hearing the court may deny or grant the
motion or allow amendment of pleading, or may defer the hearing and
determination </span><span style="">of<b> </b></span><span style="">the motion until the trial if the ground
alleged therein does not appear to be indubitable."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, the end result was the same -- private
respondents failed in their attempt to obtain a dismissal of the case.  But whether such a rebuff resulted from an
outright denial or a mere deferment, respondent Court of Appeals should have
rejected private respondents' petition for <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>because
the trial court committed no grave abuse of discretion in aborting and
frustrating the latter's move.  Such
petition merely formed part of a dilatory strategy which cleverly incorporated <i><u>res</u>
<u>judicata</u></i> and <u>lack</u> <u>of</u> <u>cause</u> <u>of</u> <u>action</u>
as additional grounds for the dismissal of the complaint.  The latter, however, is based on the
argument that since prescription has set in, petitioner cannot have a valid
cause of action.  As grounds for a
motion to dismiss or as<span style=""> </span>affirmative
defenses, prescription and lack of cause of action are distinct and separate
concepts.  Since <i><span style="">res </span></i><i><span style="">judicata</span></i><span style=""> </span>was
not invoked in the motion to dismiss, it is deemed waived pursuant to Section
2, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The averments in the complaint to the effect that (a) the lot in
question being private land originally inherited from Teodoro Mendoza and
subsequently adjudicated among his heirs by the deed of extrajudicial
settlement, it cannot be awarded to Leoncio Navarette by Free Patent, (b)
petitioner is in open, public, adverse and exclusive possession of the
three-fourths (3/4) portion adjudicated to him and (c) said three-fourths (3/4)
portion was included illegally, fraudulently and in bad faith by Leoncio
Navarette in his application for a Free Patent because he and his wife, private
respondent Maria, knew all along that petitioner is the owner and actual
possessor thereof, were deemed hypothetically admitted by private respondents
for purposes of the motion to dismiss.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Granting <i>ex </i><i><span style="">gratia</span></i><span style=""> </span>that the above theory of petitioner
embodied in the first averment is correct and he can thus support it with
evidence -- which would necessarily call for a trial on the merits -- the Free
Patent issued to Leoncio Navarette would be void as to petitioner's property
which, as he had also alleged in the complaint, is possessed by him openly,
publicly, adversely and exclusively in the concept of owner.  Thus, he can recover it even beyond the
expiration ten <span style="">(10) years </span>after
the issuance of <span style="">the Original
Certificate of Title based on the Free Patent.  A Free Patent issued over a private land </span>is <span style="">null and void.  In the 1952 case </span>of <i><span style="">Vital </span>vs. Anore</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court, speaking thru Mr. Justice Sabino Padilla, held:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Whether a Torrens title, based on a free patent granted by
the Government under the provisions of the Public Land Act (Act 2874) and
issued under the provisions of the Land Registration Act (Act 496), has the
validity and effect of a Torrens title issued as a result of judicial
proceedings need not be passed upon.  The rule laid down in Ramoso vs. Obligado et al., 70 Phil. 86, that ‘a
homestead patent, once registered under the Registration Act, becomes as
indefeasible as a Torrens Title, x x x’ is only true and correct if the parcel
of agricultural land patented or granted as homestead by the Government, after
the requirements of the law had been complied with, was a part of the public
domain.  If it was not but a private
land, the patent granted and the Torrens title issued upon the patent or
homestead grant are a nullity.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>A Torrens title issued upon <span style="">a
</span>free patent may not be cancelled after the lapse of ten years from the date
of its registration because the statute of limitations bars such
cancellation.  But if the registered
owner, be he the patentee or his successor-in-interest to whom the free patent
was transferred or conveyed, knew that the parcel of land described in the
patent and in the Torrens title belonged to another who together with his
predecessors-in-interest has been in possession thereof, and if the patentee
and his successor-in-interest were never in possession thereof, then the
statute barring an action to cancel a Torrens title issued upon a free patent
does not apply, and the true owner may bring an action to have the ownership or
title to the land judicially settled, and if the allegations of the plaintiff
that he is the <span style="">t</span>rue owner of the
parcel of land granted as free patent and described in the Torrens title and
that the defendant and his predecessor-in-interest were never in possession of
the parcel of land and knew that the plaintiff and his predecessors­-in-interest
have been in possession thereof be established, then the court in the exercise
of its equity jurisdiction, without ordering the cancellation of the Torrens
title issued upon the patent, may direct the defendant, the registered owner,
to reconvey the parcel of land to the plaintiff who has been found to be the
true owner thereof.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The plaintiff in this case avers that he and his
predecessors-in-interest have been in possession of the parcel of land from
time immemorial to the date of the filing of the complaint; that the patentee,
from whom the defendant Francisco Anore derived his title, had never been in
possession of the parcel of land granted to him as free patent; and that the
defendant Francisco Anore knew that his predecessor-in-interest had never been
in possession of the parcel of land.  If
the averments be established, the defendant, as successor-in-interest of the
patentee, could not claim to be a purchaser in good faith and for value to
protect his title to the parcel of land acquired by him from the patentee.  Justice and equity require that he should
reconvey the parcel of land to the plaintiff.  The prayer of the plaintiff in his complaint that he be declared the
owner of the parcel of land described in the transfer certificate of title issued
in the name of the defendant Francisco Anore, which had been granted as free
patent to the late Ambrosio Arabit, together with the general prayer that he be
granted such further relief and remedy as equity and justice warrant, would
justify a judgment directing the defendant to reconvey the parcel of land to
the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The statute <span style="">of </span>limitations
which would bar an action by the plaintiff could not be availed of by the
defendant, because a motion for dismissal being an admission of all the
material allegations of the plaintiff's complaint -- the same role a demurrer
in the old Code of Civil Procedure, Act 190, played <span style="">in </span>judicial proceedings -- the plaintiff's allegation that the
defendant and his predecessor-in-interest have never been in possession of the
parcel of land and knew that the plaintiff and his predecessors-in-interest
have been <span style="">in </span>possession thereof
since time immemorial is deemed admitted.  If at the trial the defendant should prove that he and his
predecessor-in-interest have been in possession of the parcel of land for 10
years or more, then the plaintiff's cause of action would be groundless and the
complaint would have to be dismissed.  The admitted allegations of the complaint <span style="">constitute a cause </span>of action."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Then, in the fairly recent case of <i><span style="">Agne </span></i>vs. <i>Director of Lands</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court, per Mr. Justice Florenz D. Regalado, ruled:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We reiterate that private ownership of land is not affected
by the issuance of a free patent over the same land because the Public Land Act
applies only to lands of the public domain.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> Only
public land may be disposed of by the Director of Lands.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Since as early as 1920, the land in dispute was already under the private
ownership of herein petitioners and no longer a part of the lands of the public
domain, the same could not have been the subject matter of a free patent.  The patentee and his successors in interest
acquired no right or title to the said land.  Necessarily, Free Patent No. 23263 issued to Herminigildo Agpoon is null
and void and the subsequent titles issued pursuant thereto cannot become final
and indefeasible.  Hence, we ruled in <i>Director
of Lands vs. Sisican, et al</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> that
if at the time the free patents were issued in 1953 the land covered therein
were (sic) already private property of another and, therefore, not part of the
disposable land of the public domain, then applicants-patentees acquired no
right or title to the land.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Now, a certificate of title fraudulently secured is null and void <i>ab
initio</i> if the fraud consisted in misrepresenting that the land is part of
the public domain, although it is not.  As earlier stated, the nullity arises, not from the fraud or deceit but,
from the fact that the land is not under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of
Lands.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Being null and void, the free patent granted and the subsequent titles produce
no legal effects whatsoever <i>Quod nullum est, nullum producit effectum</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>A free patent which purports to convey land to which the Government
did not have any title at the time of its issuance does not vest any title in
the patentee as against the true owner.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> The
Court has previously held that the Land Registration Act and the Cadastral Act
do not give anybody who resorts to the provisions thereof a better title than
what he really and lawfully has.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘x x x The Land Registration Act as well as the Cadastral Act protects
only the holders of a title in good faith and does not permit its provisions to
be used as a shield for the commission of fraud, or that one should enrich
himself at the expense of another (Gustilo vs. Maravilla, 48 Phil. 838).  The above-stated Acts do not give anybody,
who resorts to the provisions thereof, a better title than he really and
lawfully has.  If he happened to obtain
it by mistake or to secure, to the prejudice of his neighbor, more land than he
really owns, with or without bad faith on his part, the certificate of title,
which may have been issued to him under the circumstances, may and should be
cancelled or corrected (Legarda and Prieto vs. Saleeby, 31 Phil. 590).  <span style="">x x </span><span style="">x.’</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>We have, therefore, to arrive at the unavoidable conclusion that
the title of herein petitioners over the land in dispute is superior to the
title of the registered owner which is a total nullity.  The long and continued possession of
petitioners under <span style="">a </span>valid claim
of title cannot be defeated by the claim of a registered owner whose title <span style="">is </span>defective from the beginning.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The quality of conclusiveness of a Torrens title is not available
for use to perpetrate fraud and chicanery.  To paraphrase from <i><span style="">Angeles
vs. Samia, supra</span></i><span style="">, </span>the
Land Registration Act does not create or vest title.  It only confirms and records title already existing and
vested.  It does not protect a usurper
from the true owner.  It cannot be a
shield for the commission of fraud.  It
does not permit one to enrich himself at the expense of another.  Stated elsewise, the Torrens system was not
established as <span style="">a </span>means for the
acquisition of title to private land.  It is intended merely to confirm <span style="">and
</span>register the title which one may already have on the land.  Where the applicant possesses no title or

<p class="BODY">Besides, the petitioner's open, public, adverse and <span style="">exclusive p</span>ossession of the
three-fourths (3/4) portion of the property and its illegal inclusion in the
Free Patent and Original Certificate of Title issued to Leoncio Navarette give
the former a cause of action for quieting of title, which is imprescriptible in
favor of a person in possession of the property.  The allegations in his complaint before the trial court are sufficient
for such a cause of action.  In <i>Caragay-Layno

the settled jurisprudence that an action to quiet title to property in one's
possession is imprescriptible.  Their
undisturbed possession over a period of more than 25 years gave them a
continuing right to seek the aid of a court of equity to determine the nature
of the adverse claim of a third party and the effect of his own title.  If at all, the private respondents’ right to
quiet title, to seek reconveyance and to annul Transfer Certificate of Title
No. T-75543 accrued only in 1975 when they were made aware of a claim adverse
to their own.  It was only at that time
that the statutory period of prescription may be said to have commenced to run
against them.  (Sapto et al. v. Fabiana,
