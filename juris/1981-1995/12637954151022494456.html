				<BR><BR><p align="justify">This appeal, which was certified to the Court by the Court of 
Appeals as involving only questions of law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> relates to a claim for loss and/or damage 
to a shipment of machine parts sought to be enforced by the consignee, appellant 
Dole Philippines, Inc. (hereinafter called Dole) against the carrier, Maritime 
Company of the Philippines (hereinafter called Maritime), under the provisions 
of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The basic facts are succinctly 
stated in the order of the Trial Court <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> dated March 16, 1977, the relevant portion 
of which reads:<br></p>

<p><br>Before the plaintiff started presenting evidence at today's trial, at the 
instance of the Court the lawyers entered into the following stipulation of 
facts:</p>
<ol><li>The cargo subject of the instant case was discharged in Dadiangas unto the 
custody of the consignee on December 18, 1971;<br><br></li><li>
<div align="justify">The corresponding claim for the damages sustained by the 
cargo was filed by the plaintiff with the defendant vessel on May 4, 
1972;<br><br></div></li><li>
<div align="justify">On June 11, 1973 the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Court 
of First Instance of Manila, docketed therein as Civil Case No. 91043, embodying 
three (3) causes of action involving three (3) separate and different 
shipments.&nbsp; The third cause of action therein involved the cargo now subject of 
this present litigation;"<br><br></div></li><li>
<div align="justify">On December 11, 1974, Judge Serafin Cuevas issued an Order in 
Civil Case No. 91043 dismissing the first two causes of action in the aforesaid 
case with prejudice and without pronouncement as to costs because the parties 
had settled or compromised the claims involved therein.&nbsp; The third cause of 
action which covered the cargo subject of this case now was likewise dismissed 
but without prejudice as it was not covered by the settlement.&nbsp; The dismissal of 
that complaint containing the three causes of action was upon a joint motion to 
dismiss filed by the parties;<br><br></div></li><li>
<div align="justify">Because of the dismissal of the complaint in Civil Case No. 
91043 with respect to the third cause of action without prejudice, plaintiff 
instituted this present complaint on January 6, 1975.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p align="justify"><br>To the complaint in the subsequent action Maritime filed an 
answer pleading <em>inter alia</em> the affirmative defense of prescription 
under the provisions of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> and following pre-trial, moved for a 
preliminary hearing on said defense.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
The Trial Court granted the motion, scheduling the preliminary hearing on April 
27, 1977.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The record before the Court 
does not show whether or not that hearing was held, but under date of May 6, 
1977, Maritime filed a formal motion to dismiss invoking once more the ground of 
prescription.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> The motion was opposed 
by Dole<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> and the Trial Court, after due 
consideration, resolved the matter in favor of Maritime and dismissed the 
complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Dole sought a 
reconsideration, which was denied,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
and thereafter took the present appeal from the order of dismissal.<br><br>The 
pivotal issue is whether or not Article 1155 of the Civil Code providing that 
the prescription of actions is interrupted by the making of an extrajudicial 
written demand by the creditor is applicable to actions brought under the 
Carriage of Goods by Sea Act which, in its Section 3, paragraph 6, provides 
that:</p>
<div align="justify">
<blockquote>
<p>"*** the carrier and the ship shall be discharged from all liability in 
respect of loss or damage unless suit is brought within one year after delivery 
of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered; 
<em>Provided</em>, That, if a notice of loss or damage, either apparent or 
conceded, is not given as provided for in this section, that fact shall not 
affect or prejudice the right of the shipper to bring suit within one year after 
the delivery of the goods or the date when the goods should have been delivered.

<p align="justify">Dole concedes that its action is subject to the one-year period 
of limitation prescribed in the above-cited provision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> The substance of its argument is that 
since the provisions of the Civil Code are, by express mandate of said Code, 
suppletory of deficiencies in the Code of Commerce and special laws in matters 
governed by the latter,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> and there 
being "*** a patent deficiency *** with respect to the tolling of the 
prescriptive period ***" provided for in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> prescription under said Act is subject to 
the provisions of Article 1155 of the Civil Code on tolling; and because Dole's 
claim for loss or damage made on May 4, 1972 amounted to a written extrajudicial 
demand which would toll or interrupt prescription under Article 1155, it 
operated to toll prescription also in actions under the Carriage of Goods by Sea 
Act.&nbsp; To much the same effect is the further argument based on Article 1176 of 
the Civil Code which provides that the rights and obligations of common carriers 
shall be governed by the Code of Commerce and by special laws in all matters not 
regulated by the Civil Code.<br><br>These arguments might merit weightier 
consideration were it not for the fact that the question has already received a 
definitive answer, adverse to the position taken by Dole, in <em>The Yek Tong 
Lin Fire &amp; Marine Insurance Co., Ltd. vs. American President Lines, 
Inc.</em><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> There, in a parallel 
factual situation, where suit to recover for damage to cargo shipped by vessel 
from Tokyo to Manila was filed more than two years after the consignee's receipt 
of the cargo, this Court rejected the contention that an extrajudicial demand 
tolled the prescriptive period provided for in the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, 
viz:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"In the second assignment of error plaintiff-appellant argues 
that it was error for the court <em>a quo</em> not to have considered the action 
of plaintiff-appellant suspended by the extrajudicial demand which took place, 
according to defendant's own motion to dismiss, on August 22, 1952.&nbsp; We notice 
that while plaintiff avoids stating any date when the goods arrived in Manila, 
it relies upon the allegation made in the motion to dismiss that a protest was 
filed on August 22, 1952 -- which goes to show that plaintiff-appellant's 
counsel has not been laying the facts squarely before the court for the 
consideration of the merits of the case.&nbsp; We have already decided that in a case 
governed by the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act, the general provisions of the Code 
of Civil Procedure on prescription should not be made to apply.&nbsp; (<em>Chua Kuy 
vs. Everett Steamship Corp.</em>, G.R. No. L-5554, May 27, 1953.) Similarly, we 
now hold that in such a case the general provisions of the new Civil Code (Art. 
1155) cannot be made to apply, as such application would have the effect of 
extending the one-year period of prescription fixed in the law.&nbsp; It is desirable 
that matters affecting transportation of goods by sea be decided in as short a 
time as possible; the application of the provisions of Article 1155 of the new 
Civil Code would unnecessarily extend the period and permit delays in the 
settlement of questions affecting transportation, contrary to the clear intent 
and purpose of the law.&nbsp; ***"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Moreover, no different result would obtain even if the Court 
were to accept the proposition that a written extrajudicial demand does toll 
prescription under the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.&nbsp; The demand in this 
instance would be the claim for damage filed by Dole with Maritime on May 4, 
1972.&nbsp; The effect of that demand would have been to renew the one-year 
prescriptive period from the date of its making.&nbsp; Stated otherwise, under Dole's 
theory, when its claim was received by Maritime, the one-year prescriptive 
period was interrupted â€” "tolled" would be the more precise term â€” and began to 
run anew from May 4, 1972, affording Dole another period of one (1) year counted 
from that date within which to institute action on its claim for damage.&nbsp; 
Unfortunately, Dole let the new period lapse without filing action.&nbsp; It 
instituted Civil Case No. 91043 only on June 11, 1973, more than one month after 
that period had expired and its right of action had prescribed.<br><br>Dole's 
contention that the prescriptive period "*** remained tolled as of May 4, 1972 
*** (and that) in legal contemplation *** (the) case (Civil Case No. 96353) was 
filed on January 6, 1975 *** well within the one-year prescriptive period in 
Sec. 3(6) of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> equates tolling with indefinite 
suspension.&nbsp; It is clearly fallacious and merits no 
consideration.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the order of dismissal 
appealed from is affirmed, with costs against the appellant, Dole Philippines, 
Inc.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.</p>
