</span>In the said reinsurance agreement, the petitioners and respondent
expressly agreed to settle by arbitration all their differences of whatever
nature or controversy arising out of the contract, which agreement is embodied
in Article XII of the reinsurance agreement which reads:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'In the event of any dispute at any time arising out of or in any
way connected with or relating to this Agreement, whether before or after the
termination of notice under the Agreement the same shall be referred to the
decision of two arbitrators one to be appointed in writing by the London
Manager of the Union Insurance Society of Canton, Limited, and the other by the
<span class="SpellE">Reinsurer</span> or in case of disagreement between the
Arbitrators to the decision of an Umpire to be appointed in writing by the
Arbitrators before entering upon the reference and it shall be a condition
precedent that unless and until an award <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">has
</span>been made neither party shall have any right of action against the
other.</p>

<p class="2Q">'If either party refuse or neglect to nominate an Arbitrator within
thirty days after being required so to do or should the two Arbitrators have
failed to appoint an Umpire within thirty days, any appointments so failing to
be made shall be left to the choice of the Chairman for the time being of the Fire
Offices' Committee, London.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘The Arbitrators and Umpire will not have to undergo any judicial
formalities and may abstain from following the strict rules of law.</p>

the respondent as <span class="SpellE">reinsurer</span> the sum of E4<span class="GramE">,784.5.1</span> which respondent should pay to the petitioners in
pounds sterling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, while
petitioners requested the respondent to pay the aforesaid sum in pounds
sterling or in Philippine pesos at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of
payment so that the amount of Philippine pesos to be paid by the respondent
will purchase the amount of E4<span class="GramE">,784.5.1</span> in which said
obligation is payable, respondent refused to pay in pounds sterling and
insisted that it should <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pay </span>the
said amount in Philippine pesos at the old official exchange rate of P2.015 to
$1.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of the respondent's

controversy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in</span> the manner
provided for in the reinsurance agreement, which demand was received by the
respondent on <st1:date year="1966" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1966</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the said communication the petitioners

for arbitration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
the filing of this case.</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the parties provides in Article XII thereof the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'All differences of whatever nature arising out of this Agreement
shall be settled according to an equitable rather than a strictly legal
interpretation of its provisions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
differences shall be submitted to a Court of Arbitration in London composed of
two independent Fire <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Insurance experts

party shall select one and of an Umpire to be chosen by the Arbitrators prior

four weeks of the decision to refer the difference to arbitration or if the
Arbitrators do not agree upon the choice of their Umpire within four weeks of
their nomination such Arbitrator or Umpire respectively shall at the request of
either party be appointed by the Chairman for the time being of the Fire
Offices' Committee, London.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The crux of the controversy boils down to
whether or not a controversy or dispute exists under the circumstances to
warrant an order compelling the parties to submit to arbitration.</p>

<p class="BODY">A cursory reading of the petitions (complaints) in the trial
court and the answers thereto will readily reveal that indeed, a valid
controversy existed between the <span class="GramE">parties, which is</span> a
proper subject for arbitration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two
(2) civil cases brought by herein respondents alleged that there was still some
amount payable in pounds sterling due to it from the herein petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This allegation was denied by petitioner in
its answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's defenses in the
trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">were </span>anchored on
three (3) grounds, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) that there
was a previous agreement between the parties that beginning January 1, 1959,
the balance under the agreement will be made payable in US dollars; 2) that the
provision to refer to arbitration any dispute arising from the reinsurance and
the retrocession agreements can no longer be enforced five (5) years after the
termination of both agreements; and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">3) </span>as
a special alternative defense, that it was in fact the private respondents who
owe the petitioner some amount.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since it
was not disputed that in both the First Surplus Reinsurance Agreement and the
Retrocession Quota Share Fire Pool Agreement the parties had agreed that any
dispute arising from these agreements shall be referred to a set of
arbitrators, the trial court correctly ordered the parties to submit to
arbitration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by the trial
court:</p>

<blockquote>"It will be seen from the pleadings of the parties that the
only and principal issue to be decided by the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">is </span>whether or not there is a controversy or dispute between the
petitioners and the respondent under their reinsurance agreement in Civil Case
No. 68558 and in their retrocession agreement in Civil Case No. 68559 which
controversy or dispute was subject to arbitration under their agreements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>One</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>special</u>
<u>defenses</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><u>the</u> <u>respondent</u> <u>is</u>
<u>that</u> <u>the</u> <u>respondent</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>owe</u> <u>any</u>
<u>amount</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>petitioners</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as the court is not called upon to determine
the merits of the claim of the petitioners, this special defense of the
respondent is immaterial for the purpose of this decision." (p. 56, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>; emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>We hold therefore, that as
regards the dispute on the amount the parties owe each other, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">same </span>is a proper subject of
arbitration.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an attempt to exclude this case from the coverage of their
arbitration agreement, petitioner belatedly invoked R.A. 529 as a defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It contended that the agreement to pay in
pounds sterling cannot be legally enforced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Republic Act 529 declares as against public <span class="GramE">policy,</span>
and null and void, provisions in agreements which "purport(s) to give the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>right
to require payment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>gold or in
a particular kind of coin or currency other than Philippine Currency or in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>amount of money in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
measured thereby." Thus, petitioner continues that the agreement to pay in
pounds sterling can be considered as not in existence at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was then nothing to arbitrate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, while petitioner seeks to evade its
obligation to pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>pounds
sterling as being contrary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to public
policy, it manifested its willingness to pay in another foreign currency, U.S.
dollars.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As
already stated, petitioner's invocation of R.A. 529 as a defense was raised for
the first time only in its memorandum.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a basic rule in procedure
that defenses and objections not pleaded either in a motion to dismiss or in
the answer are deemed waived, the only exceptions recognized under the rule
being:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) a failure to state a cause of
action; and 2) lack of jurisdiction (Sec. 2, Rule 9, <span class="GramE">Rules</span>
of Court).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>It was held, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, if the obligation was incurred <u>prior</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u>
<u>enactment</u> of the Act (R.A. 529) and require payment in a particular kind

currency measured at the prevailing <u>rate</u> <u>of</u> <u>exchange</u> <u>at</u>
<u>the</u> <u>time</u> <u>the</u> <u>obligation</u> <u>was</u> <u>incurred</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> have adverted
to, Republic Act 529 was enacted on <st1:date year="1950" day="16" month="6">June
 16, 1950</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case now
before <span class="GramE">Us</span>, the obligation of appellant to pay <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> the 20% of $140,000.00, or the sum of $28,000.00,
accrued on <st1:date year="1961" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1961</st1:date>,
or after the enactment of Republic act 529.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that the provision of Republic Act which requires payment at
the prevailing rate of exchange when the obligation was incurred cannot be
applied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Republic Act 529 does not
provide for the rate of exchange <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>the
payment of obligation incurred after the enactment of the said Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The logical conclusion, therefore, is that
the rate of exchange should be that prevailing at the time of payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This view finds support in the ruling of this
court in the case of Engel vs. Velasco &amp; Co. where this court held that
even if the obligation assumed by the defendant was to pay the plaintiff a sum
of money expressed in American currency, the indemnity to be allowed should be
expressed in Philippine currency at the rate of exchange at the time of
judgment rather than at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of
defendant's breach.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is also the ruling
of American courts, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The value in domestic money of a payment made in foreign money is
fixed with respect to the rate of exchange at the time of payment.' (70 C.J.S.,
p. 228)</p>

<p class="2Q">'According to the weight of authority the amount of recovery depends
upon the current rate of exchange, and not the par value of the particular
money involved (48 C.J.S., 605-606.'</p>

<p class="2Q">'The value in domestic money of a payment made in foreign money is
fixed in reference to the rate of exchange at the time of such payment.' (48
C.J.S., 605)<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the obligation was incurred between the years
1958-1961, or after the enactment of R.A. 529 (June 16, 1950).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the rate of exchange shall be that
prevailing at the time of payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioner, while admitting the existence of the
provision to refer to arbitration any dispute or controversy arising from the
reinsurance and the retrocession agreements, likewise contended that said
provision can no longer be enforced five (5) years after the termination of
both contracts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">on </span>December 31,

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the retrocession agreement is also clear that
