<p class="BODY">In the present appeal, appellant raises a single assignment of
error:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the prosecution had failed
to prove <span style="">his </span><span style="">guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence submitted by the prosecution tended to <span style="">prove the following set of facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For many years prior to the commission of the crime, appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Munda</span> lived with <span style="">his </span><span style="">common-law wife, </span><span style="">Maria <span class="SpellE">Mirabete</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldon</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Aldon</span>, the complainant,
who is a daughter of Maria by another man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In June of 1982, Maria gave birth to a baby girl, a child of the
appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Every Sunday, Maria <span class="SpellE">Mirabete</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldon</span> and her daughter <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> would
go to the market place of <span class="SpellE">Jovellar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, to sell abaca fiber.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They would usually leave the house before <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4:00
 o'clock a.m.</st1:time> in order to reach the market place before sunrise.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
On the third Sunday of July 1983, however, <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> was
ordered by the appellant to stay home in order to mind her baby
half-sister.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On that particular Sunday, <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> was still asleep when her mother left for the
market.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juvy</span>
was suddenly awakened by a heavy weight pressing on her body and found
appellant on top of her, seeking to copulate with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She struggled to free herself from
appellant's embrace, but to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant scolded the victim, got hold of her buttocks and forcibly
inserted his male organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After appellant
had gratified his sexual desires, he threatened to cut off <span class="SpellE">Juvy's</span>
head if she reported the incident to her mother.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">About a week later, <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> gathered
enough courage to report to her mother what appellant had done.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria confronted the appellant who readily
admitted having sexually taken <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> but asked for
Maria's forgiveness and for a chance <span style="">to </span>reform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant apparently did not
"reform" for he shortly thereafter slapped <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span>,
allegedly for getting two (2) coconuts from a pile which had been separated and
designated for seedlings, and quarreled with and boxed and slapped Maria,
too.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria then reported the matter to
her uncle, one Santos <span class="SpellE">Mirabete</span>, who in turn brought
on <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="8">1 August 1983</st1:date>, to the
attention of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain of <span class="SpellE">Quitinday</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jovellar</span>, the rape of <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Both parties -- the appellant and <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> accompanied by
Maria -- were summoned to the house of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain and there an investigation was conducted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="8">12<span style=""> </span>August
 1983</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> was brought to Dr. Eduardo
Martinez for physical examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
the physical examination, Dr. Martinez issued a medical certificate stating the
following:</p>

<blockquote>"External Genitalia:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No physical injuries</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hymen:<span style=""> </span>Healed laceration at 3, 5, <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8 o'clock</st1:time> position</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the defense, upon the other hand, consisted
principally of the testimonies of appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Munda</span>; of his sister-in-law, Socorro <span class="SpellE">Munda</span>, who had allegedly gone with Maria to the market on
the Sunday that appellant had raped <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldon</span>; <span style="">his </span>nephew,
Charlie <span class="SpellE">Munda</span>; and his daughter, <span class="SpellE">Emmalyn</span>
<span class="SpellE">Munda-Guiriba</span>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his testimony, appellant claims he could not have <span style="">possibly </span>raped <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aldon</span> on that Sunday, in July<span style=""> </span>1983, since <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> had on that day
accompanied her mother Maria and his sister-in-law, Socorro <span class="SpellE">Munda</span>,
to the <span class="SpellE">Jovellar</span> market place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant contended that Maria had accused
him of raping <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> because the appellant had mauled
and slapped Maria around on two (2) occasions:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>first, when he tried to bring to Maria's attention <span class="SpellE">Juvy's</span>
alleged sexual affairs with two (2) men, which offended Maria no end; second,
when Maria <span class="SpellE">interferred</span> while he, the appellant, was
disciplining <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his Brief,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
appellant in effect suggests that <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> had accepted
and cooperated with him when he had sexually embraced her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He points to the fact that the physical
examination had not shown any scratches or contusions or abrasions on <span class="SpellE">Juvy's</span> body and that <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> had not
stated that she had bled during or immediately after the forced <span style="">coitus </span>with appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's </span>story
did not <span style="">impress </span>the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court said in its
decision:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<blockquote>The Court has observed the sincerity and candor of the offended
girl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like her mother, she is so
dominated by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nobody knew
that she was ravished by the common-law-husband of her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She does not have to tell her mother and <span style="">to </span>have her private parts examined and
face the wrath of the common-law-husband of her mother and the rigors and
perversion of a public trial if it were not for her desire to have the culprit
apprehended and punished.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>No young <span style="">Filipina </span>of rural breeding, for a silly reason of having been
punished for getting two (2) coconuts, would publicly admit she had been
criminally abused by the very common-law-husband of her mother, unless that is
the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For it is her natural
instinct to protect her honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In a desperate attempt to destroy the veracity of the testimony of
the complainant, the accused tried to show that <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span>,
in her tender age, is unchaste, flirting and going with male companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This part of the story of the defense is not
only fantastic but also ridiculous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> in her youth would not have known the meaning of
[such] amorous adventures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On a charge
of rape, the fact that, even if true, the offended party may have been of
unchaste character, is no defense."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Having gone over the record of this case,
we must agree with the appraisal of the trial court of appellant's
defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Like the trial court, we find
it very difficult to believe that <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldon</span>, no more than 12 or 13 years of age, had cooperated
with and accepted the sexual attentions of appellant, a man 49-years old,
co-habiting with her mother and living in the same house with her mother and
herself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that no physical
injuries were found on <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldon's</span>
body does not show that force or intimidation had not been exercised upon her, <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> had in fact testified that she had struggled against
the appellant when he commenced to force himself upon her:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now,
what did you do when he was trying to insert his organ into your organ?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>I tried to free myself but I could not
because he scolded me.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Why were you trying to struggle?<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>To be able to get away.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were you able to get away?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why were you not able to get away?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He <u>exerted force on me</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In what way?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>He took hold of my side</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After he has inserted his organ into your
organs (sic), what did <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After I was able to get up <u>he threatened
me that if I report to my mother he would cut off my head</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The absence of signs of physical injury
is moreover explained by the psychological ascendancy or dominance that
appellant obviously exercised over both the victim and her mother, as well as
by the dire threats which <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> testified had been
made by appellant immediately after the forced coition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, contrary to appellant's contention,
the fact that the victim <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> may have failed
specifically to state that she had bled during or after the forced coitus, does
not show <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> or lack of resistance on her
part against the sexual embraces of appellant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Juvy</span></span><span style=""> did not fail to refer to the pain inflicted
on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her sworn statement before
the Municipal Circuit Judge, she stated that she was badly hurt when the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> male member had penetrated her.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also sought to make much of the fact that the <span style="">victim </span><span class="SpellE">Juvy</span>
let a week go by before she told her mother that she had been raped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A delay of a week, under the circums<span style="">tances of this case, does not show that no
rape had really</span> occurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
relevant circumstances certainly include the fear that appellant must have
instilled in the mind of <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> and by the constant
presence of the appellant in the house where appellant and Maria and <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> lived together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As noted by this Court in <u>People v. <span class="SpellE">Oydoc</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and in <u>People v.</u><u><span style=""> Cruz</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "it is not uncommon for young girls to
conceal for some time the assault on their virtue because of the rapist's
threat on their lives, more so, when the rapist is the child's own stepfather
living with her".</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant points to the results of <span class="SpellE">Juvy's</span>
physical examination which indicated the presence of healed lacerations on her
hymen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant claims in his Brief
that according to the examining physician, these "healed old
lacerations" were "about 3 months or a year old at the time of the
examination".<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
What the examining physician did in fact say on cross-examination was simply
this:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
you say that the lacerations of the hymen was (sic) already healed and it (sic)
is already old, could you tell us whether it (sic) was a few weeks old or a few
months old?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
cannot exactly tell, what I can say is that it could be more than one (1) week,
Sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It should be recalled that the victim
submitted herself to physical examination two (2) weeks after the rape had been
committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the testimonies of the other witnesses of the defense,
witness Socorro <span class="SpellE">Munda</span> testified that <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> had gone with her to the market place on all the four
(4) Sundays of July 1983, but that Maria had stayed home having just given
birth to a child of the appellant in mid July 1983.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Charlie <span class="SpellE">Munda</span> casually testified that
he had seen <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> one afternoon embracing an
unidentified man in a bamboo grove.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For her part, <span class="SpellE">Emmalyn</span> <span class="SpellE">Munda-Guiriba</span> stated <span style="">that

father, the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She slept there

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not find the above testimony of the defense
witnesses persuasive:</p>

<blockquote>"The testimonies of the witnesses presented by the accused,

can not be given any <span class="SpellE">credance</span> (sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The story of the accused that he could not
have raped <span class="SpellE">Juvy</span> because she was with her mother to
