<p class="BODY">When she went to these companies to collect on what she thought
were still unpaid accounts, she was informed of the issuance of the
above-listed crossed checks.   Further
inquiry revealed that the said checks had been deposited with the Associated
Bank (hereinafter, “the Bank.”) and subsequently paid by it to one Rafael
Sayson, one of its “trusted depositors,” in the words of its branch manager and
co-petitioner, Conrado Cruz.  Sayson had
not been authorized by the private respondent to deposit and encash the said
checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent sued the petitioners in the Regional Trial
Court of Quezon City for recovery of the total value of the checks plus
damages.  After trial, judgment was
rendered requiring them to pay the private respondent the total value of the
subject checks in the amount of P15,805.00 plus 12% interest, P50,000.00 actual
damages, P25,000.00 exemplary damages, P5,000.00 attorney's fees, and the costs
of the suit. <a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners appealed to the respondent court, reiterating
their argument that the private respondent had no cause of action against them
and should have proceeded instead against the companies that issued the
checks.  In disposing of this
contention, the Court of Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
said:</p>

<blockquote>The cause of action of the appellee in the case at bar arose from
the illegal, anomalous and irregular acts of the appellants in violating common
banking practices to the damage and prejudice of the appellees, in allowing to
be deposited and encashed as well as paying to improper parties without the
knowledge, consent, authority or endorsement of the appellee which totalled
P15,805.00, the six (6) checks in dispute which were “crossed checks” or “for
payee's account only,” the appellee being the payee.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The three (3) elements of a cause of action are present in the case
at bar, namely:  (1) a right in favor of
the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is created;
(2) an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect or not to
violate such right; and (3) an act or omission on the part of such defendant
violative of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach thereof.  (Republic Planters Bank <i>vs</i>.
Intermediate Appellate Court, 131 SCRA 631).</blockquote>

<blockquote>And such cause of action has been proved by evidence of great
weight.  The contents of the said checks
issued by the customers of the appellee had not been questioned.  There is no dispute that the same are
crossed checks or for payee's account only, which is Melissa's RTW.  The appellee had clearly shown that she had
never authorized anyone to deposit the said checks nor to encash the same; that
the appellants had allowed all said checks to be deposited, cleared and paid to
one Rafael Sayson in violation of the instructions in the said crossed checks
that the same were for payee's account only; and that the appellee maintained a
savings account with the Prudential Bank, Cubao Branch, Quezon City which never
cleared the said checks and the appellee had been damaged by such encashment of
the same.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We affirm.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 22.5pt;">Under
accepted banking practice, crossing a check is done by writing two parallel
lines diagonally on the left top portion of the checks.  The crossing is special where the name of a
bank or a business institution is written between the two parallel lines, which
means that the drawee should pay only with the intervention of that company.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The crossing is general where the words written between the two parallel lines
are “and Co.” or “for payee's account only,” as in the case at bar.  This means that the drawee bank should not
encash the check but merely accept it for deposit.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In State Investment House <i>vs</i>. IAC,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court declared that “the effects of crossing a check are:  (1) that the check may not be encashed but
only deposited in the bank; (2) that the check maybe negotiated only once - to
one who has an account with a bank; and (3) that the act of crossing the check
serves as a warning to the holder that the check has been issued for a definite
purpose so that he must inquire if he has received the check pursuant to that
purpose.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The effects therefore of crossing a check relate to the mode of
its presentment for payment.  Under Sec.
72 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, presentment for payment, to be
sufficient, must be made by the holder or by some person authorized to receive
payment on his behalf.  Who the holder
or authorized person is depends on the instruction stated on the face of the
check.</p>

<p class="BODY">The six checks in the case at bar had been crossed and issued
“for payee's account only.” This could only signify that the drawers had
intended the same for deposit only by the person indicated, to wit, Melissa's
RTW.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners argue that the cause of action for violation of
the common instruction found on the face of the checks exclusively belong to
the issuers thereof and not to the payee.  Moreover, having acted in good faith as they merely facilitated the
encashment of the checks, they cannot be made liable to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject checks were accepted for deposit by the Bank for the
account of Rafael Sayson although they were crossed checks and the payee was
not Sayson but Melisa's RTW.  The Bank
stamped thereon its guarantee that “all prior endorsements and/or lack of
endorsements (were) guaranteed.” By such deliberate and positive act, the Bank
had for all legal intents and purposes treated the said checks as negotiable
instruments and, accordingly, assumed the warranty of the endorser.</p>

<p class="BODY">The weight of authority is to the effect that “the possession of
a check on a forged or unauthorized indorsement is wrongful, and when the money
is collected on the check, the bank can be held ‘for moneys had and received.’”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The proceeds are held for the rightful owner of the payment and may be
recovered by him.  The position of the
bank taking the check on the forged or unauthorized indorsement is the same as
if it had taken the check and collected without indorsement at all.  The act of the bank amounts to conversion of
the check.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that the proceeds of the subject checks
belonged to the private respondent.  As
she had not at any time authorized Rafael Sayson to endorse or encash them,
there was conversion of the funds by the Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the Bank paid the checks so endorsed notwithstanding that
title had not passed to the endorser, it did so at its peril and became liable
to the payee for the value of the checks.  This liability attached whether or not the Bank was aware of the unauthorized
endorsement <a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners were negligent when they permitted the encashment
of the checks by Sayson.  The Bank
should have first verified his right to endorse the crossed checks, of which he
was not the payee, and to deposit the proceeds of the checks to his own
account.  The Bank was by reason of the
nature of the checks put upon notice that they were issued for deposit only to
the private respondent's account.  Its failure
to inquire into Sayson's authority was a breach of a duty it owed to the
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Court stressed in Banco de Oro Savings and Mortgage Bank <i>vs</i>.
Equitable Banking Corp.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
“the law imposes a duty of diligence on the collecting bank to scrutinize
checks deposited with it, for the purpose of determining their genuineness and
regularity.  The collecting bank, being
primarily engaged in banking, holds itself out to the public as the expert on
this field, and the law thus holds it to a high standard of conduct.”</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners insist that the private respondent has no cause
of action against them because they have no privity of contract with her.  They also argue that it was Eddie Reyes, the
private respondent's own husband, who endorsed the checks.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that Eddie Reyes did endorse the crossed checks, we hold
that the Bank would still be liable to the private respondent because he was
not authorized to make the endorsements.  And even if the endorsements were forged, as alleged, the Bank would
still be liable to the private respondent for not verifying the endorser's
authority.  There is no substantial
difference between an actual forging of a name to a check as an endorsement by
a person not authorized to make the signature and the affixing of a name to a
check as an endorsement by a person not authorized to endorse it.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Bank does not deny collecting the money on the
endorsement.  It was its responsibility
to inquire as to the authority of Rafael Sayson to deposit crossed checks
payable to Melissa's RTW upon a prior endorsement by Eddie Reyes.  The failure of the Bank to make this inquiry
was a breach of duty that made it liable to the private respondent for the
amount of the checks.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no evidence that the crossed checks were actually
received by the private respondent, she would have a right of action against
the drawer companies, which in turn could go against their respective drawee
banks, which in turn could sue the herein petitioner as collecting bank.  In a similar situation, it was held that, to
simplify proceedings, the payee of the illegally encashed checks should be
allowed to recover directly from the bank responsible for such encashment
regardless of whether or not the checks were actually delivered to the payee.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
We approve such direct action in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth repeating that before presenting the checks for
clearing and for payment, the Bank had stamped on the back thereof the words:
“All prior endorsements and/or lack of endorsements guaranteed,” and thus made
the assurance that it had ascertained the genuineness of all prior endorsements.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the respondent court committed no reversible error
in holding that the private respondent had a valid cause of action against the
petitioners and that the latter are indeed liable to her for their unauthorized
encashment of the subject checks.  We
also agree with the reduction of the award of the exemplary damages for lack of
sufficient evidence to support them.</p>
