case alleged by petitioner and not disputed by public respondents are as

<blockquote>“Petitioner’s late husband started his government service as a
national language researcher in December 1957 at the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Institute</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>National Language</st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later he transferred to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Mindanao</st1:placename>

in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Marawi</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as an instructor in June 1974.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He rose
to become assistant professor and he was holding this position when in October
1982 disaster struck.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
hospitalized at the Mindanao Sanitarium and Hospital for <span class="SpellE">hemiparesis</span>
(R).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His attending physician, Dr. Levi
H. <span class="SpellE">Pagunzan</span> described the patient’s complaint, thus:</blockquote>

present condition started a few hours prior to admission when he was found <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">just </span>lying in bed in his room, unable
to move his (R) side, urinary incontinence and spasm of (R) upper and lower
extremities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No medication was given and
admission was rough.</p>

<blockquote>The diagnosis of the doctor was
cardio-vascular accident - hemorrhage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> underwent
rehabilitation at the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Orthopedic</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His physician Dr. Sylvia Velasco diagnosed
his illness as ‘<span class="SpellE">Hemiparesis</span> (L) Post CVA thrombosis.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>Because of his illness, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>
retired from the service effective <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For his ailment, <span class="SpellE">hemiparesis</span>, post cardio vascular attack, the System
recommended Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> for temporary total
disability benefit from <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="1">January 22,
 1983</st1:date>, up to <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="2">February 24,

 1983</st1:date> up to December 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, the System recommended that his PTD benefits be continued
to January 198(4).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was subsequently
extended to January 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1987</st1:date>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> died of acute myocardial infraction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span>, herein petitioner filed an
Income benefits Claim for Payment in behalf of herself and her 4 minor children

on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

permanent total disability benefits from February 1985 up to the end of the
guaranteed period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the death
claim was disapproved by the System on the ground that the contingency occurred
after retirement when there is no longer an employer-employee relationship.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On appeal with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>Employees
Compensation Commission, respondent ECC affirmed the adverse decision of the
GSIS for the following reasons:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘xxx For a cardio vascular attack or myocardial infraction, to be
compensable under the Employees Compensation rules, any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->The strain of work that brings about an acute
attack must be of sufficient severity and must be followed within twenty-four
hours by the clinical signs of a <span class="SpellE">cardial</span> injury to
constitute causal relationship.</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left:1.15in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo2;

performance of his work and such symptoms <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and
</span>signs persisted, it is reasonable to claim a causal relationship.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:67.5pt;text-indent:13.5pt">None of these
conditions had been satisfied in the instant case, obviously because the
(death) occurred more than four years after his retirement from the
service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, the myocardial
infraction which caused his death, is a different illness and cannot be
considered a complication of the cardio vascular attack for which the deceased
had been properly and fully compensated with Permanent Total Disability up to
the guaranteed period.’”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The petition is
meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Article 194(b) of
Presidential Decree No. 626, as amended, provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“b.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under such regulations

that the minimum death benefit shall not be less than fifteen thousand pesos.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We agree with the interpretation
of the Solicitor General that generally speaking, the term “covered employee”
refers to an employee who at the time of his death is still an employee covered
by the GSIS.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">At the same time, we
cannot ignore the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Employees
Compensation Commission that to be entitled to death benefits, the employee
need not be an actual employee of the public or private sector at the time of
his death; he can be a retired employee whose retirement was brought about by
permanent disability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The rules are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 3(a), Rule XIII.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘xxx
If the employee has been receiving income benefits for permanent total
disability at the time of his death, the primary beneficiaries shall be paid
the monthly income benefit equivalent to eighty percent plus the dependent’s
pension equivalent to 10 per cent thereof for every dependent child but not
exceeding five counted from the youngest and without substitution.’”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Sec. 3(b), Rule XIII.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>‘xxx If
the employee has been receiving monthly income benefit for permanent total
disability at the time of death, the secondary beneficiaries shall be paid the
monthly pension excluding the dependent’s pension of the remaining balance of
the five year guaranteed period.’”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We agree that a permanent
and totally disabled employee </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">who
is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">receiving pension cannot
work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was compelled to retire from
the service because of disability that was work-oriented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Permanent total disability means an
incapacity to perform gainful work which is expected to be permanent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The covered employee referred to in Section
194(b) Presidential Decree No. 626, as amended, <u>includes an employee who has
retired from work because of permanent and total disability and who
subsequently dies</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 194(b) applies to a retired person as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">contemplated in Art. 194(d) which allows for
funeral benefits upon the death of a <u>covered employee or permanently totally
disabled pensioner</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We interpret this social legislation in favor of the
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any doubt as to its proper
interpretation must be resolved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>favor
of the employee whose rights must be protected.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the Employees Compensation Commission denied
petitioner’s claim because the cause of death, myocardial infraction, came four
and one half years after his retirement caused by work oriented paralysis
arising from <span class="SpellE">cerebrovascular</span> attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reasoning of both public respondents is
that his death was not caused by a work oriented cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence clearly shows that during his employment, the deceased suffered from a
stroke, a cardio vascular accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
was caused by “thrombosis,” or blockage of arteries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had to retire because of paralysis caused
by that cardio vascular attack when he was an assistant professor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He died after his compulsory retirement due
to total disability, caused by cardio <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vascular
attack or myocardial infraction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stated
otherwise, the cause of his compulsory retirement due to paralysis arising from
cardio vascular accident is closely related to the cause of his death, which was
also a cardio </span>vascular attack or myocardial infraction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That heart disease developed when he was
still working as a professor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It caused
his paralysis and his total permanent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">disability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The disease was work-oriented because of the
nature of his employment as a professor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same disease eventually caused his death, contrary to the conclusion
of both the GSIS and the Employees Compensation Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court holds that the heirs of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Manuzon</span> are entitled to the benefits they are claiming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This Court is aware that death benefits must be granted to the
primary beneficiaries of the decedent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to
</span>help the family of a permanent and totally disabled person who was so
disabled because of causes that are work-oriented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule applies all the more when that
disabled person later dies because of the same cause or related cause.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decisions of the Government Service
Insurance System and the Employees Compensation Commission in E.C.C. Case No.
4630 are REVERSED, and a new one is rendered declaring and directing that death
benefits be granted to petitioner, including dependent’s pension for children
