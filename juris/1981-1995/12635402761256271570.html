Ramos;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; that the continued absence without leave of Miss Santia has greatly jeopardized the service, for which reason she requested that her position be declared vacant to enable Judge Ramos to recommend another stenographic reporter in her place; and<br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; that Miss Santia falsified her (Judge del Rosario's) signature in an alleged special power of attorney which enabled her to get the pay checks of all the Judges and employees of the regional trial courts in Iloilo City for the second half of February, 1984 and thereafter to endorse 16 of said checks, by reason of which, according to reliable information, criminal charges have been filed against Miss Santia.</blockquote>Acting Court Administrator Buena therefore recommends that she be separated from the service as a notoriously undesirable employee pursuant to Section 40(d) of P.D. 827.<br><br>It appears that, in a decision dated October 29, 1984, respondent Milagros Santia y Escarilla was convicted of seventeen (17) counts of falsification of private documents in Criminal Cases Nos. 84-24341, 84-24343 up to 84-24358 by Judge Ernesto S.
