<span class="SpellE">Magante</span>, on the other hand, was employed by the
former as a carpenter from April 17, 1980 until his dismissal on March 6, 1982

assigned to work outside the plant of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Every three (3) months, petitioner was made to fill up and sign
an employment contract relating to a particular phase of work in a specific
project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Allegedly, the terms of the
contract written in English <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">were not </span>understood
by petitioner nor was the same explained to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The last hiring agreement entered into

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1982</st1:date>,
private respondent posted a notice of termination on its bulletin board to take
effect the following day, <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1989</st1:date>,
which included petitioner and other employees as among those whose services

old, that his contract had already expired and was not renewed being a project
employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The termination of petitioner
and his fellow workers was reported to the Ministry of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, petitioner filed a complaint with the then Ministry

Employment for illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
the filing of the respective position papers by the parties, Labor Arbiter

on <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="6">June 22, 1983</st1:date> with the
following pronouncement:</p>

<blockquote>"The terms of the contract that complainant is a project
worker is not the determining factor of the status of complainant or any worker
but the work performed by him and the place where he performed his
assignment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract entered into by
respondent and complainant is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">more of a
scheme to evade its liability or obligation under the law.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, respondent is directed to reinstate complainant to his

benefits granted by law and by respondent Company."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing decision of the labor arbiter, private
respondent filed an appeal before the National Labor Relations Commission
premised on the ground that the termination of petitioner's employment was
occasioned by the completion of the phase of work in the project for which he
was specifically hired and that he was duly notified thereof in compliance with
the requirements of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding merit in the appeal, public respondent held that
petitioner's employment falls squarely within the purview of Policy Instructions
No. 20, a regulation intended for stabilizing employer-employee relations in
the construction industry which has aptly taken into consideration the unique
characteristics of respondent's business herein, quoting the pertinent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">provisions as </span>follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Generally, there are two types of employees in the

<p class="BODY">Public respondent further found that upon completion of
particular phase of work in the project for which petitioner's services have
been hired, his termination was indubitably for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>With these
justifications, public respondent set aside the appealed decision of the labor
arbiter and entered a new judgment dismissing the complaint for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed a motion for
reconsideration of the aforesaid decision but the same was denied.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner now comes before Us by way of <i>certiorari</i> to set
aside the aforesaid decision of public respondent promulgated on August 1, 1984
for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is asserted in the instant petition that
private respondent's argument that petitioner was only hired for a fixed period
of time cannot escape the factual finding of the Labor Arbiter's decision that
the contract entered into by private respondent with the petitioner is more of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>scheme to evade its liability or
obligation under the law by making it appear that said petitioner is a project
to project employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor-General, when required to file a Comment to the
instant petition, took the same stand as petitioner citing the case of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Fegurin</span></u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

as the basis for considering petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>a regular and permanent employee who should therefore be reinstated to
his position with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">In view of the Solicitor-General's contrary stand to the decision
of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission, the latter was given
an opportunity to file its o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">wn comment </span>to
the petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the aforesaid comment,
public respondent defends its decision in line with Article 281 of the Labor
Code which provides the exception to regular and casual employment, that is,
when the employment has been fixed for a specific project or undertaking, the
completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the
engagement of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Public
respondent contends that petitioner's case falls within the exception and the <span class="SpellE"><u>Fegurin</u></span> case relied upon by petitioner does not
stand on all fours with the present case because the complainants in said case
had lengths of service for nine (9), eight (8) and six (6) years, the shortest
being three (3) years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case,
petitioner worked only for over <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>year,
his last contract lasting only a span of four (4) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, Article 281 of the Labor Code is
intended for<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span>all industries
except the construction industry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Policy </span>Instruction
No. 20 was promulgated for the reason that problems of regularity of employment
in the construction industry has continued to plague it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This policy merely implements the exception
to Article 281 of the Labor Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the petition as We sustain the position of the
Solicitor-General that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span> <span class="SpellE">Magante</span> was <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>regular
employee of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 281 of the Labor Code provides:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Article 281.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Regular
and Casual Employment. - The provisions of written agreement to the contrary
notwithstanding and regardless of the oral agreements of the parties, an
employment shall be deemed to be regular where the employee has been engaged to
perform activities which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual
business or trade of the employer except where the employment has been fixed
for a specific project or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">undertaking,
the completion or termination of which has been determined at the time of the
engagement of the employee or where the work or service to be performed is
seasonal in nature and the employment is for the duration of the season."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"An employment shall be deemed to be casual if it is not
covered by the preceding paragraph:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, That, any employee who has rendered at least one year of
service, whether such service is continuous or broken, shall be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>regular employee with respect to
the activity in which he is employed and his employment shall continue while
such actually exists."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As aptly observed by the Solicitor-General, petitioner has established
that since the very inception of his employment in 1980, he was never deployed
from project to project of private respondent but had been regularly assigned
to perform carpentry work under the supervision of a certain Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Padaon</span> who, since 1964 until his resignation on January 2,
1982 worked for private respondent as the supervisor of its Carpentry
Department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This goes to show two
things:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that petitioner was assigned to
perform tasks which are usually necessary or desirable in the usual business or
trade of private respondent; and that said assignments did not end on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>project
to project basis, although the contrary was made to appear by private
respondent through the signing of separate employment contracts allegedly for
different projects because it is indeed obvious that petitioner continued to
perform the same kind of work throughout his period of employment allegedly
considered to have been done on a project to project <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although petitioner had only rendered almost two years of service,
nevertheless this should not detract from his status of being a regular
employee because as correctly stated by the labor arbiter, the determining
factor of the status of complainant-petitioner or any worker is the nature of
the work performed by the latter and the place where he performed his
assignment.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We have re-examined the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Fegurin</u></span>
<u>vs.</u> <u>National</u> <u>Labor</u> <u>Relations</u> <u>Commission</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><u><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></u></span></a>
and found that although the facts of the said case are not on all fours with the
instant petition there being a work pool to which the complaining employees
therein belonged, nonetheless, the doctrine therein may be similarly applied in
the case at bar considering that the nature of the work of petitioner herein
and in said case also involved carpentry work and there was a continuous
assignment of similar workload from project to project.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">therein </span>that
the employment of petitioners with the company for several years [four (4) of
whom for nine (9) years, one (1) for eight (8) years, another for six (6)
years, the shortest term being three (3) years] despite the shorter employment
periods specified in their notices of employment, performing activities usually
necessary or desirable in the usual business of the company, shows that they
are regular employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, if petitioner were employed as a "project
employee", private respondent should have submitted a report of
termination to the nearest public employment office every time his employment
is terminated due to the completion of each construction project, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>required by Policy Instruction No.
20.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Project employees are not entitled to termination pay if they
are terminated as a result of the completion of the project or any phase
thereof in which they are employed, regardless of the number of projects in
which they have been employed by a particular construction <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the company is not required to obtain a clearance from the
Secretary of Labor in connection with such termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">What
is required of the company is a report to the nearest Public Employment Office
for statistical purposes."</b> (Italics supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Throughout the duration of petitioner's employment, there should
have been filed as many reports of termination as there were construction projects
actually finished if it were true that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Telesforo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magante</span> was only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">a </span>project worker.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing considered, public respondent National Labor
Relations Commission gravely abused its discretion in closing its eyes to the
evidence on record and the factual findings of the labor arbiter in setting
aside the decision of the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Construing the employment contract signed by petitioner with private
respondent solely on its face without considering the surrounding circumstances
in this case serves to defeat the purpose for which the Labor Code and its
implementing rules were enacted.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
