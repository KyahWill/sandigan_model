<p>Petitioner Mauricio Bello seeks a review of the decision of respondent 
Workmen's Compensation Commission rendered on February 23, 1976 in R04-WCU Case 
No. 161021 which granted petitioner only the lump sum of P178.28 as disability 
compensation benefit in con­trast to the award made by the Acting Chief of the 
Workmen's Compensation Section, R04, Manila on March 19, 1975 requiring private 
respondent Hector Lagman to pay petitioner the amount of Seven Hundred Ninety 
Six Pesos and 80/100 (P796.80) and the weekly compensation of P33.60 beginning 
March 20, 1975 until his illness is cured or arrested or his liability for labor 
ceases provided it does not exceed P6,000.00.<br><br>From the findings of the 
respondent Commission, it appears that petitioner was an employee of respondent 
Lagman, a jeepney operator.&nbsp; Petitioner was found sick with "pulmonary 
tuberculosis, chronic, moderately advanced predominantly fibrotics", by his 
attending physician Dr. Fabian Medina, who declared on October 30, 1974 that 
said illness was aggravated by his employment.&nbsp; Petitioner was confined at 
Quezon Institute from May 27, 1971 up to June 20, 1971 when he was discharged, 
much improved, after which he resumed working.&nbsp; He was again found sick, this 
time, of bacterial conjunctivities from September 20, 1974 to October 16, 
1974.<br><br>On November 8, 1974, petitioner filed a claim for disability 
compensation, so an award was made by the Acting Chief, Workmen's Compensation 
Section of Region 4 on the ground that respondent did not controvert said 
claim.&nbsp; Respondent Lagman moved to set aside the award.&nbsp; This was granted 
despite the opposition of petitioner and the case was treated as a controverted 
claim before the Hearing Officer who dismissed petitioner's claim for lack of 
merit.&nbsp; On appeal, the Workmen's Compensation Commission applied the legal 
presumption under Section 44 of the WCC Act as amended, sustained the 
compensability of the claim, absolved Benedicto Dinglasan and Sons, Inc. from 
any liability, made respondent Lagman liable being claimant's employer at the 
time he was af­flicted with tuberculosis and granted temporary total disability 
to claimant from May 27, 1971 to June 20, 1971 and from September 20, 1974 to 
October 16, 1974 amounting to P178.28 which is 60% of his weekly average pay of 
P40.00 (See Annex A, Petition, page 21, <em>Rollo</em>).<br><br>It is undisputed 
that petitioner was afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis during the course of 
his employment.&nbsp; The only issue to be resolved here is whether or not under the 
circumstances obtaining in this case, he should be granted full compensation 
benefits.<br><br>We find the petition meritorious and so hold that full 
compen­sation benefit is in order.<br><br>While it may be true, as respondent 
Commission points out that no chest x-ray report was submitted to establish 
petitioner's illness of pulmonary tuberculosis and confinement at Quezon 
Institute, it has been resolved in many cases of this nature that the doctor's 
certifi­cation as to the nature of claimant's disability may be given credence 
as he normally, would not make a false certification.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Moreover, laboratory reports are not 
indispensable prerequisite to compensability of claim and the absence of an 
x-ray report cannot prejudice such claim<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>.&nbsp; This Court even went to the extent of 
declaring that to be compensable, it is enough that the hypothesis on which the 
workmen's claim is based is probable.&nbsp; Medical opinion to the contrary can be 
disregarded.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> Indeed, the niceties and 
refinements of technical rules on procedure must give way to effect substantial 
justice to the claimant<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>.<br><br>The 
WCC's decision under review, granted disability benefits to petitioner solely 
for the period he was <em>confined</em> at the hospital.&nbsp; The Commission in 
granting a meager amount stated thus:&nbsp; "x x x claimant is entitled to temporary 
total disability for labor from May 27, 1971 up to June 20, 1971, and then 
September 20, 1974 up to October 16, 1974.&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x"<br><br>This should not be 
so.&nbsp; In proving his entitlement to compensation benefits, petitioner submitted 
the following:</p>
<ol><li>Physician's Report of sickness, signed by petitioner's attending physician, 
Dr. Fabian Medina of the Quezon Institute, on October 30, 1974;<br><br></li><li>Certification of the Chief, Out-Patient Service of Q.I. dated October 25, 
1974 showing that petitioner had chest x-ray examinations on various dates from 
May 27, 1971 to July 11, 1974;<br><br></li><li>Medical Certificate signed by Dr. Gregorio Noriega, Medical Specialist of 
the National Tuberculosis Center Clinic, Manila, dated March 7, 
1975;<br><br></li><li>Memorandum for the Acting Chief of the Workmen's Compensation Section, by 
Dr. Edmund Calaycay, Com­pensation Rating Medical Officer of said Section, dated 
March 10, 1975.</li></ol>
<p>It is noted that all said certifications declared tuberculosis as 
petitioner's ailment.&nbsp; The disease occurred not only on May 27, 1971 but 
<em>recurred </em>on various dates in 1974 and 1975<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>.&nbsp; It is therefore error for the respondent 
Commission to award only the sum of P178.28 to petitioner especially considering 
that Section 2 of the Workmen's Compensation Act as amended, provides that an 
employee who suffers from tuberculosis "directly caused by such employment, or 
either aggravated by or the result of the nature of such employment", is 
entitled to compensation.&nbsp; There are numerous cases<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> involving substantially similar conditions 
as that of herein petitioner, wherein this Court ruled that tuberculosis is an 
occupational disease, hence, compensable.<br><br>In the present case, petitioner 
is entitled to full compensation.&nbsp; He has been rendered incapable of further 
pursuing his usual work because of his weakened bodily condition due to illness 
contracted in the course of employment.<br><br>Finally, the Court observes that 
the award of P178.28 is so unsubstantial and unrealistic considering present-day 
economic standard and financial realities.&nbsp; To sustain such a petty award would 
render meaningless the purpose of the law and the social justice precept it 
guarantees.<br><br>WHEREFORE, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the decision of respondent 
Workmen's Compensation Commission dated February 23, 1976 is SET ASIDE and 
respondent Hector Lagman is hereby ordered to pay petitioner the sum of SIX 
THOUSAND PESOS (P6,000.00) as disability compensation and to pay Counsel of 
petitioner attorney's fees equivalent to 10% of the recoverable amount, with 
costs against respondent Lagman. SO ORDERED.<br><br><em>Yap, (Chairman), 
Narvasa, Cruz, and Sarmiento, JJ., concur. Melencio-Herrera</em> and<em> 
Feliciano, JJ.</em>, on leave.<br><br><br></p></div>
