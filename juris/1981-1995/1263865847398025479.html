<blockquote>“The evidence for the prosecution shows, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">among others, </span>that on July 28, 1986 <span class="SpellE">Riza</span> Galvan was on duty at the NARCOM office with the task
of receiving incoming messages, information and other directives, and on that
day, he received an information from an informant that a certain Romeo
Olivares, <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">Reolo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">, </span>Armando <span class="SpellE">Padoy</span> and a certain <span class="SpellE">Zaldy</span> have in their possession dried marijuana leaves which
is estimated to be 1,000 grams in weight and that said marijuana leaves are
being sold by them at the residence of Romeo Olivares located at the corner of
A &amp; D <span class="SpellE">Paulate</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Guinobatan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Albay</span>; that NARCOM, on the basis <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>said information, applied for and
were able to secure a search warrant, which was issued by Branch 3 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">RTC </span>in <span class="SpellE">Legazpi</span>
City; that the NARCOM headed by PC Major <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaidem</span> conceived a “buy-bust operation”, and briefings were
conducted by the NARCOM chief relative to said operation; that the NARCOM
operatives left for <span class="SpellE">Guinobatan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
at about 5:30 in the afternoon of the same day; that after a briefing at the
churchyard of <span class="SpellE">Guinobatan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>
conducted by Major <span class="SpellE">Zaidem</span>, the informant proceeded to
the billiard-hall of the accused Romeo Olivarez to pose as a marijuana buyer,
and had with him a P20.00 bill marked with the signature of Maj. <span class="SpellE">Zaidem</span>; that meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Riza</span>
Galvan and <span class="SpellE">Lucino</span> Flores positioned themselves 10
meters more or less from the entrance of the lighted billiard-hall; that the
informant was met by a man at the entrance of the billiard-hall who turned out
to be <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Reolo</span>; that
while the informant and <span class="SpellE">Reolo</span> were having a
conversation, the former delivered the marked money to the latter, and then, a
man who turned out to be accused Romeo Olivares, approached the two, and <span class="SpellE">Reolo</span> gave the marked money to Romeo Olivares; that Romeo
Olivares went inside his residence which was adjacent to the billiard-hall, and
after about 5 minutes, returned to the two (<span class="SpellE">Reolo</span> and
informant), and Romeo Olivares gave something to the informant, after which,
the informant gave a pre-arranged signal which mea<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">nt tha</span>t the informant was able to buy marijuana; that immediately
after the pre-arranged signal, Galvan and Flores approached <span class="SpellE">Reolo</span>
and Olivares, introducing themselves as NARCOM operatives and arrested both of
them; that the article given by Olivares to the informant was retrieved from
the latter by Galvan, which turned out to be pack or tea bag of marijuana, and
the same was later given to Maj. <span class="SpellE">Zaidem</span>; that after
the arrest of Olivares and <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Reolo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">, </span>the
NARCOM operatives conducted a search for the 1,000 grams of marijuana in the
residence of Olivares <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>virtue
of the search warrant, and in the presence of <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
officials Fernando Rivera and Pedro Morales, who were fetched by the NARCOM
operatives after the arrest but before the search was conducted; that the
operatives found in the bedroom of Olivares two canisters labeled ‘<span class="SpellE">bonna</span>’ which both contained few dried marijuana seeds and
leaves; that they also found a black <span class="SpellE">attache</span> case
which yielded three Philippine peso bills having denominations of P20.00, P1.00
and P5.00, and they took the P20 bill found inside the black <span class="SpellE">attache</span> case which was the marked money given by Major <span class="SpellE">Zaidem</span> to the informant; that a receipt for property seized
(Exhibit L) was prepared by the operatives and was signed by<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Olivares, and a booking sheet and arrest
report (<span class="SpellE">Exhibt</span> A) was likewise prepared by the
operatives and was signed by Olivares; that Romeo Olivares <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and </span><span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Reolo</span> were later on brought to Camp <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibalon</span> and had them submit
for the taking of finger prints, as indicated in Exhibits A, N, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">O; </span>that Romeo Olivares was subjected
to a physical examination at Camp <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibalon</span>, whereby the medical examination report (Exhibit Q)
indicated that no external physical injuries were noted at the time of
examination; that the 1.5 grams of suspected dried marijuana fruiting tops
placed inside a transparent plastic bag (Exhibit E) as well as the two tin <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">cans </span>labeled ‘<span class="SpellE">bonna</span>’
(Exhibit F and G) each containing suspected dried marijuana fruiting tops
having a total weight of 2.1 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">grams were
</span>turned over to the Forensic Chemist, Police Lt. <span class="SpellE">Lorlie</span>
Arroyo, who conducted a laboratory examination of the same, with the finding
that after a qualitative examination conducted on the above mentioned
specimens, said specimens gave positive result to the tests for marijuana, a
prohibited drug, as indicated in Chemistry Report No. D-94-86 (Exhibit C).” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 22-25)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For its part, the defense alleged that:</p>

<blockquote>“xxx [A]t about 8:00 o’clock in the evening of July 28, 1986 (sic)
when accused Romeo Olivares, his wife, and two children were in their house,
five armed men barged into their billiard-hall at corner A and D <span class="SpellE">Paulate</span> Street, <span class="SpellE">Guinobatan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>; that one of the armed men drew out from the left
pocket of his shirt a cellophane packet which has the size of a tea bag and
told Romeo Olivares that the cellophane packet contains marijuana and compelled
him to admit that it is his; that<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>two
armed men went upstairs and poked a gun at <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span>
wife, Elizabeth, who was ordered to go downstairs and to join her husband
Romeo; that one of the armed men, who is a tall person, boxed Olivares which
caused the latter to fall down on his chest; that then Olivares was pulled to
the kitchen of his house with a gun pointed against his temple by one of the
armed men, who also boxed the accused; that the accused saw another armed man
coming from the outside of his house, carrying two cans labeled ‘<span class="SpellE">bonna</span>’; that the accused was again compelled by the armed
men to admit that those two cans also belong to him, although <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>accused vehemently denied
ownership of the same nor being in possession of marijuana, but First Lt. <span class="SpellE">Lomeda</span> at this moment was pointing a .45 caliber pistol at
the accused; that the accused was dragged and kicked out of the billiard-hall
to a jeep parked in front of the billiard-hall; that then, the armed men
entered their room and ransacked <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> personal
belongings; that after the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">lapse </span>of
about 20 to 25 minutes, the accused was ordered to alight from the jeep and
dragged to the billiard-hall, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>it
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">was at </span>this point, when accused
saw his <span class="SpellE">attache</span> case, which was kept in his
matrimonial bedroom, on top of a billiard-hall already opened; that accused was
forced and intimidated to sign papers; although at first the accused refused
because he insisted to be assisted by a lawyer before he signs those papers but
his plea was ignored and in fact prevented from doing so by the armed men whom
he identified as AIC Galvan and his armed companions; that nonetheless, the
accused signed those papers at a point of a gun as he was threatened <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>this manner ‘<span class="SpellE">pirmahan</span>
mo <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">na</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span class="SpellE">yan</span> kung <span class="SpellE">hindi</span> <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">kang</span>
<span class="SpellE">bata</span> ka’; that he was also threatened to act normally
as soon as <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain Fernando Rivera arrived
after they ransacked the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> personal
belongings; that when <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain arrived, the
accused, already intimidated, obeyed to act normally in the presence of said <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> official; that thereafter, the accused was told to
board a jeep because he would be brought to Camp <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ibalon</span>, and on the way, the accused was appeased by
Galvan to raise P10,000.00 so that the case would be dropped or settled; that
they arrived at Camp <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibalon</span>
at about 9:00 in the evening of the same day, where the accused was hit several
times with a hand and he was placed in jail until the next morning; that when
the parents of the accused arrived the next morning, they were told by Major <span class="SpellE">Zaidem</span> to raise P10,000.00 for his release; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that </span>accused denied having solicited
the legal services of Atty. Mario <span class="SpellE">Encinareal</span> for his
release from the custody of said NARCOM agents; that before his release from
the custody of the NARCOM personnel, the accused was forced to sign documents,
and he signed them because he was being hurt, and he was never assisted by any
counsel before the NARCOM.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 25-27)</blockquote>

doubt of selling the marijuana found in his possession?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a common defense of persons charged with the sale of
marijuana to question the non-presentation of the informants in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, NARCOM operatives rarely, if ever,
remove the cloak <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">of confidentiality </span>with which they surround their poseur-buyers
and informers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The usefulness of
informers would be over the moment they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are </span>presented in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, drug dealers do not look kindly
upon squealers and informants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
understandable why, as much as possible, their identities are kept secret.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The usual defense - that the non-presentation
of informers and poseur-buyers amounts to suppression of key evidence - is
non-availing when it comes to buy-bust operations in the anti-drug campaign.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully looked into the credibility and competence of <span class="SpellE">Riza</span> Galvan because the guilt or innocence of the appellant
insofar as the more serious crime of selling marijuana is concerned, hinges on
his testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">We discount the defense theory that the NARCOM agents planted the
marijuana to carry out an extortion activity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The story is farfetched and is not sustained by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are satisfied from the evidence that the
government agents were simply discharging their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">duty when they engaged in the operation which led to the </span>arrest
of Olivares.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">alleged discrepancies
in </span>the testimony of Galvan are not of a nature to warrant the rejection
of what he stated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there
were two or four of them when they left the churchyard, with the informant
going ahead or <span class="GramE">not,</span> is a minor discrepancy unrelated
to the possession and sale of the marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The exact time when the P20.00 bill was given to the informer is also a
minor discrepancy.</p>

<p class="BODY">More important is whether or not Galvan actually witnessed the
sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records show that Galvan was
only ten meters away from Olivares, <span class="SpellE">Reolo</span>, and the
informer when the transaction took place.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The place was well-lighted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Galvan saw the incident when the marked money was being turned over the <span class="SpellE">Reolo</span>, then to Olivares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was looking when Olivares left the billiard-hall and entered his
adjacent residence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He saw Olivares come
out and turn over something that <span class="SpellE">thad</span> been gotten
from inside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the operatives moved
in to arrest <span class="GramE">appellant, that</span> something was taken by
Galvan from the poseur-buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was the
packet of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To still require
Galvan to actually hear the conversation which transpired between buyer and
seller is unnecessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was enough
that he witnessed the turning over of the money, the bringing out of marijuana
and its being handed to the buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
evidence of the sale of marijuana is sufficient to establish guilt beyond <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The marijuana in the two
tin cans is likewise evidence that the appellant had a ready supply of
marijuana inside his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When a buyer
places an order and turns over the payment, Olivares would leave the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">billiard-hall, </span>enter his residential
quarters, and come out with the purchased quantity which he turned over to his
buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The marked money was also
recovered from his brief case where he placed it when he went inside the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Galvan’s testimony on the exchange of money for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">marijuana is positive and categorical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is absolutely no evidence in the record
of any evil motives why he would implicate Olivares for a crime punished by
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> if such were not true.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor is there proof of any malicious motive
why the NARCOM operatives should go to all that trouble to plant marijuana on
his person and later inside his house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The concatenation of circumstances from the report of a cache of
marijuana, the securing of a search warrant, the sales transaction itself, the
bringing in of <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> officials, and the discovery
of the tins of marijuana in addition to the packet sold for P20.00 all point to
the guilt of the appellant as a seller of marijuana.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the lower court is hereby
AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal is DISMISSED.</p>
