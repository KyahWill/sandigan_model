				<H3>HEIRS OF JULIO ROSAS HEREIN REPRESENTED IN THIS SUIT BY THEIR ATTORNEY-IN-FACT MERCEDES ROSAS, PETITIONERS, VS. HON. OSCAR R. REYES, PRESIDING JUDGE OF PASAY CITY BRANCH 47, METROPOLITAN TRIAL COURT, CHARRY CARANAY AND SANTIAGO I. BARCENAS, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue before this Court in this civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
is whether or not after an implied new lease is created and the court has fixed
a definite period for the new lease, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> may
eject the lessee u<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pon </span>expiration
of said period by a mere motion for execution without instituting anew another
action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners are owners of a residential apartment in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
a unit of which is being leased by the private respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter had been renting the premises as
early as February 1984 and their occupancy was renewed on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1986</st1:date> as evidenced by a lease contract
which was to expire six months thereafter, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">in </span>June 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1987" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1987</st1:date>, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">petitioners, through counsel, wrote a letter to the private respondents
demanding a higher rental from P1<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P1,500.00
and that they vacate the premises in the event that they do not agree to the
higher rental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">March 3,
 1987</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, the private
respondents replied that they do not agree to the petitionersâ€™ demand for
higher rental and alleged that there was an implied renewal of the lease
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They paid their rentals which
were accepted by the petitioners but upon tender of the rental for May 1987,
the latter refused to accept the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This prompted the private respondents to deposit </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a bank the rentals for May 1987 and the succeeding months.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In May 1987, the petitioners filed an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suit before the Metropolitan Trial Court, Branch
47 at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After submission of the evidence based on the
rules on summary procedure, the respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">j</span>udge rendered judgment in favor of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private
respondents were ordered to vacate the premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by the private respondents, the Regional Trial Court
(RTC) reversed the lower court's decision and dismissed the complaint on the
ground that a demand to vacate was not timely made before the expiration of the
old lease contract pursuant to Article 1670 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the RTC judge applied Article 1687
and fixed a new lease period of six months ending on <st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision of the lower court is hereby
reversed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the complaint is hereby
dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this Court has to
fix the period in accordance with Article 1687 of the Civil Code and the
defendant shall remain in the premises for another six months beginning from
receipt of this order with the same amount of monthly rental as stipulated in
the contract of lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Annex C complainant).</span> <span class="GramE">In short, not later
than </span><st1:date year="1988" day="30" month="4"><span class="GramE">April
 30, 1988</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">."</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 20)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeals which rendered a
decision on <st1:date year="1989" day="27" month="4">April 27, 1989</st1:date>
affirming the <span class="SpellE">RTC's</span> decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1989</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed a motion for execution before the respondent Metropolitan
Trial Court (MTC) judge alleging that the private respondents have not yet
vacated the leased premises despite the lapse of the period given them by the
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant thereto, the respondent
judge issued an order denying the motion for execution, declaring that since
the RTC judgment stating that defendants may stay for a period of six months
from receipt of the decision embodies a mere directive, there is in effect no
judgment to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his order, the respondent judge likewise </span>reminded
the petitioners to institute anew an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case
predicated on valid grounds for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners moved for reconsideration of said order but the respondent
judge denied their motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal by <i>certiorari</i>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners seek a review of the orders of the respondent
judge denying their Motion for Execution and Motion for Reconsideration and to
compel and command the respondent judge to issue a writ of execution to enforce
the aforementioned <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the <span class="SpellE">RTC's</span> decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioners likewise seek administrative sanctions against the respondent
judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the Regional
Trial Court's decision may be segmented into two parts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first part, the complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the second part, the lower court fixed the
period of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">lease for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">another six months from receipt of the
court's order, not later than April 30, 1988.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners aver that while the first part is apparently
contradictory to the second part, it is no justification for the respondent MTC
judge to disregard the second portion and to require the filing of a new
complaint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">to </span>enforce the
latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the petitioners,
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion is the decision to be
executed and this can be enforced by mere motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion should have been construed and harmonized as a whole in order to give <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">meaning to the judgment.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:26.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge erred in concluding that the part of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">disp</span>ositive</span>
portion which states that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">"x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> defendant shall remain in the
premises for another six months beginning from receipt of this <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">order x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In short, not later than April 30, 1988."</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">is</span> a mere
directive and in effect there is no judgment to be executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the above-quoted <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dispositive</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> portion is part and parcel of an <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment which can be enforced by mere motion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1670 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"If at the end of the contract the lessee should continue
enjoying the thing leased for fifteen days with the acquiescence of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, and unless a notice to the contrary by either party
has previously been given, it is understood that there is an implied new lease,
not for the period of the original contract, but for the time established in
Articles 1682 and 1687.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The other terms
of the original contract shall be revived."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the RTC judge dismissed the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit because there was no express notice to
vacate within the statutory 15-day period and an implied new lease was
created.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the judge
proceeded to apply Article 1687 which refers to the lease of urban lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of said article states:</p>

<blockquote>"If the period for the lease has not been fixed, it is
understood to be from year to year, if the rent agreed upon is annual, from
month to month, if it is monthly, from week to week, if the rent is to be paid
daily.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, even though a monthly rent
is paid, and no period for the lease has been set, the courts may fix a longer
term for the lease after the lessee has occupied the premises for over one
year. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the private respondents have been occupying the leased
premises for more than one year, the RTC judge acted within legal bounds in
extending the lease for another six months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The logical consequence of the foregoing lease extension is that after
the lapse of six months, the private respondents must relinquish possession of
the leased apartment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit is
not incompatible with the fixing of the term of the new lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both are equally enforceable by mere
motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon expiration of the six-month
period, the private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">respondents have to
vacate the premises and if they do not, a motion for execution of judgment, and
not a new <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit, will suffice to oust them
from the leased area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion arises
from a court decision and any plausible intervening defenses such as purchase
of the premises by the lessee can be raised when the motion is heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court deplores the adv</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">ic</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">e
to needlessly file suits which unnecessarily clog judicial dockets and
frustrate the speedy disposition of cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent's comment and memorandum shows that her case is purely
dilatory relying as it does solely on technicality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While we hold that the public respondent erred in denying the
petitioners' motion for execution, this Court finds that his disposition of the
motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">is </span>a mere error of
judgment which does not warrant administrative sanctions against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing of bias or other improper
motive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the questioned order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, the petitioners also claim that the private
respondents have not been paying the rentals due from the time the petitioners
filed their appeal with the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, the private respondents, through respondent <span class="SpellE">Charry</span> <span class="SpellE">Caranay</span>, answered in their
memorandum that they have already vacated the premises by virtue of an
agreement with <span class="SpellE">Editha</span> Rosas, wife of petitioner
Eduardo Rosas, and that <span class="SpellE">Editha</span> Rosas likewise agreed
to condone their rental arrearages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners, however, manifested that they did not give <span class="SpellE">Editha</span> Rosas authority to act in their behalf as evidenced
by a special power of attorney wherein they appointed M<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">ercedes </span>Rosas, not <span class="SpellE">Editha</span> Rosas, as
their attorney-in-fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court finds that the agreement to condone the unpaid rental
is unenforceable inasmuch as it was entered into by <span class="SpellE">Editha</span>
Rosas without authority of the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, it would be unfair to exonerate the private respondents from
the payment of rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The RTC judge
stated in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of his decision
that "the defendant shall remain in the premises for another six months
beginning from the receipt of this order <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>same</u> <u>amount</u>
<u>of</u> <u>monthly</u> <u>rental</u> <u>as</u> <u>stipulated</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u>
<u>contract</u> <u>of</u> <u>lease</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">." </span>Even
if said judgment did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">immediately
become </span><span class="SpellE">executory</span> due to the petitioners'
appeal to the appellate court, the private respondents were legally and morally
obligated to pay rentals because they enjoyed and made use of the leased
premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their failure to pay plainly
constitutes unjust enrichment on their part.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>except for
the imposition of administrative sanctions against the public respondent, the
petition is GRANTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The orders of the
respondent judge dated October 30, 1989 and December 15, 1989 in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Civil Case No. 259-87 are SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

enforce the second part of the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion </span>of
