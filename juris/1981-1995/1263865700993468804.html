				<BR><STRONG>GANCAYCO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This nation has a wealth of laws on agrarian reform.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such laws were enacted not only because of the
constitutional mandate regarding the protection to labor and the promotion of
social justice but also because of the realization that there is an urgent need
to do something in order to improve the lives of the vast number of poor
farmers in our land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yet, despite such laws, it is a fact that the agrarian problems
which beset our nation have remained unsolved.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Majority of our farmers still live a hand-to-mouth existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The clamor <span style="">for </span>change has not died down.</p>

<p class="BODY">One need not go far in order to search for the reason behind
this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We all know that our
beautifully-worded-a<span style="">grarian</span> <span style="">laws have never really been effectively
implemented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unscrupulous individuals
have found various </span>ways in order to get around the laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Loopholes in the law <span style="">and </span>the ignorance of the poor farmers have been taken advantage
of by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the farmers
who are <span style="">intended to be protected </span>and
uplifted by the said laws find themselves back to where they started or even in
a worse position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must put a stop to
this vicious cycle and the time to do it is now.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case serves to remind those who are involved in the
execution <span style="">of </span>agrarian laws that
it is the farmer-beneficiary's interest that must be primarily served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This also holds that agrarian laws are to be
liberally construed in favor of the farmer-beneficiary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyone who wishes to contest the rights of
the farmer to land given to him by the government in accordance with our
agrarian laws has the burden of proving that the farmer does not deserve the
government grant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Posed </span>before Us
for resolution in this petition for review on <i>certiorari </i>is the question
of to whom ownership and possession of a certain landholding rightfully
belongs:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>to petitioner who was the
tiller <span style="">of </span>the <span style="">land </span>when Presidential Decree No. 27
was promulgated, or to private respondent in whose favor petitioner transferred
his rights over the land in consideration <span style="">of
</span>P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following facts can be gathered <span style="">from </span>the records of <span class="GramE">this cases</span>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner was the leasehold tenant of a 4,000 square-meter parcel
of land included in the <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Firme</span>
<span style="">Estate and located at </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Caloocan</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Isabela</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1972, when Presidential Decree No. 27 was
signed into law, petitioner was the tiller of the aforementioned piece of land
and was automatically deemed owner of the property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under Presidential Decree No. 27, any form of
transfer of those lands within the coverage of the law is prohibited except as
otherwise provided therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1978, urgently in need of money, petitioner was forced to
enter into what is called a "<span class="SpellE">selda</span>"
agreement, with private respondent, wherein he transferred his rights of
possession and enjoyment over the landholding in question to the latter in
consideration of a loan in the amount of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to
be paid not earlier than 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As part
of the agreement, petitioner signed an "Affidavit of Waiver" whereby
he waived all his rights over the property in favor of private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner, it was also agreed
upon by them that upon the payment of the loaned <span style="">amount, private respondent will deliver possession and enjoyment of the
property back to petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two years later or in 1980, petitioner offered to pay the loaned
amount but private respondent asked for an extension of one more year to
continue cultivating the land and enjoying its fruits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because of this, the money being offered by
petitioner to pay for the loan was utilized for other purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In 1981, though petitioner really wanted to
get the property back, he could not do so because he lacked the necessary
funds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in 1985 when <span style="">petitioner was </span>able to save enough
money to make another offer but this <span style="">time
private respondent categorically denied said offer and refused to vacate the
land.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner filed a complaint with the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain of <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cabatuan</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Isabela</span></span> stating therein that
he mortgaged his land to private respondent and that he already wanted to
redeem it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the scheduled date of
hearing, private respondent failed to appear.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the issuance by the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
captain of a certificate to file action, petitioner filed a complaint with the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cauayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Isabela</span>
for the recovery of possession of the parcel of land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After due trial, the said court rendered a
decision in favor of petitioner with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, judgment
is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) DECLARING the affidavit of waiver (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

planting season from December 1, 1986, or their equivalent at the NFA price of
P3.50 per kilo, until the possession of the land in question is delivered to
the plaintiff."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">On
</span>appeal to the <span style="">Court </span>of
Appeals, the decision of the trial court was reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">Taking into consideration the
circumstances surrounding this case and bearing in mind the constitutional
mandate on the promotion of agrarian reform, <span class="GramE">We</span> rule
in favor of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">It is not disputed by private
respondent that petitioner was in fact the tiller of the subject land when
Presidential Decree No. 27 was promulgated in 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of the law, petitioner was
granted the right to possess and enjoy the property for himself.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">The conflict arose when petitioner, by
force of circumstances, transferred possession of his land to private
respondent in consideration of a sum certain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to what was actually the contract that was entered upon is being
contested by the two parties herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has insisted from the very beginning that the agreement
entered into between him and private respondent was one of mortgage and that
private respondent promised to give back to him his <span style="">landholding </span>upon payment of the loaned amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">stand
of private respondent, on the other hand, is that petitioner relinquished all
his rights over the property in his favor, as expressly written in the
Affidavit of Waiver that petitioner signed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">In <span style="">its </span>decision, the trial court ruled in favor of petitioner having
found his version more convincing than <span style="">that
</span>of private respondent whose evasive attitude did not go unnoticed
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court further ruled
that the transfer of property from petitioner to private respondent is null and
void for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of Presidential Decree No.
27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, on the other
hand, believed that petitioner completely waived his rights over the land as
evidenced by the Affidavit of Waiver he executed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the Court of Appeals, the said
Affidavit of Waiver is valid because at the time of its execution, petitioner
was not yet the owner of the land there having been no title issued to him
yet.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, continued the Court of
Appeals, the Affidavit of Waiver did not violate Presidential Decree No.
27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals further added
that petitioner abandoned his landholding and received benefits under the
agreement, hence, should not be rewarded at the expense of private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;"><span style="">After
a careful scrutiny of the two conflicting </span>decisions and an exhaustive
study of the laws and jurisprudence applicable to this case, <span class="GramE">We</span>
affirm the judgment of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First of all, <span class="GramE">We</span> have given much weight to the
finding of the trial court that what was entered upon by the parties herein was
a contract of mortgage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It need not be
stressed that in the matter of credibility of witnesses, <span class="GramE">We</span>
rely heavily on the findings of the trial court because it had the opportunity
to meet them face to face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial
court observed, petitioner's version is more convincing because of the apparent
evasive attitude of private respondent as compared to the candid testimony of
the petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">Indeed, We find it hard to believe that
petitioner, who has been tilling the land in question for a long, long time
would suddenly lose interest in it and decide to leave it for good at a time
when he knew that full ownership over the same was soon going to be in his
hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, if the situation
were otherwise, petitioner would not have made repeated offers to pay for the
amount he borrowed from private respondent and demand from the latter the
possession of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would not
have even thought of bringing an action for the recovery of the same if he
honestly believed that he had already given it up in favor of private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, or anyone in his
right mind for that matter, would not waste his time, effort and money,
especially if he is poor, to prosecute an unworthy action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, petitioner is an example of a poor
tenant farmer who, due to sheer poverty, was constrained to mortgage his <span style="">only land</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> to somebody </span><span style="">else</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> -- </span><span style="">a situation which Presidential Decree No. 27 sought to prevent by
providing an explicit prohibition on transfers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">The above finding notwithstanding, and
assuming that petitioner really waived his tenancy rights in favor of private
respondent, this case should still be resolved against private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer would still be void for being made
in violation of Presidential Decree No. 27.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">We shall now take <span style="">a </span>closer look at the law.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">Presidential Decree No. 27 was signed
into law in view of the fact that the old concept of land ownership by a few
has spawned valid and legitimate grievances that gave rise to violent conflict
and social tension.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The law points out that reformation must start with the emancipation of the
tiller from the bondage of the soil.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.35in;">The fundamental policy of the law is
reflected in its title, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>PRESIDENTIAL DECREE NO. 27 -- DECREEING THE EMANCIPATION OF TENANT FROM
THE BONDAGE OF THE SOIL, TRANSFERRING TO THEM THE OWNERSHIP OF THE LAND THEY
TILL AND <span style="">PROVIDING THE INSTRUMENTS AND
MECHANISM THEREFOR.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This policy is
intended to be given effect by the following provisions:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>The tenant farmer, whether
in land classified as landed estate or not, shall be DEEMED OWNER of a portion
constituting a family size farm of five (5) hectares if not irrigated and three
(3) hectares if irrigated; (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"TITLE TO LAND
ACQUIRED PURSUANT TO THIS DECREE OR THE LAND REFORM PROGRAM OF THE GOVERNMENT
SHALL NOT <span class="GramE">BE</span> TRANSFERABLE except by hereditary
succession or to the Government in accordance with the provisions of this
Decree, the Code of Agrarian Reforms and other existing laws and
regulations:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The law is clear and leaves no room for doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon the promulgation of Presidential Decree
No. 27 on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="10">October 21, 1972</st1:date>,
petitioner was DEEMED OWNER of the land in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As of
that date, he was declared emancipated from the bondage of the soil.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, he gained the rights to possess,
cultivate, and enjoy the landholding for himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those rights over that particular property
were granted by the government to him and to no other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To insure his continued possession and enjoyment
of the property, he could not, under the law, make any valid form of transfer
except to the government or by hereditary succession, to his successors.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Yet, it is a fact that despite the prohibition, many
farmer-beneficiaries like petitioner herein were tempted to make use of their
land to acquire much needed money.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the then Ministry of Agrarian Reform issued the following
Memorandum Circular:</p>

<blockquote>"Despite the above prohibition, however, there are reports
that many farmer-beneficiaries of PD 27 have <u><span style="">transferred </span>the ownership, rights, and/or possession of their
farms/<span class="SpellE">homelots</span></u> to other persons or have
surrendered the same to their former landowners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these transactions/surrenders are <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of PD 27 and therefore, null and void."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the Court of Appeals when it ruled that
petitioner's land is not included in the legal prohibition since petitioner has
not yet acquired absolute title to the land having failed to comply with all
the conditions set forth by the law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>With regard to the legal prohibition, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold
that title refers not only to that issued upon compliance by the tenant-farmer
of the said conditions but also includes those rights and interests that <span style="">the tenant-farmer immediately acquired upon
the promulgation of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To rule otherwise would make a tenant-farmer falling in the category of
those who have not yet been issued a formal title to the land they till -- easy
prey to those who would like to tempt them with cash in exchange for inchoate
title over the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following this,
absolute title over lands covered by Presidential Decree No. 27 would end up in
the name of persons who were not the actual tillers when the law was
promulgated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the evidence on hand shows that Certificate of Land
Transfer No. 096267 covering the land in question is in the name of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Torres.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>

the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The rights and interests covered by the Certificate of Land
Transfer are beyond the commerce of man.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They are not negotiable except when it is used by the beneficiary as <span class="GramE">a collateral</span> for a loan with the rural bank for an
agricultural production."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Having settled that the contract of transfer entered into between
petitioner and private respondent is void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">initio</span></u></span><span style="">, </span><span class="GramE">We</span> now go to

applies to this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule <span style="">in the negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public policy and the policy of the law must
prevail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold otherwise will defeat
the spirit and intent of Presidential Decree No. 27 and the tillers will never

the ruling is that the policy of the law is to give land to a family for home

where the principle was reiterated, this Court, through Justice Alex Reyes,
made the following pronouncement:</p>

<blockquote>"Appellants, however, contend that the voiding provision of

have the effect of annulling the grant and cause the reversion of the property
and its improvements to the State, plaintiffs may no longer claim the
homestead.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similar contentions were made
in the case of Catalina de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Santos vs. Roman
Catholic Church of <span class="SpellE">Midsayap</span> et al., G.R. No. L-6088,

would run counter to an avowed fundamental policy of the State, that the
forfeiture of the homestead is a matter between the State and the grantee or
his heirs, and that until the State had taken steps to annul the grant and
asserts title to the homestead the purchaser is, as against the vendor or his
heirs, 'no more entitled to keep the land than any intruder.’ ”<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
