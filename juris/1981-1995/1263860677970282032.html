<p class="BODY">The private respondents, <span class="SpellE">Ederlina</span> <span class="SpellE">Navalta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Teng</span>,
Jose <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>, <st1:place><st1:city><span class="SpellE">Leandro</span> <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span></st1:city>, <st1:state>Victoria</st1:state></st1:place>
<span class="SpellE">Sudario</span>, and Flora <span class="SpellE">Nagbuya</span>
were the lessees of the premises located at <st1:street><st1:address>No. 512 <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Quiapo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
originally owned by the Susana Realty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These individual verbal leases were on a month-to-month basis at the
following rates:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ederlina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Navalta</span> at the rate of P80.50; <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>

Flora <span class="SpellE">Nagbuya</span> at the rate of P80.55.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The payments of the rentals were paid by the
lessees to a collector of the Susana Realty who </span>went to the premises
monthly.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in March, 1984, the Susana Realty sold the leased
premises to the petitioner, <span class="SpellE">Cetus</span> Development, Inc.,
a corporation duly organized and existing under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the laws </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From April <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">to </span>June, 1984, the private respondents continued to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">pay t</span>heir monthly rentals to a
collector sent by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
succeeding months <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of July, </span>August
and September 1984, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">respondents
failed to pay their monthly </span>individual <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">rentals as no collector came.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">October
 9, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, the
petitioner sent </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">letter to each of the private respondents
demanding that they vacate the subject premises and to pay the back rentals for
the months of July, August and September, 1984, within fifteen (15) days from
the receipt thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately upon
the receipt of the said demand letters on </span><st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="10"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">October 10, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, the private respondents paid their
respective arrearages in rent which were accepted by the petitioner subject to
the unilateral condition that the acceptance was without prejudice to the
filing of an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequent monthly rental payments were
likewise accepted by the </span>petitioner under the same condition.</p>

<p class="BODY">For failure of the private respondents to vacate the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">premises </span>as demanded in the letter
dated October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">9, 1984, the petitioner
filed with the Metropolitan Trial </span>Court of Manila complaints for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> against the former, as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) 105972-CV, against <span class="SpellE">Ederlina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Navalta</span>; (2) 105973-CV, against Jose <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span>; (3) 105974-CV, against Flora <span class="SpellE">Nagbuya</span>;
(4) 105975-CV, against <span class="SpellE">Leandro</span> <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>;
(5) 105976-CV, against Victoria <span class="SpellE">Sudario</span> and (6)
105977-CV, against <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> <span class="SpellE">Teng</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their respective answers, the six (6) private respondents
interposed a common defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
claimed that since the occupancy of the premises they paid <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">their </span>monthly rental <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">regularly </span>through a collector of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>; that their non-payment of the rentals for the
months of July, August and September, 1984, was due to the failure of the
petitioner (as the new owner) to send its collector; that they were at a loss
as to where they should pay their rentals; that sometime later, one of the
respondents called the office of the petitioner to inquire as to where they
would make such payments and he was told that a collector would be sent to
receive the same; that no collector was ever sent by the petitioner; and that
instead they received a uniform demand letter dated October 9, 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondents, thru counsel, later filed a motion for
consolidation of the six cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>as
a result thereof, the said<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> cases were
consolidated in the Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila, Branch XII, presided
over by Judge Eduardo S. <span class="SpellE">Quintos</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">June 4, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, the trial court rendered its decision
dismissing the six cases, a pertinent portion of which reads, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The records of this case show that at the time of the filing
of this complaint, the rentals had all been paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the plaintiff cannot eject the
defendants from the leased premises, because at the time these cases were
instituted, there are no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">rentals in
arrears.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The acceptance of the back rental by the plaintiff before the
filing of the complaint, as in <span class="GramE">these case</span>, the alleged
rental arrearages were paid immediately after receipt of the demand letter,
removes its cause of action in an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case,
even if the acceptance was without prejudice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, the court has observed that the account involved
which constitutes the rentals of the tenants are relatively small to which the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> may not lie on grounds of equity and for humanitarian
reasons.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants' counterclaim for litigation expenses has no legal
and factual basis for assessing the same against plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered dismissing these
cases, without pronouncement as to costs.</blockquote>

4.0pt">G.R. </span>No. 77647)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals defined the basic issue in this case as
follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether or not there exists a
cause <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>action when the
complaints for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> were filed
considering the fact that upon demand by petitioner from private respondents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for </span>payment of their back rentals, the
latter immediately tendered payment which was accepted by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In holding that there was no cause of action, the respondent
Court relied on Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">2, </span>Rule
70 of the Rules of Court, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>“Sec. 2 - Landlord to proceed against tenant only after demand. -
No landlord or his legal representative or assign, shall bring such action
against a tenant for failure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">t</span>o <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pay </span>rent due or to comply with the
conditions of his lease, unless the tenant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">shall have failed to pay such rent or comply with such conditions for a
period </span>of fifteen (15) days or five (5) days in case of building, after
demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, made upon him personally, or by
serving written notice of such demand upon the person found on the premises, or
by posting such notice on the premises if no persons be found thereon."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">It interpreted </span>the
said provision as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
right to bring an action of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> or unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> must be counted from the time the defendants
failed to pay rent after the demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not the failure per se to pay rent as
agreed in the contract, but the failure to pay the rent after a demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is made, that entitles the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
to bring an action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the demand contemplated by
the above-quoted provision is not a demand to vacate, but a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">demand made by the landlord upon his tenant
for the latter to pay the rent due.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
the tenant fails to comply with the said demand within the period provided, his
possession becomes unlawful and the landlord may then bring the action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>." (p. 28, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>,
G.R. No. 77647)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We hold that the demand
required and contemplated in Section 2, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">aforequoted</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> is a jurisdictional requirement for the purpose of
bringing an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> suit for failure to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pay </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">rent or comply </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the conditions of lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It partakes </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">an extrajudicial
remedy that must be pursued before resorting to judicial action so much </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">so </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">that when there is full compliance with the demand, there arises no
necessity for court action.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As to whether this demand
is merely a demand to pay rent or comply with the conditions of the lease or
also a demand to vacate, the answer can be gleaned from said Section 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This section presupposes the existence of a
cause of action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> as it speaks of
"failure to pay rent due or comply with the conditions of the lease."
The existence of said cause of action gives the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
the right under Article 1659 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the New Civil Code to ask </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">the rescission of the contract of lease and indemnification for
damages, or only the latter, allowing the contract to remain in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">force.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Accordingly, if the
option chosen is for specific performance, then the demand referred to is
obviously to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pay </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">rent or to comply with the conditions of the </span>lease
violated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, if rescission is the
option chosen, the demand must be for the lessee to pay rents or to comply with
the conditions of the lease and to vacate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the rule that has been followed in our jurisprudence where
rescission is clearly the option taken, is that both demands to pay rent and to
vacate are necessary to make a lessee a <span class="SpellE">deforciant</span> in
order that an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit may be filed (<span class="SpellE">Casilan</span>, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Tomassi</span>,
L-16574, February 28, 1964, 10 SCRA 261; <span class="SpellE">Rickards</span> vs.
Gonzales, 109 Phil. 423; <span class="SpellE">Dikit</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Icasiano</span>, 89 Phil. 44).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Thus, for the purpose of
bringing an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit, two requisites must
concur, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) there must be
failure to pay rent or comply with the conditions of the lease and (2) there
must be demand both to pay or to comply and vacate within </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">periods specified in Section 2, Rule 70, namely 15 days in case of
lands and 5 days in case of buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The first requisite refers to the existence of the cause of action for
unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> while the second refers to the
jurisdictional requirement of demand in order that said cause of action may be
pursued.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is very clear that in
the case at bar, no cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> has
accrued. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>There was no failure yet on the
part of private respondents to pay rents for three consecutive months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the terms of the individual verbal leases
which were on a month-to-month basis </span>were not alleged and proved, the
general rule on necessity of demand applies, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>there is default in the fulfillment of an
obligation when the creditor demands payment at the maturity of the obligation
or at anytime thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is explicit
in Article 1169, New Civil Code which provides that "(t<span class="GramE">)hose</span>
obliged to deliver or to do something incur in delay from the time the <span class="SpellE">obligee</span> judicially or <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
demands from them the fulfillment of their obligation." Petitioner has not
shown that its case falls on any of the following exceptions where demand is
not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">required:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) </span>when the obligation or the law so
declares; (b) when from the nature and circumstances of the obligation it can
be inferred that time is of the essence of the contract; and (c) when demand
would be useless, as when the obligor has rendered it beyond his power to
perform.</p>

<p class="BODY">The demand required in Article 1169 of the Civil Code may be in
any form, provided that it can be proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The proof of this demand lies upon the creditor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without such demand, oral or written, the
effects of default do not arise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
demand is different from the demand required under Section 2, Rule 70, which is
merely a jurisdictional requirement before an existing cause of action may be
pursued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts on record fail to show proof that petitioner demanded
the payment of the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> rentals when the
obligation matured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Coupled with the
fact that no collector was sent as previously done in the past, the private
respondents cannot be held guilty of <span class="SpellE"><u>mora</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>solvendi</u></span> or delay in the payment of rentals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when petitioner first demanded the
payment of the 3-month arrearages and private respondents lost no time in
making tender and payment, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">which </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">petitioner accepted, no cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> accrued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, its demand to vacate was premature as it was an exercise of a
non-existing right to rescind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In contradistinction,
where the right of rescission exists, payment of the arrearages in rental after
the demand to pay and to vacate under Section 2, Rule 70 does not extinguish
the cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> as the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> is not only entitled to recover the unpaid rents but
also to eject the lessee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner correctly
argues that </span>acceptance of tendered payment does not constitute a waiver
of the cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> especially when
accepted with the written condition that it was "without prejudice to the
filing of an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it is illogical or ridiculous not to
accept the tender of payment of rentals merely to preserve the right to file an
action for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this line of argument presupposes
that a cause of action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> has already
accrued, which is not true in the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner likewise claims that its failure to send a collector
to collect the rentals cannot be considered a valid defense for the reason that
sending a collector is not one of the obligations of the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">Article </span>1654.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is true that a <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not obligated to send a collector,
it has been </span>duly established that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">has </span>been customary for private respondents to pay the rentals
through a collector.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides Article
1257, New Civil Code provides that where no agreement has been designated for
the payment of the rentals, the place of payment is at the domicile of the
defendants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it could not be said
that they were in default in the payment of their rentals as the delay in
paying the same was not imputable to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, it was attributable to petitioner's omission or <span class="GramE">neglect</span> to collect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also argues that neither is its refusal to accept the
rentals a defense for non-payment as Article 1256 provides that "[<span class="SpellE">i</span>]f the creditor to whom the tender of payment has been
made refuses without just cause to accept it, the debtor shall be released from
responsibility by the consignation of the thing due." It bears emphasis
that in this case there was no unjustified refusal on the part of petitioner or
non-acceptance without reason that would constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>mora</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>accipiendi</u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">warrant
consignation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>There was simply
lack of demand for payment of the rentals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that respondent Court of
Appeals did not commit grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction in its conclusion affirming the trial court's decision dismissing
petitioner's complaint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">for lack of </span>cause
of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not agree, however,
with the reasons relied upon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
is hereby DENIED for lack of merit and the decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1987</st1:date> of respondent Court of Appeals
is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>
