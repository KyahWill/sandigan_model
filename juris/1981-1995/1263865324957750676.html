italic">a </span>petition<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> for <i>certiorari</i>
to annul <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">and set aside </span>the
decision of the National Labor Relations Commission affirming the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">granting of </span>the clearance to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">dismiss </span>herein petitioners in NLRC
Cases Nos. 7-929, 7-1062 and 7-1120.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears on record <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">that
herein </span>petitioners are employees of General Milling Corporation (GMC)
and members of Associated Labor Unions - VINCONTU (ALU).  GMC had a Collective Bargaining Agreement
(CBA) with ALU for a term of three (3) years from August 19, 1973 up to August
18, 1976.  The CBA contained a union
security clause or closed shop provision requiring union membership in good
standing as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>condition for
employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 20, 1976, while the CBA was in effect and within sixty
(60) days prior to the expiration of the CBA or within the so called
"freedom period", petitioners gave their written consent to the
petition for certification election filed by <u>ILAW</u> <u>at</u> <u style="text-underline:words">Buklod</u> <u style="text-underline:words"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ng</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <u style="text-underline:words">Manggagawa</u> </span>(IBM) a newly-organized
local union, with petitioner Ernesto Andaya as President, Juan Potot and Jose
Tumacao <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>members of the Board
of Directors, Archilles Alda as Treasurer, and Raymundo Yamson, Sotero Berdin
and Alberto Bacay <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>members.  As officers and members of IBM the
aforenamed petitioners actively campaigned for ALU members to resign and join
IBM.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the aforesaid acts of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">seven </span>petitioners they were charged with committing acts
inimical to the interest of ALU.  Investigation ensued in the absence of the seven petitioners as they
failed to appear despite notice, after which they <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">were </span>found guilty and expelled from ALU in accordance with
Section 10 of Article III of its Constitution and by-laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 13, 1976, ALU advised GMC of the expulsion of the seven
petitioners and requested, pursuant to the CBA, the termination of their
employment.  On July 15, 1976 the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">seven </span>petitioners received notice of
termination from the plant manager of GMC.  On July 22, 1976, GMC and ALU filed a joint <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
" courier="" new""="">application for clearance to dismiss the seven petitioners.  Said application was docketed as NLRC Case
No. 264 (NLRC No. 7-929).  On August 3,
1976 the Regional Director of the Department of Labor issued the clearance and
the seven petitioners were dismissed from employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Questioning the legality of their dismissal, the seven
petitioners filed a complaint for illegal dismissal and unfair labor
practice.  The case <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>docketed <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>NLRC Case No. 7-1062.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing, Labor Arbiter Pelagio <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">A. </span>Carpio rendered in NLRC Cases Nos.
7-929 &amp; 7-1062 <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>consolidated
decision dated June 30, 1977, the dispositive portion of which provides, viz:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">ALL
</span>THE FOREGOING CONSIDERATIONS, judgment is hereby rendered, ordering the
General Milling Corporation to reinstate the herein individual respondents
namely:  Juan Potot, Raymundo Yamson,
Sotero Berden, Achilles Alda and Jose Tunacao and Ernesto Andaya, to their
former positions without loss of seniority rights with full backwages from the
time of their dismissal on August 4, 1976 computed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">on </span>the basis of their latest salary,
until actually reinstated to be shouldered jointly and severally by the General
Milling Corporation and the Associated Labor Unions-Vincontu.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.” (pp. 67-68, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both GMC and ALU elevated the above decision to the NLRC which on
March 5, 1981 reversed the ruling of the Labor Arbiter and affirmed the
clearance for termination granted by the Regional Director.  In an En Banc resolution dated June 4, 1981
the NLRC likewise denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the other ten (10) petitioners (Ramon Cabalda,
Wenceslao Quilantang, Alfredo Pablo, Vicente Millama, Elmagecio <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Lastimosa, Manuel Bernaiha, Genaro Oyao, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Renato </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Visitacion, Rosalito Escopete and Nicasio Imbong), on August 7, 1976,
ALU advised GMC of their expulsion from the union and requested that their
services be terminated pursuant to the closed-shop provision.  On August 18, 1986, joint application for
clearance was filed by GMC and ALU which was docketed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as NLRC Case No. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">7-­1120.  On September 22, 1976, the Regional Director, Department of Labor,
granted the clearance and on September 30, 1976 the said petitioners were
dismissed.  Labor Arbiter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Teodorico </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">L. Ruiz sustained their dismissals in his decision dated September 20,
1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 4, 1977, the ten (10) petitioners received <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>copy of the Labor Arbiter's
decision.  By mail, they filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">six </span>copies of their appeal on October
18, 1977.  Payment of the appeal fee and
the submission of additional five (5) copies of the appeal memorandum were made
on October 19, 1977 (Rollo, p. 19).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 17, 1978 the NLRC resolved <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">to dismiss </span>the appeal in NLRC Case No
7-1120 on the ground that it was filed beyond the ten (10) day reglementary
period (Rollo, p. 157).  A motion for reconsideration
was filed on August 7, 1978 but it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>not resolved by the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 26, 1986 herein petitioners filed the instant
petition for <i>certiorari</i>.  The
deceased Nicasio Imbong one of the petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">represented in </span>the case by his wife Mrs. Imbong.  In this case petitioners seek the
nullification <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of
the </span>decisions of public <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">respondent in NLRC </span>Cases Nos. 7-929, 7-1062
and 7-1120 on the ground that with grave abuse of discretion the NLRC <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">allegedly committed serious error in
affirming the dismissal of herein petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At the outset the procedural issue raised by ALU in its comment
dated January 29, 1989 as to the timeliness of the petition must be settled
before we can proceed with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">resolution
of the other issues raised in this petition.  In its comment ALU pointed out, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">among others, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">that the instant petition dated
January 30, 1986, should be dismissed because it was not filed within a
reasonable time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Partly, We agree with ALU insofar as it concerns NLRC Cases Nos.
7-929 and 7-1062.  The record will show
that in a consolidated resolution dated June <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">4, </span>1981 (Rollo, pp. 276-277) the NLRC EN BANC Resolved to deny
the Motion for Reconsideration of the seven petitioners.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">From </span>June
9, 1981 up to February 26, 1986 the date of the filing of the instant petition
more than <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">four years had
lapsed.  The burden of establishing the
jurisdictional fact that the petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">65 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">was filed within a reasonable time
is on the seven petitioners.  However,
they conveniently omitted such material fact in their petition and despite
ALU's comment they did not in their consolidated reply refute the allegation
that the petition was not filed within a reasonable </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">time.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
" courier="" new""="">They did not even bother to offer an explanation </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">why it took
them </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">more than four
years from June 4, 1981 to file the instant petition.  Petitioners' silence is an eloquent admission that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""="">petition is indeed not filed within
a reasonable time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Delay in filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Supreme
Court may bar the petition.  Although
the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Rules </span>of Court, requires no definite
time frame <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">within which the petition
may be filed, jurisprudence has established the rule that it must be filed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new";mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"="">within <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>reasonable time (Dimayacyac</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:" courier="" new""=""> <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">v. Court of Appeals, 93 SCRA </span></span>256 [1979]).  Reasonable time has been defined as so much
time as is necessary under the circumstances for a reasonable, prudent and
diligent man to do (East Realty Investment <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Inc. v. Court of Appeals et al., 166 SCRA 256 [1988]).  </span>Thus, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in </span>the case of Philippine Overseas Drilling and Oil Respondent
Corporation v. Minister of Labor (146 SCRA 79 <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">[1986]) this Court ruled </span>that a petition filed four (4) months
after the petitioner received copy of the order sought to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">reviewed cannot be said </span>to have been
filed within a reasonable time.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the other ten (10) <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">petitioners in NLRC Case </span>No. 7-1120 the NLRC correctly ruled that
the appeal of the Labor Arbiter's decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">was </span>filed outside the reglementary period.  Under Article 223 of the Labor Code, a
decision of a labor arbiter is final and executory unless appealed to the
National Labor Relations Commission by any or both of the parties within ten
(10) days from notice of the decision.  The ten (10) day period required by law contemplates calendar <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">days and not working </span>days (Vir-Jen
Shipping and Marine Services <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">v. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">NLRC, 115 SCRA 347
[1982]).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar whether the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">decision of the labor </span>arbiter was received by petitioners on
October 5, 1977 <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>alleged in
their petition or on October 4, 1977 as found <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">by </span>the NLRC, the undisputed fact remains that the appeal <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">thru mail <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">was </span>filed only </span>on October 18, 1977 and the appeal fees
were <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">paid </span>on October 19, 1977,
after the expiration of the ten (10) calendar days reglementary period.  Perfection of an appeal within the period
prescribed by law is <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">jurisdictional (De
Los </span>Santos v. NLRC, G.R. 83927, June 28, 1989) so that the failure to
perfect an appeal has the effect of rendering the judgment final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing it appears unnecessary to discuss the
other issues raised in this petition.</p>
