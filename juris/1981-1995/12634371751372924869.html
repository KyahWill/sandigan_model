<p class="BODY">Complainant Chanda Lucas, who was born on 2 June 1973,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
testified that their house at 23-X Daropa Road, Baesa, Quezon City, has only
one bedroom.  On 26 November 1983, she
was sleeping in the bedroom with her brother and sisters.  Their mother did not sleep in their house at
that time.  At about 2:00 to 3:00 a.m.,
she awoke and realized that her father was removing her panty and shorts.  He cautioned her to keep quiet.  Then, her father, who was already naked,
went on top of her and placed his sexual organ inside her vagina.  She was hurt but did not resist because her
father threatened to kill her.  Only her
older sister Cynthia witnessed the incident.  Chanda reported the incident to her mother and her aunt but the former
did nothing.  When her aunt said that
her father should be jailed, her mother did not agree.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The 26 November 1983 incident was only the first of many
atrocities.  Since then, her father had
been repeatedly molesting her, especially when her mother was not around.  The last assault on her womanhood occurred
on 12 February 1991 when she was already seventeen years old.  Before he had sex with her at 3:00 a.m. on
12 February 1991, he first moved her brothers and sisters, who were sleeping in
the same room with her, to another place.  She did not resist because he had a <i><span style="">balisong</span></i><span style=""> </span>with
him and told her that he can take her life anytime.  After the sexual assault, he stood up holding his <i><span style="">balisong</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>and again said that she has only
one life and that he can take it anytime.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the morning of 16 February 1992, in the company of her mother
and uncle, she reported the incident to the police in their area.  The police investigator questioned her and
her sworn statement (Exhibit "D") was taken.  In the afternoon of that day, she submitted
to a medical examination at Camp Crame and a medical certificate was issued.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Cynthia Lucas Viado, the elder sister of Chanda, testified that
she witnessed the incident of 26 November 1983.  She was then thirteen years old while Chanda was only nine years
old.  She saw his father on top of
Chanda, then she closed her eyes and covered her face with a blanket.  She reported the incident and the fact that
she saw blood on the underwear of Chanda to her aunt Neneng and her mother; the
former was very angry upon learning of the incident but the latter did not
believe her; at that time, her mother loved her father dearly.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
On cross-examination, Cynthia declared that her father intended to sexually
abuse her on 26 November 1983 but because she resisted, her father instead
raped Chanda.  She was not able to help
Chanda because she was afraid of her father.  Their brother and another sister were not aware of the incident and they
did not wake them up because they were ashamed of their neighbors.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Emmanuel Aranas testified that he examined the complainant on
16 February 1991 at the Crime Laboratory Services at Camp Crame pursuant to a
letter-request<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
from Capt. Jaime Q. Peralta of the Central Police district, Quezon City.  His examination of her genitalia disclosed
healed lacerations, but he could not determine when the lacerations were
inflicted or sustained.  He concluded
that the complainant has had several sexual experiences and was no longer a
virgin.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He issued a written report of his findings.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> On
cross-examination, he declared that he found no sperm on the organ of the
complainant and that there were no signs of recent trauma or physical injuries
on her.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the witness stand, the accused testified that he and Chanda's
mother, Ofelia Austria, are not married; however, since 1969, they had been
living together as husband and wife until 1972, when he was detained for
alleged gunrunning and when Ofelia and the children moved to Cotabato.  They were reunited in 1977.  He denied having raped his second daughter,
Chanda, and alleged that the brothers and sisters of Ofelia, particularly
Leonardo Austria, were all angry at him and instigated the filing of the
fabricated charges against him.  He
further declared that Ofelia was angry at him because he intervened in guiding
the life of Chanda.  He could not recall
anymore where he was on 26 November 1983.  However, on 12 February 1991, he and Ofelia quarreled about Chanda's
frequent late arrivals from school and, because of the quarrel, he
"physically harmed" both of them.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 October 1992, the trial court promulgated its decision<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
in the two cases finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of two
crimes of rape.  The dispositive portion

In his brief submitted to this Court, he alleges that the trial court erred:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote><span style="">X X X </span>IN GIVING

<p class="BODY">As to the first assigned error, the accused asserts that the
conduct of his daughters, Chanda and Cynthia, after the alleged first sexual
abuse casts doubt on their credibility.  It is hard to believe that if Chanda were indeed raped by him when she
was only nine years old and repeatedly thereafter, she would report the abuses
only when she was seventeen years old.   Several remedies were available to her and she had relatives who
could extend their help.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">He also contends that the testimony of Cynthia is not convincing;
it was contrary to human experience and conduct for her to simply close her
eyes and cover her face with a blanket upon witnessing the rape of her younger
sister by their own father instead of helping Chanda.  If she was afraid of her father at that time, she could have
convinced Chanda to temporarily leave their house and seek shelter with her
relatives.  It was also unnatural for
her to abandon Chanda when, as she claims, she fully knew the bestial
tendencies of her father.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> As
to his wife, Ofelia, he attributes to her an ulterior motive when she consented
to the filing of the charges against him.  Except for the souring of their relationship which ended in their
separation, he finds no possible explanation why Ofelia believed Chanda's
report on the 12 February 1991 incident when she, Ofelia, refused to heed
Chanda and Cynthia's report concerning the 26 November 1983 incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second assigned error, he contends that he could not be
validly convicted of rape in Criminal Case No. Q-91-18466 under a complaint for
attempted rape only.  He cites the rule
that when the offense proved is more serious than that charged, the accused can
only be convicted of the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellee, through the Office of the Solicitor General, prays
that the judgment of conviction in Criminal Case No. Q-91­-18465 be affirmed <i><span style="">in </span>toto</i>.  However, it submits that the accused can be convicted only of
attempted rape in Criminal Case No. Q-91-18466.  The appellee argues that the trial court correctly gave credence
to the testimony of Chanda as it is "positive, straightforward and clearly
revelatory only of the truth of the facts she experienced, without any dubious
motive shown why she would bear false witness against appellant."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The reaction which the accused expected of Chanda after the first rape and
which she did not so manifest does not necessarily lead to a conclusion that
she fabricated her story.  As Chanda's
father, he exercised absolute authority and moral influence over her.  Moreover, at the tender age of nine, she was
totally helpless and defenseless.  And
regarding the imputed motive of Chanda's mother, the same is too trivial to
prompt her to falsely charge him with a grave crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first and third assigned errors raise a question of fact
which hinges on the credibility of the prosecution witnesses.  The second involves a question of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rape cases, this Court has been guided by three well?entrenched
principles:  (1) an accusation for rape
can be made with facility; it is difficult to prove but more difficult for the
person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic
nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually involved, the
testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme caution; and (3)
the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits and
cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the
defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Conclusions as to the credibility of witnesses in rape cases lie
heavily on the sound judgment of the trial court.  Accordingly, in the appreciation of the evidence, the appellate
court accords due deference to the trial court's views on who should be given
credence since the latter is in a better position to decide the question of the
credibility of witnesses, having seen and heard these witnesses and observed
their deportment and manner of testifying during the trial.  The trial court's findings concerning the
credibility of witnesses carry great weight and respect and will be sustained
by the appellate court unless the trial court overlooked, misunderstood or
misapplied some facts or circumstances of weight and substance which would have
affected the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful examination of the records and the evidence, we
are unable to find any cogent reason to disturb the finding of the trial court
that the accused raped his daughter, Chanda, on 26 November 1983 and 12
February 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first charge, there is, however, a variance
between the evidence presented and the allegations of the complaint.  The complaint in Criminal Case No.
Q-91-18465 charges the accused with the crime of rape committed on 26 November
1982.  Both Chanda and Cynthia, however,
testified that the incident took place on <u>26</u> <u>November</u> <u>1983</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused offered no objection to such evidence.  Consequently, the variance was not fatal to the prosecution.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>United States vs. Arcos</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Where time or place or any other fact alleged is not an
essential element of the crime charged, conviction may be had on proof of the
commission of the crime, even if it appear that the crime was not committed at
the precise time or placed alleged, or if the proof fails to sustain the
existence of some immaterial fact set out in the complaint, providing it
appears that the specific crime charged was in fact committed prior to the date
of the filing of the complaint or information within the period of the statute
of limitations, and at a place within the jurisdiction of the court.  (U.S. vs. Smith, and cases cited, 2 Phil.
Rep., 20)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The unobjected testimony of another date of the commission of the
crime charged in Criminal Case No. Q-91-18465 could even be the basis for an
amendment of the complaint to make it conform to the evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 14, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court also provides:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"SEC. 14. </span><i>Amendment.
--</i> The information or complaint may be amended, in substance and form,
without leave of court, at any time before the accused pleads; and thereafter
and during the trial as to all matters of form, by leave and at the discretion

accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x"<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Chanda was less than twelve years old when she was raped by the
accused on 26 November 1983.  Since she
was born on 2 June 1973, she was then exactly ten years, five months, and
twenty-four days old.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"ART. 335. </span><i>When
and how </i><i><span style="">rape </span>is committed</i>.
<span style="">-?</span><span style=""> </span>Rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a woman under

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The third paragraph is known as statutory
rape or the unlawful carnal knowledge of a woman below 12 years of age.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
Otherwise stated, carnal knowledge alone is sufficient for conviction as the
presence of any of the circumstances mentioned in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article

<p class="BODY">As found by the trial court and fully supported by the evidence,
the accused had carnal knowledge of his daughter Chanda -- then below twelve
years old -- on 26 November 1983.  We
are not persuaded by the arguments of the accused that if indeed she were raped
on that date and several times thereafter, she should not have kept her silence
until she was seventeen years old since she had all the available remedies for
redress as well as relatives who could help her.  The equanimity or the wisdom of more mature persons cannot be
expected from a young and immature girl like Chanda.  We have said before that the workings of a human mind when placed
under emotional stress are unpredictable and that people react differently to
various situations.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition to her tender age and immaturity, Chanda was, to say
the least, a victim of unfavorable circumstances not of her own making.  These prevented her from exposing earlier
the evil deeds of her father.  All that
she could proudly claim was a beautiful name -- Chanda.  She had no decent home.  Her father and her mother were not married
and were untrammeled by the bonds of lawful wedlock.  When she was born, her father was under detention for gunrunning
and it was only when she was four years old (1977) when he rejoined his
"family." Since then, all the members of the family slept in one
room.  Chanda had no choice of another
home, for it does not appear that another was available to the family or that
she was prepared to leave it because she had the means to face life alone or
that a kind soul had offered her shelter.  She was a victim of poverty and a virtual captive in the only
"home" her natural parents could provide, for she was entirely
dependent upon them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, she was completely under the moral ascendancy and control
of her father and the fear alone of a harsher life outside such a
"home" and of what her father would do if she would expose his evil
deeds, made her suffer in silence for a long time the excruciating pains his
assaults inflicted upon her.  Then too,
although she told her mother about the abuse committed by her father on 26
November 1983,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
her mother only got angry but did not do anything.  Chanda must have felt despair at such indifference.</p>

<p class="BODY">Her delay in reporting the sexual assaults to the authorities is
thus understandable and does not affect her credibility.  We do not believe that she would fabricate a
story of defloration against her own father, make public her painful and
humiliating experiences which are better kept in secret or forgotten, allow her
private parts to be examined, and eventually bring to shame her own family and
jeopardize her chances of marriage unless she was not telling the truth and was
motivated by nothing but the desire to obtain justice for the grievous wrongs
committed against her.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There was a consummated rape on 12 February 1991.  According to Chanda's testimony, at 3:00
a.m. that day, the accused, who had a <i><span style="">balisong
</span></i>with him, laid down beside her, threatened her that she had only one
life which he can take away any time; removed her shorts and panty and then
moved on top of her and inserted "his organ to her organ."
Thereafter, he stood up holding his <i><span style="">balisong</span></i><span style=""> </span>and reiterated his earlier threat.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering, however, that the complaint for this incident
subject of Criminal Case No. Q-91-18466 charges the accused with the crime of <u>attempted</u>
<u>rape</u>, then, as correctly pointed out by the accused in his second
assigned error and concurred in by the Office of the Solicitor General, he
cannot be convicted of consummated rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4, Rule 120 of the Rules of Court provides that
"[w]hen there is variance between the offense charged in the complaint or
information, and that proved or established by the evidence, and the offense as
charged is included in or necessarily includes the offense proved, the accused
shall be convicted of the offense proved included in that which is charged, or
of the offense charged included in that which is proved." The offense
charged in Criminal Case No. Q-91-18466 (attempted rape) is necessarily included
in the offense that was proved (consummated rape).  Accordingly, the accused should be convicted of <u>attempted</u> <u>rape</u>
<u>only</u>.  The penalty for attempted
rape is <i><span style="">prision mayor,</span></i><span style=""> </span>which is two degrees lower than that
provided by law for rape.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> The
accused is entitled to the benefits of the Indeterminate Sentence Law, and for
attempted rape he may be sentenced to a penalty whose minimum should be within
the range of <i><span style="">prision correccional </span></i>and
whose maximum should be within the range <span style="">of
</span><i><span style="">prision mayor, </span></i>taking
into account the modifying circumstances.  The alternative circumstance of relationship provided for in Article 15
of the Revised Penal Code should be appreciated against the accused considering
that the offended party, Chanda, is his descendant.  In crimes against chastity, such as rape, relationship is
aggravating.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Prior to R.A. No. 7659,<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a> the
presence of modifying circumstances would not affect the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua </span></i>prescribed for
the crime of rape because such a penalty was then indivisible and under Article
63 of the Revised Penal Code, when the law prescribes a single indivisible
penalty, it shall be applied by the courts regardless of any mitigating or
aggravating circumstances that may have attended the commission of the deed.  However, pursuant to Section 21 of R.A. No.
7659, which amended Article 27 of the Revised Penal Code, <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua</span></i><span style=""> </span>has now a defined duration, <i>i.e</i>.,
from <u><span style="">twenty</span></u><span style=""> <u>(20)</u> <u>years</u> <u>and</u> </span><u>one</u>
<u><span style="">(1)</span></u><span style=""> <u>day</u> </span><u>to</u> <u><span style="">forty</span></u><span style=""> <u>(40)</u> <u>years</u>.  </span>There
is, however, no corresponding amendment to Article 76 of the same Code for the
purpose of converting <i><span style="">reclusion
perpetua</span></i><span style=""> </span>into a
divisible penalty with three specific period -- minimum, medium, and maximum --
and including it in the table provided therein showing the duration and the
time included in each of the periods.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may thus be said that although the law has now fixed the
duration of <i><span style="">reclusion </span>perpetua</i>,
it did not make explicit its intention to convert it into a divisible
penalty.  In any event, Article 65 of
the Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART 65.  <i><span style="">Rules </span>in </i><i><span style="">cases in which the penalty is not composed of three periods. --</span></i><span style=""> </span>In cases in which the penalty
prescribed by law is not composed of three periods, the courts shall apply the
rules contained in the foregoing articles, dividing into three equal portions
of time included in the penalty prescribed, and forming one period of each of
the three portions."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">may be applied.  Accordingly, the time included in the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua </span></i>(twenty [20]
years and one [1] days to forty [40] years) can be divided into three equal
portions, with each composing a period.  The periods of <i><span style="">reclusion
perpetua </span></i>would then be as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">minimum  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>20 years and 1 day
to 26 years and 8 months</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">medium  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>26 years, 8
months and 1 day to 33 years and 4 months</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">maximum  -<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>34 years, 4 months and 1
day to 40 years</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Taking into account the presence of the aggravating circumstance
of relationship in Criminal Case No. Q-91-18465, the accused may finally be
sentenced to thirty-four (34) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering again such aggravating circumstance, the accused may
be sentenced in Criminal Case No. Q-91-18466 to an indeterminate penalty
ranging from four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of <i><span style="">prision correccional</span></i><span style=""> </span>maximum as <u><span style="">minimum</span></u><span style=""> </span>to
ten (10) years and one (1) day of <i><span style="">prision
mayor</span></i><span style=""> </span>maximum as <u><span style="">maximum</span></u><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There should also be awards for damages in each of the two cases.</p>
