<p class="BODY">Respondent Lee <span style="">also </span>claimed the additional amount of P295.00 which the former
allegedly paid Atty. Rivera, counsel for petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner denied all respondent’s allegations in her answer and
contended that although she signed for the amount <span style="">of P12,000.00 </span>as stated in the first cause of action, the real
amount she actually received from respondent was only P2,000.00 as shown in<span style=""> the l</span>atter's affidavit dated May 27,
1958; that the claims of respondent in <span style="">the
se</span><span style="">cond</span><span style="">, </span><span style="">third, four</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">h, fifth </span>and ninth causes <span style="">of </span>action

never received by her.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1972</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered <span style="">a </span>decision dismissing the complaint on the ground of

<p class="BODY">We find the petition devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first assigned error, petitioner alleges that the
action brought <span style="">by
</span>respondent Lee before the trial court is barred by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
on the ground of unreasonable delay of nine (9) years before the fil<span style="">i</span>ng of the action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> is the failure or neglect, for
an unreasonable length of time to do that which, by exercising due diligence
could or should have been done earlier; it is negligence or omission to <span style="">assert </span>a
right within <span style="">a
</span>reasonable time warranting a presumption that the party entitled to
assert it either has abandoned it or <span style="">declined
to assert it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Tijam</span>, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Sibonghanoy</span>,
G.R. 21450, April 15, 1968, 23 SCRA 29; <span class="SpellE">Tejido</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Zamacoma</span>, No. 63048, August 7, 1985, 138 SCRA 78).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The four basic elements
of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> are:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1) conduct on the part of the defendant, or of one under whom he claims,
giving rise to the situation of which complaint is made and for which the
complainant seeks a remedy; 2) delay in asserting the complainant's rights, the
complainant having had knowledge or notice of the defendant's conduct and
having been afforded an opportunity to institute suit; 3) lack of knowledge </span><span style="">or notice on </span><span style="">the part of the defendant that the
complainant would assert the right on which he bases his suit; and 4) injury or
prejudice to the defendant in the event relief is accorded to the complainant,
or the suit is not held to be barred.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the first element is present in this case, all the other
elements are missing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lapse of nine
(9) years within which respondent Lee had not instituted her suit cannot be
considered as unreasonable delay to warrant the application of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first
place, the action filed by <span style="">respondent
has not yet prescribed, since it </span><span style="">was </span><span style="">instituted
well within the period of ten (10) years from the time the cause of action
accrued as provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine
of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, being an equitable principle, should not
be applied to supplant what is clearly stated in the law, especially if it
would defeat and not promote justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the petitioner, in invoking <span class="SpellE">laches</span>,
has not sufficiently shown that she has no knowledge that <span style="">respondent Lee would assert her right for the
collection of the obligations which the former owes the </span>latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, petitioner admits the <span style="">existence of the real estate mortgages on the
properties and the promissory notes signed by her in </span>favor of respondent
Lee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although she raised the <span style="">defense of payment of all her debts in her
answer before the trial court, there was no proof presented evidencing payment
thereof as correctly found by the appellate court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there was more truth to the </span>allegations
of<span style=""> respondent, which were not refuted
by petitioner, that several demands had been made to the latter for the payment
of all her debts, and that petitioner had merely given her word and promises to
settle such obligations (p. 13, Brief for Private Respondent).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the doctrine of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>
cannot be taken against respondent where petitioner is shown to have promised
from time to time the relief sought for (<span class="SpellE">Cristobal</span> v.
<span class="SpellE">Melchor</span>, et al., G.R. No. L-43203, </span><st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="7"><span style="">July 29,
 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">, 78 SCRA 175)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the last element of <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, there
is no showing that the petitioner would be the party injured or prejudiced <span style="">if </span>the suit
is not held to be barred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was
satisfactory proof that petitioner owed the respondent several amounts of money
and that payment had not been made thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the suit is allowed to prosper against petitioner and the latter
adjudged liable, her liability would be confined merely to the <span style="">settlement of her due and demandable
obligations and the payment of proper interest to respondent for the default
incurred.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Laches</span>,
being an equitable defense, he who <span style="">invokes
</span>it must come to court with clean hands.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Bailon-Casilao</span> v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. 78178, April <span style="">15, 1988,
160 SCRA 738).</span></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second assigned error, petitioner submits that the
affidavit executed by respondent Lee dated <st1:date year="1958" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1958</st1:date> which states that the real indebtedness of
petitioner is only P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> with respect to the deed
of real estate mortgage should be given more weight than respondent's oral
testimony in court which states that the petitioner's obligation <span style="">is </span>P12,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said the respondent appellate court on this matter:</p>

mortgage for the amount of P12,000.00 and with the other facts and

by the evidence contained in the record, the burden of proving that it has been
extinguished by payment devolves upon the debtor who offers such a defense to
the claim of the creditor (Chua <span class="SpellE">Chienco</span> v. Vargas, 11
Phil. 219 cited in <span class="SpellE">Servicewide</span> Specialists Inc. v.
Hon. Intermediate Appellate Court, et al., G.R. No. 74553, June 8, 1989, 174
SCRA </span><span style="">80).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">In
the case at </span><span style="">bar, </span><span style="">all the </span><span style="">documents </span><span style="">evidencing
petitioner's debts are still in the possession of respondent Lee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No receipts or other satisfactory evidence
was presented by the petitioner to prove </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">alleged payment to
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Promissory notes in the
hands of the creditor are proofs of indebtedness rather than proofs of payment

70246, July 31, 1989, 175 SCRA 753).<span style="">&nbsp;

the Court of Appeals are final and conclusive and cannot be generally disturbed
on appeal by <i>certiorari</i> before this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the fourth assigned error, petitioner contends that courts

respondent, who is <span style="">a </span>prosperous business woman.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention must fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice must be done according to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Emotional appeals for justice while they may
