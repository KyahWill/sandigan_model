<p class="BODY">In this action, Traders Royal Bank filed a complaint against GM
WOOD and its President-General Manager, Sonia Gonzales, for the recovery of the
principal amount of P3,540,197.34 representing unpaid export advances. As
prayed for, on <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1980</st1:date>,
respondent Judge issued a Writ of Attachment on the machineries, assorted
lumber and office equipment of GM WOOD found in the factory situated at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
leased from BALINTAWAK. On <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="4">April 29,
 1980</st1:date>, attachment was partially lifted as agreed upon by the parties,
to enable GM WOOD to continue with its operations and meet the obligations to
Traders Royal Bank.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

of its factory at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, using its machinery and
office equipment that had been levied upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 28, 1981, GM WOOD filed a manifestation in the CFI case
stating that the Deputy Sheriff assigned to the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City Court was about to disturb the properties under attachment by virtue of an
<span class="SpellE">Ejectment</span> Order and moved that the Sheriff be
enjoined from doing so. As prayed for, respondent Judge issued the Order of <st1:date year="1981" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1981</st1:date>, challenged herein,
reading as follows:</p>

paid by defendants.</p>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By way of special appearance, petitioner filed a Motion for
Reconsideration with respondent Judge alleging lack of jurisdiction to issue
the afore-quoted Order, in the nature of an injunction, in so far as the <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> aspect of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City Court case is concerned, without notice, and that the same could not be
enforced outside <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>. Respondent Judge, in an Order
dated <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1981</st1:date>, refused
to take cognizance of the Motion as petitioner was not a party in the CFI case
and had no personality to file any pleading unless pursued in a proper
proceeding under the Rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">That denial prompted the filing of this Peti­tion for <i>Certiorari</i>
and Prohibition seeking to annul the Orders of <st1:date year="1981" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1981</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="6">June
 5, 1981</st1:date> issued by respondent Judge. On <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1981</st1:date>, we issued a Temporary Restraining Order
enjoining the enforcement of respondent Judge's Order, dated <st1:date year="1981" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the facts, we hold that respondent Judge of the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
acted with grave abuse of discretion tanta­mount to lack of or excess of
jurisdiction in enjoining the enforcement of a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> of the City Court of <span class="SpellE">Caloo­can</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is basic that once a judgment becomes final, the prevailing
party is entitled as a matter of right to a Writ of Execution, and the issuance
thereof is the Court's <span class="SpellE">ministrial</span> duty, compellable
by <i>Mandamus</i>. In fact, it has been fittingly said that "an execution
is the fruit and end of the suit, and is very aptly called the life of the
law."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner, therefore, as the prevailing party was entitled as a matter of
right to the execution of the judgment of <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
in its favor that had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. Particularly
so when it is considered that the machineries, assorted lumber and office
equipment, which are the subject of the attachment order, belong to GM WOOD,
but the leased premises do not. The building itself belongs to petitioner as <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and should not be subject to the attachment order
issued by respondent Judge. The right to possession of the leased premises
belongs to petitioner by virtue of a final judgment in its favor and respondent
Judge cannot defeat that right. In fact, neither did GM WOOD follow the correct
procedure in filing its "Manifestation and Motion" of <st1:date year="1981" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1981</st1:date> (supra) before
respondent Judge. What it should have done was to file a third-party claim in
order to defeat the Writ of Execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have noted that GM WOOD invokes equity in its favor in that it
is trying its best to update its rental obligations but that it has been faced
with unforeseen and oppressive circumstances and asks that it be given a chance
to rehabilitate itself.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Against this plea, however, is petitioner's equally urgent prayer in its Motion
to Expedite Resolution<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
that this case be resolved because, as of February 14, 1983, GM WOOD had an
accrued overdue and unpaid rentals <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
P500,000.00, plus interest. It should also be recalled that the <i>Certiorari</i>
petition filed by GM WOOD before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> seeking to enjoin the enforcement of the Writ of
Execution issued by the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Court was
dismissed, which dismissal was upheld by this Court in G. R. No. L-54410 as far
back as <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1980</st1:date>.
There can be no justifiable reason, therefore, for delaying execution in the <span class="SpellE">Ejectment</span> case any longer.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the conclusion arrived at, we find no need to resolve the
other issues raised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Orders issued by respondent Judge, dated <st1:date year="1981" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1981</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1981</st1:date>, are hereby annulled and
set aside and the Metropolitan Trial court, corresponding to the former City
Court of <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>, may proceed with the enforcement
of the Alias Writ of Execution that it had issued in Civil Case No. 13446. The
temporary Restraining Order issued by this Court on <st1:date year="1981" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1981</st1:date> addressed to respondent Court is
