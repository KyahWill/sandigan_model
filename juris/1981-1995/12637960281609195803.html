<p class="BODY">Paz M. Dingle, herein petitioner, and her husband Nestor Dingle, 
are owners of a family business known as "PMD Enterprises" which was managed by 
the latter.</p>
<p class="BODY">Nestor Dingle entered into a transaction with one Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> whereby PMD Enterprises would sell 400 of washed silica 
sand to <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> gave as 
advanced payment a certain amount to Nestor Dingle.</p>
<p class="BODY">Nestor Dingle, however, failed to deliver the 400 tons of washed 
silica sand, so he issued to <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> two (2) postdated 
checks drawn by him and his wife as <span class="CharacterStyle1"><span>authorized 
signatories of PMD Enterprises in the total amount of P51<span class="GramE">,885.93</span> representing the value of the undelivered washed 
silica sand.<span>&nbsp; </span>The checks were dishonored for being "drawn against 
insufficient funds." When informed of the dishonor Nestor Dingle replaced the 
checks with one (1) Equitable Banking Corporation Check in the amount of 
P51<span class="GramE">,885.93</span> which was also signed by both 
spouses.<span>&nbsp; </span>This was also dishonored.<span>&nbsp; </span>Two (2) letters 
were sent to and received by Nestor Dingle for the payment of the amount covered 
by the dishonored check.<span>&nbsp; </span>No payment was made.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, 
the spouses were charged with the violation of BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 
22, otherwise known as the Anti-Bouncing Check Law.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The trial court found them guilty as charged and sentenced 
each of them to suffer imprisonment of six (6) months of <span class="SpellE"><em>arresto</em></span><em> mayor</em>, to pay a</span> fine<span> 
of P52<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to indemnify the offended party the 
amount of P51,885.92.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Paz Dingle appealed and the Intermediate Appellate Court 
(now the Court of Appeals)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
</span><span>modified </span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span>the decision by 
imposing upon her the penalty of imprisonment for a period of only 30 
days.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Insisting on her innocence, Paz Dingle filed the instant 
petition contending that she did not incur any criminal liability under BP 22 
because she had no knowledge of the dishonor of the checks issued by her 
</span><span class="CharacterStyle1"><span>husband and for that matter even the 
transaction of her husband with <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Solicitor General in his Memorandum <em>recommended that 
petitioner be acquitted of the instant charge</em> because from the testimony of 
the sole prosecution witness Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>, it was 
established that he dealt exclusively with Nestor <span class="SpellE">Ang</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nowhere in his testimony is the name of 
Paz Dingle ever mentioned in connection with the transaction and with the 
issuance of the check.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Ang</span> 
categorically stated that it was Nestor Dingle who received his two (2) letters 
of demand.<span>&nbsp; </span>This lends credence to the testimony of Paz Dingle that 
she signed the questioned checks in blank together with her husband without any 
knowledge of its issuance, much less of the transaction and the fact of 
dishonor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case of <span class="SpellE"><em>Florentino</em></span><em> Lozano vs. Hon. Martinez</em>, 
promulgated </span><st1:date month="12" day="18" year="1986"><span>December 18, 
1986</span></st1:date><span>, it was held that an essential element of the 
offense is <em>knowledge</em> on the part of the maker or drawer of the check of 
the insufficiency of his funds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>WHEREFORE</span></b><span>, on reasonable doubt, the 
assailed decision of the Intermediate Appellate Court (now the Court of Appeals) 
is hereby SET ASIDE and a new one is hereby rendered ACQUITTING petitioner on 
reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE"><strong>SO 
ORDERED</strong>.</span></p><span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Fernan</span>, (Chairman), <span class="SpellE">Alampay</span>,
