ordered <span class="SpellE">Ernefe</span> to lie down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then appellant placed himself on top of her,

the aunt of <span class="SpellE">Ernefe</span> uttered to him:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘Kung <span class="SpellE">ikaw</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">lang</span></span>, <span class="SpellE">kaya</span>

appellant answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="SpellE">Bakit</span>?’
But that man left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant stayed
overnight at the wake and went home the following day.</blockquote>

appellant went to the prospective lessee Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>
to collect the agreed rental but since Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>
offered a check and not cash, he told her to leave the house but she did not
leave because she was waiting for a policeman from <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also went to the residence of the <st1:city><st1:place>Marshall</st1:place></st1:city>
to ask <span class="SpellE">Ernefe's</span> uncle to retract what he said in the
evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he was confronted by a daughter of Evelyn
Marshall who berated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had an
altercation with her and when he realized that he was quarrelling with a woman,
appellant decided to leave the <st1:city><st1:place>Marshall</st1:place></st1:city>'s
residence.</blockquote>

while appellant was again attending the wake, Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>
arrived with a male companion and told him that she would already pay the
rental in cash.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he was surprised
when Pat. Jack Miranda suddenly handcuffed him for threatening the lessee and
he was brought to the police sub-station 1 at <span class="SpellE">Edwardson</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Marikina</span></span></st1:place></st1:city> where he met Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Pasanas</span> where Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>
charged him of grave threats but the case was later dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In connection with this case, appellant
executed a Joint Affidavit (Exhibits "G" &amp; "G-1")
together with Janette Enriquez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
support his alibi, appellant presented Janette Enriquez who testified that
appellant was with her shopping at <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> until they
went home at <span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> in the evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;

 <st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place> where she left appellant
and went home alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also
presented Leonardo B. <span class="SpellE">Requinala</span> who testified that a
confrontation occurred in the evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1987</st1:date> between appellant and Ramon <span class="SpellE">Juanillo</span> where the complainant was asked to identify him
and she told them that appellant was not the one who raped and robbed her.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is only one issue to be resolved in this case - whether or
not the accused is guilty <span style="">of </span>the
offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the trial court's conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant's defense of denial and
alibi cannot stand against his positive identification by the victim (People v.
<span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, G.R. No. 65017 [1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>, G.R. No. 76531 [1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Millarpe</span>, 134 SCRA 555 [1985]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that it was improbable for him to have
committed the crime considering that he was then at the house of his
sister-in-law, Margie <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span> at <span class="SpellE">Parang</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He and Janette Enriquez, a boarder of his
sister-in-law later went to <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span> to go
shopping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, they went home to
eat supper and both <span style="">proceeded to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Modesta</span></span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Village</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">San </span><span style="">Mateo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Rizal</span></span> to meet with
a </span><span style="">certain Lo</span><span style="">urdes <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The alibi of the
accused-appellant hardly inspires </span>belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, there was no single proof of
purchase which would prove that they indeed went shopping and no <span style="">reason was given to explain the urgency of
the shopping.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was her supposed
meeting with </span><span style="">their </span><span style="">prospective lessee believable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is totally contrary to </span><span style="">human </span><span style="">experience to negotiate a contract such as a lease </span>during the
late hours of the night.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise <span style="">perplexing why Janette Enriquez would opt to
board </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">house </span><span style="">of the appellant's
sister-in-law </span><span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Parang</span></span><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Marikina</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> during that month when her permanent
residence which is at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Matatag</span></span><span style=""> Street</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> is nearer
to <span class="SpellE">Morayta</span> where she was then attending review
classes for her board examination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above facts render
the testimonies of the accused and Janette Enriquez doubtful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The same is true with
regard to the testimonies of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Tanods</span> who claim that the accused was not pinpointed by the
victim when the latter was in a car together with some police officers and was
asked to identify </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">was her assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, it can be said that the
testimonies </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">these <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">tanods</span> are not far from being coached and fabricated
because the records show that the victim positively identified the accused in a
police line-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the 3-hour
ordeal suffered by the victim in the hands of her tormentors in a place which
was sufficiently lighted by a <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> </span><span style="">post </span><span style="">gave <span class="SpellE">Ernefe</span>, the victim, sufficient
opportunity to see their faces.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There can be <span style="">no </span>mistaken
identity as claimed by the accused-appellant because the face of the accused
was familiar to the victim, the former having frequently passed <span style="">by </span>the house where she was
staying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both lived in the same street
and the accused was known to be a trouble-maker in their place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the short <span class="GramE">pants
which was</span> presented by the prosecution as belonging to the assailant
fitted the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense of denial and alibi pales in comparison with
the victim's positive <span style="">and </span>straightforward
declaration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Between the version of the
complainant and appellant, complainant's version is more credible (People v. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, 151 SCRA 696 [1987]) because when a woman
testifies that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to
show that rape was committed provided her testimony is clear and free from
contradiction (People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcid</span>, 135 SCRA 280 <span style="">[1985]; People v. Alfonso, 153 SCRA 487
[1987]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no reason to doubt the
complainant's narration and testimony that she was threatened with death, was
robbed, and raped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Furthermore, the appellant
has not shown any improper motive on the part of the victim <span style="">for </span>her to testify as she did (People
v. <span class="SpellE">Esquillo</span>, 171 SCRA [1989]<span style=""> citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, 143 SCRA 428
[1986]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the crime was
corroborated by physical facts gathered at the crime scene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> insinuation that he was
charged by the complainant because of the misunderstanding which ensued between
him and the victim's uncle is without basis.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The remark from the victim's uncle presupposes an incident before
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was uttered precisely because he
was identified as a suspect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue involved in this case is the credibility of the
witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is left primarily to the
Trial Judge to assess in view of his advantage in observing their demeanor on
the stand (People v. Lisbon and <span class="SpellE">Bebanco</span>, G.R. No.
63396, November 15, 1989; People v. <span class="SpellE">Canamo</span>, 13 SCRA
141 [1985]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is an oft-repeated
fundamental rule in criminal as well as civil cases (<span class="SpellE">Montañez</span>
v. People, G.R. No. 72199, <st1:date year="1989" day="29" month="11">November
 29, 1989</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, for the defense of alibi to prosper, it does
not suffice to prove the whereabouts of the accused at the time the crime was
committed; it must be undisputedly demonstrated that at the time of the
commission of the crime, it was physically impossible for the suspect to have
been at, or near, the scene of the crime (People v. <span class="SpellE">Aragona</span>,
138 SCRA 569 [1985]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Manzanares</span>, 177 SCRA
427 [1989]; People v. Cruz, 177 SCRA 451 [1989]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the distance between the
scene of the crime in <span class="SpellE">Parang</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>, and <span class="SpellE">Cubao</span>
is only a 30-minute drive by any kind of motor vehicle.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of all the foregoing, we find no reversible error in the
trial court's finding that the appellant, Gerry V. <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span>
is guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of robbery with rape and that
the appealed decision with the exception of the amount to be paid by way of
reparation of the stolen cash and other personal belongings of <span class="SpellE">Ernefe</span> <span class="SpellE">Devierte</span> which should be
increased to P440.00 is in accordance with law and the evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records show that <span class="SpellE">Ernefe</span>
was robbed of P160.00 cash, a pair of pants worth P200.00 and a bottle of
lotion valued at P80.00.</p>
