				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The instant Petition for "<em>Certiorari</em>, <em>Mandamus</em> and Prohibition with Preliminary Injunction" seeks to set aside the Order, dated June 7, 1982, of respond­ent Judge in the case entitled "Better Buildings, Inc. vs. Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company" (Civil Case No. 39943), authorizing execution pending appeal of the judgment requiring payment by petitioner-defend­ant of the sum of P311 ,328.78 to respondent-plaintiff, Better Buildings, Inc. <p>The Better Buildings, Inc. (BBI, for brevity) had been supplying the Philippine Long Distance Tele­phone Company (PLDT) janitorial maintenance and sani­tation services at the latter's different offices for more than ten years already. </p> <p>Sometime in 1977, BBI requested PLDT for readjustment of its monthly billings due to the increase in prices of cleaning materials and the payment of more benefits to its employees as mandated by the Labor Code and other Presidential Decrees.&nbsp; On September 18, 1978, PLDT agreed to the readjustment but in the reduced amount of P550.00 monthly per janitor instead of the proposed price of P595.00.&nbsp; According to BBI, based on PLDT's counter offer, a total of P315 ,906.03 became due and payable to BBI, but that PLDT paid only P103,281.25 leaving unpaid the sum of P212,624.78. </p> <p>On February 4, 1981, BBI filed a complaint against PLDT before the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch XIII (CC No. 39943), presided by respondent Judge, for the recovery of said balance plus the amounts of P29 ,038.25 and P7,400.00 repre­senting the balance of regular billings and special jobs, respectively, and attorney's fees equivalent to 25% of its claim. </p> <p>In its Answer, PLDT denied any liabilities contending mainly that BBI is an independent contractor, the true and actual employer of its employees and is, therefore, liable and responsible for the pay­ment of all benefits and compensation due them under existing laws; that BBI can not hold PLDT liable for any amount in excess of the agreed payment of P550.00 per month; and that the invoices submitted by BBI to substantiate its claims have been either paid already, exaggerated, or of doubtful validity. </p> <p>At the pre-trial on October 15, 1981, respondent Judge allowed BBI to mark its documentary evidence, terminated the pre-trial, and set the case for trial on the merits.&nbsp; The Order read in part: </p> <p>"Considering that the only issue in this case is payment which is raised as a defense by the defendant, the parties agreed to terminate the pre-trial". </p> <p>On January 6, 1982, respondent Judge admitted all of BBI's documentary evidence over PLDT's ob­jections and set the case for reception of PLDT's evidence. </p> <p>After several postponements, when the case was again set for reception of PLDT's evidence on March 18, 1982, PLDT's counsel moved for postponement on the ground of sudden illness of its witness.&nbsp; Objected to by the BBI attorney, postponement was denied and PLDT was "considered to have waived its right to present its evidence and the case is deemed submitted for decision." </p> <p>On April 27, 1982, a Decision was rendered awarding to BBI all the amounts it had prayed for, thus: </p> <p>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defend­ant directing the latter to pay the former the following: </p> <p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the sum of P212 ,624.78 representing the adjust­ments from May 1976 to December, 1977 to take care of the extra fringe benefits advanced by plaintiff to its person­nel embodied in the Labor Code, and P.Ds. 825, 851, 928 and 1123, together with the legal rate of interest due thereon, computed from May 1976 until such time as defend­ant shall have paid in full the said P212,624.78; </p> <p>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of P29 ,038.25 representing the balance of its regular billings; </p> <p>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sum of P7 ,400.00 representing cost of special job rendered by plaintiff; </p> <p>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorney's fees equivalent to 25% of plaintiff's claim and </p> <p>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Costs of suit. </p> <p>SO ORDERED."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p> <p>On May 27, 1982, twenty-three (23) days after receipt of the Decision, PLDT filed a Motion for New Trial and/or Reconsideration contending that PLDT had never admitted its liability during the pre­-trial, that BBI's documentary evidence consisting of requests for adjustments were not shown to have been approved by it (PLDT), and that PLDT was deprived of its day in Court as it was not permitted to adduce evidence in its defense. </p> <p>On a date that does not appear of record, BBI filed a "Motion for Immediate Execution and Opposi­tion to Motion for New Trial and/or Reconsideration". </p> <p>On June 7, 1982, respondent Judge issued the assailed Order denying reconsideration and/or new trial on the ground that she found no valid reason to alter her Decision, and that "after the lapse of seven (7) months, it (PLDT) can not now be allowed to raise in issue the correctness or accurateness of the contents of the pre-trial order." </p> <p>In the same Order of June 7, 1982, respondent Judge granted BBI's "Motion for Immediate Execution" on the ground that there was a "clear intention" on the part of PLDT "to delay the proceedings in this case" adding that: </p> <p>"The defendant was given ample opportunity to prove its defense of payment.&nbsp; It failed to avail itself of the chance. </p> <p>"Since the liability has already been admitted, and it appears from the records that the plaintiff has already ad­vanced the sums due it to the laborers/janitors entitled to what is being claimed in this case, the Court finds the motion for immediate execution meritorious". </p> <p>The aforestated Order was followed the day after, or on June 8, 1982, with the corresponding Writ of Execution, which is also challenged herein. </p> <p>On June 9, 1982, PLDT filed the instant Petition praying for a judgment declaring the Order dated June 7, 1982 authorizing execution, as well as the Writ itself under date of June 8, 1982, null and void for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion as there exist no good and special reasons to warrant the same. </p> <p>On June 14, 1982, this Court required BBI to Comment, and issued a temporary Restraining Order enjoining respondents from enforcing the Writ of Execution dated June 8, 1982. </p> <p>Subsequent pleadings submitted by the parties show that on June 8, 1982, PLDT had filed a Notice of Appeal and a cash bond.&nbsp; This was followed on June 14, 1982 with a Record on Appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></p> <p>Further, on June 15, 1982, BBI filed a "Motion for the Approval of the Bill of Costs", <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>attaching thereto the following: </p> <p>"BILL OF COST </p> <p>Claim on Par. (a) - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P212,624.78 </p> <p>Legal rate of interest:&nbsp; 21% </p> <p>Duration: Six (6) years and one (1) month </p> <p>P212 ,624.78 x 21% x 6 years and one month </p> <p>= P673 ,980.66 </p> <p>Total &nbsp;- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P673,980.66 </p> <p>Add: Claim on Par.

PLDT underscores the absence of "good reasons" as a basis for the issuance of execution pending appeal. We agree. The existence of good reasons is what confers discretionary power on a Court of First Instance to issue a writ of execution pending appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> The "delay" cited by respondent Judge as the rationale behind the issuance of execution pending appeal is not per se a good and valid reason. Neither is the apprehension that the appeal of a defeated party is merely dilatory sufficient to justify execution pending appeal. </p><blockquote> <p>" . . . unless the appeal is unquestionably dilatory, the allusion made by the trial court that the appeal being taken by respondent is only for the purpose of delay (Annex Q) cannot be a valid reason. This assumption prematurely judges the merits of the appeal (City of Bacolod vs. Enriquez, et al., supra) x x x ".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>Moreover, the impression of respondent Judge that "the only issue in this case is payment, which is raised as a defense by the defendant",<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> is based on a misappreciation of PLDT's position. As early as its Answer, PLDT denied any liability. At the pre-trial, its counsel also had occasion to clarify its stand: </p><blockquote> <p>"Atty. Palabrica - </p> <p>"Our records show that full payments had been made to them in accordance with the agreement. So, we are not admit­ting our liability for the said amounts."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> </p></blockquote> <p>In its Motion for New Trial and/or Reconsider­ation,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> PLDT also specifically contended: </p><blockquote> <p>"x x x Although defendant agreed to the adjustment, plaintiff was not able to prove by substantial evidence as to the number of its employees who actually rendered service to the defendant during the disputed period in order to determine the actual amount due the plaintiff. x x x " </p></blockquote> <p>Faced with those contentions, it behooved respondent Judge to have reopened the case for the reception of PLDT's evidence. Even granting that PLDT had sought several postponements, the require­ments of substantial justice mandate that PLDT should have been given its day in Court. The grant of a reasonable continuance would have been sounder judi­cial discretion to ferret out the truth. </p><p>It thus becomes obvious that the urgency of the execution was not clearly patent nor the right of BBI as the prevailing party to the relief of execution pending appeal undeniable. </p><blockquote> <p>2. The approval by respondent Judge of BBI's Bill of Costs ex-parte was likewise in grave abuse of discretion. Firstly, the judgment had not yet become final because of PLDT's appeal. </p></blockquote> <p>Secondly, the items listed depart from the basic meaning of judicial costs, that is the expenses of litigation as between litigants,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> or the statutory allowance to a party to an action for his expenses incurred in the action, and having reference only to the parties and the amounts paid by them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> Section 10, Rule 142 of the Rules regulates the costs that may be recovered by a prevailing party in Courts of First Instance.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> The monetary sums awarded in a judgment are never taxed as costs. The proper mode for securing satisfaction therefor is through execution pursuant to the Rules. </p><p>Thirdly, a Bill of Costs, in the first instance, is passed upon by the Clerk of Court although either party may appeal to the Court from the Clerk's taxation. In acting on the Bill of Costs initially and approving it immediately, respondent Judge contravened Section 8, Rule 142 of the Rules of Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Moreover, PLDT claims that it was never sent the required notice. </p><p>In respect of attorney's fees as costs, Sec. 6 of the same Rule 142 likewise explicitly provides: </p><blockquote> <p>"SEC. 6. Attorney's fees as costs. - No attorney's fees shall be taxed as costs against the ad­verse party, except as provided by the rules of civil law. But this section shall have no relation to the fees to be charged by an attorney as against his client." </p></blockquote> <p>Clearly, attorney's fees are not normally taxable as costs. Those fees are not included within the ex­penses and costs of any trial or proceeding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> Nor is this case an instance where the rules of civil law allow attorney's fees as costs. </p><p>BBI likewise used 21% as the basis for the computation of interest, which rate was immediately approved by respondent Judge. This is patent error. The Decision in this case stipulated "legal rate of interest", supra. BBI's ratiocination that it was the rate of interest paid by it when it borrowed money from the banks with which to pay its janitors because of PLDT's refusal to make such payment is absolutely untenable. That factor is completely immaterial and irrelevant in the computation of the legal rate of interest awarded in a judgment. </p><p><strong>WHEREFORE,</strong> granting the Writs prayed for, the Order, dated June 7, 1982, and the Writ of Execution, dated June 8, 1982, having been issued by respondent Judge with grave abuse of discretion, are hereby NULLIFIED; 2) granting other "just and equitable reliefs" prayed for, the Decision rendered by respond­ent Judge under date of April 27, 1982 is also SET ASIDE and respondent Judge is hereby directed to re-­open Civil Case No. 39943 for the reception of the evidence of petitioner Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, and thereafter to render judgment as the facts and evidence may warrant; 3) petitioner, as defendant in that case, shall present its evidence with the least possible delay, limiting requests for postponement to the minimum; and 4) the temporary Restraining Order heretofore issued is hereby made permanent. </p><p>Costs against private respondent.
