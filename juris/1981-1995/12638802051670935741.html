				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">The controversy at bar
had its origin in the "wage distortions" affecting the employees of
respondent San Miguel Corporation allegedly caused by Republic Act No. 6727,
otherwise known as the Wage Rationalization Act.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Upon the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the Act on June 5, 1989, the union known as </span><span style="">"</span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">Ilaw</i></span><i style=""> at <span class="SpellE">Buklod</span> Ng <span class="SpellE">Manggagawa</span>
</i><i style=""><span style="">(IBM)</span></i><span style="">" -- </span><span style="">said to represent 4,500 employees of San
Miguel Corporation, more or less, “working at the various plants, offices, and
warehouses located at the National Capital Region" -- presented to the
company a "demand" for correction of the "significant distortion
in ** (the workers) wages." In that "demand," the Union
explicitly invoked Section </span>4 <span style="">(d)
of RA 6727 which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“ * * * * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(d) <span style="">* * * * *<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Where the application of the increases in the wage rates under this
Section results in distortions as defined under existing laws in the wage
structure within an establishment and gives rise to a dispute therein, such
dispute shall first be settled voluntarily between the parties and <span class="GramE">in</span> the event of a deadlock, the same shall be finally
resolved through compulsory arbitration by the regional branches of the
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) having jurisdiction over the
workplace.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It shall be mandatory for the NLRC to conduct continuous hearings
and decide any dispute arising under this Section within twenty (20) calendar
days from the time said dispute is formally submitted to it for
arbitration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of a dispute arising from a wage distortion shall not in any way delay the applicability
of the increase in the wage rates prescribed under this Section."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">But the Union claims that
that "demand" was ignored:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The ** COMPANY ignored said demand by offering a measly
across-the-board wage increase of P7.00 per day, per employee, as against the
proposal of the UNION of P25.00 per day, per employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the UNION reduced its proposal to
P15.00 per day, per employee by way of amicable settlement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the ** COMPANY rejected the reduced proposal of the UNION, the
members thereof, on their own accord, refused to render overtime services, most
especially at the Beer Bottling Plants at Polo, starting October 16,
1989."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In this connection, the
workers involved issued a joint notice reading as follows:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Union's position (set

refusal "to work beyond eight (8) hours everyday starting October 16,
1989" as a legitimate means of compelling SMC to correct "the
distortion in their wages brought about by the implementation of the said laws
(R.A. 6640 and R.A. 6727) to newly-hired employees."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> That decision to observe the "eight

"ten (10) hours for the first shift and ten (10) to fourteen (14) hours
for the second shift, from Mondays to Fridays **; (and on) Saturdays, ** eight
(8) hours for both shifts" -- a work schedule which, SMC says, the workers
had "welcomed, and <span style="">encouraged"
because the automatic overtime built into the schedule "gave them a steady
source of extra-income," and pursuant to which it (SMC) "planned its
production targets and budgets."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This abandonment of the
long-standing schedule of work and the reversion to the eight-hour shift
apparently caused substantial losses to SMC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its claim is that there ensued "from 16 October 1989 to 30 November
1989 alone ** work disruption and lower efficiency ** (resulting in turn, in)
lost production of 2,004,105 cases of beer *<span class="GramE">* ;</span> that (<span class="SpellE">i</span>)n "money terms, SMC lost P174,657,598 in sales and
P48,904,311 in revenues ** (and the) Government lost excise tax revenue of P42

taken by SMC as organizing "a third shift composed of regular employees
and some <span class="SpellE">contractuals</span>," and appeals "to the
Union members, through letters and memoranda and dialogues with their plant
delegates and shop stewards," to adhere to the existing work schedule.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Thereafter, on October
18, 1989, SMC filed with the Arbitration Branch of the National Labor Relations
Commission a complaint against the Union and its members "to declare the
strike or slowdown illegal" and to terminate the employment of the union
officers and shop stewards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint was docketed as NLRC-NCR Case No. 00-10-04917.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Then on December 8, 1989,
on the claim that its action in the Arbitration Branch had as yet "yielded
no relief," SMC filed another complaint against the Union and members
thereof, this time directly with the National Labor Relations Commission,
"to enjoin and restrain illegal slowdown and for damages, with prayer for
the issuance of a cease-and-desist and temporary restraining order."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Before acting on the application for

</span>The first two settings were cancelled on account of the unavailability

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->the NLRC "gravely abused its discretion
when it refused to decide the application for injunction within the twenty day
period of its temporary restraining order, in violation of its own rules and
the repeated decisions of this ** Court."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is <span style="">SMC's </span>submittal
that the coordinated reduction by the Union's members of the work time
theretofore willingly and consistently observed by them, thereby causing
financial losses to the employer in order to compel it to yield to the demand
for correction of "wage distortions," is an illegal and
"unprotected" activity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is,
SMC argues, contrary to the law and to the collective bargaining agreement
between it and the Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The argument
is correct and will be sustained.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the rights guaranteed to employees by the Labor Code is
that of engaging in concerted activities in order to attain their legitimate
objectives. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Article 263 of the Labor
Code, as amended, declares that in line with "the policy of the State to
encourage free trade unionism and free collective bargaining, ** (w)<span class="SpellE">orkers</span> shall have the right to engage in concerted
activities for <span style="">purposes </span>of
collective bargaining or for their mutual benefit and protection." A
similar right to engage in concerted activities for mutual benefit and
protection is tacitly and traditionally recognized in respect of employers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The more common of these
concerted activities as far as employees are concerned are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>strikes -- the temporary stoppage of </span><span style="">work as a result </span><span style="">of an industrial or labor dispute; picketing
-- the marching to and fro at the employer's premises, usually accompanied by
the display of placards and other signs making known the facts involved in a
labor dispute; and boycotts -- the concerted refusal to patronize an employer's
goods or services and to persuade others to a like refusal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the counterpart activity
that management may licitly undertake is the lockout -- the temporary refusal
to furnish work on account of a labor dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In this connection, the same Article 263 provides that the "right
of legitimate labor organizations to strike and picket and of employer to
lockout, consistent with the national interest, shall continue to be recognized
and respected." The legality of these activities is usually dependent on
the legality of the purposes sought to be attained and the means employed <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It goes without saying that these joint or coordinated activities
may be forbidden or restricted by law or contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the particular instance of
"distortions of the wage structure within an establishment" resulting
from "the application of any prescribed wage increase by virtue of a law
or wage order," Section 3 of Republic Act No. 6727 prescribes a specific,
detailed and comprehensive procedure for the correction thereof, thereby
implicitly excluding strikes or lockouts or other concerted activities as <span style="">a modes of settlement of the issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> states that?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ten (10) calendar days of conciliation, shall be <i style="">referred to the appropriate branch of the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC)</i><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It shall be mandatory for the NLRC to

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The legislative intent
that solution of the problem of wage distortions shall be sought by voluntary
negotiation or arbitration, and not </span>by <span style="">strikes, lockouts, or other concerted activities of the employees or

of the quotation,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> also prescribes a similar eschewal of
strikes or other similar or related concerted activities as a mode of resolving
disputes or controversies, generally, said agreement clearly stating that
settlement of "all disputes, disagreements or controversies of any
kind" should be achieved by the stipulated grievance procedure and
ultimately by arbitration. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
provisions are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any and all disputes, disagreements and
controversies of any kind between the COMPANY and the UNION and/or the workers
involving or relating to wages, hours of work, conditions of employment and/or
employer-employee relations arising during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Agreement or any renewal thereof, shall be settled by arbitration in
accordance with the procedure set out in this Article.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No dispute, disagreement or controversy which
may be submitted to the grievance procedure in Article IX shall be presented
for arbitration unless all the steps of the grievance procedure <span style="">are </span>exhausted"
(Article V - Arbitration).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The UNION agrees that there shall be no
strikes, walkouts, stoppage or slowdown of work, boycotts, secondary boycotts,
refusal to handle any merchandise, picketing, sit-down strikes of any kind,
sympathetic or general strikes, or <span style="">any
</span>other interference with any of the operations of the COMPANY during the
terms of this agreement" (Article VI).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Union was thus
prohibited to declare and hold a strike or otherwise engage in non-peaceful
concerted activities for the settlement of its controversy with SMC in respect
of wage distortions, or for that matter, any other issue "involving or
relating to wages, hours of work, <span class="GramE">conditions</span> of
employment and/or employer-employee relations." The partial strike or
concerted refusal by the Union members to follow the five-year-old work
schedule which they had theretofore been observing, resorted to as a means of coercing
correction of "wage distortions," was </span>therefore <span style="">forbidden by law and contract and, on this
account, illegal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Awareness by the Union of the proscribed character of its
members' collective activities, is clearly connoted by its attempt to justify those
activities as a means of protesting and obtaining redress against said members
working overtime every day from Monday to Friday (on an average of 12 hours),
and every Saturday (on 8-hour <span style="">shifts),</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>rather than as a measure to bring
about rectification of the wage distortions caused by RA 6727 -- which was the
real cause of its differences with SMC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By concealing the real cause of their dispute with management (alleged
failure of correction of wage distortion), and trying to make it appear that
the controversy involved application of the eight-hour labor law, they
obviously hoped to remove their case from the operation of the rules
implementing RA 6727 that "<i>Any issue involving wage distortion shall
not be a ground for a strike / lockout</i><span style="">." </span>The stratagem cannot succeed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, that it was indeed the wage distortion issue
that principally motivated the Union's partial or limited strike is clear from
the facts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The work schedule (with
"built-in overtime") had not been forced upon the workers; it had
been agreed upon between SMC and its workers at the Polo Plant and indeed, had
been religiously followed with mutually beneficial results for the past five
(5) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it could not be
considered a matter of such great prejudice to the workers as to give rise to <span style="">a </span>controversy between them and
management.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the workers
never asked, nor were there ever any negotiations at their instance, for<span style=""> a</span> change in that work schedule prior
to the strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What really bothered
them, and was in fact the subject of talks between their representatives <span style="">and </span>management, was the “wage
distortion” question, a fact made even more apparent by the joint notice
circulated by them prior to the strike, i.e., that they would adopt the
eight-hour work shift in the meantime pending correction by management of the
wage distortion <span style="">(</span><i style="">IPATUPAD MUNA ANG EIGHT HOURS WORK SHIFT
PANSAMANTALA HABANG HINDI IPINATUTUPAD NG </i><span style="">SMC MANAGEMENT </span><i style="">ANG TAMANG </i><span style="">WAGE DISTORTION").</span><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, even if there were no such legal prohibition,
and even assuming the controversy really did not involve the wage distortions
caused by RA 6727, the concerted activity in question would <span style="">still </span>be <span style="">illicit </span>because contrary to the workers' explicit contractual
commitment "that there shall be no strikes, walkouts, stoppage or slowdown
of work, boycotts, secondary boycotts, refusal to handle any merchandise,
picketing, sit-down strikes of any kind, sympathetic or general strikes, or any
other interference with any of the operations of the COMPANY during the term of
** (their collective bargaining) agreement."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What has <span style="">just </span>been
said makes unnecessary resolution of SMC's argument that the workers' <span style="">concerted </span>refusal to adhere to the
work schedule in force for the last several years, is a <i style="">slowdown</i><span style="">, </span>an inherently
illegal activity essentially illegal even in the absence of a no-strike clause
in a collective bargaining contract, or statute or rule.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is in substantial agreement with
the petitioner's concept of a slowdown as a "strike on the installment
plan;" as a <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> reduction in the rate of work
by concerted action of workers for the purpose of restricting the output of the
employer, in relation to a labor dispute; as an activity by which workers,
without a complete stoppage of work, retard production or their performance of
duties <span style="">and </span>functions to compel
management to grant <span style="">their demands.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The Court also agrees that such a slowdown
is generally condemned as inherently illicit and unjustifiable, because while
the employees "continue to work and remain at their positions and accept
the wages paid to them," they at the same time "select what part of
their allotted tasks they care to perform of their own volition or refuse
openly or secretly, to the employer's damage, to do other work;" in other
words, they "work on their own terms."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> <span class="GramE">But whether or not the
workers' activity in question -- their concerted adoption of a different work
schedule than that prescribed by management and adhered to for several years --
constitutes a slowdown need not, as already stated, be gone into.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it to say that that activity is
contrary to the law, RA 6727, and the parties' collective bargaining agreement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Union's claim that the restraining order is void because
issued by Commissioners whose appointments had not been duly confirmed by the
Commission on Appointments should be as it is hereby given short shrift, for,
as the Solicitor General points out, it is an admitted fact that the members of
the respondent Commission were actually appointed by the President of the
Philippines on November 18, 1989; there is no evidence whatever in support of
the Union's bare allegation that the appointments of said members had not been
confirmed; and the familiar presumption of regularity in appointment and in
performance of official duty exists in their favor.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also untenable is the Union's other argument that the respondent
NLRC Division had no jurisdiction to issue the temporary restraining order or
otherwise grant the preliminary injunction prayed for by SMC and that, even
assuming the contrary, the restraining order had been improperly issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds that the respondent
Commission had acted entirely in accord with applicable provisions of the Labor
Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 254 of the Code provides that "No temporary or permanent
injunction or restraining order in any case involving or growing out of labor
disputes shall be issued by any court or other entity, except as otherwise
provided in Articles 218 and 264 * *." Article 264 lists down specific
"prohibited activities" which may be forbidden or stopped by a
restraining order or injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article
218 <i style=""><span style="">inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>enumerates the powers of the National Labor
Relations Commission and lays down then conditions under which a restraining
order or preliminary injunction may issue, and the procedure to be followed in
issuing the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Among the powers expressly conferred on the Commission by Article
218 is the power to "enjoin or restrain any actual or threatened
commission of any or all prohibited or unlawful acts or to require the
performance of a particular act in any labor dispute which, if not restrained
or performed forthwith, may cause grave or irreparable damage to any party or
render ineffectual any decision in favor of such party **."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The record reveals that
the Commission exercised the power directly and plainly granted to it by

it faithfully observed the procedure and complied with the conditions for the
exercise of that power prescribed in said sub-paragraph (e).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It acted on SMC's application for immediate

it found SMC's evidence adequate and issued the temporary restraining order
