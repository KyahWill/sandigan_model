				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An action for damages based on quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span>
(Art. 2176 of the Civil Code) was filed by private respondent against
petitioner. The action arose from a vehicular accident that occurred on 5
August 1979 in <span class="SpellE">Gapan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, when Martin <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>,
while driving a cargo truck belonging to petitioner, rammed "head-on"
the store-residence of the private respondent, causing damages thereto which
were inventoried and assessed at P53,024.22.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his answer to the complaint, the petitioner alleged
principally: "that his driver Martin <span class="SpellE">Belmonte</span>
operated said cargo truck in a very diligent (and) careful manner; that the
steering wheel refused to respond to his effort and as a result of a blown-out
tire and despite application of his brakes, the said cargo truck hit the
store-residence of plaintiff (private respondent) and that the said accident
was an act of God for which he cannot be held liable"<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also filed a third party complaint against <span class="SpellE">Travellers</span> Insurance and Surety Corporation, alleging that
said cargo truck involved in the vehicular accident, belonging to the
petitioner, was insured by the third party defendant insurance company.
Petitioner asked that the latter be ordered to pay him whatever amount he may
be ordered by the court to pay to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rendered judgment in favor of private respondent.
Upon appeal to the Court of Appeals, the latter court affirmed in <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the decision of the trial court, which ordered
petitioner to pay, jointly and severally with <span class="SpellE">Travellers</span>
.Insurance and Surety Corporation, to the private respondent the following: (a)
P53<span class="GramE">,024.22</span> as actual damages; (b) P10,000.00 as moral
damages; (c) P10,000.00 as exemplary damages; and (d) the sum of P5.000.00 for
attorney's fees and the costs. On the third party complaint, the insurance
company was sentenced to pay to the petitioner the following: (a) P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for third party liability under its comprehensive
accident insurance policy; and (b) P3,000.00 for and as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for review on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">certiorari</i>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention that the respondent court erred in
finding him guilty of fault or negligence is. <span class="GramE">not</span>
tenable. It was established by competent evidence that the requisites of a
quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> are present in the case at bar. These
requisites are: (1) damages to the plaintiff; (2) negligence, by act or
omission, of which defendant, or some person for whose acts he must respond,
was guilty; and (3) the connection of cause and effect between such negligence
and the damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that private respondent suffered damages as a
result of an act or omission of petitioner. The issue of whether or not this
act or omission can be considered as a "negligent" act or omission
was passed upon by the trial court. The findings of said court, affirmed by the
respondent court, which we are not prepared to now disturb, show that the fact
of occurrence of the "vehicular accident" was sufficiently
established by the police report and the testimony of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Masiclat</span>. And the fact of negligence may be deduced from
the surrounding circumstances thereof. According to the police report,
"the cargo truck was <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> on the right
side of the road going to Manila and then it crossed to the center line and
went to the left side of the highway; it then bumped a tricycle; and then
another tricycle; and then said cargo truck rammed the store-warehouse of the
plaintiff"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>,</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the driver of the cargo truck, he applied the brakes
but the latter did not work due to mechanical defect. Contrary to the claim of
the petitioner, a mishap caused by defective brakes can not be considered as
fortuitous in character. Certainly, the defeats were curable and the accident
preventable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the petitioner failed to adduce any evidence to
overcome the disputable presumption of negligence on his part in the selection
and supervision of his driver.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing finding by the respondent Court that there
was negligence on the part of the petitioner, the petitioner's contention that
the respondent court erred in awarding private respondent actual, moral and
exemplary damages as well as attorney's fees and costs, is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">ACCORDINGLY</b>, the
petition is DENIED.</p>
