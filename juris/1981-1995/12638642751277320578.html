decreeing the confirmation of title of the applicants?<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
under Republic Act No. 496 in relation to Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended,
over an area identified as Lot No. 1736, Cadastral Survey of Orion, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said Lot No. 1736 is a large tract of agricultural land situated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>Barrio Kapok, Orion, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, containing 233.6883 hectares, alleged to have been
occupied since 1913 by the grandfather of applicant Arturo Rodriguez, the late
Vicente Rodriguez, who, during his lifetime filed Lease Application No. 1206
with the Bureau of Lands, but which application was rejected upon investigation
and ascertainment that the land was classified as within the U.S.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Military Reservation (<span class="SpellE">Mariveles</span>)

dated <st1:date year="1925" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1925</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the death of Vicente Rodriguez in 1924, possession of the
property was taken over by his sons, <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span>
Rodriguez (the father of applicant Arturo Rodriguez) and Pablo Rodriguez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently in an instrument of quitclaim,
both <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> and Pablo Rodriguez waived their rights
as heirs of the late Vicente Rodriguez over the subject property ceding all
their participation, ownership and possession thereon in favor of Arturo
Rodriguez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Arturo Rodriguez
sold two-thirds (2/3) undivided portion of the land to Guillermo Reyes and
Francisco S. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 29, 1965, Arturo Rodriquez together with Guillermo
Reyes and Francisco S. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> filed a verified
petition for registration of their title to Lot No. 1736 of the Cadastral
Survey of Orion, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> under Act No. 496 alleging
that they, by themselves and through their predecessors-in-interest had been in
open, continuous, exclusive and adverse possession thereof in the concept of
owners for more than thirty (30) years immediately preceding the filing of
their application.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Land

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date>,
the remaining applicants, Arturo Rodriguez and Guillermo Reyes, filed an
amended application incorporating an allegation that the heirs of Vicente
Rodriguez, the original possessor of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 1736,
namely <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> Rodriguez and Pablo Rodriguez, had
relinquished their rights and participation in <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 1736
in favor of Arturo Rodriguez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirty-nine (39) persons headed by <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Canaria</span> filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">their
</span>Opposition to the petition for registration contending, among others,
that they have been in actual, peaceful, adverse and continuous possession of
portions of Lot No. 1736 for more than thirty (30) years and have introduced
improvements thereon consisting of fruit-bearing trees; that the applicants
have never been in possession of the property; and that applicant Arturo
Rodriguez could not have inherited the land from his grandfather, because the
children of Vicente Rodriguez are still living.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands likewise filed his opposition alleging that
neither the applicants nor their predecessors-in-interest possess sufficient
title to the land applied for, as they have not been in open, continuous,
exclusive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>notorious
possession <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>occupation of the
land sought to be registered for at least thirty (30) years immediately

</span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1966</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> <span class="SpellE">Rosauro</span> <span class="SpellE">Canaria</span>, et al., filed a motion to dismiss the petition for
registration stating that the cause of action is barred by a prior
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said motion was denied on <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1966</st1:date> for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1967</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> Director of Lands filed a "Motion to
Dismiss or for Reconsideration" of the Order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1966</st1:date> alleging in substance that the
present petition for registration was intended to reopen Cadastral Case
No.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>15, L.R.C. Record No. 1021, wherein
a cadastral court already declared Lot 1736 as public land; that the
application for registration cannot be treated as a pleading for the reopening
of the cadastral case as provided under Republic Act No. 931 because it does
not contain material allegations justifying the applicants' failure to file
their answer during the cadastral proceedings; and that a decision in a
cadastral case constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated July 12, 1967, the lower court ruled in favor
of the applicants confirming their title to Lot 1736 of Orion Cadastre, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> and ordering its registration in the names of said
applicants in the following proportion:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>2/3 undivided portion to Arturo Rodriguez and 1/3 undivided portion to
Guillermo Reyes.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The Director of Lands and the private <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>
seasonably filed their respective notices of appeal and their joint record on
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, private <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>' appeal was dismissed by the appellate court in
its resolution dated <st1:date year="1969" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1969</st1:date>
on the ground that the record on appeal did not show that they filed an appeal
bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 2, 1976, the Court of Appeals promulgated its decision
penned by Justice Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> and concurred in by
Justices Ramon C. Fernandez and <span class="SpellE">Delfin</span> Fl. <span class="SpellE">Batacan</span>, reversing and setting aside the decision of the
lower court on the ground that the land in question had been decreed in 1938 to
be part of the public domain by the cadastral court in proceedings commenced as
early as 1927 and which had become final thereby constituting a bar to the
subsequent application for registration on the principle of <span class="SpellE">res</span>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Such declaration according to the appellate court is binding upon the
applicants even if they did not take part in the proceedings as claimants or <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> and therefore the trial court had no further
jurisdiction to entertain the case at bar.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">A</span>pplicants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> filed a motion for the reconsideration of the
appellate court's decision alleging three grounds, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the decision in Cadastral Proceedings
No. 15, Record No. 1021 does not constitute <span class="SpellE">res</span> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span> on the same land subject of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">present </span>application for land
registration; that the application for land registration and/or confirmation of
an imperfect title is not a petition for reopening of the cadastral
proceedings; and that the trial court had jurisdiction over the land
registration case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated November 10, 1976,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court of Appeals thru a division of five and by a vote of four to one
reversed its decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>ruled
that the prior decision of the cadastral court declaring the lot in question as
public land way back in 1930 does not bar the present application for
registration of title or confirmation of imperfect title under­ Act 496 of the
same parcel of land citing the case of <u>Mindanao</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Director</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Lands</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

the land subject of the application.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's main contention in elevating the case to this Court
is that the case of <u>Mindanao</u> relied upon by the appellate court in
reversing its original decision is not applicable to the case at bar the basic
and fundamental distinction resting on the fact that the declaration of the
land in question <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>public land
in said case was made in ordinary land registration proceedings which was a
voluntary application commenced by a private party under Act 496, whereas in
this case, the land in question was declared public land in compulsory
cadastral proceedings initiated by the government under the Cadastral Act.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioner consequently cites the case of <u>Navarro</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Director</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Lands</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
as the more appropriate and applicable decision wherein it was ruled that where
the parcels of land sought to be registered are the same lots already declared
public lands in a cadastral proceedings where the applicant and the Director of
Lands were parties, and the applicant failed to show acquisition of the lands
by any of the legal modes of acquiring public lands, the decision declaring the
lots part of the public domain must be deemed <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We grant the petition but not on the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
invoked by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, the land
in question had been declared public land in a decision rendered by the
cadastral court in Cadastral Case No. 15, Record No. 1021.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Factually, however, there is no prior final
judgment at all to speak of because, as we explained in the case of <u>Director</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Lands</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>a decision <span class="GramE">in a
cadastral proceedings</span> declaring a lot public land is not the final
decree contemplated in Sections 38 and 40 of the Land Registration Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a judicial declaration that a parcel of
land is <span class="GramE">public,</span> does not preclude the same applicant
from subsequently seeking a judicial confirmation of his title to the same
land, provided he thereafter complies with the provisions of Section 48 of
Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, and as long as said public land remains
alienable and disposable.</p>

<p class="BODY">When Cadastral Case No. 15 was instituted in 1927 and terminated
in 1930, the land in question was still classified as within the U.S. Military
Reservation per Proclamation No. 10 of the Governor General of the Philippines
dated February 16, 1925 and was deemed reverted to the public domain only in
1953.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this basis, the Court finds
that the decision in the aforesaid <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cadastral
case </span>does not constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">judicata</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>upon a subsequent action for land
registration considering the futility of filing any claim then over the land in
question since the same would nevertheless have been denied due to the fact
that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the cadastral case, said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">land </span>was not alienable nor disposable
and this was shown by the denial of the lease application filed then by private
respondents' predecessor-in-interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be unfair to consider the said cadastral decision as
binding upon private respondents because there was nothing they could have done
then to protect their rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently,
at that time they had no <span class="SpellE">registrable</span> right to speak
of considering that in 1927, private respondents' possession could not have met
the thirty year requirement under the law, their predecessor-in-interest having
entered the land only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>1913, which
if computed up to 1927 would add up to only fourteen (14) years.</p>

<p class="BODY">But while the cadastral proceedings in 1927 cannot be considered
a bar to the registration proceedings instituted by private respondents in 1965,
the chronology of events in the case at bar clearly negates compliance by
private respondents-applicants with the thirty-year possession
requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The intervening period
commencing from the promulgation of Proclamation No. 10 of the Governor-General
of the Philippines in 1925 declaring the land in question as part of the U.S.
Military Reservation until 1953 when the land was deemed reverted back to the
public domain disturbed private respondents-applicants’ possession over the
land in question because during this interregnum, no amount of time in whatever
nature <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>possession could have
ripen such possession into private ownership, the land having been segregated
as part of a military reservation.</p>

<p class="BODY">This circumstance considered, private respondents’ claim of open,
continuous, exclusive and notorious possession over the land in question should
be counted only from 1953.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering
that the application for registration was filed in 1965, obviously, the
thirty-year requirement had not been met at the time the action for
registration was filed and therefore it was error on the part of the appellate
court to rule that the applicants already possessed a <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>
title over the land in question.</p>
