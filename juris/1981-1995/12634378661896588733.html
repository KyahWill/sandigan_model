bar, but we shall reduce the penalty to conform to R.A. No. 7659, to which we
have given retroactive effect whenever favorable to the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial of Rosario Gabriel for violation of the Dangerous
Drugs Act, the prosecution sought to prove that in the morning of November 29,
1989, Rodolfo Ventura, a 17-year old student, appeared before the Laoag City
Integrated National Police with the information that the appellant was engaged
in the illicit trade of marijuana in the town of San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Station Commander Major Ricardo Antalan thereupon organized a buy-bust team
composed of Cpl. Rodrigo Ventura, Cpl. Walter Tuzon, Pfc. Warlito Maruquin,
Pfc. Marlin Ramos, Pat. Virgilio Adobas and Pat. Ruby Manuel Balolong.  Rodolfo Ventura was designated as
poseur-buyer and provided with two twenty-peso bills, the serial numbers of
which were recorded in the police blotter of the Laoag City PNP.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
At around 5:00 o'clock that afternoon, the team went to the San Nicolas market
area where the police operatives deployed themselves.  Ventura then approached Rosario (a male person) and asked to buy
marijuana from him.  The latter told him
to wait and then left, returning after about 3 to 5 minutes with a package
wrapped in aluminum foil.  He handed
this to Ventura after receiving the marked money.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> At
this juncture, the other team members closed in and arrested Rosario.  They took him to the police station at San
Nicolas where they retrieved the two marked bills from him.  The team then went to the Laoag City INP where,
after examination of the contents of the two packages and finding marijuana
leaves therein, they forwarded the same to the Provincial Processing Center of
the PC/INP Crime Laboratory Service at Camp Juan, Laoag City.  Later, the specimens were taken to the Crime
Laboratory of Camp Diego Silang, San Fernando, La Union, then to the PC/INP
Crime Laboratory Service of Camp Crame, Quezon City, where the leaves were
subjected to chemical, thin layer photographic, and microscopic examinations.  The tests yielded positive results for
marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense had a different story.  The accused testified that on November 29, 1989, he went to the
barrio of Dingras, Ilocos Norte, to sell <i>galunggong</i>.  Afterwards, he inquired about the current
price of fish at the market of San Nicolas.  As he was leaving for home, someone approached him and asked him
"if there is something," but since he did not know what that person
was talking about, he just ignored him.  He then went home, changed his clothes, and proceeded to his brother's
house, which was situated near the market.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> As he
was about to enter the house, four men grabbed him and boarded him in a
vehicle, then took him first to the Municipal Hall of San Nicolas and later to
the police station of Laoag City.  He
was searched there and nothing was found on him except the P700 he had earned
from the sale of the fish.  The
policemen counted the money, took two P20.00 bills and copied the serial
numbers.  They then accused him of
peddling marijuana.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Grace Gabriel (also a male) corroborated the appellant's
testimony.  He declared that in the
afternoon of November 29, 1989, while on his way home from work, he saw a
vehicle which stopped in front of his house.  Somebody got off, approached and collared his half-brother Rosario, who
was standing near the door of his house.  He inquired what Rosario had done.  All they said was that they were members of the police force.  He asked Rosario what he had done and the
latter replied that he had done nothing wrong.  The policemen then forced the accused into the vehicle.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Minviluz C. Astudillo of the Regional Trial Court of Ilocos
Norte chose to believe the prosecution and in her decision dated March 26,
1993, disposed as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, from the facts established, the Court finds ROSARIO
GABRIEL Y POLA alias BOY GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of selling
a prohibited drug under Article II, Section 4, of Republic Act No. 6425 as
amended, and imposes upon him the penalty of LIFE IMPRISONMENT.  He is further ordered to pay a fine of
TWENTY THOUSAND (P20,000.00) PESOS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant faults this decision in his appeal for alleged
inconsistencies in the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses, but we find
that they are only minor discrepancies that do not impair the essential
veracity of their sworn declarations.  We do not agree that the appellant was merely "framed," as he
claims, for there is no evidence of this allegation.  Neither are we persuaded that the policemen tried to extort money
from him, as he also makes this assertion without proof.  In the absence of clear and convincing
evidence to the contrary,<span style=""> </span>the
presumption in favor of the apprehending officers that they have regularly
performed their official duty should be observed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the factual findings of the trial judge because she had
the advantage of observing first-hand the deportment of the witnesses and was
therefore in a better position to form accurate impressions and conclusions on
their credibility.  As we observed in
People vs. de Guzman:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>In the resolution of the factual issues, the Court relies heavily
on the trial court for its evaluation of the witnesses and their
credibility.  Having the opportunity to
observe them on the stand, the trial judge is able to detect that sometimes
thin line between fact and prevarication that will determine the guilt or
innocence of the accused.  That line may
not be discernible from a mere reading of the impersonal record by the
reviewing court.  The record will not
reveal those tell-tale signs that will affirm the truth or expose the
contrivance, like the angry flush of an insisted assertion or the sudden pallor
of a discovered lie or the tremulous mutter of a reluctant answer or the
forthright tone of a ready reply.  The
record will not show if the eyes have darted in evasion or looked down in
confession or gazed steadily with a serenity that has nothing to distort or
conceal.  The record will not show if
tears were shed in anger, or in shame, or in remembered pain, or in feigned
innocence.  Only the judge trying the
case can see all these and on the basis of his observations arrive at an
informed and reasoned verdict.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>questioned
decision should, however, be modified in line with R.A. No. 7659, which took
effect on December 31, 1993, and amended <i>inter alia, </i>R.A. No. 6425,
otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.  Sections 13 &amp; 17 of the new law provide that the penalty of <i>reclusion
perpetua </i>to death and a fine ranging from P500,000.00 to P10,000,000.00
shall be imposed for the sale, administration, delivery, transportation and
distribution of 750 grams or more of indian hemp or marijuana.  However, if the quantity involved is less
than 750 grams, the penalty shall range from "<i>prison correccional</i>
to <i>reclusion perpetua</i>, depending upon the quantity."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the recent cases of People vs. de Lara<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> and
People vs. Simon,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court held that where the quantity of the drugs involved is less than 750
grams, Section 17 of R.A. No. 7659 should be interpreted as providing for a
penalty ranging from <i>prision correccional </i>to <i>reclusion temporal </i>only,
and not <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.  These cases also read the second paragraph of Sec. 17, particularly the
phrase "<i>prision correccional </i>to <i>reclusion perpetua </i><u><span style="">depending upon the quantity</span></u><span style="">," </span>to mean that "if the
marijuana involved is below 250 grams, the penalty to be imposed shall be <i>prision
correccional; </i>from 250 to 499 grams, <i>prision mayor; </i>and 500 to 749
grams, <i>reclusion temporal</i>.  Parenthetically, fine is imposed as conjunctive penalty only if the
penalty is <i>reclusion perpetua </i>to death."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the two packages of marijuana fruiting tops
had a total weight of only 9.98 grams as averred in the information
itself.  Hence, the penalty to be
imposed should be <i>prision correccional, </i>which, under the Indeterminate
Sentence Law as interpreted in the Simon Case, may be lowered to an
indeterminate penalty ranging from <i>arresto mayor, </i>as minimum, to <i>prision
correccional, </i>as maximum.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED, but with
the modification that the appellant shall be sentenced to suffer an
indeterminate penalty of FIVE (5) months of <i>arresto mayor, </i>as minimum,
to FIVE (5) years of <i>prision correccional, </i>as maximum, conformably to
R.A. No. 7659.  Costs against the
appellant.</p>
