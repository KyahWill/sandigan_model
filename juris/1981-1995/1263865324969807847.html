Mira, <span class="SpellE">Balbina</span> <span class="SpellE">Calayo</span>, her

Mira who were defendants in Civil Case No. 2548 (Victoria <span class="SpellE">Llona</span>,
et al. <span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE">Camilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pareja</span>, et al.) guilty of contempt of court for
having returned to the unregistered parcels of lands subject of the action and
gathered products therein after the possession thereof had been delivered to
the plaintiffs pursuant to the final judgment in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants contend that they could not be
cited for contempt inasmuch as the motion for contempt is an incident of the
decision in Civil Case No. 2548 which has become <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span> considering that the lands in dispute
are disposable and alienable <span style="">part </span>of
the public domain and that during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
contempt proceedings, they were awarded titles over the disputed lands pursuant
to their free patent applications with the Bureau of Lands which has the
authority under the law to dispose of public lands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resolution of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> was appealed to the Court of Appeals but the
latter court certified the appeal to <span class="GramE">Us</span> since only

the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> on March 12, 1946
as shown by the annotation of registration (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

same parcel of land to the spouses Agustin Maldonado and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span>

Maldonado had this parcel of land declared in his name, Tax Declaration No.

A); said sale in favor of the plaintiffs <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Llona</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">Llave</span> was duly registered at the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Sorsogon</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.

parcel of land was then declared for taxation purposes in the name of <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span> <span class="SpellE">Llona</span> under Tax
Declaration No. 7875 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. F), which was later

question three times - the first time he entered he gathered and got 96
coconuts, the second time he took away 185 coconuts, and the third time he
gathered and carried away 400 coconuts; Leona Martinez, Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Calayo</span>, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Jesalva</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aquilina</span> Mira are claiming interests over certain portions
of the land in question only because, upon request and intercession of Leona
Martinez, they were allowed by the father of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Victorio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Llona</span> to cultivate certain portions of the land <span style="">in </span>question; they, the plaintiffs,
together with the predecessors in interest had been in possession of the land
in question openly, publicly, adversely, notoriously, peacefully, continuously
and uninterruptedly in concept of owners since 1912 over<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Parcel 2, and as far back as 1906 over Parcel
1, (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. M and L); as a consequence of the filing of
this case against the defendants, the plaintiffs incurred P600.00 for
attorney's fee, P300.00 for incidental expenses, and P1,000.00 for actual damages.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘The evidence presented during the reception of evidence
sufficiently proved the ownership and possession of the plaintiffs over Parcel
1 and Parcel 2, subject of this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their possession, together with those of their predecessors in interest,
which was open, public, peaceful, adverse, notorious, continuous, <span class="GramE">uninterrupted</span> and in concept of owner, started as far back
as 1906 for Parcel 1 and 1912 for Parcel 2.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For which reasons, whatever rights any other persons may have over said
property, if there be any, have already prescribed.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘Furthermore, the records of this case show that the defendants
were duly served with summons and copies of the complaint in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead of filing an answer to the complaint
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period as required of them by
law, thereby availing of their rights to protect their interests over the
property, they chose to ignore the same and attempted to show some semblance or
color of ownership by entering the property every now and then to gather the
products <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> which is a clear indication that
the defendants are wanting in <span class="SpellE">muniments</span> of title and
other evidence in their possession to prove their ownership over the property
in question.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘WHEREFORE, premises considered and as prayed for, this Court hereby
renders judgment declaring the plaintiffs the rightful owners of Parcel 1 and
Parcel 2, subject of this case and entitled to the peaceful possession of said
property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The defendants, as well as

this case, the appellants must show from the fact of the record itself that the

the relief or no jurisdiction over the subject <span class="GramE">matter</span>
or over the parties or both (see Reyes, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Datu</span>,
94 Phil. 446, citing I Freeman <span style="">on </span>Judgments,
Sec. 322, p. 642 and Sec. 326, p. 650).</p>

<p class="BODY">The records reveal that the disputed parcels of land were already
declared by the Director of Lands as alienable and disposable public
agricultural lands seven months before the complaint was filed in the trial
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the nature of the
land, the trial court never acquired jurisdiction over it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it was true that the said court was
never informed of the true nature of the land until later, such omission
however, could not alter the public character of the land as to confer
jurisdiction to it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Public
Land Act, the administration and disposition of public lands are entrusted to
the Director of Lands primarily, and ultimately, to the Secretary of
Agriculture and Natural Resources (Com. Act. No. 141, as amended, Sec. 4
thereof; see Guerrero v. <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, Secretary
Agriculture and Natural Resources, G.R. No. 34492, March 28, 1988, 159 SCRA
374).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Director of Lands has
the exclusive authority to grant licenses, permits, leases and contracts or
approve, reject, reinstate or cancel applications or decide conflicting
applications (See Espinosa v. <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span>, 79 Phil.
134).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, the authority of the
Lands Department to administer, dispose of and alienate public lands, does not
deprive other branches of the government of their respective functions or
powers such as the authority of the police forces to stop disorders and quell
breaches of peace and the authority on the part of the courts to take
jurisdiction over <span class="SpellE"><u>possessory</u></span> <u>actions</u> <u>arising</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>therefrom</u></span> <u>not</u> <u>involving,</u> <u>directly</u>

(See <span class="SpellE">Pitarque</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sorilla</span>,
92 Phil. 5, underlining supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> actions aforementioned relate to cases of
forcible entry and <span class="SpellE"><u>accion</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>publiciana</u></span>
where the basis of the remedy is mere possession as a fact, of physical
possession, not legal possession (<span class="SpellE">Pitargue</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Sorilla</span>, ibid, p. 131).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the action filed in this case was for quieting of title of
unregistered lands which involves a determination of ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a question which the Bureau of Lands,
not the courts, should properly resolve after due investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since from the onset, the trial court lacked
jurisdiction to try Civil Case No. 2548, its decision of November 11, 1971 and
its resolution of March 29, 1978 should be set aside for being null and
void.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Commissioner of Internal
Revenue v. Villa, We ruled that:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Jurisdiction over the subject matter is fundamental for a court to
act on a given controversy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
conferred by law not by consent of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It can be challenged at any stage of the proceedings and for lack of <span class="GramE">it,</span> a court can dismiss a case <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">mero</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> </span>(L-23988, January 2,
1968, 22 SCRA 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once a judgment is
declared void, the same becomes non-existent and thus, it leaves the parties
litigants in the same position they were in before the trial (see Metropolitan
Waterworks and Sewerage System v. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>, L-40309,
August 31, 1983, 124 SCRA 394).</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the Director of Lands, who was never a party to this
case, had already made an administrative investigation on the rights of the
parties to the disputed parcels of land and thereafter, issued free patents to
the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, appellants
already received their respective certificates of titles.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The correctness of the final decision of the
Director of Lands is not herein involved but it is valid and binding until
reversed in <span style="">a </span>proper proceeding
by the court (see Hernandez, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Clapis</span>, et <span style="">al., </span>98 Phil. 684).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision of the Court of First Instance
