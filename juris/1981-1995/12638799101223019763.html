turns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease concerns residential
premises identified as Apartment A at 1836 <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span>
Street, Sta. Cruz, <span class="GramE">Manila</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said lease was executed on April 1, 1981 by
the owner of the place, Benjamin de <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Victor, as lessee.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The agreement included stipulations (a) fixing the term of the lease and (b)
governing the <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> right of repossession, <i style="">viz.:</i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

above, then the <span class="SpellE">Lessor</span> shall have the right, upon
five (5) days written notice to the Lessee or in his absence, upon written
notice posted at the entrance of the premises leased, to enter and take<span style=""> possession of the said premises holding in
his trust and custody and such possessions and belongings of the Lessee found
therein after an inventory of the same in the <span class="SpellE">presense</span>
of a witness, all these acts being hereby agreed to by the Lessee as tantamount
to his voluntary vacation of the leased premises without the necessity of suit
in court."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A duplicate original of <span style="">the </span>contract was given to the lessee, <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Victor.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in October, 1983, Victor and his wife left for Ontario,
Canada and did not return to the Philippines until February, 1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left the apartment in the care of their
son, Ramon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Believing that the Victor spouses had abandoned the apartment Â­they
having been away for more than a year, and the place being occupied by Ramon
Victor, an <span style="">unauthorized stranger -- </span>De
<span class="SpellE">Asis</span> brought suit in the Metropolitan Trial Court in
December, 1984 to evict the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the spouses returned in February,
1985, and on their representation that they did not mean to give up the
apartment, the case <span style="">was </span>dismissed
on joint motion of the parties dated March 12, 1985.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It seems, however, that <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Victor
did not re-occupy the apartment but continued to leave it in the care of his
son, Ramon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, in the second week of
October, 1985, Ramon himself left for Canada.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He asked his brother, <span class="SpellE">Roldan</span>, to look after
the place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Roldan</span>
Victor did not actually move into the apartment; all he did was to install a
padlock at the main door, visit the place once a week, and sleep there
occasionally.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">When De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> learned of this state of
affairs sometime in December, 1985, he went to the place to see for himself if
it was true.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw there was nobody in
the apartment, but he could not get inside because it was locked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> then caused
the cutting off of the electrical and water service connections and, on the
following day, posted at the main door of the apartment a notice of termination
of the lease, on the ground of abandonment and failure to pay rentals in
accordance with the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could
not serve the notice of termination directly on the lessee since he did not
know where the latter was.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first week of January, 1986, De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>
returned to the apartment and noted that the termination notice he had posted
at the door was no longer there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
posted another notice, this time announcing that he would repossess the place
after five (5) days in order to secure it from fire, repair it to preserve its
value, and inventory such of the lessee's things as were inside which might
thereafter be claimed at his residence in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> also wrote on January 2, 1986
to the local <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain requesting his presence
at the premises on January 5, 1986 at which time he intended to open and
repossess the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 5,
1986, as announced, and in the presence of the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>
authorities, De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> had the door of the apartment opened
by a carpenter, and hauled to his residence the things found inside after
making an inventory of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
he made repairs on the apartment at a cost of P13<span class="GramE">,108.00</span>,
and then leased it to <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cresencio</span></span><span style=""> C. </span><span class="SpellE">Viray</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Not long afterwards an action of forcible entry was instituted in
the Metropolitan Trial Court against De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> and his
new lessee, <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>, by <span class="SpellE">Roldan</span>
Victor in behalf and in the name of his father, <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">action
was docketed as Civil Case No. 115635-CV and resulted in a judgment rendered on
December 29, 1986 "against the defendants ** De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>
(owner-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span>) and Sgt. C. <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
(present occupant) ordering the said defendants to restore plaintiff to the

suit."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The Metropolitan Trial Court ruled that <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Victor could not be deemed to have abandoned the
premises, and even if he had, the apartment could not be repossessed without
judicial action, the stipulation authorizing the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
to do so being void as "against public policy and existing
precedents."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
appealed to the Regional Trial Court, without success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That Court rendered judgment on June 15,
1987, affirming that of the Metropolitan Trial Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It adopted "by reference the findings of fact and conclusions of law ** in
the Decision appealed from;" declared the <span style="">findings </span>to be "in strict accord with the evidence
presented and the conclusions ** so obviously correct that a detailed
discussion would serve no useful purpose;" and directed "the court of
origin to issue a writ of possession immediately in favor of the plaintiff and
family, and to issue an order directing the immediate return of the personal
belongings of plaintiff taken by defendant Benjamin De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span>
inside the apartment in question that were hauled and/or transported to his
residence in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City on April 15, 1987."</p>

<p class="BODY">De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Viray</span>
then appealed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Their appeal met the same fate.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By judgment promulgated on <span style="">November
27, 1987 </span>by the Fifteenth Division,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
their petition for review was dismissed and the Regional Trial Court's decision
affirmed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to overturn these three adverse verdicts that De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> and <span class="SpellE">Viray</span> are now before
this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They ask this Court to rule
favorably to them on two questions of law, <i>viz</i>.:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) whether or not the posting in the
premises, in the first week of December, 1985, of notice of termination of the
lease had legally caused its cessation or extinguishment as of December 31,
1985; and (b) whether or not De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> had "the
legal and contractual right to repossess the premises" without and
independently of prior judicial authority.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court gave the petition due course by Resolution dated June
28, 1989 and required the parties to submit memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioners submitted their memorandum on
August 23, 1989.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No memorandum was filed
by or in behalf of <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Victor within the time
appointed.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indisputable that the partiesâ written agreement created a
lease on a month-to-month basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a
lease, therefore, must be construed, by established doctrine,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
as providing a definite period and as terminable by notice at the end of any
given month.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears <span class="GramE">undisputed,</span> too, that the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> had posted a notice of termination of the lease at
the doorway of the leased apartment and that that notice had subsequently been
noted and removed by the lessee's representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The giving of notice of termination in this
manner is explicitly authorized by Section 2, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, which
pertinently provides that a demand by a landlord for payment of rent or comply
with the conditions of the lease and to vacate the premises may <i style=""><span style="">inter
<span class="SpellE">alia</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>be made "by posting such notice on the
premises if no persons be found thereon."</p>

<p class="BODY">The lease having thus been licitly terminated, the lessee, <span class="SpellE">Rustico</span> Victor and his sons became obliged to surrender the
leased apartment to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They did not.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They stayed away from the place and did not show up during the
repossession undertaken by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, announced in
advance through the posting of another notice on the door of the apartment.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the Victors eventually did was to bring a forcible entry
suit against De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> on the theory that the
stipulation in the lease contract authorizing repossession by the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> without court action was void as contrary to public
policy, and De <span class="SpellE">Asis</span> had perpetrated the legally
proscribed act of taking the law into his own hands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The stipulation referred to does by its terms empower the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> to repossess the apartment <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It states that <a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

a substantially identical condition in a written lease agreement, which read as

<blockquote>"9.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That in case of

to comply with the terms and conditions of the contract by way of reminder
before the take-Â­over."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This Court ruled that the stipulation
"is in the nature of a <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span> condition, for
upon the exercise by the Sub-<span class="SpellE">lessor</span> of his right to
take possession of the leased property, the contract is deemed
terminated;" and that such a contractual provision "is not illegal,
there being nothing in the law proscribing such kind of agreement."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Although the authorities are not in entire accord, the better
view seems to be, <span style="">even in </span>jurisdictions
adopting the view that the landlord cannot forcibly eject a tenant who
wrongfully holds without incurring civil liability, that nevertheless, <i style="">where a lease provides that if the tenants
holds over after the expiration of his term, the landlord may enter and take
possession of the premises</i><span style="">, </span>using
all necessary force to obtain the actual possession thereof, and that such
entry should not be regarded as a trespass, be sued for as such, or in any wise
be considered unlawful, the landlord may forcibly expel the tenant upon the
termination of the tenancy, using no more force than is necessary, and will not
be liable to the tenant <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, <i style="">such a condition in a lease being valid.</i><span style="">"</span><i style=""><o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>â* * although there is contrary authority, the rule supported by a
substantial number of cases is that despite the effect of forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> statutes, where a lease expressly gives a landlord
a right to use such reasonable force as is necessary in making re-entry and
dispossessing a tenant, when the landlord becomes entitled to possession
because of the termination of the term, the landlord can use force in making
re-entry and dispossessing the tenant.â</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Be this as it may, since the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> (De
<span class="SpellE">Asis</span>) had licitly and efficaciously terminated the
month-to-month lease by notice, and had therefore acquired an affirmative right
of action to judicially eject the lessee after giving notice to vacate, the
existence of such an affirmative right of action constitutes a valid defense
against, and is fatal to any action by the tenant who has been ousted otherwise
than judicially to recover possession.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So has this Court had occasion to rule, with unassailable logic, it
might be added.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Apundar</i></span><i style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Andrin</span>,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">Medel</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Militante</span>
(41 Phil., 526), we held that when the tenant denies his landlord's title this
gives rise to a right of action on the part of the landlord to recover
immediate possession of the demised premises; and it follows as a necessary
corollary from this proposition that if the landlord acquires possession
peacefully, as in this case, by the mere act of reentry, the tenant cannot
maintain an action to put the landlord out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The existence of an affirmative right of action on the part of the
landlord to oust the tenant is fatal to the maintenance of any action by the
tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the absurd result
would follow that a tenant ousted under the circumstances here revealed would
be restored to possession only himself to be immediately put out in a <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> action instituted by the landlord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prevent <span class="SpellE">circuity</span>
of action, therefore, <span style="">we </span>must
recognize the affirmative right of action on the part of the landlord as a
complete and efficacious defense to the maintenance of an action by the
tenant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">Circuitus</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">est</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">evitandus</span>; et <span class="SpellE">boni</span>

<span class="SpellE">oriatur</span>.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote>Another consideration based upon an idea familiar to jurisprudence
is equally decisive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is found in
one of the implications of the familiar maxim, <span class="SpellE"><i>Ubi</i></span><i><span style=""> jus </span><span class="SpellE">ibi</span> </i><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">remedium</span></i></span><i><span style="">,</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">the converse of
which is of course equally true, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Nullum</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""> jus <span class="SpellE">nullum</span>
<span class="SpellE">remedium</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span></i>Applying
this idea to the case before us, it is manifest that inasmuch as the <span class="GramE">plaintiffs</span> right of possession has been destroyed, the
remedy is also necessarily taken away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even under the language of the statute itself (Sec. 80, Code of <span class="SpellE">Civ</span>. Proc.), the action of unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
does not lie unless the property is unlawfully withheld from the plaintiff, <span class="GramE">which</span> imports an actual present right of possession in
him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the view that the Court thus takes of the facts, the
petition for review <span style="">on </span><span class="SpellE"><i>cetiorari</i></span><span style=""> </span>must
be accorded merit and relief correspondingly granted to the petitioners.</p>
