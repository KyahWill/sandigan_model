<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1949" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1949</st1:date>,
petitioner applied for the lease of a pasture land consisting of 78.6 hectares,
situated at <span class="SpellE">Lacangan</span>, Barrio <span class="SpellE">Madiangat</span>,
Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>,
before the Bureau of Forestry, Department of Agriculture and Natural Resources,
thru the office of the Provincial Forester at <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By virtue of said application, petitioner was
granted Ordinary Pasture Permit Ps-993 after a survey of the area
involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, petitioner
occupied said 78.6 hectares of pasture land and fenced the same, without
anybody disturbing his possession thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent, being a neighbor of petitioner, was aware of such
occupation of the land by petitioner since 1949.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1951" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1951</st1:date>,
petitioner was again granted Ordinary Pasture Permit Ps-993 Extension by
Director of Forestry <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tamesis</span>,
authorizing the former to occupy the same area, the first permit having expired
on <st1:date year="1952" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1952</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, on <st1:date year="1958" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1958</st1:date>, petitioner entered into a lease agreement
with the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources, Juan de G. Rodriguez,
under Pasture Lease Agreement No. 1228 covering the identical area for a period
of 11 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, private respondent, upon verification from the Bureau
of Forestry supposedly before 1963 that the pasture land in question was
reportedly untouched and outside the pasture land of petitioner, filed his
application for a homestead with the Bureau of Lands and entered the northern
portion of the land, clearing and cultivating an area of less than 4 hectares
in 1963.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1965</st1:date>,
private respondent secured a certification from Assistant Chief <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Abuan</span> of the Bureau of
Forestry office in <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, certifying to the fact that the land in
question is alienable and disposable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent further claims to have secured another certification from an
employee of the Bureau of Lands who based the same on a certification on file
in the Bureau of Lands office as furnished by the Bureau of Forestry.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1966</st1:date>,
petitioner caused the relocation survey of his pasture land in the presence of
Bureau of Lands Inspector <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span> and private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was found in said survey that a portion of
the land subject of private respondent's application was within the pasture
land of petitioner and within the so-called Forest Zone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, petitioner requested
Inspector <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span> to send a telegram to the Director
of Lands in <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> reading:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Lands Director Jorge, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Please hold action homestead application <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> Doctor and Luis <span class="SpellE">Carub</span>,
Solano, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Re-investigation in

<p class="BODY">Aside from this survey, petitioner requested in a letter to the
office of the Bureau of Forestry at <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> the relocation survey of his pasture land pursuant
to which the district forester sent Forester <span class="SpellE">Nicasio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> to relocate the same on April 26, 1966.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A cartographer of the Bureau of Lands, <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> Miranda, herein petitioner and private respondent,
as well as several laborers, were present during said relocation survey.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Forester <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
submitted his memorandum, dated <st1:date year="1966" day="3" month="5">May 3,
 1966</st1:date>, to the bureau director indicating the different positions of
the lots that had encroached on the pasture land of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequent to such findings, Forester <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> recommended that all certifications and/or patents
issued in favor of the lot owners or claimants of said encroaching lots be
nullified for the good of the public service.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1967</st1:date>,
petitioner was granted another ordinary pasture permit by Acting Director of
Forestry Antonio <span class="SpellE">Quejado</span> to occupy and use for
pasture another 42 hectares of public forest land situated in <span class="SpellE">Inatub</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lacangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carolet</span> and <span class="SpellE">Buliwao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
which made a total of 120.6 hectares of land granted to petitioner for pasture
purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said additional area was
likewise fenced by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">On </span><st1:date year="1968" day="17" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 17, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
Original Certificate of Title No.</span> P-­3428 under Homestead Patent No.
124175 was issued to private respondent over a parcel of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Inatub</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, containing an area
of approximately 20 hectares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, private respondent and one Luis <span class="SpellE">Carub</span>
requested the Bureau of Forestry to relocate the pasture land of petitioner to
determine any encroachment on his land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forester Buenaventura <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>, on the
instructions of the Director of Forestry dated <st1:date year="1971" day="25" month="11">November 25, 1971</st1:date> thru District Forester Geronimo <span class="SpellE">Falloran</span>, conducted the relocation survey.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="3">March
 1, 1972</st1:date>, Forester <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span> submitted his memorandum
to the district forester indicating that the area in the title granted to
private respondent traversed a portion of the pasture land of petitioner and
that only 3.5 hectares, more or less, was verified to be within the alienable
and disposable area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, a
recommendation was made that the application filed by petitioner for the
renewal of the pasture lease agreement, which expired on <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1969</st1:date>, be approved and that only 3.5
hectares of land be retained by private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 23, 1972, said memorandum report of District Forester <span class="SpellE">Falloran</span>, was forwarded to the Director of Forestry,
Manila, through the Regional Director of the Bureau of Forestry, Region No. 2, <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>, who in turn
indorsed the same on June 23, 1972.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1972</st1:date>, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Aniceto</span> <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, Officer-in-Charge
of the Parks, Range and Wildlife Division of the Bureau of Forest Development,
furnished petitioner a copy of the renewed Pasture Lease Agreement No. 1228,
dated <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="11">November 9, 1972</st1:date>,
entered into by the petitioner with the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural
Resources, Jose D. <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>, Jr.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lease was for a period of 25 years, to
expire on <st1:date year="1994" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1994</st1:date>,
and covered the 120 hectares of pasture land in <span class="SpellE">Lacangan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Inatub</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carolet</span>, <span class="SpellE">Madiangat</span> and <span class="SpellE">Buliwao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">With these documents in favor of petitioner, private respondent
was prevented from occupying and cultivating the disputed portion of 16.5459
hectares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, private <span class="GramE">respondent,</span> filed an action for recovery of possession with
damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial, the court <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u> rendered judgment on May 28, 1981 in favor of therein defendant and
against the plaintiff, and ordering the plaintiff to pay the defendant the
amount of P1,400.00 as actual and litigation expenses, P3,000.00 for attorney's
fees, and to pay the costs of the suit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On a "Partial Motion for Reconsideration" filed by
petitioner, and a "Motion for Reconsideration and/or New Trial" of
private respondent, as defendant and plaintiff, respectively, said decision was
amended by a resolution issued on January 7, 1982, the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span>
portion whereof reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated at the outset, said decision and resolution were
appealed to respondent court which reversed and set aside the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A motion for reconsideration, dated <st1:date year="1984" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1984</st1:date>, was filed by
petitioner with respondent court with a supplemental memorandum in support
thereof, but the same was denied in respondent court's resolution of <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present recourse is before us as a consequence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Succinctly reduced to salient terms,
petitioner's submissions are that respondent court committed errors of law (1)
in concluding that the land in dispute is alienable by relying on the
certification issued by District Forester <span class="SpellE">Abuan</span> and
in disregarding the contrary testimonies and certifications of Foresters <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span> and <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>; (2) in
concluding that petitioner, a pasture lease <span class="SpellE">permittee</span>,
has no legal personality to question the patent and title of private respondent
Doctor over the disputed area; and (3) when it ruled that private respondent is
entitled to the award of damages.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the first assignment of error, petitioner maintains that
respondent court should not have relied on the certification issued by District
Forester <span class="SpellE">Abuan</span>, it being hearsay evidence by reason
of <span class="SpellE">Abuan's</span> failure to testify thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, petitioner assails respondent
court's disregard of the testimonies of Foresters <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span> who certified that the land was within
the Forest Zone after having conducted an actual verification survey of the
area.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with petitioner, but not only for the reason that the
evidence-in-chief of private respondent may, in point of strict law, be
constitutive of hearsay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The question as
to whether a particular portion of land is <span class="SpellE">forestal</span>
or any other class of land is a question of fact to be settled by the proof in
each particular case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, the mere classification or certification made by the Bureau of Forestry
that a part of the public domain is timberland is not controlling in all cases.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have reviewed the testimonies of the witnesses for private
respondent and nowhere do we find any cogent basis for the certification made
by District Forester <span class="SpellE">Abuan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Delizo</span>, District Land Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bayombong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, which could
possibly have energized private respondent's case, is itself plagued with not a
few vacuities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside from his assertion
and admission that the sole basis for his certification was merely an office
copy of the certification also of Forester <span class="SpellE">Abuan</span>
himself, <span class="SpellE">Delizo</span> further admitted that he had not made
any actual verification of the subject area.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither could he even conclusively establish that the lot mentioned in his
certification was identical to the lot in question.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In diametrical contrast, the pasture lease permit granted to
petitioner was issued after a series of actual investigations, ocular and
technical, of the subject area by Foresters <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span> conducted in the presence of all the
interested parties, including private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While private respondent denies having
received any copy of the memoranda executed by the foresters despite his
admitted presence during the surveys and investigations,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the same does not relieve him of the consequences of imputed knowledge of the
findings therein considering the facility in obtaining copies of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, it is an affront to credulity that a
person like private respondent who, despite his zeal and desire to possess and
own the land in controversy, would prefer to remain in deliberate ignorance of
the results of said surveys through his unexplained inaction and inexplicable
indifference.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notably, even before the relocation survey made by Forester <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>, Bureau of Lands Inspector <span class="SpellE">Hernaez</span>
conducted his own survey and found that the land subject of private
respondent's application for a homestead patent was within the pasture land of
petitioner and within the Forest Zone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Precisely, an advice to hold said application was sent to the Director
of Lands in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> upon
petitioner's request.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It will also be recalled that consequent to Forester <span class="SpellE">Pascua's</span> survey and findings, a further recommendation was
made to the Director of Forestry for the nullification of all certifications
and/or patents issued in favor of the owners and/or claimants whose lots had
intruded upon petitioner's land area, including private respondent himself,
such invalidation being necessitated for the good of the public service.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
All these on-the-spot surveys, the findings wherefrom are <span class="SpellE">unassailed</span>
and <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span>, more than preponderate over and
definitely override the enervated evidentiary value of the certification of <span class="SpellE">Abuan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Delizo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While we admit an exception to the rule that the Bureau of
Forestry has the power to set aside for forestry or mineral purposes a
particular land in question,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and that is when there was prior intervention of private interests, said
exception cannot find application in private respondent's favor since
petitioner's interests commenced and vested very much earlier than any claim
thereon by the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner had open, uninterrupted and peaceful possession and
occupation of the disputed land since 1949, being a grantee of pasture lease
permits which expired in 1969.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent, on the other hand, started his controversial cultivation of the lot
only in 1963 and secured the questioned certification in 1965.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The long period of time from 1949 to 1969 during which the land was under
pasture lease permits granted to petitioner all the more lends credence to the
fact that said land was within the Forest Zone as only lands of the category of
public forest land can be the subject of such permits.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court neither loses sight of the presumption, in lieu of
contrary proof, that the land is agricultural in character, rather than <span class="SpellE">forestal</span>, as it is for the good of the country to have the
large public domain come under private ownership.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It is to be emphasized, however, that such presumption obtains only when the
conflict of interest is between a private citizen and the Government, not when
it involves opposing rights of private citizens against each other.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second assigned error, private respondent makes the
riposte that petitioner cannot question the validity of the title registered in
the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If there is any party who can question his title on the ground that it
includes therein a forest land, private respondent posits that it should be the
Bureau of Forest Development.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
This counter-argument is an effete pretension.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Gatchalian</u></span> <u>vs</u>.
<span class="SpellE"><u>Pavilin</u></span>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court had the occasion to render the following ruling:</p>

<blockquote>"As to the alleged lack of personality of
defendants-appellants to assail <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> land grant
and certificate of title for the reason that said appellants are mere
prospective homestead applicants, it is sufficient to remark that by reason of
their prior occupancy and cultivation, these parties have already acquired <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> rights that they may vindicate and defend
against intruders without better title.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And if it be true that the Bureau of Lands had no jurisdiction to issue
a patent in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> Francisco <span class="SpellE">Gatchalian</span> because the land involved was still inalienable
forest land when granted, then it may be plausibly contended that her patent
title would be <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>
void subject to attack at any time by any party adversely affected (Civil Code,
Arts. 1409, 1421; <span class="SpellE">Vano</span> vs. Insular <span class="SpellE">Gov't</span>., 41 Phil. 161; Adorable vs. Dir. of Forestry,
L-13663, 25 March 1960).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in <u>Vallarta</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>. <u>vs</u>. <u>Hon</u>.
<u>Intermediate</u> <u>Appellate</u> <u>Court</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
where the original proceeding was also between private citizens, we held:</p>

<blockquote>"It is elementary in the law governing natural resources that
forest land cannot be owned by private persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is not <span class="SpellE">registrable</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The adverse possession which can be the basis
of a grant of title in confirmation of imperfect title cases cannot commence
until after forest land has been declared alienable and disposable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Possession of forest land,
no matter how long cannot convert it into private property.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> If somehow forest land happens to have been included in a
Torrens Title, <u>the</u> <u>title</u> <u>is</u> <u>null</u> <u>and</u> <u>void</u>
insofar as the forest land is concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Ironically, it was private respondent himself who initiated the
original action below for recovery of possession with damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence, petitioner was virtually
compelled to litigate in order to protect his own right to possession which in
part hinged on the nature of the land in dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Were we to uphold private respondent's theory
that petitioner is devoid of personality to question the invalidity of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> patent and title, that would be a procedural
inequity since it would thereby prevent petitioner from fully protecting his
interests or, at the very least, divest him of valid defenses.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On the third supposed error, suffice it to state that the records
are bereft of any substantial evidence showing that private respondent was
deprived by petitioner of the possession of the land through force,
intimidation, threat, strategy or stealth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, the evidence convinces us that petitioner was well
within his rights in taking possession of the lot in question, a matter which
we need not belabor with any further disquisition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the assailed decision and resolution of
respondent court are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the trial court, dated
January 7, 1982, on the partial motion for reconsideration by herein petitioner
as defendant therein, except as to the award of attorney's fees and the payment
