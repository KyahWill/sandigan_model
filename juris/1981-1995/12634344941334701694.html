				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioners Adelpha Fernandez, Marissa Domingo, Eunice Ofrecia,
Roselyn Mendoza, Arlene Caballero, Almira Miranda and Mary Christine Valenton
seek <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition to prohibit and restrain the Secretary
of the Department of Labor and Employment ("DOLE") and the
Administrator of the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration
("POEA") from enforcing and implementing Item No. 1 of DOLE Circular
No. 01-91 dated 20 November 1991 entitled "Prescribing Additional
Requirements, Conditions and Procedures for the Deployment of Performing
Artists."</p>

<p class="BODY">Item No. 1 of the assailed DOLE Circular provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"1. No
Filipino entertainer shall be deployed outside the Philippines except for
legitimate performing artists consisting of musicians, singers and members of
dance troupes.  In all cases, the
performing artists must have a track record of legitimate and reputable
performance in the Philippines for at least one year.  In no case shall the performing artist be below 23 years old.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Secretary of Labor and Employment may, for justifiable reasons,
exempt performing artists from coverage hereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The promulgation of DOLE Circular No. 01-91 was preceded by
public agitation (as reflected in the print media) for a total ban on
deployment of Filipino entertainers abroad, in response to the growing number
of documented reports and complaints from entertainers and their relatives
about the exploitative working conditions, harassment, forcible detention,
physical injuries, rape and even death suffered by female performing artists
and entertainers abroad.  Because a
comprehensive prohibition of such deployment would visit obviously adverse
economic consequences upon the entertainment industry, the First National
Tripartite Conference for the Protection of Overseas Entertainers, attended by
representatives from the Government and from the management and labor sectors
of the entertainment community, was held last 18 November 1991.  The Conference was convened to evaluate a
Government proposal for a complete interdiction of overseas deployment of
Philippine entertainers and performing artists.  During this Conference, some of the problems facing Filipino
entertainers (in particular, women entertainers) abroad were discussed
openly:  vulnerability to operations of
organized crime syndicates abroad; subjection to white slavery; harsh and
substandard working conditions; vulnerability to sexually transmitted diseases
and unwanted pregnancies, and so forth.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
At the end of the Conference, the consensus among the management and labor
representatives which emerged was that Government should adopt a policy of <u>selective</u>
(rather than comprehensive) prohibition of deployment abroad of Philippine
entertainers, to avoid the adverse effects which complete prohibition would
impose on the country's manpower export program.  The labor representatives recommended that the minimum age for
performing artists seeking overseas deployment be raised from eighteen (18)
years to twenty-three (23) years.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present proceeding, petitioners allege themselves to be
"qualified performing artists, mostly singers and dancers," of ages
eighteen (18) to twenty-two (22) years.  Through counsel, they challenge the constitutional validity of Item No.
1 of DOLE Circular No. 01-91 and their arguments may be condensed in the
following manner:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]-->that
Item No. 1 of DOLE Circular No. 01-91 is violative of the equal protection
clause and the due process clause of the Constitution, and the state policy on
protection of labor because Item No. 1 is arbitrary, oppressive and
discriminatory against performing artists of ages eighteen (18) to twenty-two
(22) who would otherwise be qualified for overseas employment; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><!--[endif]-->that
Item No. 1 of the mentioned DOLE Circular was promulgated by public respondent
DOLE Secretary and POEA Administrator without or in excess of their
jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In actions involving constitutional issues, the firmly settled
rule is that a constitutional question will not be heard and resolved by the
courts unless the following requirements of judicial inquiry are met:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->the existence of an actual case or controversy;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->the party raising the constitutional issue must have a
personal and substantial interest in the resolution thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(3)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->the controversy must be raised at the earliest reasonable
opportunity; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(4)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->that the resolution of the constitutional issue must be
indispensable for the final determination of the controversy.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Appraising the present proceeding in
terms of the foregoing requirements, the Solicitor General urges that the
Petition at bar does not present a justiciable controversy for having been
filed prematurely:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x petitioners, who claim to be performing artists, had
not previously applied with the Secretary of Labor for exemption from the
coverage of the Circular in line with the aforequoted provision.  Said provision connotes that the prohibition
is not at all permanent or absolute.  It
admits of exception.  x x x.  But to repeat, there is no allegation in the
petition that petitioners had previously sought exemption from the Secretary of
Labor, from the coverage of the Circular, before filing the instant
petition.  Obviously, the petition must
fail for <u>prematurity</u>.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the Solicitor General.  We note, in the first place, that Item No. 1
of the challenged DOLE Circular does not establish an absolute and
comprehensive prohibition of deployment abroad of entertainers below twenty-three
(23) years of age.  Item No. 1 itself
provides that "the Secretary of Labor and Employment may, for justifiable
reasons, exempt from performing artists from coverage hereof." The
discretionary authority here asserted by the DOLE Secretary does not purport to
be unlimited and arbitrary in nature.  To the contrary, fairly explicit and precisely drawn grounds for
exempting particular performing artists from the coverage of Item No. 1 are set
out in a set of "Administrative Guidelines Implementing Department
Circular No. 01-91".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, petitioners have failed to allege, or have
refrained from alleging, that they had previously applied to public respondent
officials for exemption from the minimum age restriction imposed by Item No. 1
of DOLE Circular No. 01-91.  Necessarily, therefore, petitioners also do not allege that public
respondent officials have arbitrarily denied their applications for exemption
from the minimum age requirement or from any other requirement established by
Item No. 1.  Neither have petitioners
alleged that public respondents have continually threatened to deny all and
sundry applications for exemption, so as to create a reasonable expectation
that their applications would be immediately and arbitrarily denied, should
they in fact file them.  Petitioners do
assert that the exemption clause of DOLE Circular No. 01-91 is
"practically useless and [constitutes] empty verbiage." They have
not, however, attempted to support this assertion.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not compelled to indulge in speculation that public
respondent would deny any and all applications for exemption from coverage of
DOLE Circular No. 01-91.  Two (2)
important presumptions are here applicable.  The first is that administrative orders and regulations are entitled to
the presumption of constitutionality.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The second is that official duty has been or will be regularly performed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Philippine Association of Colleges and Universities v.
Secretary of Education</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitioner universities and colleges challenged a regulation requiring all
private educational institutions to secure a permit to operate from the
Department of Education.  The Court
dismissed the Petition for being premature, after finding that the petitioners
had in fact in their possession permits to operate and that the petition was
filed for speculative or academic purposes upon the supposition that the
petitioning institutions might be denied such permits, or have their permits
withdrawn, at some future time.  The
Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Mere apprehension that the Secretary of Education might
under the law withdraw the permit of one of petitioners does not constitute a
justiciable controversy</u>.  (Cf. Com.
ex rel Watkins vs. Winchester Waterworks (Ky.) 197 S.W. 2d. 771.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>An action, like this, is brought for a positive purpose, nay, to
obtain actual and positive relief.  (Salonga vs. Warner Barnes, L-­2245, January 1951).  <u>Courts do not sit to adjudicate mere
academic questions to satisfy scholarly interest therein, however
intellectually solid the problem may be.  This is specially true where the issues ‘reach constitutional dimensions</u>,
for then there comes into play regard for the court's duty to avoid decision of
constitutional issues unless avoidance becomes evasion.’ (Rice vs. Sioux City,
U.S. Sup. Ct. Adv Rep., May 23, 1955, Law Ed., Vol. 99, p. 511).”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring added).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">To engage in judicial review, under the
facts and circumstances here obtained, in advance of official efforts to apply
the provisions of the challenged circular, upon the supposition that
petitioners' legal rights in the premises might be denied by public respondent
officials, is too close to rendering an advisory opinion in a hypothetical case
-- ­an undertaking clearly beyond the jurisdiction of this Court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We consider, therefore, that petitioners have failed to show the
first requisite of a judicial inquiry, i.e., the existence of actual case or
controversy.  This failure renders
unnecessary consideration of the other requisites of constitutional litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, for lack of a justiciable controversy, the
Court Resolved to DISMISS the Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and
Prohibition.  Costs against petitioners.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform:uppercase">Concurring Opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I have said often enough that an unconstitutional measure should
be slain on sight regardless of non-compliance with the established requisites
of a judicial inquiry into a constitutional issue.  But in so saying, I had in mind the clearly illegal act that
should not be reprieved by procedural impediments to delay its inevitable
annulment.</p>

<p class="BODY">I see no such act in the case at bar.  The questioned circular is at best of dubious validity,
especially as it seems to offend the equal protection clause by laying down an
age barrier that Justice Gutierrez <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">finds
arbitrary.  I am not prepared at this
time to share his conviction although I will say that I too have my doubts
about the distinction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I agree that at this point the Court should wait until an actual
controversy is before it involving a justiciable issue ripe for judicial determination.  Meanwhile, the petitioners should lay their
case before the administrative authorities and give them a chance to re-examine
their act and affirm or undo it.  The
policy we here pursue is based not only on sound practical considerations but
also on a becoming respect for a coordinate branch of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There will be time enough
to "make the hammer fall, and heavily," in Justice Laurel's words, if
that be </span>necessary.   <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In my view, that time has not yet come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J.</i>:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I find the age limitation in the questioned resolution arbitrary
and discriminatory.  There is no
reasonable nexus between the requirement and the objective sought to be
accomplished.  I am constrained to
dissent.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated by the petitioners, it has been the official policy and
practice of the government for many years if not decades to authorize the
overseas employment of performing artists, eighteen (18) years and above,
provided they are qualified and have passed the auditions conducted by the
Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).   Every year, around 40,000 musicians, singers,
and dancers go to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Japan as </span>performing
artists.  They allegedly contribute at
least US$780,000,000.00 to our foreign exchange earnings not to mention the
considerable relief they give to our serious unemployment and under-employment
problems.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">According to the
petitioners, there are at least </span>500,000 persons and family members
dependent on them for<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">all or a significant part of their living
expenses and who will also be prejudiced by the enforcement of the questioned
Circular No. 01-91.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The issuance of Circular No. 01-91 was triggered by the
unfortunate fate of a lady entertainer who died under suspicious circumstances
in Japan, an alleged<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> victim of
exploitation and abuse.  I cannot recall
her age but to me it has absolutely no relevance to the cause of her
death.  The lady would have died whether
she was 18, 23, or 35 years of age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The public respondents have failed to do their job of properly
regulating the placement activities of recruitment agencies.  Instead of improving their work and
ascertaining their shortcomings and glaring inadequacies, the public
respondents try to placate an outspoken media and angry citizenry with an unreasonable
regulation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be noted that almost all victims of criminal syndicates
and abusive employers in Japan went there as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">tourists and not as legitimate performing artists.  The age of the victims has nothing to do
with their exploitation.  It is the
absence of valid working visas, the failure to enter into government approved
contracts with known employers, and the absence of any singing, dancing or
entertainment talent which criminal elements in Japan manipulate as they
victimize the illegal entrants.  The
Department of Labor and Employment is mandated to allow only legitimate
performing artists to leave for employment abroad.  It is supposed to screen </span>the reputable and acceptable
standards of performance of singers and dancers it allows to be deployed
abroad.  It maintains offices and
personnel in Japan where entertainers can bring their problems freely because
their presence in that country is legitimate and known to DOLE officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is public knowledge that in none of the above functions has DOLE
been half successful in its performance.  Instead, it comes out with an unreasonable regulation which will kill
the legitimate livelihoods of tens of thousands of genuine entertainers without
really solving the problems of the illegal entrants and the unauthorized
entertainers.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">I </span>find the
challenged restriction arbitrary and unreasonable because it is not rationally
related to the problem intended to be solved.  It is not the age of the entertainers which causes them to be victimized
but the clandestine nature of their departure from the Philippines and the
illegality of their status as overstaying tourists or smuggled entrants in
Japan, not to mention their lack of artistic talents or their having engaged in
the sex trade in the Philippines and gone to Japan because the income is
better.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Circular No. 01-91 aims to "provide continuing employment
opportunities to legitimate Filipino performing artists abroad and to ensure
their protection and welfare x x x." The key words are "continuing
employment oppor<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">t</span>unities",
"legitimate", "protection", <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">and "welfare."   The
challenged age requirement will severely restrict employment
opportunities.  Instead of using an
arbitrary cut-off age, the DOLE should concentrate on seeing to it that only
"legitimate" or qualified performers will be deployed and, once they
are abroad, to give them the mandated protection and welfare, adequate and
dedicated instead of being lackluster and desultory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The challenged provision
is discriminatory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">As stated by the
petitioners, there is no reasonable standard </span>or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">basis which allows a classification into 18 years old and 23 years
old.  An 18-year old woman can
vote.  A 21-year old woman is
emancipated.  From 18 to 23, a woman can
look for a job and engage in gainful employment.  Why one is forced to work only in the Philippines while the other
may roam freely around the world has no reasonable basis.  A psychological and maturity test in
addition to effective screening of artistic abilities as an entertainer would
be reasonable but not an arbitrary cut-off age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">With all due respect for
the majority opinion which I find to be based more on theory than fact, the
"justifiable reasons" which DOLE may use for exempting those below 23
from the ban are as illusory as its ability to regulate the proliferation of
illegal recruiters and to extend protection or assistance to victims of abuses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The other reasons used by
the majority -- a failure to allege certain matters -- is to my mind unduly </span>technical.  Anyone dealing with administrative
officials, especially the minor functionaries in charge of granting permits to
work abroad, cannot be blamed for going immediately to Court to challenge an
arbitrary regulation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">which </span>effectively
eliminates their livelihood.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">I VOTE to GRANT the </span>PETITION
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and to strike out the questioned
regulation as an arbitrary infringement of liberty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
