in the evening of <st1:date year="1979" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1979</st1:date>,

three persons near <span style="">him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>There <span style="">was then </span>a lighted <span style="">small
lamp at the altar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The three men tied his hands behind his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They made him lie on the floor with his face
down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the men hit him with an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span>, the other pointed a bolo at his neck and the
third poked a pistol on his right ear.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They looked for money and they found P2<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>
inside an <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;

called Pastor and the latter opened the door of his store.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The persons demanded money from Pastor who
was made to lie down also with his hands tied behind his back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Isidro could not tell whether the malefactors
were able to get money from Pastor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Later, he and Pastor were ordered to look for a fast motor boat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding Isidro's outboard motor, Isidro
started the engine while one of the men boarded it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two other men accompanied Isidro and
Pastor to a rocky place called <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the older of the two persons had
decided not to kill Isidro and Pastor, they left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Isidro and Pastor then ran towards <span style="">their </span>homes (TSN, Hearing of January

her husband at the time of the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She failed to recognize the third person

filed a notice of appeal to the Court of Appeals (Record, p. 480).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, in view of the fact that the death

automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">An assignment of error submitted by both <span class="SpellE">Beringuel</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span> for this Court's consideration is the
admissibility of Exhibit âBâ, the sworn statement of <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>,
wherein he admitted having participated in the commission of the crimes and
implicated <span class="SpellE">Beringuel</span> therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is merit in appellants' claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exhibit "B" is inadmissible because
it was taken during custodial investigation unaided by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there was no valid waiver of his
rights to remain silent and to counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This being so, <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>' extrajudicial
confession <span style="">is </span>inadmissible
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Malmis</span>, 167 SCRA [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the inadmissibility of <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span>'
sworn statement, the Court has to determine whether there is ample evidence to
establish the guilt of the accused to a moral certainty (People v. Lopez, 157
SCRA 304 [1988]) and, in these cases, the controlling issue is whether or not
the appellants had been positively identified as the culprits.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is submitted that notwithstanding <span class="SpellE">Merlita</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rapada's</span> statement that she could not recognize any

trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when asked to point out the

<p class="BODY">It is understandable why <span class="SpellE">Merlita</span> failed

given in open court (People v. <span class="SpellE">Pacola</span>, 58 SCRA 370
[1974]) because they are almost always incomplete and inaccurate, sometimes from
partial suggestions sometimes from want of suggestions and inquiries, without
the aid of which the witness may be unable to recall the connected collateral
circumstances necessary <span style="">for </span>the
correction of the suggestion of his memory and for his accurate recollection of
all that belongs to the subject (People v. <span class="SpellE">Loveria</span>,
G.R. No. 79138, July 2, 1990 citing People <span style="">v. </span>Gonzales, 99 SCRA 697 [1980]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Tarciana</span> <span class="SpellE">Apdo</span>
also positively identified <span class="SpellE">Devaras</span> and <span class="SpellE">Beringuel</span> as the robbers because of the kerosene lamp on a
small table <span style="">in </span>front of her
husband (TSN, Hearing of May 11, 1979, pp. 4-5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pastor <span class="SpellE">Hadlocon</span>,

and <span class="SpellE">Beringuel</span> as the intruder with the pistol (TSN,
February 21, 1979, pp. 10-11).</p>

<p class="BODY">Identification of the culprits is, therefore, not difficult in
these cases because the places where the crimes occurred were sufficiently
lighted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where considerations of
visibility are favorable and the witness does not appear to be biased against
the accused, his or her assertions as to the identity of the malefactor should
be normally accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is more so
when the witness is the victim or his near relative because these witnesses usually
strive to remember the faces of the assailants (People v. <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>,
G.R. No. 88662, June 18, 1990; People v. Alvarez, 169 SCRA 730 [1989]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the trial court gave credence to
the prosecution's identification of the appellants as the culprits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subject to exceptions which do not obtain in
these cases, the trial court is in a better position to decide this question,
having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment
and manner of testifying during the trial (People v. De la Cruz, G.R. No.
83260, April 18, 1990).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the positive identification of the appellants as the
culprits, alibi must he established by full, clear and satisfactory evidence
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Pili</span>, 56 Phil. 730 [1926]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants failed to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Paulino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Devaras</span> does not carry much weight because he is the
father of one of the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alibi
is weak if it is established mainly by the accused himself and his immediate
relatives and not by credible persons (People v. <span class="SpellE">Somera</span>,
173 SCRA 684 <span style="">[1989].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>F</span>or his part, <span class="SpellE">Beringuel</span>
even failed to present a witness to corroborate his alibi even after he was
given the chance to do so at the new trial which he himself requested.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, appellants failed to prove any ulterior motive on
the part of the prosecution witnesses as to why they would falsely impute such
a despicable crime on the accused if they did not really commit it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimonies of the prosecution witnesses
strongly indicate their honest motivation to have the real <span class="GramE">offenders</span>
punished (People v. <span class="SpellE">Francisquite</span>, 56 SCRA 764
[1974]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Beringuel's</span> contention that the failure
of the complainants to immediately submit to an investigation and their delay
in the institution of the criminal charges indicate that they were <span style="">not </span>able <span style="">to </span>identify the culprits, does not hold water.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This has been debunked by the positive
