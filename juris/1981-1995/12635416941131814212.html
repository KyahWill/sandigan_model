				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This case is about the acquisition of land by prescription.&nbsp; Felix Bergado owned Lot 655 with an area of 11,001 square meters.&nbsp; It is located in Punta Rizal, Barrio Gunob, Opon, now Lapulapu City.&nbsp; It was inherited by his seven children named Tomasa, Teodora, Ambrosia, Florencia, Aniceto, Macario and Vicente.<br><br>Cadastral Judge Guillermo F. Pablo on January 31, 1929 ordered the registration of Lot 655 in the names of seven sets of transferees to each of whom he adjudicated a <i>1/6 share instead of 1/7</i>.&nbsp; Because of that error and other clerical errors, no decree was issued and the adjudicatees did not obtain any Torrens title.&nbsp; The land remained unregistered.<br><br>Two-sevenths of Lot 655, pertaining to Macario Bergado and Vicente Bergado, were transferred to Maximo Patalinghug while the 5/7 share of the other five children were transferred in 1929 and 1930 to the spouses Domingo Magsumbol and Susana Magsumbol.<br><br>Lot 655 was subdivided on January 30, 1934 with the approval of the Director of Lands into Lot 655-A (5/7) and Lot 655-B (2/7).&nbsp; The Bergado heirs ceased to have possession of any portion of Lot 655 which was occupied by the Magsumbol spouses and Patalinghug.<br><br>In the guardianship proceeding for the children of Miguel Magsumbol who inherited Lot 655-A from Domingo, Sr., Judge Jose M. Mendoza adjudicated to Domingo, Jr. on October 30, 1962 said lot with an area of 7,344 square meters.&nbsp; Domingo, Jr. then sold on November 2, 1962 to the brothers Mamerto and Lorenzo Igot Lot 655-A for P10,000 (Exh. D or 2).&nbsp; The Igots continued the Magsumbols' possession of Lot No. 655-A.<br><br>On May 10, 1967, or 38 years after Judge Pablo rendered his decision, Judge Mendoza, the same judge who granted Lot 655-A to Domingo Magsumbol, Jr., at the instance of some Bergado heirs, corrected the clerical errors in Judge Pablo's decision.&nbsp; A decree was issued and on December 19,1967, OCT No. 8 was issued for Lot 655.&nbsp; The land became registered land at last.<br><br>In 1970 the Igot brothers sued some Bergado heirs for the reconveyance of Lot 655-A or 5/7 portion of Lot 655 which is covered by OCT No. 8.&nbsp; The trial court upheld their claim.&nbsp; The Appellate Court, through Justice Gatmaitan, affirmed that decision.<br><br>It held that the Magsumbols had acquired Lot 655-A by prescription under section 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure.&nbsp; That right was in turn transmitted to the Igots.&nbsp; The petitioners herein, or defendants Godinez and Jayme, acquired only a paper title in 1967 when they obtained OCT No. 8.<br><br>The petitioners contend in this appeal that the Appellate Court erred in not regarding OCT No. 8 as indefeasible and in not considering that the action of the Igots is barred by res judicata.<br><br>We hold that the Appellate Court did not err in dismissing the claim of the petitioners for Lot 655-A which has been in the adverse, continuous, uninterrupted and notorious possession of the Magsumbols and the Igots in the concept of owner for more than half a century.&nbsp; Law and the canons of common sense are on the side of the Igots.<br><br>OCT No. 8 did not nullify the sales made by the five Bergado children to the Magsumbol spouses in 1929 and 1930.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.&nbsp; Costs against the petitioners.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED</b><br><br><i>Concepcion, Jr., Abad Santos, Escolin</i>, and <i>Cuevas, JJ.,</i> concur.<br><i>Makasiar, (Chairman), J</i>., no part.</div>
