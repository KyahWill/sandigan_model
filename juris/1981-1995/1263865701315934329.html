				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The sufficiency of a complaint for injunction is what is chiefly involved
in these appellate proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court of Appeals, reversing the Trial Court, held that the complaint does set
out a cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is that
holding that is now challenged in this Court by the petitioner, Manila Banking
Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint was filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte by Luzon Brokerage Corporation against
said bank and two (2) others, the Pacific Copra Export Co., Inc. (PACOCO), and
the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span>
Norte.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Basically, it alleged the following facts, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Luzon Brokerage Corporation -- hereafter,
simply LUZON -- entered into (a) a "Field Warehouse Storage
Agreement" with PACOCO to operate warehouses in <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte for Philippine copra in bags and/or
in bulk,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and (b) some three and a half years later,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
a lease of the latter's two warehouses for the purpose of depositing copra
therein.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to the
agreements, <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> received from PACOCO for deposit in
said warehouses 150 long tons of <i><span style="">copra
<span class="SpellE">resecada</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>valued at P84<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, at least, in
connection with which <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> issued the following
warehouse receipt, viz.:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"FWR No. 978 dated July 29, 1964 for 150 long tons copra <span class="SpellE">resecada</span> "for the account of and to be delivered
without surrender of this warehouse receipt upon written order of Pacific
Banking Corporation, Manila, for Wells Fargo Bank, San Francisco, California,
Pledge for <span class="SpellE">Paxsmo</span> Inc., San Francisco, California,
covering Letter of Credit No. 14549."</p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some two months later,
Manila Banking Corporation -- hereafter simply MANILABANK -- addressed a formal
request to the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte to <span class="SpellE">extra­judicially</span> sell
the copra above described at public auction.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That request was made
without prior satisfaction of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> warehouseman's lien, the surrender of the warehouse
receipt, or presentation of a "written order" from the entities
mentioned in said receipt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Alleging further that the extra-judicial
sale was <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> rights, and would cause it injustice and irreparable
injury, the complaint prayed that:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a writ of
preliminary injunction be issued <i><span style="">ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>restraining
the defendants, their agents, representatives or deputies from selling the 150
long tons of copra in the two warehouses of PACOCO leased to plaintiff * * and
from molesting said plaintiff in its possession thereof;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">after</span>
due proceeding, defendants be perpetually enjoined from committing said acts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">defendants</span>
(MANILABANK and PACOCO) be sentenced to pay plaintiff not less than P6,000.00
by way of attorney's fees and other necessary expenses of litigation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">said</span>)
defendants ** taxed the costs of suit; (and) </blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 22.5pt; text-indent: -0.9pt;">* * (plaintiff) be
granted such other equitable remedies as may be deemed just in the
premises."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court issued a temporary restraining order and set the
application for preliminary injunction for hearing.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
MANILABANK filed an opposition to the injunction application.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>

The Court then issued an order requiring <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>,
MANILABANK, and another claimant to the copra, a certain <span class="SpellE">Ong</span>
<span class="SpellE">Hing</span> <span class="SpellE">Lian</span>, "to submit
simultaneous memoranda" on the issue.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the same Order,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court directed the following:</p>

<blockquote>"As the subject matter of this case is copra, which is
fungible, and copra will deteriorate in the passing of time, in order to save
this from deterioration and ultimate loss, to the prejudice of the party or
parties who may be found to be entitled to the same, the Court hereby directs
the Provincial Sheriff to cause notice to be published again according to law
for the sale at public auction of the copra in question, to the highest and
best bidder within five days from the time that the notices are published or
posted according to the requirements of the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Provincial Sheriff shall hold in his custody all the proceeds
of the sale of the copra until the court will have decided to whom to award the
same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The copra was accordingly sold at public auction for P78<span class="GramE">,470.11</span>, which amount was deposited with MANILABANK in the
name of the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte,
subject to the orders of the Trial Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Memoranda were also submitted by MANILABANK AND LUZON as
required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">MANILABANK's</span>
memorandum contained a motion to dismiss the complaint on the ground of failure
to state a cause of action.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span>
memorandum, as might be expected, included an opposition to the motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the Court promulgated an Order dismissing the
complaint with costs against plaintiff <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>, declaring
MANILABANK entitled to all the balance of the proceeds of the copra in the
amount of P78<span class="GramE">,062.71</span> and directing the Sheriff to
deliver the same to MANILABANK.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The Court cited the following reasons for the dismissal of the action:</p>

<p class="BODY">1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">a</span>
"re-reading of the complaint -</p>

<blockquote>* * does not show that
the plaintiff seeks to recover anything from the defendant Pacific Copra Export
Co., Inc., but only to prevent the defendant, the Manila Banking Corporation
and the Provincial Sheriff from doing something.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only avers that it has superior liens and
that it is entitled to the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> prayed for it only
for the issuance of a permanent injunction and for the defendants to pay the
plaintiff attorney's fees in the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>* * * (Moreover) under the New <span style="">Rules of Court, injunction can no longer be
maintained as a main action but only as ancillary or in aid to a main action."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">to</span>
follow <st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> theory to its logical conclusion would mean keeping the
copra indefinitely in the bodega of PACOCO, ultimately resulting in its
"loss by deterioration," to the prejudice of the parties;<span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>even if the action were
proper, LUZON could not be awarded the copra in question because, according to
its Field house Warehouse Receipt No. 978, the copra it was claiming was
deposited in Warehouse No. 8, whereas that mortgaged to MANILABANK was in
bodegas Numbered 1 and 2 of PACOCO; furthermore, while the chattel mortgage of
the copra in favor of MANILABANK had been duly registered, the warehouse
storage agreement relied on by LUZON had not been so registered; and</p>

<p class="BODY">4)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">the</span>
copra had already been sold at public auction, and the proceeds deposited with
MANILABANK subject to the Court's orders.</p>

<p class="BODY"><st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> appealed to the Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court set aside said order
of dismissal, declaring it to be "erroneous," and remanded the case
"to the lower court for further proceedings and trial on the merits."
In its Decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court of Appeals said:</p>

<p class="BODY">1) <span style="">&nbsp;</span>"There is still a
main action of injunction *<span style=""> </span>*
(which) should not be confused with the provisional remedy of preliminary
injunction."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2) <span style="">&nbsp;</span>"The complaint
states a sufficient cause of action * * (which is set out in its paragraphs 3
to 6, inclusive; i.e.,) the right to keep the copra in question in its custody
until its lien as a depository has been satisfied and to prevent the defendants
to sell said copra at public auction without satisfying the plaintiff's lien
thereon."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">MANILABANK appealed to this Court by <i>certiorari.</i><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here it raises the "principal question
of law ** (of) whether or not an <span style="">injunction
</span><span style="">can be </span><span style="">issued against consummated </span><span style="">acts;" and "as a corollary, whether
or not a case that has indubitably become moot and academic can still be tried
by a court."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals is of course correct in so far as it opines
that in this jurisdiction, and under the present state of the law, there is
"still a main action of injunction," which prays for judgment
embodying a <i>final </i>injunction and which is distinct from, and
"should not be confused with the provisional remedy of <i>preliminary </i><span style="">injunction," the </span><span style="">sole </span><span style="">object of which is to preserve the </span><i>status quo </i><span style="">until the merits </span><span style="">can </span><span style="">be heard.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 58 of the Rules of Court provides for both types of
remedies:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a <i>preliminary</i> and a <i>final</i>
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the Rule
defines a preliminary injunction as -</p>

<blockquote>"* * an order granted at any stage of an
action prior to the final judgment, requiring a person to refrain from a
particular act * * (or) the performance of a particular act, in which (latter)
case it shall be known as a preliminary mandatory injunction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Section 10 of the same Rule, on the other
hand, treats of a final injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>" * * If upon the trial of the action
it appears that the plaintiff is entitled to have the act complained of
permanently enjoined, the court shall grant a final injunction perpetually
restraining the defendant from the commission or continuance of the act or
confirming the preliminary mandatory injunction."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, Section 4, Rule 39, also adverted to by the
Appellate Tribunal, deals <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span> </i>with
"an action for injunction," and decrees that the judgment therein
"shall not be stayed after its rendition and before an appeal is taken or
during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of an appeal."</p>

<p class="BODY">An action for injunction, therefore, is as it has always <span class="GramE">been,</span> a recognized remedy in this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, as above intimated, a <span style="">suit </span>which has for its purpose the
enjoinment of the defendant, perpetually or for a particular time, from the
commission or continuance of a specific act, or his compulsion to continue
performance of a particular act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has
an independent existence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is similar
to the special civil action of prohibition under Rule 65, except that the
latter, in common with other special civil actions, deals with special matters
requiring a special procedure,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
i.e., it is concerned with public officers or entities performing public
duties:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>tribunals, corporations, boards,
or persons exercising functions <span style="">judicial
</span>or ministerial,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
whereas the former, an ordinary <span style="">suit,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>generally involves acts and
transactions of private individuals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
<i>action</i> for injunction is distinct from the <i>ancillary remedy</i> of
preliminary injunction which cannot exist except only as part or an incident of
an independent action or proceeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And, of course, in an <i>action</i> of injunction, the <i>auxiliary
remedy</i> of a preliminary injunction, prohibitory or mandatory, may issue.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><i>Ollendorf</i></span><i> v. Abrahamson,</i> <span style="">decided by this Court as early as in 1918,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is illustrative of this form of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case involved an "obligation imposed
upon defendant by the particular clause of his contract * * (which was) negative
in character" (i.e., “not to engage </span>in a similar or competitive
business to that of the plaintiff” anywhere within the Philippine Islands for a
period of five years).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
observed that the traditional mode of enforcing obligations of this sort was by
an injunction suit.</p>

<blockquote>" * * .<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unless
defendant voluntarily complies with his undertaking there is no way by which
the contract can be enforced except by the injunctive power of judicial
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such negative obligations have
long been enforced by the courts in this manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated by High in his well known work on
Injunctions (Vol. 2, pp. 877-878):</blockquote>

<blockquote>'The remedy by injunction to prevent the violation of negative
agreements, or contracts not to do a particular thing, is closely akin to the
remedy by way of specific performance of agreements of an affirmative
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In both cases the object is
substantially one and the same, and by enjoining the violation of a negative
agreement the court of equity in effect decrees its specific performance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Lumley <i>vs</i>. Wagner,
1 <span class="SpellE">DeGex</span>, M. &amp; G., 604).'</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Where by the terms of a contract imposing a positive obligation the
obligor is entitled to a specific performance, it will not avail the defendant
to show that plaintiff will suffer no pecuniary damage if the contract is not
performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon like reason, when the
undertaking is negative in character and defendant is violating the obligation
imposed upon him the court may interfere without requiring proof of actual
damage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(High on Injunctions, par. 1135,
citing Dickenson <i>vs</i>. Grand Junction Canal Co., 15 <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Beav</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> 270)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As well established is the rule that an action for permanent
injunction should be dismissed when it appears in the trial or otherwise that
the acts, to restrain which the action was begun, have been accomplished or
fully executed.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
It is this rule that infuses merit into the petition at bar, impelling issuance
of the writ thereby prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">The acts sought to be restrained by <st1:place><span class="SpellE">LUZON</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> complaint
have already been accomplished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the
complaint sought essentially was to perpetually stop the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> del Norte <span style="">and
his co-defendants, and "their agents, representatives or deputies from
selling the </span>150 <span style="">long tons of
copra in the two warehouses of PACOCO leased to plaintiff (LUZON) * * and from
molesting said plaintiff in its possession thereof." This, on the theory
that the extra-judicial foreclosure sale was being attempted without prior
satisfaction of <span class="SpellE">LUZON's</span> warehouseman's lien, the
surrender of the warehouse receipt, or presentation of a "written
order" from the entities mentioned in said receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But the undisputed fact is that <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place> had
long since ceased to have possession of the <i><span style="">copra <span class="SpellE">resecada</span>,</span></i><span style=""> </span>and the mortgage sale thereof has
already been consummated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
obviously no longer possible to <span style="">grant it
</span>the relief it was seeking against MANILABANK, i.e., the permanent
restraint of the mortgage sale of the copra, and of any interference with its
possession thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor may the complaint be deemed as alternatively praying for
payment of warehouse fees for not only does it fail to set out a prayer for the
payment of said fees, but more importantly, there is nothing in the body of the
complaint particularly setting forth a claim <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The general prayer "for such other <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> as may be just and proper" is meaningless in
this context.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, MANILABANK may not be deemed a debtor of <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>
as far as warehouse fees for the storage of copra deposited by PACOCO are
concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While <st1:place>LUZON</st1:place>
had a right of action against PACOCO to recover fees for the storage of the
copra deposited with it by the latter, it had no such right against <span style="">MANILABANK.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The only right that LUZON had </span><span class="SpellE"><i>vis</i></span><i>
a <span class="SpellE">vis</span></i> <span style="">MANILABANK
(or any other claimant of the deposited copra, aside from PACOCO) consisted of
the so-called warehouseman's lien, i.e., the right to retain possession of the
copra and refuse to release it to the claimant except only upon surrender of
the warehouse receipt and payment of the storage charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But that lien, being <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
in nature, was lost when </span><st1:place><span style="">LUZON</span></st1:place><span style=""> gave
up possession of the copra;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and when that happened, </span><st1:place><span style="">LUZON</span></st1:place><span style=""> ceased to have any right whatever against
MANILABANK with respect to the copra.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, as regards the deposit of the copra by </span><i>PACOCO </i><span style="">with </span><st1:place><span style="">LUZON</span></st1:place><span style="">, the latter had and has no right of action
against </span><i>MANILABANK</i> <span style="">for
