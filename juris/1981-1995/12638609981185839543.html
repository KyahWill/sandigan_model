13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">(a) </span>a decision of the Workmen's
Compensation Commission dated 29 November 1975 which reversed the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Decision </span>of the Acting Referee
awarding to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span>
and her children Mario and Ulysses, both surnamed <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span>,
compensation benefits by reason of the death of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span>,
as well as (b) the orders dated 19 July 1977 and 7 June 1978 of the Secretary
and Acting Secretary of the Department of Labor denying petitioners' first and
second Motions for Reconsideration, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span> started working for
private respondent Luzon Stevedoring Corporation as Barge Patron of one of its
barges sometime in 1930, and remained there until his death in 1965.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1963, he began to suffer from high blood

when Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span> returned home from work, he
complained to his wife of chest and stomach pains.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter brought him to the Philippine
General Hospital for treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pedro
died the very next day. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The cause of his
death was diagnosed as myocardial infarction, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="13" month="9">13 September 1966</st1:date>,
in representation of herself and her two (2) minor children, <span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span> <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span> through her then
counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Felizardo</span> Moreno, filed a claim for
compensation benefits under the pertinent provisions of the Workmen's
Compensation Act (Act No. 3428, as amended) docketed as Case No. <span class="GramE">RO-4-WC-5412.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="9">29 September 1966</st1:date>, without any
authority from <span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span>, Atty. Moreno filed a motion
to dismiss claiming that the filing of said motion was authorized by petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span> and that petitioner was no longer interested
in prosecuting her claim against respondent company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Acting Referee granted said motion in his
order dated <st1:date year="1966" day="29" month="9">29 September 1966</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 November 1966, <span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span> through
another counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Gaspar</span> <span class="SpellE">Tagle</span>
filed a motion for reconsideration of the order of dismissal, claiming that she
had not consented to the filing of the motion to dismiss, not having understood
its contents:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that she never had the
intention of asking for dismissal of her claim and had not received any
pecuniary benefits by reason of the said dismissal; that the said dismissal had
prejudiced her interest and that of her children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Acting Referee denied the motion for
having been filed out of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
order of denial was served on the petitioners through their new counsel on <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="2">1 February 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 February 1967, petitioner interposed a Petition for Review
on the following grounds, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that
the order dismissing the claim was null and void considering that the motion to
dismiss dated 29 September 1966 was filed without the authority of <span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span> and her children; that the Acting Referee's order
dated 29 September 1966 did not start the running of the period to file the
petition for review since the same was not served on petitioners' counsel; that
the Petition for Review was filed under the provisions of Section 38 of the
Rules of Court which had supplemental effect under Section 2, Rule 7 of the
Rules of the Workmen's Compensation Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Petition for Review (or for relief) remained formally <span class="SpellE">unacted</span> upon despite the fact that the Commission in
October 1971 remanded the case to its Regional Office No. 4 for further
proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several years went by without any further proceedings being
taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="11">29 November 1974</st1:date>, petitioners <span class="SpellE">refiled</span>
their claim which was docketed as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">RO-4-WC
</span>Case No. 160991.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the
re-filed claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>furnished to <span class="GramE">private respondent corporation which, on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="14" month="1"><span class="GramE">14 January 1975</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, filed its Employer's Report of Accident or Sickness <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> petitioner's claim on grounds of "(a)
lack of employer-employee relationship; (b) cause of death not
service-connected; and (c) claim is time-barred."</span> The Acting
Referee then required the parties to file their respective affidavits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span>
filed her affidavit to which she attached a certification of her marriage to
the deceased and the baptismal certificates of her minor children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="GramE">corporation</span>
filed nothing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="8">25 August 1975</st1:date>, the
Acting Referee awarded to petitioners the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,990.40</span>
as compensation benefits, P200.00 as burial expenses and P300.00 as attorney's
fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision, private respondent corporation
filed with the Workmen's Compensation Commission a motion for reconsideration
on the ground of <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of another, similar claim
filed by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="11">29 November 1975</st1:date>,
the Workmen's Compensation Commission reversed the decision of the Acting Referee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Commission ruled that there was no causal
connection between the work of the deceased and the cause of his death,
petitioners having failed to show that the deceased was incapacitated for work
prior to his death:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>and, that the
Certificate of Marriage and the Baptismal Certificates submitted by petitioners
were insufficient to prove their relationship with and <span class="SpellE">filiation</span>
to the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners filed two
(2) motions for reconsideration both of which were denied by the Secretary and
the Acting Secretary of the Department of Labor, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant Petition for Review, the petitioners assail the
decision of the Commission for not having entertained their two (2) motions for
reconsideration although meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">In turn, respondent company urges that, under the provisions of
the Labor Code, petitioners' motion for reconsideration of the decision of the
Commission dated 29 November 1975 was filed out of time, having been filed
beyond the ten-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be observed that petitioners' claim
was filed under the pertinent provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act and <u>not</u>
of the Labor Code, and that under the former <span class="GramE">Act,</span> the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period was fifteen (15) days.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:17.1pt">The records show that while the claim
was pending before the Commission, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hermoso</span>,
petitioners' previous counsel, was appointed to the Judge Advocate General's
Office (JAGO) and at the time the decision was received in his house on 22
December 1975, he was away at <span class="SpellE">Mactan</span> Airbase serving
as its Provost Court Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
only on <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="1">5 January 1976</st1:date>, when
he came back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> that he had
learned of said decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
he was able to file the motion for reconsideration only on <st1:date year="1976" day="13" month="1">13 January 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In view of this excusable negligence, we believe that the period should
be considered to have had started to run from <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="1">6 January 1976</st1:date> and not from <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="12">22 December 1975</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under this view, the first motion for reconsideration may be regarded as
filed seasonably.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As is well-known, the
Workmen's Compensation Act is a piece of social welfare legislation which seeks
to give effect to the concept of social justice,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
and the provisions of which should accordingly be liberally construed in favor
of the employee or the claimant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not
petitioners are entitled to the compensation benefits under the provisions of
the Workmen's Compensation Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that petitioners' claim was not just denied by the
Commission on the ground of lack of causal connection between Pedro's death and
the conditions of his work, but also for the reason that the petitioners had
allegedly failed to establish their relationship to the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As observed, however, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Tibulan</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> had </span>in fact attached to her
affidavit filed with the Acting Referee several documents to support her claim,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>a medical certificate, the
baptismal certificates of petitioners Mario and Ulysses <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span>,
a certification of <span class="SpellE">Mansueta's</span> marriage to the
deceased issued by the parish priest who had solemnized the marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mansueta</span> had also
attached to her motion for reconsideration which she had filed with the
Commission copies of the birth certificates of Mario and Ulysses <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
totality of this evidence was, in this case, quite sufficient to establish
petitioners' relationship to the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In any case, it is merely commonplace to note that strict observance of
the technical rules of evidence is not properly demanded in Workmen's
Compensation cases.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> did not present any
evidence <span class="SpellE">controverting</span> petitioners' documentation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent company, whatever else it may have stated in its
earlier "Employer's Report of Accident and Sickness," does not
dispute before this Court that Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span> had been
in its employ as Barge Patron during his lifetime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records further show that Pedro's illness
had begun in 1963 while still employed by the respondent company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering that the claim was filed under
the provisions of the Workmen's Compensation Act, petitioners are entitled to
the presumption of compensability which, under the provisions of said act, <span class="GramE">arise</span> under the aforementioned circumstances.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Because Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan's</span> illness is
presumed to be compensable, his employer, <span class="GramE">respondent
corporation</span>, had the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">burden </span>of
<span class="SpellE">controverting</span> and overcoming such presumption with
competent evidence showing that the deceased's illness was <u>not</u> in fact
work-connected and had in fact <u>not</u> been aggravated by the conditions of
his employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not believe that respondent company was successful <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>discharging the burden of disproving
the work-relatedness of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan's</span> illness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company merely argued that because
the deceased was occupying a supervisory position, therefore, the cause of his
death could not be directly traceable to his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To overcome the legal presumption of
compensability, evidence must do more than merely create a doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, no substantial doubt was generated by respondent company's
contention.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the petitioners claimed that the conditions
under which Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span> had served as Barge Patron
had some connection with the emergence and development of the disease which
caused his death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners pointed
out that the deceased had worked for respondent company for almost thirty-five
(35) years, from 1930 up to his death on <st1:date year="1965" day="24" month="12">24 December 1965</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The barge to which the deceased was assigned was being used to transport
heavy cargoes up and down and around the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>
and had under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">his </span>supervision
only two (2) sailors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These conditions
lead us to the inference that while the position of the deceased was not one
requiring mainly manual labor, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">nonetheless,
he could not have avoided strenuous physical activity in carrying out his
duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the captain or patron
of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cargo barge was not expected to, and would
not have been allowed to, live his life behind a desk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Further, it appears that
when Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan</span> first joined respondent company,
he was in fact </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">good health.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where an employee entered employment in </span>g<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">ood health and suffered an illness in the course of employment which
illness he never had before said employment, he has in his favor the statutory
presumption that his disease or illness is compensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once more, <span class="GramE">respondent
corporation</span> was unable to overturn the applicable statutory presumption
of compensability and of the work-related character of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Tibulan's</span> illness.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Finally, since respondent
company failed to submit any affidavit or counter-affidavit to the Acting
Referee as required by the provisions of Department Order No. 3, it must be
deemed to have renounced its right to challenge petitioners' claim and to have
waived all non-jurisdictional defenses.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Acting Referee's
award in 1975 in favor of petitioners was clearly in order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is difficult to </span>understand why
private <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> should have felt
compelled to appeal that award which came after the claim had been pending for
nine (9) years; that appeal was frivolous and insubstantial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is even more difficult to comprehend the
reversal of that award by the Commission in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>decision notable only for its
failure to apply the simple and widely-known statutory presumption of
compensation, and which compelled petitioners to come to this Court and which
resulted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in </span>the further prolongation
of this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these circumstances,
petitioners are entitled to legal interest on the amount of the original award
computed from the date of rendition of that award by the Acting Referee.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
