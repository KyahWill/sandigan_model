of the Regional Trial Court of Gapan, Nueva Ecija, convicting him of violation
of Sec. 4, Art. II, of R.A. No. 6425, otherwise known as "The Dangerous
Drugs Act of 1972," as amended, the Information alleging that on 18 March
1987, in Gapan, Nueva Ecija, the accused sold, delivered and gave away to
another two (2) tea bags of dried marijuana leaves or Indian hemp without
authority of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution:  After conducting surveillance on the reported drug activities of the
brothers "Yakee" and "Raul", elements of the Philippine
Constabulary at Aurora Narcom District, Nueva Ecija, proceeded to the suspects’
residence at Daang Bakal, Sto. Niño, Gapan, in the afternoon of 18 March
1987.  "Yakee" is Marcelino
and "Raul" is Rolando, both surnamed Quetua.  They were reported to be drug pushers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The raiding team, composed of T/Sgt. Pablito E. Reyno, Sgt.
Danilo S. Maullon, Sgt. Juanito dela Cruz, CIC Romeo de Jesus, civilian agent
Edgar Punzal and a civilian/confidential informer, arrived at the residence of
the suspects around 4:50 in the afternoon.  While the rest of the team positioned themselves some 50 to 60 meters
away, Sgt. Reyno, acting as poseur-buyer, together with the civilian informer,
went to the house of the suspects and expressed to "Raul" his desire
to "score" which means, in local parlance, to buy marijuana.  Appellant then entered the house.  When he came out, he brought with him two
(2) tea bags of the prohibited stuff<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and handed them over to Sgt. Reyno who paid P10.00 in marked money.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Whereupon, the accused was arrested.  Upon questioning, the accused voluntarily surrendered a brown paper
containing marijuana fruiting tops weighing approximately 200 grams,
twenty-three (23) tea bags of marijuana fruiting tops, and a yellow plastic bag
marked "AJINOMOTO" containing marijuana seeds also weighing
approximately 200 grams.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused was then brought to the Field Office of the raiding team where Sgt.
Reyno, as Investigating Officer, prepared a Certificate of Field Test,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
a Booking Sheet and Arrest Report,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
as well as a Receipt of Property Seized/Confiscated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, to refute the alleged sale of marijuana and
establish that appellant was actually framed-up, the defense presented Filomena
Arcilla (neighbor and sister-in-law of appellant), Luningning Quetua
(appellant's mother), Danilo Cabanlit, and appellant himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Filomena Arcilla testified that in the afternoon of 18 March
1987, she was near the house of her neighbor Lucing de Guzman from where she
could see the house of appellant.  She
saw a tricycle stop in front of the gate with two (2) passengers one of whom
alighted, looking for "Yakee." "Raul" came out and talked
to the visitor for two to three minutes.  The other passenger then alighted and gave him a blow on the face that
felled him.  Then "Raul" was
handcuffed after which a Ford Fiera arrived with eight (8) or more armed
passengers.  They entered and ransacked
appellant's house for about fifteen (15) minutes.  As Filomena watched the entire occurrence, she did not see “Raul”
hand anything to the men nor anything being carried by them away from the
house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Luningning Quetua confirmed that, although she was also present, she did not
see the soldiers take things from the house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On his part, appellant asserts that in the afternoon of the
incident, he noticed a tricycle cruising around his house.  The passengers appeared to be looking for
somebody.  The tricycle stopped in front
of the gate after which a passenger alighted looking for his brother
Yakee." Since "Yakee" was not home, appellant came out of the
house and advised the callers to return some other time.  But they came right back<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and told him they were looking for marijuana.  After appellant gave them a negative response, an argument ensued.  He was hit, handcuffed, and while being held
by the collar, was forced to go inside the house.  Then he was brought to the Gapan Police Station where he was
coerced into signing Exh. "F", an improvised plastic envelope containing
the two (2) tea bags, and two or three documents.  He was compelled to sign whenever a member of the team would hit
him on the head with a stapler.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The next morning, Sgt. Reyno went to see appellant in jail and
told him he would be freed if he could produce his brother.  After a week, Sgt. Reyno again visited him,
this time telling him that he had to identify another pusher to gain his
freedom.  But not knowing any pusher nor
the whereabouts of his brother, appellant was not released.  However, he was told by his friends that
according to the companions of Sgt. Reyno he could be released if he could
produce P10,000.00.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying for the accused, Donato Cabanlit narrated that as
civilian informer of the NARCOM for three (3) weeks, he was aware of the <i>modus
operandi</i> of Sgt. Reyno and his team of bringing marijuana in their raids
for the purpose of "planting evidence" on their intended victim so
that they could arrest him, extort money, and file a complaint whenever their
demand was not met.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of appellant Rolando Quetua alias "Raul",
the team met in the morning and discussed the possible arrest of Marcelino
alias "Yakee" whom they claimed to be a drug pusher.  The team members agreed to observe their
usual practice of bringing marijuana with them in their operation and he
(Cabanlit) was even the one who got the tea bags (Exh. "F") from the
office cabinet where they were kept.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Part of the plot was to arrest any of the Quetua brothers in the event that
Marcelino himself could not be arrested.  Cabanlit claimed that he had to testify because he could no longer stand
the continued incriminatory machinations being committed against innocent
victims by this team.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Unfortunately, the trial court did not consider the testimonies
of Filomena Arcilla and Donato Cabanlit as worthy of belief because the former
is the sister-in-law of the accused, while the latter was a “disgruntled"
informer.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the court <i>a quo</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Forensic Chemist, Capt. Marlene Salangad, testified that
while the two (2) tea bags were positive of marijuana,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
they were brought to her for examination only on 20 March 1988, or two (2) days
after the buy-bust operation.  The two
(2) tea bags were not even properly identified.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">CIC Romeo de Jesus’ testimony hardly carries any weight.  It is centered merely on the briefing conducted
before, and the investigation after, the buy-bust operation.  No account was given of the actual sale or
exchange of the prohibited stuff with the marked money.  Sgt. de Jesus, being then positioned some 50
to 60 meters away from Sgt. Reyno, and the confidential informer as well as the
appellant, only saw them talking but did not hear their conversation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, he and the rest of the team approached the trio only when a commotion
ensued.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from Exh. “F" (marijuana tea bags) and Exh.
"A" (marked money), which appellant insists were "planted,”
there is nothing left on record to establish the alleged sale of marijuana
except the following uncorroborated testimony of Sgt. Reyno-</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>When
you reached Sto. Niño, Daang Bakal, what did you do?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We concede that it is possible to convict an accused on the sole
testimony of a witness so long as it is positive and credible, especially where
the witness is a police officer who enjoys the presumption of regularity of the
performance of his duties.  However, in
the case before Us, the testimony of Sgt. Reyno does not satisfy the quantum of
proof required to convict the accused.  His uncorroborated account of the alleged sale is too sketchy to sustain
a conviction under Sec. 4, Art. II of R.A. 6425 where the sale without
authority of law has to be clearly and unmistakably established.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
The evidence for the prosecution appears confined merely to
buyer-told-seller-of­-intention-to-buy-marijuana, and
seller-handed-over-stuff-while-buyer-gave-P10.00-as payment.  But how could appellant, as seller, have
known what quantity to bring when from the testimony he did not even have the
slightest idea of how much marijuana Sgt. Reyno, as buyer, was interested in
purchasing.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, how could Sgt. Reyno have known how much the
stuff would cost when he did not even ask about the price nor the quantity of
the stuff when it was handed over to him?  Considering that the thrust of the prosecution is that appellant sold
marijuana to the government agents in their buy-bust operation, the prosecution
should have at least enlightened the court on how Sgt. Reyno and appellant, as
buyer and seller, respectively, came to agree on the quantity of marijuana and
the price therefor.  The absence of such
conversation engenders serious doubt on whether there was any sale of marijuana
at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, Sgt. Reyno's credibility, to Our mind, has been
seriously eroded.  Witness Donato
Cabanlit clearly narrated how Sgt. Reyno and his team, as a matter of practice,
would "plant" marijuana on hapless victims and then demand money from
them in return for a whitewash.  Although the trial court may have reason for doubting Cabanlit's
credibility as he was "disgruntled” when Sgt. Reyno did not render
assistance to him when his child got sick despite previous agreement for
payment of his services as informer,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
We find it difficult to believe that Cabanlit merely concocted the story just
to get back at Sgt. Reyno.  For, in the
process of unraveling the vicious <i>modus operandi</i> of the government
agents concerned, Cabanlit was also incriminating himself by admitting his
participation in the nefarious operations.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case of Rolando Quetua, Cabanlit admitted that he was even the one who
got the two (2) tea bags from the office cabinet where they were kept.  It is not likely that a person would
sacrifice his reputation and risk prosecution just to get even with
someone.  It is even probable that the
fact that Sgt. Reyno did not help him in his time of dire need served as the
catalyst for Cabanlit to end his silence and expose the nefarious activities of
the apprehending team which were in fact the subject of an expose’ in the 30
June 1988 issue of a local newspaper, entitled "Narcom Team's Relief
Sought,”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
which however the trial court did not admit in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, a cloud of doubt has been seriously cast
on the credibility of Sgt. Reyno on whose testimony hinges the cause of the
prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that the accused does not have the burden of proving
his innocence to avert a conviction; rather, it is for the prosecution to
overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence and establish the guilt of
the accused with proof beyond reasonable doubt.  We emphasize this with greater force in the case at bar where
violation of "The Dangerous Drugs Act," particularly Sec. 4, Art. II,
is visited with such stiff penalty as life imprisonment to death<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
and a fine ranging from P20,000.00 to P30,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">By this reversal, We are not holding that appellant is innocent,
but that the prosecution failed to establish his guilt with the required
quantum of proof, i.e., proof beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision finding the accused <i>ROLANDO S.
QUETUA</i> alias "Raul" guilty of violating Sec. 4, Art. II of R.A.
6425, is <i>REVERSED</i> and <i>SET ASIDE,</i> and the accused is <i>ACQUITTED</i>
on the ground of reasonable doubt.</p>
