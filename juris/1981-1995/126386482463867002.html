person left as all the others before her who lined up to fetch water had
already gone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing that she was alone,
appellant approached and poked a sharp pointed object wrapped in a piece of
cloth (believed by complainant to be a knife) at the left portion of her neck

complainant while lying on the rocks, by positioning himself on top of her
after removing his pants and pulling her panty down and succeeded in having
carnal knowledge of her despite her struggle to free herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All this time, appellant continued to hold
the knife aimed </span>at her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">neck,

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">About four days later,
appellant went to the victim's house to ask her hand in marriage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She rejected such proposal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Right then and there he was apprehended by
the police. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand,
appellant, in his testimony as sole witness for the defense, does </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">deny having had sexual intercourse with the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he claims that it was voluntary and
without the use of force since they were lovers, appellant having courted and
finally winning the love of complainant whom he met in November 1979.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Such claim is not
substantiated by the evidence on the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Except for his oral testimony in court, nobody or nothing was presented
in court to corroborate appellant's testimony of their alleged
relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim refuted such
testimony of the appellant, when she denied on the witness stand any amorous
relationship between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
if they were indeed sweethearts, why did the complainant refuse appellant's
offer of marriage after they had already engaged in sex and instead she chose
to undergo the rigors and humiliation of a public trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such reaction is unnatural for a young girl
who had had sexual intimacies with the man of her choice if she truly loves
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is no showing that
she is a girl of loose morals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One can
only surmise the pain and embarrassment the victim went through during trial
because as the lower court observed:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the
complainant was so shy or sensitively embarrassed to narrate what the accused
did to her relative to the sexual intercourse and had to pause in her testimony
to muster courage to say publicly what apparently was to her a very shameful
experience."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant insinuates that
complainant wanted them to have the time </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">for </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">themselves so that
she deliberately chose the wee hours of the morning to fetch water and she
allowed her sister to leave her alone at the public faucet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is purely conjectural and has no factual
basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the fact that it was
established that they had no amorous relationship, it has been shown that the
victim lives in a neighborhood where their only source of water </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a public faucet located at </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Dayap</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> St</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that there were many people fetching water from the same
faucet, she had no control of her time as to when she would be able to finish
drawing water.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appellant faults the
victim for not shouting to ask for help since the place where the incident
happened was not dark and isolated contrary to the findings of the trial
court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also claims that the victim
could have easily shouted for help while still at the faucet as it was located
near </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">house and that there were still other people
who lined up after her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it may be
true that several people arrived after her, it was also possible that when she
lined up for the last time, no other people followed her, considering that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">she </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">had to line up before the faucet not only once because after filling up
a smaller container, she had to transfer its contents to a drum placed in a
push cart, after which she had to fall in line again.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Comp</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">l</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ainant
admitted that the corner of <span class="SpellE">Bermeo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> streets was lighted with a <span class="SpellE">flourescent</span>
lamp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this lighted corner was
located sixteen (16) meters away from the exact spot where the rape occurred so
that the spot where the rape occurred was hardly illuminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As to the corner of <span class="SpellE">Dayap</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Bermeo</span> Sts., there was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">no </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">showing that the <span class="SpellE">Meralco</span> post was lighted,
and even if this was lighted, the light could not have possibly reached the
place of the incident as the distance between them was approximately ninety
(90) meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the presence
of plants and bushes taller than a normal person on the spot where the rape
occurred, effectively blocked any light coming from the corner of <span class="SpellE">Calatagan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bermeo</span>
Streets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides at </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="15"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">3:00 o'clock</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> in the morning the streets were already
deserted and it is reasonable to expect that people inside their homes were
already asleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have ruled that
presence of people </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a certain vicinity does not preclude the
commission of rape (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Managbanag</span> 155 SCRA
669) which may be committed in parties or by the roadside, or in school
premises or in other places where people usually pass by (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Aragona</span> 138 SCRA 569).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Accused-appellant argues
that it was impossible for him to remove his pants, pull the victim's panty
down to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">her </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">knees and insert his penis into victim's
organ while he was on top of her while holding a knife with his left hand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He questions the fact that the garter of
complainant's panty remained intact even after the alleged resistance </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">struggling of the victim to free herself.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Considering that the
victim was continuously threatened by the appellant with an object (believed by
the victim to be a knife) pointed at her neck, thus it would be expected that
fear for her life was simply overpowering and stifling any attempt to resist
the sexual assault of the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
enunciated in the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cabradilla</span>, (133
SCRA 413) We reiterate the following:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The working of human mind when placed under emotional stress,
however, are unpredictable and people react differently.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this given situation, some may shout; some
may faint; and some may be shocked into insensibility; while some may openly
welcome <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the intrusion."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The fact that the garter
of victim's panty remained intact </span>does not negate rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could be possible that in the course of
her struggle, her panty slipped down from her knees until it was eventually off
her legs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if it stayed just below
her knees, sexual intercourse would not be impossible since the garter was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">stretchable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant's feat in raping the complainant may be </span>difficult to
achieve but it is not at all impossible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Usually passion is high when one desires what is not his so that no
obstacle is too difficult to overcome to achieve what is intended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim might be lacking tenacity or vigor
in her resistance but that does not indicate consent to the sexual intercourse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If she did, why did she lose no time in
complaining the rape to her parents and why did she denounce the appellant at
the police headquarters before daybreak, rejecting later on, the proposal of
marriage by the appellant?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these
circumstances strongly reject the theory of appellant's innocence.</p>
