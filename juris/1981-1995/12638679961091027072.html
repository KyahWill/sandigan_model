<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT

AMBIT OF ART. 335 <span class="GramE">PARAGRAPH</span> 2 OF THE REVISED PENAL
CODE.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT
THE PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT THE CONVICTION OF THE
ACCUSED BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT." (Appellant's Brief, p. 3)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">According to Article 335
of the Revised Penal Code, rape is committed by having carnal knowledge of a
woman under any of the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) by using force or intimidation; (2) when the woman is deprived of
reason or otherwise unconscious; (3) when the woman is under twelve years of
age, even though neither of the circumstances mentioned above are present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the case at bar, the
trial court convicted Nguyen <span class="SpellE">Dinh</span> <span class="SpellE">Nhan</span>,
the accused-appellant, for rape under the second circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found that the complainant,
Tran <span class="SpellE">Thi</span> <span class="SpellE">Thic</span> Doan was a
woman deprived of reason as she is a mental retardate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant adopts a two-pronged defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His first defense is premised on the
exclusion of the psychological report.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He argues that without the said report, there <span style="">is </span>then no evidence establishing the complainant's mental
retardation.</p>

<p class="BODY">But on the off chance that the psychological report confirming
the complainant's mental retardation will be admitted, his second defense is
based on the argument that the deprivation of reason mentioned in Article 335
paragraph 2 of the Revised Penal Code means complete deprivation of
reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant, then, does not
fall under said category as she is not one completely deprived of reason.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's first defense is contained in the first two
assigned errors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant questions
the admissibility and the adequacy of the psychological report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"C") upon which the trial
court anchored its findings that the complainant is a mental retardate.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>to
its admissibility, he <span style="">contends that the
psychological </span>report is hearsay, <span style="">thus,
has no probative value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to its
adequacy, he states that the report is the </span>product of tests which <span style="">are not in accordance with universally
accepted procedures in ascertaining the mental condition of the person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There </span>is no need <span style="">to delve on the adequacy of the psychological
report as it is true that without presenting Sonia <span class="SpellE">Margallo</span>,
the </span>psychologist <span style="">who prepared
the questioned report as a witness, the said report is </span>hearsay evidence
(Rule 130, Sec. 36, Revised Rules on Evidenced; US <span style="">V. </span><span class="SpellE">Lorenzana</span>, 12 Phil., 64, 70 [1908]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant is entitled to
cross-examine the psychologist who made the report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without such examination the accused would be
deprived of his right to confront and examine the witnesses against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On this basis, the appellant, in his fourth assigned error,
contends that without the psychological report, there is no sufficient evidence
to support his conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He adds that no other evidence were adduced
that touch on the mental capacity of the complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's contention this <span class="GramE">time,</span> is
without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon a close perusal of the records, we find that contrary to
appellant's contention, there is enough evidence to support the appellant's
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant's mental
condition was amply established d<span style="">espite
the non-admission of the psychological report, </span>by the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses, Socorro <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> and Caroline
McClure and by the testimony of the <span style="">appellant
himself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Socorro <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, a doctor of medicine, testified that she had
examined Doan several times </span>before the rape incident, (TSN, November 8,
1989, p. 8) hence, she had ample opportunity to observe her behavior.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, after her very first examination of
the complainant she recommended that the complainant be psychologically examined
as she suspected her to be a handicap case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, November 8, 1989, p. 8) In her testimony she positively declared
that Doan is mentally retarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, November 8, 1989, p. 11).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Caroline McClure, a social worker of the Community and Family
Services International (C.F.S.I) at the Vietnamese Refugees Center, (the camp
where complainant and appellant were staying) likewise, testified that Doan is
mentally handicapped (TSN, November 9, 1989, p. 2) Although McClure admitted
that she is not a psychologist, (TSN, November 9, 1989, p. 6) she is still in a
position to know the mental condition of the complainant as she has known the
complainant ever since May 18, 1989, the date of the arrival of the complainant
at the center.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant was <span style="">a </span>regular client of the C.F.S.I
precisely because of her mental condition.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, November 9, 1989, p. 2) It was also due to Doan's mental condition
that McClure had to assist her in filing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, November 9, 1989, p. 5)</p>

<p class="BODY">However, it was the <span style="">appellant's
</span>own testimony which created the greatest damage to his defense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant admitted in open court that he
knew that the complainant is mentally and physically handicapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, December 12, 1989, p. 6)</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 129, Sec. <span style="">4 </span>of
the Revised Rules of Evidence states that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 4.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Judicial admissions.</span>
- An admission, verbal or written, made by a party in the course of the
proceedings in the same case, does not require proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The admission may be contradicted only by
showing that it was made through palpable mistake or that no such admission was
made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There was no showing that the admission was made through palpable
mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant cannot deny that
he made such an admission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, he
cannot say that there was no evidence which dwelled on the mental capacity of
the complainant when he himself admitted to that lack of mental capacity.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the knowledge of the appellant about the mental
condition of the complainant might have emboldened him to commit the despicable
act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having established that the complainant is a mental retardate,
the second defense of the appellant now comes into play.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third assigned error, the appellant claims that a woman
"deprived of reason" as used in Article 335, paragraph 2 of Revised
Penal Code should be construed as one completely deprived of <span style="">intelligence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>It was the claim of the prosecution that the complainant is only
an imbecile <span style="">or a </span>woman suffering
from mental weakness, <span class="GramE">hence,</span> she could not be
categorized as a woman "deprived of reason."</p>

<p class="BODY">This claim must fail.</p>

CA-G.R. </span>No. 6366-R, March 6, 1953, 49 O.G. 2331, 2338 (June 1953) which <span style="">states:</span></p>

<blockquote>"The deprivation of reason contemplated by law does not need
to be complete.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mental abnormality or
deficiency is enough.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So it was held by
the Supreme Court of Spain that a man having carnal knowledge of a woman whose
mental faculties are not normally developed or who is suffering from <span class="SpellE">hemiplegia</span> and mentally backward or who is an idiot commits
the crime of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sentences of
November 19, 1930, May 11, 1932 and June 24, 1935)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Whatever term may describe the complainant, be it an imbecile or
a woman suffering from mental weakness, there is no question about her mental
retardation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant's
abnormality stuck out like a sore thumb at the center.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her behavior as a mental retardate was so
obvious that even the appellant who is not a man of science concluded that she
was mentally handicapped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her being a
regular client of the C.F.S.I. shows that she had to be assisted and guided
unlike a normal 17 year old girl.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, no motive can be ascribed to the complainant other than
a desire for justice and redress for a terrible wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Puedan</span>, G.R.
