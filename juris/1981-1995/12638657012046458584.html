volume of transactions in sugar and other products and a relatively high profit
in its first year of operation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The business
activity on sugar, however, abruptly sagged, and the corporation decided to
engage in other ventures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such was the

<st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1974</st1:date>, the Board of
Directors amended the said resolution through its Resolution No. 33,
authorizing the issuance of <span class="SpellE">unissued</span> shares out of

payable on or before </span><st1:date year="1974" day="31" month="8"><span class="GramE">August 31, 1974</span></st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Latchme</span> <span class="SpellE">Motoomull</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> purchased <span class="SpellE">unissued</span>
stock in accordance with the resolution and within the period stated therein,
while the other stockholders did not exercise their right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Payment of the exemption fee, however, was
made only on <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1974</st1:date>
and as such, the certificate of exemption or resolution granting the same was
issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission only on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, because the by-laws provided that the annual stockholders'
meeting should be held on the second Saturday of September of each year, a
written notice for the holding thereof on September 14, 1974 was circularized
on August 19, 1974 among the stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The meeting was, however, advanced to <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1974</st1:date>, after notification of the stockholders
by telephone allegedly upon the request of Mr. and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aranas</span> who were slated to leave on <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1974</st1:date> for <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other stockholders allegedly agreed to
this request.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this adjusted date, the
meeting was held presided over by Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> upon
his designation by the President, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Latchme</span> <span class="SpellE">Motoomull</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During
that meeting a financial statement was submitted, but the same was not approved
by the stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> announced that an election for the
members of the board of directors would be held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was protested by private respondents who
instead moved that the present set of officers be considered reelected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was not given due course by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> who then distributed the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The voting was by secret ballot, utilizing
the cumulative system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
votes were canvassed by Mr. <span class="SpellE">Despi</span>, an accountant, who
announced the result which showed that petitioners <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Motoomull</span> garnered more votes than what they
should have considering the actual number of shares subscribed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other stockholders, particularly the
private respondents, evinced surprise on the number of votes garnered by
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Motoomull</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>
explained that the additional number of shares was a result of the exercise of
their rights to the additional shares of stocks taken from the <span class="SpellE">unissued</span> shares, as authorized by the stockholders in
Resolution No. 33.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This started the
commotion, resulting in the walk-out of some stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="9">September
 14, 1974</st1:date>, another meeting was held, the proceedings of which
appeared merely to be a repetition of the September 11 meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The minutes thereof (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> '27') show that the only stockholders present
were Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, <span class="SpellE">Latchme</span>
<span class="SpellE">Motoomull</span>, and Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Jesswani</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the meeting was held, with
Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Jesswani</span> acting as the secretary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Another election was held by these

</span>The foregoing incident was apparently the ultimate reason which
constrained the private respondents to institute action against petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, private respondents filed Civil Case No. 11601, which is
still pending trial in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They filed a

said letter-complaint, the alleged acts committed by the petitioners that
jeopardize their rights are:</p>

<blockquote>“(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the provision
in the by-laws fixing the date of the election of corporate directors, we were
sent notices of a special meeting to be held earlier and then said officers

<blockquote>“(b) <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In order to assure their election, said
officers also surreptitiously acquired additional shares of stock from the <span class="SpellE">unissued</span> shares of the corporation in derogation of our
preemptive rights to purchase said shares.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We have insisted on
the dissolution of the corporation in view of <span class="GramE">these

resistance of said officers.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

corporate funds as there has been no meeting of the board of directors called.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(e) We have been denied access to the corporate books and
records and have been compelled to go to court to enforce this right."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

pp. 42-45), the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which, reads:</p>

another 5,000 shares to Manuel <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> on August 28,

in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="27" month="2">February 27,

restraining order (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 151).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1976</st1:date>,

172-190) while private respondents filed a Rejoinder and Motion to Dismiss (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 191-212).</p>

<p class="BODY">After an extensive discussion of the issues by the parties in
their pleadings, among which is to the effect that the Honorable Court of
Appeals not only has no jurisdiction to issue the preliminary injunction prayed
for, but altogether the Court has no jurisdiction to continue taking cognizance
of the case because of the passage of P.D. No. 902-A which transferred the
jurisdiction of the appeal from the Court of Appeals to the Supreme Court,
Respondent Court of Appeals issued a resolution dated November 4, 1976 (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 243-254), the <span class="SpellE">decretal</span> portion of which, reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the appellant's motion for the issuance of a writ
of preliminary injunction is hereby denied and the restraining order previously
issued by this Court is hereby lifted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A Motion for Reconsideration was filed (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 255-261),
but the same was denied in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1976</st1:date> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 273).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant
petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The First Division of this Court, after the parties had filed the
required pleadings, in a resolution dated June 17, 1977 (<u>Ibid.</u>, p. 319),
resolved to give due course to the petition; and in a resolution dated July 20,
1977 (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 323), the case was declared submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">privotal</span> issue in this case is the
meaning of the word "Court" as used in Section 5 of R.A. No. 5434,
which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Effect of appeal.</span> -
Appeal shall not stay the award, order, ruling, decision or judgment unless the
officer or body rendering the same or the court, on motion, after hearing, and
on such terms as it may deem just, should provided otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The propriety of a stay granted by the
officer or body rendering the award, order, ruling, decision or judgment may be
raised only by motion in the main case."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals ruled that the word "court"
in the said section refers to the Court of Agrarian Relations and not to the
Court of Appeals, the former belonging to the group of bodies whose decision
under R.A. 5434 is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the latter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, the power to stay the
appealed decision clearly belongs to the lower court, officer or body rendering
the decision, in this case to the SEC alone and not to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioners maintain that the word
"court" having been separated from the phrase officer or body
rendering the same, refers to the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the outset, the law <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span>
stated its declared objective that appeal shall not stay the appealed decision,
award, order, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception given
is where the officer or body rendering the same, or the court on motion, after
hearing should provide otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
line with the above objective, the law provides further that the propriety of a
stay granted by the officer or body rendering the award, order, decision or
ruling may be raised only by motion in the main case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court of Appeals correctly
interpreted that if the adverse party intends to appeal from a decision of the
SEC and pending appeal desires to stay the execution of the decision, then the
motion must be filed with and be heard by the SEC before the adverse party
perfects its appeal to the Court of Appeals (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 250).</p>

<p class="BODY">By and large, such interpretation gives meaning and substance to
the avowed purpose of the law where the need for immediacy of execution of
decisions arrived at by said bodies, was recognized and considered imperative.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the contrary view would negate the expressed
mandate of the law that appeal shall not stay the award, order, ruling,
decision or judgment appealed from, should the appellate court and not the
lower court or administrative body which tried the facts, be authorized to
enjoin execution thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, according to the maxim <span class="SpellE"><u>noscitur</u></span>
<u>a</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>socies</u></span> where a particular word or
phrase is ambiguous in itself or is equally susceptible of various meanings,
its correct construction may be made clear and specific by considering the
company of words in which it is found or with which it is associated (<span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, "Statutes and Their Construction, p. 116
citing Black on Interpretation of Laws, 2d ed., pp. 194-196), or stated
differently, its obscurity or doubt may be reviewed by reference to associate
words (Luzon Stevedoring Co. v. Trinidad, 43 Phil. 804 [1922]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, <span class="GramE">an
interpretation which lead</span> to patent inconsistency must be rejected as
not in accordance with the legislative intent (Commissioner of Customs v.
Philippine Acetylene Co., 39 SCRA 71 [1971]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, correct construction of the word "court" may be
made clear by reference to Section 1 of R.A. No. 5434, where the court officer
or bodies whose decision, award, etc. are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Court of Appeals, are enumerated as follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Court of Agrarian Relations, the Secretary of
Labor, the Land Registration Commission, the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Social Security Commission, the Civil Aeronautics Board, the
Patent Office and the Agricultural Inventions Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the said grouping, the enumeration in Section 5 is obviously
derived and from which it is easy to see that the word "court" means
Court of Agrarian Relations and not the Court of Appeals which by no stretch of
the imagination can be deemed to belong to the same group.</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly stated by the Court of Appeals, while said Court
possesses considerable power to issue writs of injunction either in the
exercise of its original or in aid of its appellate jurisdiction, but where the
law lodges the power to enjoin in some other body or court, as in the case at
bar, the issuance of the writ by the Court of Appeals would constitute a
virtual usurpation of authority on the part of said Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it is evident that R.A. 5434
merely grants the adverse party the right to appeal from such decision (<span class="SpellE">Rolo</span>, p. 253).</p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether or not the Court of Appeals still has jurisdiction
over this appeal which was perfected before P.D. 902-A transferring jurisdiction
of the appeal to the SEC, is answered by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> (91 SCRA 248,
256 [1979]) in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
held:</p>

<blockquote>"The rule is that where a court has already obtained and is
exercising jurisdiction over a controversy, its jurisdiction to proceed to the
final determination of the cause is not affected by new legislation placing
jurisdiction over such proceedings in another tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception to the rule is where the
statute expressly provides, or is construed to the effect that it is intended
to operate as to actions pending before its enactment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a statute changing the jurisdiction of
a court has no retroactive effect, it cannot be applied to a case that was
pending prior to the enactment of the statute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The exception not having been provided in P.D. 902, it is obvious
that the Court of Appeals retains its jurisdiction over the case despite the
issuance of said decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, while it may be desirable to remand this case to the
Court of Appeals considering that, what is involved herein is merely an
interlocutory order of said appellate Court but it is the consistent policy of
this Court where public interests so demands, to broaden its inquiry into a
case and decide the same on the merits rather than merely resolve the
procedural question raised (Velasco v. Court of Appeals, 95 SCRA 616
[1980]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying the rule enunciated in
<span class="SpellE">Gayos</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gayos</span> (67 SCRA 146
[1975]) and reiterated in Alger Electric, Inc. v. Court of Appeals (135 SCRA 43
[1985]), the Court will always strive to settle the entire controversy in a
single proceeding leaving no root or branch to bear the seeds of future
litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, it is evident that the disposition of
the incident as well as the main issue in the case at bar is in consonance with
an efficient administration of justice, now that the facts are before this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Securities and Exchange Commission carefully analyzed Section
30 and Section 38 of the Securities Act as amended and correctly arrived at the
conclusion that under Section 30 thereof, the sale of the shares of stock made
in violation of the Act is merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> at the
election of the purchaser who acts in good faith as when the latter is unaware,
without his fault, that they have not been registered nor exempted from
registration as provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, such purchaser should not be deprived of his rights
resulting from said purchase.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, under Section 38 of said Act, the purchaser
who acquires shares knowing that they are not registered nor exempted from
registration participates in, and is equally guilty of the violation of
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he cannot be accorded
any rights by virtue of such acquisition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
51).</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the foregoing analysis to the case at bar, the SEC noted
that the petition for exemption was filed on <st1:date year="1974" day="25" month="6">June 25, 1974</st1:date>, the exemption fee was paid on <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1974</st1:date> and the resolution
exempting the share from registration was issued by the Commission only on <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="12">December 4, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Undoubtedly, therefore, the issuance of
10,000 additional shares on August 28 and 29, 1974 to <span class="SpellE">Motoomull</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> respectively, which were divided equally
between them, was made pending approval of the application for exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the stockholders' meeting of September 11
and 14, 1974, these two stockholders made a surprise move by suddenly without
the knowledge of private respondents utilized the additional shares for
purposes of voting, thereby enabling them to gain control of the corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, <span class="SpellE">Motoomull</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, president and treasurer of <span class="GramE">subject
corporation</span> respectively, knew at the time they issued the shares in
question to themselves that the exemption or filing fee had not yet been paid,
much less has the corporation received the certificate or resolution of
exemption from the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
cannot, therefore, claim innocence of violation of law to whom the rights
provided for under Section 30 of the Securities Act could be accorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the election of the Board of
Directors which would have a different result had the additional shares not
been utilized for voting was declared null and void and the incumbent members
of the Board of Directors at the time of said meeting shall continue to hold
office until their successors shall have been duly elected and qualified.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing view of the Securities and Exchange Commission can
hardly be faulted.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has time and time again reminded litigants that the <span class="GramE">interpretation</span> of officers of laws which are entrusted to
their administration is entitled to great respect (Sierra Madre Trust v. Hon.
Secretary of Agriculture, et al., 121 SCRA 38 [1983]), and have in their favor
a presumption of legality (<span class="SpellE">Espanol</span> v. Chairman PVA,
137 SCRA 319 [1985]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Findings of
administrative officials and agencies who have acquired expertise because their
jurisdiction is confined to specific matters are generally accorded not only
respect but at times even finality if such findings are supported by
substantial evidence (<span class="SpellE">Lianga</span> Bay Logging Co.,
Inc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">v</span>. Lopez <span class="SpellE">Enage</span>, 152 SCRA 81 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records, no plausible reason could
be found to disturb the findings and conclusions of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, an opposite
view would grant premium to violators of law and negate the very purpose for
which it was enacted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the petition is hereby DENIED and the
resolution of the Court of Appeals promulgated on November 4, 1976 in CA-G.R.
No. 05108-SP and the decision of the SEC dated May 9, 1975, both entitled
