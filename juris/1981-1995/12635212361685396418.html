This is a petition for <em>certiorari </em>filed by Cresencio, Magin, 
Juanito, Socrates and Imelda, all surnamed Velez, seeking the reversal, 
for grave abuse of discretion, the decision dated May 22, 1978 of the 
Court of First Instance of Cebu, Branch XIII dismissing their complaint 
for recovery of possession of five parcels of land pursuant to 
Presidential Decree No. 20.
<p>
The evidence shows that the five parcels of land all located at 
Katipunan Street, Cebu City, then assessed at P17,000.00 and known as 
Lots 5311-A-2-A, 5311-A-2-B, 5311-A-2-C, 5311-A-2-D and 5311-A-2-F, were
 formerly owned by Rodrigo Velez, the father of petitioners.  In an 
extrajudicial partition, the said lots were adjudicated to petitioners 
herein on June 16, 1970.  As early as 1970, petitioners made a demand to
 vacate upon respondents who asked an extension of one year but 
thereafter, respondents changed their minds and refused to vacate.  
Around the end of 1973, petitioners again advised respondents that they 
needed the premises for their own use and ordered them to vacate the 
premises by removing their dwelling units from the lots.  Upon their 
refusal, petitioners filed an ejectment case before the City Court of 
Cebu, which case was docketed as Civil Case No. R-17011.  On motion of 
respondents, the City Court dismissed the case <em>without prejudice</em>
 in an Order dated August 3, 1974 on the ground that there exists no 
cause of action, following the suspension of judicial ejectment by 
Presidential Decree No. 20.  On July 3, 1976, petitioners made again an 
extrajudicial demand in a letter which required respondents to vacate 
the premises within 15 days at the same time threatening them with 
prosecution under Presidential Decree No. 772 for the crime of 
squatting.  On August 5, 1976, petitioners filed the complaint for 
recovery of possession of the aforesaid five parcels of land alleging 
that except for Magin Velez, they have no other lot of their own and are
 living on other persons’ premises; that respondents are not only 
occupying the premises but also accepting boarders and/or using the same
 for commercial purposes and that several demands have been made to give
 way to the needs of petitioners and their respective families but 
respondents maliciously, abusively and defiantly refused to accede to 
petitioners' lawful demands.
</p><p>
In their answer, respondents admitted the ownership of the land by 
petitioners.  But in their special and affirmative defenses, they 
alleged that they have been occupying portions of the lots by virtue of 
oral agreements of lease for an indefinite period, paying monthly 
rentals for their respective portions ranging from P4.00 to P12.00; that
 the present action is barred by <em>res judicata</em> and/or prior 
judgment and that the present action, if at all there is any cause of 
action, is essentially one for unlawful detainer since the last demand 
to vacate was made less than a year ago.
</p><p>
Eight of the twenty respondents testified that they are the original 
occupants of the lots while two of them, Segundo Macatol and Hilario 
Gaviola, claimed to have bought their houses from third persons with the
 understanding that they should pay rentals to the landowner, Rodrigo 
Velez.  They also testified that they have been paying rentals for their
 respective portions ranging from P4.00 to P12.00.  In support of their 
claim of payment of rentals, at least six of them presented one or two 
receipts dated 1973 or earlier (Exhibits 2, 2-A to 2-I) and claimed that
 other receipts were lost.  But all respondents admitted not having paid
 rentals since 1973, some reasoning out that nobody collected and others
 claiming that Fabiola Velez Garganera, Rodrigo Velez’ daughter, refused
 to accept their rentals.  At least one of them, Hilario Gaviola, 
produced what he claimed as a building permit but the same turned out to
 be a mere application.
</p><p>
After the case was submitted for decision, the trial court ruled:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It appearing that the defendants are lessees of the portions of 
the land in question wherein their respective dwelling units are 
erected, personal use by the plaintiffs and/or their families of the 
said land, cannot be a valid ground for judicial ejectment of the 
former, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 20, issued by the President 
on March 15, 1977." (sic, should be October 12, 1972). (Decision of the 
CFI, p. 5; Rollo, p. 30) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the ground that respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of 
Cebu acted with grave abuse of discretion in the exercise of his 
judicial functions by holding that private respondents are lessees and, 
therefore, privileged to continue staying on the lots in question 
pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 20, the plaintiffs below brought 
this instant petition for <em>certiorari</em>.
</p><p>
Petitioners contend that the preponderance of evidence shows that the 
occupancy of private respondents on the lots in question is due to the 
tolerance of the owners thereof and against the latter's will.
</p><p>
Conceding that respondents are lessees, petitioners claim that 
Presidential Decree No. 20 does not mean that (1) they are freed from 
paying rentals for the lots in question; (2) they can use the lots for 
commercial purposes; and (3) they can refuse to adduce evidence - 
specifically referring to the twelve respondents who did not testify on 
their behalf.
</p><p>
In answer to the argument of respondents that they are willing to pay 
rentals if petitioners send collectors, petitioners cite Article 1256 of
 the Civil Code where mere willingness to pay is not payment, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Art. 1256.  If the creditor to whom tender of payment has been 
made refuses without just cause to accept it, the debtor shall be 
released from responsibility by the consignation of the thing or sun 
due."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioners also claim that they had presented evidence that some 
respondents, particularly Natividad Bajarias, Maura Belarma and Placida 
Tejano, are using the premises not only as residences but also stores 
while Alding Acedera is using her residence as a boarding house, thereby
 removing said respondents from the protective mantle of Presidential 
Decree No. 20.
</p><p>
Finally, petitioners invoke the equal protection rights guaranteed by 
the Constitution contending that respondent Judge's undue application of
 Presidential Decree No. 20 in spite of the undisputed fact that 
petitioners have no other lot of their own and are renting other 
people's properties, except Magin Velez (who nevertheless wants to 
recover his property for the use of one of his children who is married),
 constitutes a denial of said constitutional provision.
</p><p>
Whether or not respondent Judge acted with grave abuse of discretion 
must be resolved in the affirmative.  It should be recalled that this is
 a case of <em>accion publiciana</em>, the purpose of which is being to 
establish who have a better right to possess.  (Bernabe, et al. vs. 
Judge Dayrit, et al., G.R. No. 58399, Oct. 27, 1983).  There is no 
allegation of forcible entry in the complaint.  Neither is it a case of 
unlawful detainer because the preponderance of evidence shows that the 
occupancy of private respondents on the lot in question is due to the 
tolerance of the owners thereof and against the latter's will.  Private 
respondents admit that they have no written contract of lease with the 
petitioners not with petitioners' predecessor in interest.  Only Marcial
 Burgos alleged that he had an oral agreement with Rodrigo Velez, all 
others surprisingly failed to testify that they had such an oral 
agreement of lease.  They likewise admit that their houses were 
constructed without building permits.  In the true sense of the word, 
respondents are squatters.  As such, their possession is by tolerance.  
(Pangilinan vs. Aguilar, 43 SCRA 136).  Although respon­dents had been 
paying nominal rentals, ranging from P4.00 to P12.00 per month for some 
time, they did not thereby acquire the legal status of tenants.  
Squatting is unlawful and no amount of acquiescence converts it into a 
lawful act. Illegal constructions constitute public nuisance per se.  
They pose problems of health and sani­tation.  (Cf. City of Manila vs. 
Garcia, et al., 19 SCRA 413).
</p><p>
Even if the case were to be decided as an ejectment case, the insistence
 of respondents that they are lessees and, therefore, under the 
protective mantle of Presidential Decree No. 20 loses ground when We 
consider the finding of fact that respondents had not been paying any 
consideration for the occupancy of their respective premises.  Said 
Presidential Decree No. 20 suspended ejectment when the lease is for an 
indefinite period.  It did not suspend ejectment on other grounds like 
lack of payment of the rental stipulated.
</p><p>
The failure of the owners to collect, or their refusal to accept the 
rentals are not valid defenses.  Article 1256 of the Civil Code provides
 that "if the creditor to whom tender of payment has been made refuses 
without just cause to accept it, the debtor shall be re­leased from 
responsibility by the consignation of the thing or sum due."
</p><p>
Independently of the foregoing, the petitioners' need of the premises 
for their own use or for the use of any member of his family as a 
residential unit entitles them to the possession of the lots in 
question.  Batas Pambansa Blg. 25, which took effect on April 10, 1979, 
provides as additional ground for judicial ejectment the need of the 
owner/lessor to repossess his property for his own use or for the use of
 any member of his family as a residential unit, such owner or immediate
 member not being the owner of any other available residential unit.
</p><p>
Even before the effectivity of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25, Presidential 
Decree No. 20 had been held to be not without exception.  In <em>Ongchengco vs. City Court of Zamboanga</em>,
 95 SCRA 313, this Court ruled that “extreme necessity for personal use 
of the property entitles the owner to exemption from the operation of PD
 20 which suspends the provision of Article 1673 of the Civil Code on 
judicial ejectment." The case of <em>Betts vs. Matias</em>, 97 SCRA 439,
 reaffirmed that "Presidential Decree No. 20 does not sanction the 
deprivation of a lessor of resi­dential property in extreme need of the 
leased premises for his own use of his right to terminate the lease and 
recover possession of his property." Then, in <em>Sinclair vs. Court of Appeals</em>,
 115 SCRA 318, this Court held that “a strict and rigid compliance with 
Presidential Decree No. 20 is not in order, for an exemption from its 
pro­visions is warranted for humanitarian reasons." Again, in<em> Tan Tok Lee vs. CFI of Kalookan City</em>,
 121 SCRA 438, this Court said that "petitioners' reliance on the 
provision of Presidential Decree No. 20 is not well taken.  It could not
 have been the intention of the said decree to deprive the owner of the 
rightful use of her home, more so, when petitioners reneged on their 
promise to look for another house in the mistaken belief that PD 20 gave
 them a preferential right over that of the owner.  To deny the owner of
 the use and possession of her property would be tantamount to depriving
 her of her cons­titutional right to abode." In <em>Rantael vs. Court of Appeals, et al</em>.,
 97 SCRA 453, this Court upheld the right of the Iessor to judicially 
eject the lessee on the ground not only that "expiration of period of 
written lease contract is manifestly present" but also because Batas 
Pambansa Blg. 25 which superseded P.D. 20 "buttresses the right of 
respondent Llave to judicially eject petitioner Rantael from the leased 
premises." In <em>Santos vs. Court of Appeals and Paraguas</em>, G.R. 
No. L-45071, May 30, 1983, this Court held that "the retroactive 
application of Batas Pambansa Blg. 25 to pending ejectment cases is 
already a settled matter and may no longer be questioned.  (Alejandro 
Melchor, Jr., etc. vs. Hon. Jose L. Moya, etc., et al., G.R. No. 
L-35256, March 17, 1983; Gutierrez vs. Cantada, 90 SCRA 1; Ongchengco 
vs. City Court of Zamboanga, 95 SCRA 313; Betts vs. Matias, 97 SCRA 
439).  It was also held therein that "the right of the private 
respondents over the property which they own in order to use the same as
 their residence, not being owners of any other dwelling place, may not 
be denied.  Such right is expressly recognized by Batas Pambansa Blg. 
25.  Elemental sense of justice and fairness dictates that it must be 
so."
</p><p>
