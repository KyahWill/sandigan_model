of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date> at the
residence of complainant Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>, situated

<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an outcome of such events, two separate
criminal <span class="SpellE">informations</span> were filed in April 1973
against defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span> with Branch 5 of the then Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Samar</span>:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in">A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Criminal Case No. 425</u> - charged the
accused with frustrated homicide:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 6th day of February 1973, in the
afternoon, in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Carayman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span>
City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, with intent to kill and armed with a sharp-pointed weapon,
did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously attack, assault and stab with said weapon one Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>, who, as a result thereof, sustained wound on her
body, which would have produced the crime of homicide as a consequence, but
nevertheless did not produce it by reason of causes independent of the will of
the accused, that is, by the able medical attendance rendered which prevented
the death of said Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:22.5pt;text-indent:-22.5pt">B. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><u>Criminal
Case No. 426</u> - charged the accused with attempted rape, later amended to
consummated rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint of the
offended party read:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 6th day of February 1973, in the
afternoon, in Bo. <span class="SpellE">Carayman</span>, <span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span>
City, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused actuated by lust, and with the use of deadly weapon, namely
a sharp-pointed instrument, and by means of violence and intimidation, did then
and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously have
carnal knowledge of undersigned complainant, against the latter's will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At arraignment, the accused, aided by counsel, entered a plea of
"not guilty" to both charges against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the offenses charged in Criminal Case
No. 425 and Criminal Case No. 426 were very closely related to each other in
point of time and circumstance, and with the consent of the parties involved,
the two cases were tried jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> found <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span> guilty of
frustrated homicide and consummated rape.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portions of the decision read:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>Criminal Case No. 425<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"PREMISES considered, the Court finds the accused ROGACIANO
TADUYO guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of frustrated homicide a
charged in the information and applying the Indeterminate Sentence Law, hereby
sentences the <span class="SpellE">aforenamed</span> accused to suffer an
imprisonment of TWO (2) YEARS, FOUR (4) MONTHS and ONE (1) DAY, <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> as minimum
to EIGHT (8) YEARS and ONE (1) DAY <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor as
the maximum; to pay the costs of the proceedings; to pay Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> the sum of P3,000.00 as exemplary and moral damages
and to suffer such other accessory penalties of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall be credited in full with the total
period of his detention in correction with the case if he agrees to abide by
the same disciplinary rules imposed upon prisoners; otherwise, he shall only be
credited with 4/5 of such detention in accordance with RA 6127."</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>Criminal Case No. 426<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>‘WHEREFORE, the Court finds ROGACIANO TADUYO guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE defined and penalized by Article 335 (1),
paragraph 2, [Revised Penal Code] with the aggravating circumstance of robbery
committed on the occasion of the rape with no mitigating circumstance to offset
the same, and sentences the aforesaid accused to suffer the supreme penalty of
DEATH; to pay the costs of the proceedings; to compensate the victim, Margarita
<span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span> (sic) with the sum of Five Thousand Pesos
(P5,000.00) for moral damages in accordance with Article 21 and 2219, both of
the New Civil Code of the Philippines; to restitute to Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> the sum of P430.00 which he took from his
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He shall likewise suffer such
other accessory penalties of the law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant appealed his conviction for frustrated homicide to
the Court of Appeals where the appeal was docketed as CA-G.R. No.
16022-CR.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appeal was dismissed by
the Court of Appeals on <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="10">22 October 1975</st1:date>
since the accused himself stated in a letter-request to the Court of Appeals
that he was no longer interested in pursuing his appeal and failed to submit an
appellant's brief.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judgment of conviction for rape came before this Court on
automatic review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution consists mainly of the
testimonies of the complainant Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amoguis</span> and Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> <span class="SpellE">Cutanda</span>, the physician who
first examined Margarita after the events complained of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The facts as they emerge from such evidence,
are outlined below.</p>

<p class="BODY">Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>, then twenty-nine
years of age, testified that she was married to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>
who, however, had abandoned her on <st1:date year="1972" day="16" month="8">16
 August 1972</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She has a house
situated in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Carayman</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Samar</span></st1:place> where she lived with her
two children, an eight-year old child and an infant of nine months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Near the stairway which led to the interior
of her home, she maintained a small <u>sari-sari</u> store where she sold a
limited assortment of grocery items.</p>

<p class="BODY">At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date>,
appellant <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span>
came up her house and asked to buy ten-centavos’ worth of Pine cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After Margarita handed over the cigarettes to
<span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>, the latter requested a drink of water.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obliging, Margarita, followed by <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>, went inside her kitchen (where her children
were) and proceeded to fetch a glass of water for her thirsty customer.</p>

<p class="BODY">As Margarita turned to face <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>,
she was suddenly startled to find him standing in front of her wielding a
ten-inch knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Almost immediately, <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> pressed the knife's point on Margarita’s stomach
and demanded money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fear-stricken,
Margarita acceded and led <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> into her bedroom
(located some three meters away from the kitchen) when she kept her money.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inside her bedroom, Margarita surrendered to <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
P430.00 which she had kept hidden inside a wooden trunk.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>,
with knife in hand, forced Margarita to lie on the floor face up and commanded
her to undress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Margarita refused, so <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> forcibly tore off her shorts and undergarments
(Exhibits "A" and "A-1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> opened his pants, pulled out his sex
organ and then lay on top of Margarita and proceeded to assault sexually his
helpless and unwilling victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the coerced coitus, <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
thoughtlessly put down the knife he had been holding in his right hand and
placed it on the floor, somewhere to the left of Margarita.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Margarita reached for the knife with her left
hand, grasped it and thrust the blade into the right side of <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>, causing him suddenly to withdraw from above
her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A struggle immediately ensued
during which <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> was able to regain possession
of the knife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So armed, the wounded <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> chased Margarita and, upon overtaking her at the
main doorway to her home (about two arms’ lengths from her bedroom), locked her
in an embrace and stabbed her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
wounded Margarita stumbled and fell down the staircase leading from her house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She managed to escape and reach the house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Obong</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rogaciano’s</span> cousin) some fifteen meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, she found no one there who
could help her as only children were at home at the time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Margarita returned to her own house two minutes
later and put on fresh clothes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon afterwards
along the main barrio road, she chanced upon <span class="SpellE">Engracia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Obong</span> who assisted her in boarding a tricycle and
accompanied her to the <span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span> City General Hospital
where she was confined and treated for her injuries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Margarita did not complain to the doctors present at the hospital
that she had been sexually attacked by <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, no medical examination was
carried out on her person to determine whether or not she had been raped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, upon her discharge from the hospital
20 days later on <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="2">26 February 1973</st1:date>,
she promptly reported the entire incident to the authorities at the Philippine
Constabulary Detachment Office in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Julieta</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>
testified that at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date>,
she was at the house of Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> to borrow
money from Margarita.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She knocked on the
main door but received no answer from within.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Seeing, however, that the door was open, <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span>
entered the house and proceeded up the staircase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once upstairs, <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span>
notice Margarita's children playing in the kitchen while inside the bedroom
(about six meters from where she stood) she saw <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span> who was then holding a knife at the abdomen of
Margarita.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Julieta</span>
observed that Margarita was close to tears when the latter handed over some
money to <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She also testified that she stayed inside the house for only about a
minute before departing for the barrio proper of <span class="SpellE">Carayman</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> <span class="SpellE">Amoguis</span>
testified that at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date>,
he was resting inside his house when he heard Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>
yell "<span class="SpellE"><u>Tabag</u></span>!" ("Help, a
man!") twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He immediately got up
and rushed over to the house of Margarita situated just ten meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> was able to
enter Margarita's house because the main door was left open.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside, he saw Margarita being chased,
embraced and then stabbed once in the right side of her abdomen by <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Amancio</span> also
observed that <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> was already wounded on his
right side when the latter stabbed Margarita.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He backed off and returned to his house because <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
had threatened to kill him if he ventured any closer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Minutes later, he saw Margarita run towards
the house of <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Obong</span>;
he did not, however, see where <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> went.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

 <st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
testified that he examined Margarita <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span> inside
the emergency room of the hospital on the afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date> when she was brought in for

opined that if Margarita's assailant were left-handed, then Margarita must have
been frontally assaulted; and if her assailant were right-handed, then she was
stabbed from behind.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Cutanda</span>, referring to Margarita's wound, categorically stated
that "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)f the patient was not operated [upon],

<p class="BODY">The defense of <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span> consisted generally of denying that he had raped
Margarita with whom, he claimed, he had been living as husband and wife at the
time the events complained of took place and for sometime before.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Essentially, <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano's</span> defense was that he could
not have raped Margarita, for he had no need to rape her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He painted a picture of Margarita as a woman
of highly developed sexuality, who was accustomed to multiple intercourse with
him and who found him irresistible because he was well-endowed physically.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claimed he had been meeting Margarita
clandestinely even before her husband had abandoned her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

His more specific defense consisted of the claim that Margarita, far from being
a victim, was the aggressor during the events which took place in her house in
the afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Rogaciano's</span> version of those events was
basically the following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
afternoon of 6 February 1973, <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> saw Margarita,
<span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Obong</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rogaciano's</span> cousin), Irene <span class="SpellE">Mahayag</span>,
and a fourth woman unknown to him, all drinking <u>tuba</u> in front of
Margarita's store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He approached the
group upon <span class="SpellE">Anastacia's</span> invitation but Margarita
suddenly hurled a bowl at him, hitting him on the forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perplexed but <span class="SpellE">unangered</span>,
he disregarded this unexpected act of hostility and went home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later in the same afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> returned to Margarita's store to buy cigarettes
for his elder brother <span class="SpellE">Tarcilo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He went upstairs upon Margarita's invitation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inside, he asked her why she had thrown a
bowl at him earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>, Margarita retorted that she resented his
belittling her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She then threatened him
saying "<span class="SpellE"><u>papatayun</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">ta</span>
<span class="SpellE">ikao</span></u>" and, with that warning, suddenly
thrust a knife into his right side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Margarita attempted to stab a second time but, <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
said, he grasped her knife and twisted it around and pushed the knife towards
her own body and wounded her in the abdomen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All he remembered after that, he testified, was that Margarita ran away,
as a few moments later he fell unconscious along the stairway of the house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

another woman in the Barrio, one <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> <span class="SpellE">Achoso</span>, in the neighborhood store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Margarita, he further suggested, was also

that he was living with Margarita.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the resolution of the present appeal must turn on the
issue of credibility of the witnesses on each side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only Margarita herself testified that the
accused had indeed raped her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
is by means unusual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in a
prosecution for rape, more often than not, only the offended party can testify
as to the act of coerced copulation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the Court has held that conviction of rape may ensue on the
sole basis of the complainant's testimony where such testimony is found to be
positive and credible.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court explicitly assayed the credibility of the testimony
respectively presented by complainant and by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial Judge clearly was not moved or
convinced by the story presented by the accused and his witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the lurid character of that defense
story and the ocular examination by the court of the physical endowment <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> had boasted about,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
convinced the court he was merely spinning a tale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the other hand, the Judge accorded the
testimony of Margarita full weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
trial Judge said:</p>

<blockquote>"The court in appreciating the totality of the evidence laid
before it, finds that the prosecution evidence should be accorded more faith<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> and credence than that of the defense
because it is founded upon the common experience of man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More than that from the stand the court noted
that the complaining witness narrated her harrowing experience in a manner that
left no doubt as to her sincerity and candor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the other hand the story of the defense is like one copied from
books on pornography or from the pornographic "<span class="SpellE">bomba</span>
<span class="SpellE">komiks</span>" that saturated the country during the
days before martial law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The narration
by the accused as to how he undressed Margarita before the supposed sexual acts
he had with her and how Margarita wiped his genital organ with her panty after
every copulative act, looks fiction(al)<span class="SpellE">ized</span> or at the
least invented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<blockquote>With respect to Margarita's version as to how she was abused by <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Taduyo</span>, there is no
corroboration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But that fact alone has
not weakened the case of the people.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Margarita was on the stand she did not show any trace of hesitancy
as she described how the fear of the knife poked at her by <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
made her lie down on the floor and offered no resistance when the accused
inserted his penis into her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was candid in her answers to questions propounded to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no indicia of artificiality in her
manner of testifying which are easily detected in a witness who has a
fabricated story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY">Necessarily, the findings of fact of the trial Judge must be
accorded great weight by an appellate tribunal<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
for the latter can only read in cold print the testimony of the witnesses which
commonly is translated from the local dialect into English.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the process of converting into written
form the statements of living human beings, not only fine nuances but a world
of meaning apparent to the judge present, watching and listening, may escape
the reader of the written, translated words.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused stressed the fact that Margarita did not tell any one
in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
that she had been raped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact,
however, does not appear to us to be critical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Margarita was unconscious when she arrived in the hospital that
afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date>,
and was rushed to the operating room for emergency <span class="SpellE">laparatomy</span>
surgery.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
It is common knowledge that post-operative stupor may take time to clear
up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such factors, coupled with the
severe shock complainant must have experienced, would account for her failure
to tell her story to the hospital doctors during her confinement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is important is that she reported the
whole incident -- the rape and the stabbing -- to the Constabulary authorities
as soon as she left the hospital on <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="2">26
 February 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
consistent with her explanation<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
that her temporary silence at the hospital was due merely to her belief that
the criminal charge of rape was appropriately lodged with the police
authorities rather than with the hospital officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused also claimed that the criminal charge for rape was
instituted against him by Margarita basically to justify Margarita's act of
stabbing him and to counteract the charge of frustrated murder which <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> had supposedly filed against Margarita with the
City Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Calbayog</span> City.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
The accused, however, completely failed to show that he had indeed filed a
criminal complaint against Margarita.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> and his
witnesses failed to convince the trial court; this Court has neither reason nor
inclination to overthrow the findings of the trial courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bowl-throwing incident which allegedly
took place in front of Margarita's store was not proven by evidence other than
the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> bare assertion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense could have easily presented the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> own cousin, <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Obong</span>, who was supposed to have been present at that
incident to testify on it on behalf of the accused; but the defense did not do
so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any case, that story of <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> is not only uncorroborated but also, to our mind,
improbable and inadequate to explain the supposed murderous attack by Margarita
upon <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the <u>voyeur</u> <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
Bongo must have appeared contrived and prurient to the trial Judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note that <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano's</span>
claim that he and Margarita had been living together as common-law husband and
wife, a relationship not easily kept secret in a small rural community like <span class="SpellE">Carayman</span>, could have been easily established by unrelated,
competent and credible witnesses, e.g., by barrio people living in the
immediate vicinity of Margarita's house or the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
own relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense, however,
failed to present any such supporting testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of defense witness Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Antor</span>, which was in itself inadequate to show a common law
marital relationship between the accused and the complainant, was not
corroborated even by the accused himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is another reason why we are compelled to reject the <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span> defense that he and Margarita were common law
husband and wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One may assume <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> merely, that <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
and Margarita did live together as pretended husband and wife.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But that by itself does not prove that <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span> <u>could not</u> have raped Margarita, that
Margarita would <u>never</u> have denied <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>
sexual access.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, no presumption
arises that a common law wife will, or is willing to, submit to the common law
husband's embraces always and under all circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of a prior history of a common law
marital relationship will not prevail over clear and positive evidence of
copulation by the use of force or intimidation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In <u>People vs. <span class="SpellE">Blance</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Mr. Justice Johnson explained:</p>

<blockquote>"Admitting that the appellant had been having illicit
relations with the offended party for months before the time and place
mentioned in the complaint, yet, nevertheless, that fact would not constitute a
defense, providing the illicit relations, which are described in the complaint,
took place by force and violence and against the will of the offended
party."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The fact that Maria <span class="SpellE">Bernales</span> may
have been an unchaste character constitutes no defense of the charge of rape,
providing it is proved that the illicit relations described in the complaint
were committed with force and violence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant is equally guilty, under the law, if force and violence
were used, regardless of the good or bad morals of Maria <span class="SpellE">Bernales</span></u>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">To our mind, the stab wound inflicted by
Margarita upon <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>, and that sustained by
Margarita herself from <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>, are sufficient
proof that she did not consent indeed objected vehemently to <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano's</span> embraces that afternoon of <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="2">6 February 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We conclude that the trial court correctly held that the guilt of
the accused was established beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn now to the robbery that the trial court found to have
been committed by the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
robbery was, however, neither alleged in one or the other of the two (2) <span class="SpellE">informations</span> filed against <span class="SpellE">Rogaciano</span>,
nor charged in a third separate information.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In any case, robbery can scarcely be regarded as a generic aggravating
circumstance in the crime of rape and the trial Judge was in error in so
considering it in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
have taken note of the fact that the accused immediately surrendered himself to
the Constabulary authorities upon his discharge from the hospital on <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="2">16 February 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Until that point, no formal charges had been
filed against him by complainant who was still in the hospital recovering from
her injuries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
for homicide and rape were in fact filed only on <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="2">26 February 1973</st1:date>, i.e., ten (10) days after the accused
had given himself up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it
appears that the warrant for his arrest was never issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, therefore, it may
reasonably be inferred that the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> surrender
to the authorities was spontaneous and voluntary and not one forced upon him by
extraneous circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed judgment, insofar as it relates to
the conviction of the accused-appellant of the crime of rape, is AFFIRMED with
the modification that the death penalty imposed by the trial court is hereby
reduced to <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> in view
