				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The central question in the petition at bar is whether or not the
regular courts may stay an execution decreed by the labor arbiters and what the
consequences are of such a recourse to the courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case began from a complaint, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1977</st1:date>, for recovery of unpaid
thirteenth-month pay filed by the <span class="SpellE">Sarangani</span> Marine
and General Workers Union-ALU with the Department of Labor (Regional Office No.
Xl, <st1:place><st1:placename>General</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Santos</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>) against the South <span class="SpellE">Cotabato</span> Integrated Port Services, Inc. (SCIPSI), a
Philippine corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later,
thirty-seven SCIPSI employees, non-union members apparently, filed their own
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The labor arbiter
consolidated the twin complaints and after hearing, ordered a dismissal on <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, however the National Labor
Relations Commission, on <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="6">June 9, 1981</st1:date>,
reversed and accordingly, ordered the private respondents, SCIPSI and its
president and general manager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Veiayo</span>, to pay the
thirteenth-month pays demanded. The private respondents' motion for
reconsideration was denied, and the decision has since attained finality.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the parties, on orders of the labor arbiter, were
made to appear before a corporate auditing examiner to determine the private
respondents' exact liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1986</st1:date>, the corporate
auditing examiner submitted an accounting and found the private respondents
liable in the total sum of P1,134,000.00. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Thereupon, the private respondents interposed
an objection and prayed for a revision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It appears, however, that the private respondents never pursued their
exceptions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1987</st1:date>,
the union moved for execution and pursuant thereto, the labor arbiter issued a
writ of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result, the
sheriff levied on two parcels of land, both registered in <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Velayo's</span> name, with an area of 400 and 979 square
meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1987</st1:date>,
both SCIPSI and <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> petitioned this Court<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

fundamentally, that the Department of Labor's examiner erred in her
determination of the private respondents pecuniary liabilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 16, 1987, <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> alone filed
a petition with the respondent court (Special Case No. 227) on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>cause of action based on an alleged
irregular execution, on the ground that he “was never a party to the labor

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1987</st1:date>,
the respondent court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">execution </span>of the judgment in the
aforementioned labor cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1987</st1:date>, the petitioner moved

<span class="SpellE">Lavarez</span>) themselves, on <st1:date year="1987" day="22" month="10">October 22, 1987</st1:date>, instituted these <i>certiorari</i>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1988" day="27" month="4">April 27,
 1988</st1:date>, the parties (in G.R. Nos. 77300-01) submitted a Compromise
Agreement whereby the private respondents agreed to pay, in installments, the
reduced sum of P637,400.00 to the workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1988</st1:date>, we
issued a Resolution approving the Compromise Agreement, and considering the
cases (G.R. Nos. 77300-01) closed and terminated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">At the same time, we issued (in this petition) a Resolution
requiring the private respondents and/or counsel, Atty. Oscar <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span>, to show cause why they should not be held in
contempt for forum-shopping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On December
9, 1988, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span> filed a manifestation praying
for dismissal "not because it has become moot and academic in view of the
compromise agreement executed by the parties in G.R. Nos. 77300-01 [but
because] the subject or cause of action [thereof] is totally different from the
cause of action in the above-entitled case."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On whether or not this case has become moot and academic in view
of the compromise reached in G.R. Nos. 77300-01, the Court rules in the
affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted that the
instant petition has been brought as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">result
of the execution of the judgment rendered below, and since the parties, by
virtue of the compromise, have spelled out the manner by which payment shall be
made, execution by means of levy, the question confronting the </span>court
herein, may no longer be carried out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, because of the ethical implications of the acts of the
private respondents, the Court is constrained to render its judgment if only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to </span>forestall future similar acts and
for the guidance of the bench and the bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We likewise render
judgment notwithstanding Atty. Oscar </span><span class="SpellE">Dinopol's</span>
pending prayer for extension of time to file his comment to our show cause
Resolution of <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1988</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We consider his manifestation, dated <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="11">November 29, 1988</st1:date>, urging us not to
dismiss this case for having become moot and academic but because the petition
lacks merit as his comment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do so for
one because it has been the position of the private respondents that Special
Case No. 227 and G.R. Nos. 77300-01 could stand together and for another,
because of the compelling need to dispose of labor cases with utmost
dispatch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We take this as his defense to
that show-cause Resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Parenthetically, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">we </span>find
him mistaken for supposing that our Resolution is based on the simultaneous
commencement of Special Case No. 227 and G.R. Nos. 77300-01.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not the act that forced suspicions on
our part of efforts by the private respondents to "shop for a friendly
forum".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather, it is the
institution of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Special Case No. 227,
despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the labor proceedings below,
that led us to those suspicions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>G.R.
Nos. 773007-01, on the other hand, were brought primarily on the question of
the exact amount SCIPSI <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">liable </span>to pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is on its face, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>legitimate ground for <i>certiorari</i>, and for this reason
we accepted the parties' compromise reached there, instead of dismissing it.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is forum-shopping whenever, as a result of an adverse
opinion in one forum, a party seeks a favorable opinion (other than by appeal
or <i>certiorari</i>) in another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
principle applies not only with respect to suits filed in the courts but also
in connection with litigations commenced in the courts while <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an </span>administrative proceeding is pending,
as in this case, in order to defeat administrative processes and in
anticipation of an unfavorable administrative ruling and a favorable court
ruling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is specially so, as in this
case, where the court in which the second suit was brought, has no
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the respondent court must be held to be in error
assuming jurisdiction over Special Case No. 227.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-established that the courts cannot
enjoin execution of judgment rendered by the National Labor Relations
Commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Velayo's</span> reliance upon National Mines and Allied Workers
Union v. Vera<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
is not well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the
properties involved belonged to third persons, a development that provided a
civil dimension to the labor case, and a development that gave the courts the
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
however, <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> cannot be said to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:28.0pt">a </span>stranger to the proceedings for a
number of reasons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First, and as pointed
out by the Solicitor General, and as the records will amply show, he, <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>, was a party to the proceedings below where he took
part actively in defense of his case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
quote:</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>It is not true that <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> was not a party in the labor cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The caption of the labor cases shows he was a
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records of the labor
cases show that he participated in the proceedings therein, without raising the
issue that he was not a party nor the employer of the complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Motion for Reconsideration dated <st1:date year="1981" day="7" month="8">August 7, 1981</st1:date> attached to the
Petition as Annex B was filed by both SCIPS and <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>SCIPS
and <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> discussed the merits of the cases in said
motion and there was nary a mention of the allegation of <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span>
now that<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:28.0pt"> </span>he was not a party in
the cases nor an employer of the complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Likewise, the Exception and/or Opposition to Report of Examiner dated
November 13, 1986, attached to the Petition as Annex F, was also filed by both
SCIPS and <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> and, like the Motion for
Reconsideration aforementioned, it does not mention anything about <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> not being a party and not being an employer of
complainants.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Certainly, he cannot now be heard to say that he was no party to
the controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that he was never mentioned in the pleadings before the
petitioner-labor arbiter is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact is that he himself had questioned the findings of the corporate
auditor (in G.R. Nos. 77300-01) and this is enough evidence that he admits
personal liability, although he does not agree with the amount supposedly due
from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His <span class="SpellE">remonstrances</span>
came too late in the day.</p>

<p class="BODY">But other than <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, the law itself
stands as a formidable obstacle to <span class="SpellE">Velayo's</span>
claims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In A.C. Ransom Labor Union-CCLU
v. NLRC<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

we held that in case of corporations it is the president who responds
personally for violation of the labor pay laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We quote:</p>

<blockquote>Article 273 of the Code provides that:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"Any person violating
any of the provisions of Article 265 of this Code shall be punished by a fine
of not exceeding five hundred pesos and/or imprisonment for not less than one
(1) day nor more than six (6) months."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How can the foregoing
provisions be implemented when the employer is a corporation? The answer is
found in Article 212(c) of the Labor Code which provides:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Employer'
includes any person acting in the interest of an employer, directly or
indirectly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The term shall not include
any labor organization or any of its officers or agents except when acting as
employer."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The foregoing was culled
from Section 2 of RA 602, the Minimum Wage Law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since RANSOM is an artificial </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">person, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">it must have an
officer who can be presumed to be the employer, being the "person acting
in the interest of (the) employer" RANSOM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The corporation, only in the technical sense is the employer.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The responsible officer of
an employer corporation can be held personally, hot to say even criminally,
liable for non-payment of back wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That is the policy of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the Minimum Wage Law, Section 15(b) provided:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If any violation
of this Act is committed by a corporation, trust, partnership or association,
the manager or in his default, the person acting as such when the violation
took place, shall be responsible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
case of a government corporation, the managing head shall be made responsible,
except when shown that the violation was due to an act or commission of some
other person, over whom he has no control, in which case the latter shall be
held responsible."</blockquote>

<blockquote>In PD 525, where a corporation fails to pay the emergency allowance
therein provided, the prescribed penalty "shall be imposed upon the guilty
officer or officers" of the corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the policy of the
law were otherwise, the corporation employer can have devious ways for evading
payment of back wages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant
case, it would appear that RANSOM, in 1969, foreseeing the possibility or
probabi­lity of payment of back wages to the 22 strikers, organized <st1:city><st1:place>ROSARIO</st1:place></st1:city>
to replace RANSOM, with the latter to be eventually phased out if the 22
strikers win their case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>RANSOM actually
ceased operations on <st1:date year="1973" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1973</st1:date>,
after the <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1972</st1:date>
Decision of the Court of Industrial Relations was promulgated against RANSOM.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record does not
clearly identify "the officer or officers" of RANSOM directly
responsible for failure to pay the back wages of the 22 strikers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of definite proof in that
regard, we believe it should be presumed that the responsible officer is the
President of the corporation who can be deemed the chief operation officer
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in RA 602, criminal
responsibility is with the "Manager or in his default, the person acting <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>such." In RANSOM, the President
appears to be the Manager.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(e)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>considering that
non-payment of the back <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">wages </span>of
the 22 strikers has been a continuing situation, it is our opinion that the
personal liability of the RANSOM President at the time the back wages were
ordered to be paid should also be a continuing joint and several personal
liabilities of all who may have thereafter succeeded to the office of
president; otherwise, the 22 strikers may be deprived of their rights by the
election of a president without <span class="SpellE">leviable</span> assets.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> cannot be excused
from payment of <span class="SpellE">SCIPS's</span> liability by mere reason of <span class="SpellE">SCIPSI's</span> separate corporate existence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The theory of corporate entity, in the first
place, was not meant to promote unfair objectives or otherwise, to shield
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court has not hesitated in

that forum-shopping is an act of malpractice that constitutes contempt of

we reject Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dinopol's</span> pretense that no identity
exists between Special Case No. 227 and the labor case that had precipitated
it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that in Special <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">Case </span>no. 227, he assails the execution
of the judgment of the National Labor Relations Commission, the same relief he
could have asked for in the very labor proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that he likewise prayed for damages
therein will not alter the essence of the petition -- to stay execution -- and
in which the claim for damages <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">is </span>but
an incidental relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, both <span class="SpellE">Velayo</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Dinopol</span> must account for forum-shopping.</p>
