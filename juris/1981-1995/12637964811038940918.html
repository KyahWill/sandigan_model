				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The estate of the deceased spouses, <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span>
(<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagobo</i></span>) and <span class="SpellE">Mida</span> (<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagoba</i></span>) is the subject of the proceedings at
bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It chiefly consists of four (4)
parcels of land situated at <span class="SpellE">Tagluno</span>, <span class="SpellE">Toril</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Lapoy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Gumati</span>, both at <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City, with
an aggregate area of 47 hectares, more or less.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Proceedings for the settlement of their estate were instituted by their
granddaughter, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Po (the daughter of their
deceased daughter, <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>) in the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, docketed therein as Special
Proceedings No. 589.</p>

<p class="BODY">An action was subsequently commenced in the same Court by the
appointed administrator, docketed as Civil Case No. 1051, for the recovery of
possession of portions of the two (2) lots at <span class="SpellE">Tagluno</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Toril</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Davao</span></span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Named as defendants in the action were <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span> Entice, Faustino <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Sulpicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roda</span>, to whom the areas
in question had been transferred by two (2) other children of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> by his second wife, <span class="SpellE">Acklin</span>
(<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagoba</i></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The action resulted in a judgment declaring the conveyances to the
defendants null and void, and directing said defendants to vacate the property
and deliver possession thereof to the administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this decision, <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> and Faustino <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> took
an appeal to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
Court affirmed the judgment of the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Court of
First Instance with a slight modification "in the sense that the deeds of
assignment of rights in favor of <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> and Faustino <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> are
valid to the extent of the shares in the land in question which <span class="SpellE">Incol</span> <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Adsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> may receive in the
settlement of the estate of <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bagobo</span>)."</p>

<p class="BODY">This judgment became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>;
and on remand of the case to the Court of origin, execution thereof was
ordered.</p>

<p class="BODY">What <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Campana</span>
and Faustino <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> did next was to file a series of
motions before the Probate Court in Special Proceeding No. 589 praying <i>inter</i>
<span class="SpellE"><i>alia</i></span> that they be allowed to stay on the
disputed areas as tenants; that the special proceeding be terminated; that the
administration be confined to one-half (1/2) of the land at <span class="SpellE">Tagluno</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Toril</span>; and that a declaration of the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Acklin</span> (<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagoba</i></span>), <span class="SpellE">Iguianon's</span> second wife, be forthwith made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these motions were ordered stricken from
the record by the Probate Court at the instance of the administrator upon the
ground that the <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span> had no personality to
intervene in the case involving the estate belonging exclusively to the spouses
<span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mida</span> and that
said <span class="SpellE">movants</span> were hostile to him as administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span> took another tack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This time they sought the relief of the
administrator.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They succeeded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A substitute administrator, Julian <span class="SpellE">Sarte</span>, was named by the Probate Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some ten (10) months later, <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Po
filed a motion to dismiss the special proceeding on the ground that the heirs
of the decedent spouses had already settled the estate extra-judicially among
themselves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span>
opposed the motion, alleging that they had not been informed of the
extra-judicial partition and had been deprived of participation in the estate,
as was their right as assignees of the rights of certain heirs of the
estate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Po</st1:place> filed
a reply, insisting that the <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span> had no
personality to intervene in the intestate proceeding, and the heirs have the
right under Section 1, Rule 74 of the Rules of Court to divide the inheritance
extra-judicially.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Probate Court
denied <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Po's motion to dismiss and declared
the extra-judicial settlement null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> moved for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">She has appealed to this Court by <i>certiorari</i> on the theory
that this Order of the Probate Court, denying her motion to dismiss and
annulling the extra-judicial settlement of the estate, was rendered with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an endeavor in which she cannot
succeed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The insuperable obstacle to <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span>
Po's efforts to preclude and negate the <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span>'
participation in the estate proceedings is the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment of the Court of Appeals declaring that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">"<i>the deeds of assignment of rights in favor of <span class="SpellE">Raymunda</span> <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> Faustino <span class="SpellE">Campana</span> are valid to the extent of the shares in the land
in question which <span class="SpellE">Incol</span> <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Adsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> may
receive in the settlement of the estate of <span class="SpellE">lguianon</span> (<span class="SpellE">Bagobo</span>).</i>"</span> This is a conclusive and
authoritative declaration that the <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span> have
stepped into the shoes of the children of the intestate <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span>
(<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagobo</i></span>) by his second wife, <span class="SpellE">Acklin</span> (<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagoba</i></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Po is bound
by that declaration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She may not escape
its effects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The declaration gives the <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span> standing and personality to intervene in the
intestate proceedings and to receive a part of the inheritance "to the
extent of the shares ** which <span class="SpellE">Incol</span> <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Adsa</span> <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span> may receive" as heirs of <span class="SpellE">Iguianon</span>
(<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagobo</i></span>) and <span class="SpellE">Acklin</span>
(<span class="SpellE"><i>Bagoba</i></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That same judicial declaration also and quite obviously operates to
proscribe and nullify any attempts at partition of the estate to the exclusion
of the <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">No error may therefore be ascribed to the Probate Court in
denying <span class="SpellE">Vicenta</span> Po's motion to dismiss and declaring
the extra-judicial settlement to the exclusion of the <span class="SpellE">Campanas</span>
null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, that order is in
accord with the facts and applicable law and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">,</span>
the petition is dismissed, with costs against the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Resolution is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and no motion for extension of time to file a
motion for reconsideration will be entertained.</p>
