<p class="BODY">From their testimonies, it can be gathered that at around eight
o'clock in the morning of August 24, 1990, the victim, Leopoldo de Leon,
together with his son, Vicente, and tenant Tomas Dalayoan, were cutting grass
in their field.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Leopoldo's cousin, Romeo de Leon, was also cutting grass in the same field,
some thirty (30) meters away from them.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Suddenly, the three accused-appellants arrived.  Carlos "Jaime" Pinto and Buenaventura "Inciong"
Castillo were armed with armalite rifle while Aquilino "Ador"
Castillo was unarmed.  Upon seeing them,
Leopoldo raised his hands and pleaded, "Cousin, don't kill me because I
have no fault.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Despite this plea, accused-appellants Carlos Pinto and Buenaventura Castillo
released a volley of automatic fire at Leopoldo, killing him instantly.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
They fired from a distance of three (3) to four (4) meters away from the
victim.  Accused-appellants fled from
the scene of the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Dalayoan reported the incident to the father of the victim who passed on the
information to their barangay captain.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Romeo de Leon testified that he saw the three
accused-appellants approach Leopoldo.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> He

Accused-appellants passed by him while leaving the scene of the crime.  He recognized them for they were known to
him since childhood.</p>

<p class="BODY">The body of Leopoldo was taken to the de Leon's house, where Dr.
Pascual conducted his post-mortem examination.  His findings, quoted in the Information filed against
accused-appellants, are embodied in a report, dated August 27, 1990 (Exh.
"E").  Dr. Pascual diagnosed
the cause of Leopoldo's death as "Cardiorespiratory Arrest due to Hypovolemic
Shock/Blasted Brain due to Gunshot Wounds."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> He

which he handed over to the investigating officer, Pfc. Eligio Lopez.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Twenty-nine (29) M-16 armalite blank cartridges or empty shells (Exhs.
"A" and "B") were found at the scene of the crime by the
men of Barangay Captain Norly Tomondong, who delivered them to <span style="">Pfc. </span>Lopez.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense forwarded by accused-appellants consisted mainly of
denial, and in the case of accused-appellant Carlos "Jaime" Pinto,
alibi.  Testifying in their behalf,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
they denied that bad blood or ill-will existed between them and the deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense also presented as witness, <b><span style="">ANACLETO TAMONDONG, </span></b>a 33-year-old member of the INP in Urdaneta,
Pangasinan and a resident of Barangay Sanlibo, Bayambang, Pangasinan.  He corroborated accused-appellant Carlos
Pinto's claim of alibi.  According to
the two, on August 24, 1990, Carlos was in the house of Anacleto starting 7:20
in the morning.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
He was borrowing one hundred pesos (P100.00) from Anacleto.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Carlos stayed until almost noon because he waited for the heavy rain to stop.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Both Carlos and Anacleto heard gunfire coming from east of the latter's
house.  They, however, did not endeavor
to ascertain where the shots came from.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense further presented testimony regarding the arrest and
detention of brothers Juancho and Manuel Gutierrez<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
in connection with the killing of the deceased, Leopoldo.  The two were put under protective custody on
August 25, 1990, and released on August 29, 1990.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the killing of Leopoldo de Leon, two criminal
cases were filed against the three accused-appellants.  The case at bench was one of them.  The second was a case for Illegal Possession
of Firearms and Ammunition,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
which was tried by the RTC of San Carlos, Pangasinan, Br. 56.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
On December 10, 1990, accused-appellants were acquitted in the Illegal
Possession case.  On October 30, 1991,
however, they were all convicted of the crime charged in the case at
bench.  They were sentenced as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Buenaventura Castillo
y Pinto alias "Inciong," Carlos Pinto y Jimenez alias
"Jaime" and Aquilino Castillo y Pinto alias "Ador" guilty
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder and sentences each of them to
suffer the penalty of <i>Reclusion Perpetua </i>and to indemnify the offended
party of the amount of FIFTY THOUSAND (P50,000.00) PESOS and to pay the costs
of suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this appeal.  It is
accused-appellants' contention that the trial court erred:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x  IN NOT
RESOLVING THE DOUBTS IN FAVOR OF THE ACCUSED;"</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x  IN COMPLETELY
DISREGARDING THE DECISION OF THE REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 56, SAN CARLOS
CITY (PANGASINAN) IN CRIMINAL CASE NO. SCC-1623 WHICH RESULTED TO THE ACQUITTAL
OF THE ACCUSED;" and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x x x  IN CONVICTING
THE ACCUSED ON THE BASIS SOLELY OF THE TESTIMONY OF A FABRICATED WITNESS, ONE
WHO IS NOT LISTED AS SUCH IN THE COMPLAINT OR INFORMATION."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants assail their conviction because the trial
court allegedly failed to appreciate the following:  (1) the arrest and detention of Juancho and Manuel Gutierrez as
the killers of the victim; (2) the presentation by the prosecution of Vicente
de Leon who was not listed in the Complaint or Information; and (3) their
acquittal by Br. 56, RTC of San Carlos, Pangasinan in Crim. Case No. SCC-1623,
where the trial judge held it "doubts the veracity of witnesses Tomas
Dalayoan and Romeo de Leon."</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal lacks merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, there is neither rhyme nor reason in the defense's
argument that the arrest and protective detention of the Gutierrez brothers
proved accused-appellants' innocence.  It is not unusual for the police to arrest various suspects in the
commission of a crime.  Those whose guilt
cannot be established by evidence are later released after investigation.  Their release, however, cannot be
interpreted that the police authorities erred in prosecuting other suspects
against whom they have established a <i>prima facie</i> <i>case</i>.  In the case at bench, the prosecution
presented no less than three (3) eyewitnesses to the killing of Leopoldo de
Leon.  Unless their testimonies are
shown to be untrue, accused-appellants cannot exculpate themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, the defenses of denial and alibi cannot prevail over
the positive identification of accused-appellants by witnesses Vicente de Leon
and Tomas Dalayoan.  In this regard,
Vicente testified:</p>

<p class="BODY">Especially telling is the testimony of Vicente.  As the son of the deceased, he must be
genuinely interested in bringing to justice the real killers.  He was eight (8) years old, when he
testified, and it is difficult to believe the charge of accused-appellants that
he perjured his testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Vicente was not listed in the complaint or in the
Information filed against accused-appellants does not justify characterizing
his testimony as "fabricated." It is the high prerogative of the
prosecution to choose its witnesses.  It
is not limited to witnesses listed in the Complaint or Information.  In any event, the task of determining the
credibility of witnesses, whether listed or unlisted, belongs to the courts
which calibrate them considering our different rules on evidence.  In the case at bench, the trial court, which
had a first-hand opportunity to observe Vicente's countenance during his
testimony, chose to give the same its mark of credence.  We give great weight to such finding absent
any manifest error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, we are ourselves convinced of the credibility of
Vicente's testimony.  The transcripts
show that he was candid in answering the questions propounded to him, and that
he possessed intelligence and proper understanding of the seriousness of the
matters about which he was testifying.  These characteristics are particularly mirrored in Vicente's
cross-examination, as conducted by Atty. Tulagan, <i>viz</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">We note too, that Vicente's testimony
that August 24, 1990 was not a school day was corroborated by the prosecution's
rebuttal witness, <b>ROSALINA MACASIEB, </b>Vicente's Grade I teacher at the
Sanlibo, Elementary School.  Mrs.
Macasieb explained that there were no classes on that date because the teachers
in District II attended a "Learning Activity Cell" session at the
District Office in Bayambang.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Accused-appellants likewise posited the
view that the trial court should have followed the lead of the RTC of San
Carlos, Pangasinan, Br. 56, which acquitted them in Crim. Case No.
SCC-1623.  There is no merit to this
argument.  The court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>cannot be bound by the
findings of the court <span style="">which </span>tried
and decided the Illegal Possession case against accused-appellants.  Murder and Illegal Possession are two
separate and distinct offenses.  They
have different elements, hence, the acquittal of accused-appellants from the latter
charge does not necessarily mean that their acquittal from the case at bench is
also in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants likewise argued that "(n)o motive
whatsoever has been shown or established or even insinuated by the prosecution
that would drive the appellants to commit so grave a wrong as killing a person,
their own relative at that."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> This
contention deserves scant consideration.  We have held many times in the past that proof of motive is unnecessary
where there is a clear and positive identification of the accused,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
as in the case at bench.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellants were correctly convicted of
murder.  The killing of Leopoldo was
characterized by treachery.  He was shot
with armalite weapons while helpless and pleading for his life.  With upraised arms, he was shot from a
distance of three (3) to four (4) meters by high-powered weapons.  Twenty-nine (29) M-16 blanks cartridges were
recovered from the scene of the crime.  They indicate the number of times he was shot.  Indeed, his head was blasted beyond recognition.  He was completely without any defense when
shot.</p>
