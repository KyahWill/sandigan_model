				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition to review the decision<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></span></a> of the Court of Appeals, in CA-G.R.
No. SP-08642, dated 21 March 1979, ordering petitioner Manila Mahogany
Manufacturing Corporation to pay private respondent Zenith Insurance
Corporation the sum of Five Thousand Pesos (P5,000.00) with 6% annual interest from
18 January 1973, attorney's fees in the sum of five hundred pesos (P500.00), and
costs of suit, and the resolution of the same Court, dated 8 February 1980,
denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration of its decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">From <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="3">6 March 1970</st1:date>
to <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="3">6 March 1971</st1:date>, petitioner
insured its Mercedes Benz 4-door sedan with respondent insurance company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1970" day="4" month="5">4
 May 1970</st1:date> the insured vehicle was bumped and damaged by a truck
owned by San Miguel Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the
damage caused, respondent company paid petitioner five thousand pesos
(P5,000.00) in amicable settlement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner's general manager executed a Release of Claim, subrogating
respondent company to all its right of action against San Miguel Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="11" month="12">11 December 1972</st1:date>,
respondent company wrote Insurance Adjusters, Inc. to demand reimbursement from
San Miguel Corporation of the amount it had paid petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Insurance Adjusters, Inc. refused
reimbursement, alleging that San Miguel Corporation had already paid petitioner
P4,500.00 for the damages to petitioner's motor vehicle, as evidenced by a cash
voucher and a Release of Claim executed by the General Manager of petitioner
discharging San Miguel Corporation from "all actions, claims, demands and
rights of action that now exist or hereafter [sic] develop arising out of or as
a consequence of the accident".</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent insurance company thus demanded from petitioner
reimbursement of the sum of P4,500.00 paid by San Miguel Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner refused; hence, respondent company
filed suit in the City Court of Manila for the recovery of P4,500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The City Court ordered petitioner to pay
respondent P4,500.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the
Court of First Instance of Manila affirmed the City Court's decision <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>, which CFI decision was affirmed by the Court
of Appeals, with the modification that petitioner was to pay respondent the
total amount of P5,000.00 that it had earlier received from the respondent
insurance company.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner now contends it is not bound to pay P4,500.00, and
much more, P5,000.00 to respondent company as the subrogation in the Release of
Claim it executed in favor of respondent was conditioned on recovery of the
total amount of damages petitioner had sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since total damages were valued by petitioner
at P9,486.43 and only P5,000.00 was received by petitioner from respondent,
petitioner argues that it was entitled to go after San Miguel Corporation to
claim the additional P4,500.00 eventually paid to it by the latter, without
having to turn over said amount to respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent of course disputes this allegation and states that there was
no qualification to its right of subrogation under the Release of Claim
executed by petitioner, the contents of said deed having expressed all the
intents and purposes of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">To support its alleged right not to return the P4,500.00 paid by
San Miguel Corporation, petitioner cites Art. 2207 of the Civil Code, which
states:</p>

<blockquote>"If the plaintiff's property has been insured, and he has
received indemnity from the insurance company for the injury or loss arising
out of the wrong or breach of contract complained of the insurance company
shall be subrogated to the rights of the insured against the wrongdoer or the
person who has violated the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
the amount paid by the insurance company does not fully cover the injury or
loss the aggrieved party shall be entitled to recover the deficiency from the
person causing the loss or injury."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also invokes Art. 1304 of the Civil Code, stating:</p>

<blockquote>"A creditor, to whom partial payment has been made, may
exercise his right for the remainder, and he shall be preferred to the person
who has been subrogated in his place in virtue of the partial payment of the
same credit."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find petitioner's arguments to be untenable and without
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any other
evidence to support its allegation that a gentlemen's agreement existed between
it and respondent, not embodied in the Release of Claim, such Release of Claim
must be taken as the best evidence of the intent and purpose of the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Court of Appeals rightly stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner argues that the release claim it executed
subrogating private respondent to any right of action it had against San Miguel
Corporation did not preclude Manila Mahogany from filing a deficiency claim
against the wrongdoer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Citing Article
2207, New Civil Code, to the effect that if the amount paid by an insurance
company does not fully cover the loss, the aggrieved party shall be entitled to
recover the deficiency from the person causing the loss, petitioner claims a
preferred right to retain the amount collected from San Miguel Corporation,
despite the subrogation in favor of private respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Although petitioner's right to file a deficiency claim
against San Miguel Corporation is with legal basis, without prejudice to the
insurer's right of subrogation, nevertheless when Manila Mahogany executed
another release claim (Exhibit K) discharging San Miguel Corporation from
"all actions, claims, demands and rights of action that now exist or
hereafter arising out of or as a consequence of the accident" after the
insurer had paid the proceeds of the policy -- the compromise agreement of
P5,000.00 being based on the insurance policy -- the insurer is entitled to
recover from the insured the amount of insurance money paid (Metropolitan
Casualty Insurance Company of New York v. <span class="SpellE">Badler</span>, 229
N.Y.S. 61, 132 Misc. 132, cited in Insurance Code and Insolvency Law with
comments and annotations, H.B. Perez 1976, p. 151).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner by its own acts released San
Miguel Corporation, thereby defeating private respondent's right of
subrogation, the right of action of petitioner against the insurer was also
nullified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
<span class="SpellE">Keng</span> &amp; Co. v. Queensland Insurance Co., Ltd., 54
O.G. 391.) Otherwise stated:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>private respondent
may recover the sum of P5,000.00 it had earlier paid to petitioner<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">As held in <u>Phil Air Lines v. <span class="SpellE">Heald</span> Lumber Co</u>.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>If a property is insured and the owner receives the indemnity from
the insurer, it is provided in [Article 2207 of the New Civil Code] that the
insurer is <u>deemed subrogated</u> to the rights of the insured against the
wrongdoer and if the amount paid by the insurer does not fully cover the loss,
then the aggrieved party is the one entitled to recover the deficiency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>xxx Under this legal provision, <u>the real
party in interest with regard to the portion of the indemnity paid is the
insurer and not the insured</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the respondent court ordering petitioner to pay
respondent company, not the P4,500.00 as originally asked for, but P5,000.00,
the amount respondent company paid petitioner as insurance, is also in accord
with law and jurisprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In disposing
of this issue, the Court of Appeals held:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx petitioner is entitled to keep the sum of P4,500.00 paid
by San Miguel Corporation under its clear right to file a deficiency claim for
damages incurred, against the wrongdoer, should the insurance company not fully
pay for the injury caused (Article 2207, New Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>However, when petitioner released San
Miguel Corporation from any liability, petitioner's right to retain the sum of
P5,000.00 no longer existed, thereby entitling private respondent to recover
the same</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">As has been observed:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The right of subrogation can only exist after the insurer has
paid the insured, otherwise the insured will be deprived of his right to full
indemnity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the insurance proceeds are
not sufficient to cover the damages suffered by the insured, then he may sue
the party responsible for the damage for the <span class="SpellE">the</span>
[sic] remainder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To the extent of the
amount he has already received from the insurer, the insurer <span class="SpellE">enjoy's</span> [sic] the right of subrogation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since the insurer can be subrogated to only such rights as
the insured may have, <u>should the insured, after receiving payment from the
insurer, release the wrongdoer who caused the loss</u>, <u>the insurer loses
his rights against the latter</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>But
in such a case, the insurer will be entitled to recover from the insured
whatever it has paid to the latter, unless the release was made with the
consent of the insurer</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And even if the specific amount asked for in the complaint is
P4,500.00 only and not P5,000.00, still, the respondent Court acted well within
its discretion in awarding P5,000.00, the total amount paid by the
insurer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals rightly
reasoned as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is to be noted that private respondent, in its complaint,
prays for the recovery, not of P5,000.00 it had paid under the insurance policy
but P4,500.00 San Miguel Corporation had paid to petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this score, We believe the City Court and
Court of First Instance erred in not awarding the proper relief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although private respondent prays for the
reimbursement of P4,500.00 paid by San Miguel Corporation, instead of P5,000.00
paid under the insurance policy, the trial court should have awarded the
latter, although not prayed for, under the general prayer in the complaint
"for such further or other relief as may be deemed just or equitable"
(Rule 6, Sec. 3, Revised Rules of Court; Rosales v. Reyes <span class="SpellE">Ordoveza</span>,
25 Phil. 495; <span class="SpellE">Cabigao</span> v. Lim, 50 Phil. 844; <span class="SpellE">Baguioro</span> v. Barrios and <span class="SpellE">Tupas</span>, 77
Phil. 120)".</blockquote>
