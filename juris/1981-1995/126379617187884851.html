<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Conversely, the

by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to Land

forced himself into the land in dispute and with the aid of armed men bulldozed
the trees and plants thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

violation of the order and the Public Land Act, leased the land to Hi-Protein

<p class="BODY">While there is no disputing the authority of administrative
superiors to reverse the findings of their subordinates, this power must be
exercised sparingly and only upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a </span>clear
showing of error.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Lacking such flaw, the
decision of the lower administrative officials should be sustained, if only
because they have closer access to the problem sought to be resolved and have
the direct oppor­tunity to question the parties and their witnesses and to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">assess </span>the evidence first-hand.</p>

<p class="BODY">The hearing officer of the Bureau of Lands, who made the initial
investigation in the case at bar, had such an opportunity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Jose B. Isidro who conducted the
hearings to resolve the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">conflicting </span>claims
of possession of the petitioner and Gregorio Reyes, examined them and their
witnesses and inspected the disputed property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His report of <st1:date year="1968" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1968</st1:date>,
was in favor of the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Notably, not even the private respondents impugn his integrity and
impartiality and in fact even cite him to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">support
their own position that de Leon had abandoned the property by selling it in
1968 and 1969.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By contrast, the motives of both Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Habal</span>
have been questioned by the petitioner, and for good reason.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that it was Bautista who
advised Gregorio Reyes to file his sales application,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
and by some happenstance, it was <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">also </span>Bautista
who was assigned to investigate the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">also </span>not denied
that <span class="SpellE">Habal</span> was retained by Reyes to conduct the
survey of the land in dispute, presumably for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>corresponding compensation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Given such circumstances, we find it not unreasonable to suppose, and even
expect, that the reports of these two individuals would be, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>in fact they were, favorable to
Reyes.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is worth noting that in his decision reversing the Ministry of
Natural Resources, the public respondent merely rejected the report of Isidro
and opted in favor of the reports of Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Habal</span>,
but without saying why except to note that Bautista's report was earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No effort was made to explain away their
apparent bias as directly challenged by the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reports were simply and completely
accepted to sustain the private respondents' stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was also no mention of Land
Investigator <span class="SpellE">Salvado</span>, who reported on <st1:date year="1983" day="12" month="8">August 12, 1983</st1:date>, that Reyes had
violated the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> order of the Bureau of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Lands and recommended that he be held civilly
and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">criminally liable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His report was totally ignored.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Besides invoking the
reports of Isidro and <span class="SpellE">Salvado</span>, the petitioner
presented two witnesses who both testified that he and his father had been in
continuous possession of the land in dispute, raising fruit-bearing trees
there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pastor Buenaventura swore he was
born in Sta. <span class="SpellE">Quiteria</span> in 1917 and Ricardo Javier
claimed he transferred to the place in 1938, and both were positive that the de
Leon father and son were occupying the disputed property until it was bulldozed
in 1969.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

investigation report on the application stated, among others, that the

prove the genuineness of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">sig­</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">nature on the challenged deeds of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:

had not been bulldozed by Gregorio Reyes but had been destroyed during </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">typhoon, but this too has no evidentiary value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the alleged affiant was never presented
and could not be examined on the said sworn statement, it must be rejected </span>as
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">hearsay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The Minister also found
that the tax declarations made by Gregorio Reyes referred not to the land in
dispute but to the lot purchased from the <span class="SpellE">Piedad</span>
Estate by the <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> spouses, his parents-in-law.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> The private </span>respondents' argument
that the disputed land was part of the said lot is weakened by the fact that
Reyes filed a sales application <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and so
impliedly admitted it was public land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then there is Reyes' assertion that the <span class="SpellE">Bartolomes</span>
had merely allowed or tolerated de Leon's occupation of the land because he was
their relative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This claim, if true at
all, would only disprove the reports made by Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Habal</span>
that no one but Reyes was at the time of their inspection occupying the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are satisfied from an examination of the evidence of record
that the petitioner, as his father before him, was in continuous possession of
the disputed land from 1925 and raised fruit-bearing trees therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1969, Reyes forcibly ousted de Leon from
the said property and destroyed the trees and structures on the said
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, despite the order
of the Bureau of Lands requiring the parties to maintain the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">status</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt"> <u>quo</u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> pending </span>the
resolution of their dispute, Reyes leased the property to the Hi-Protein
Corporation, which itself introduced improvements on the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">While, as previously remarked, the decisions of administrative
officials are subject to review by their superiors, such review, to be valid,
must not be whimsical or arbitrary or devoid of substantial basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the public
respondent, acting on behalf of the President, can reverse the decisions of a
department head although the former is lower in rank than the Cabinet
member.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But that is not the point.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The point is that, although the power is
conceded, it must be exercised, like all powers, within the limits of the law,
if substantive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">rights are to be
protected and justice is to be upheld.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Our finding is that such
power was not properly exercised in this case, to the prejudice of the
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The basis of the reversal,
to wit, the reports of Bautista and <span class="SpellE">Habal</span>, have been
discredited for partiality and refuted by the private respondents themselves
when they argued that the petitioner’s possession of the land was only
tolerated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was an implicit
admission that the petitioner was actually occupying the land at the time they
said they had no possession of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the public respondent did not consider the other official
reports submitted by Isidro and <span class="SpellE">Salvado</span> and just
dismissed them out of hand notwithstanding that these were the very bases used
by the Bureau of Lands in deciding for the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The public respondent, in
setting aside the decision of the Bureau of Lands, as affirmed by the Ministry
of Natural Resources, disregarded the long line of decisions holding that the
findings and conclusions of the Director of the Bureau of Lands and approved by
the Secretary of Agriculture upon a question of fact are conclusive and not
subject to review, in the absence of showing that such decision was rendered in
consequence of fraud, imposition, or mistake.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The writ of <i><u>certiorari</u></i> is available in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If all administrative decisions
were conclusive upon us in any event, there would have been no reason at all to
offer this extraordinary remedy to litigants who otherwise would have been
deprived of this only and last resort to the courts of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This remedy applies to administrative
decisions up to the highest level and includes the decision at bar even if rendered
"by authority of the President." The sacramental phrase does not
remove these decisions from the <i><u>certiorari</u></i> jurisdiction of the
Court or inhibit us from reversing them when warranted by a clear showing of a
grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petition is
granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writ must issue.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It bears emphasis that whereas the petitioner is a humble farmer
applying for a free patent over the only land he and his father before him have
tilled all these many years, the private respondents are subdivision owners who
really do not need the disputed property as much as the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are elated that the facts and the law of
this case have tilted in favor of the party with "less privileges in
life" and thus given meaning to the consti­tutional ideal of a more
equitable distribution among our <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">people
of the bounties of the earth.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
