<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In convicting him, the
Regional Trial Court of Malabon, Metro Manila, relied heavily on the testimony
of the prosecution witnesses who participated in the buy-bust operation that
led to his arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The operation was narrated by Pat. Roger Felices,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

who acted as the buyer in the mock transaction that took place at about seven
o'clock in the evening of January 24, 1990, at Cadorniga Street, in Navotas,
Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Navotas Police Station had earlier received confidential
information that Reynaldo Nario was selling shabu in the street.  A buy-bust team was immediately formed, with
Felices, Pat. Nemesio Ira and Pat. Rizalito Francisco as members and Pat.
Rolland Mabbun as leader.  Two <s>P</s>100<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>bills <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">were </span>marked with the initials "REF" for use in the
sham purchase.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As the other team members deployed themselves, Felices approached
Nario and said he wanted to buy shabu.  Nario said he had some for sale at <s>P</s><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">100.00 </span>a teabag.  Felices
gave the marked money to Nario, who handed him two teabags in return.  Upon witnessing the exchange, the other
policeman closed in on Nario and identified themselves as peace officers.  They arrested him and recovered the marked <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">money.  Nario also surrendered another teabag he was carrying in his wallet.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The teabags were later
sent to the National Bureau of Investigation for laboratory examination and
found to contain methamphetamine hydrochloride, commonly known </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">shabu.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Felices was corroborated by Rolland Mabbun<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and
the NBI forensic expert, Demelon de la Cruz, who affirmed his examination
report.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nario denied the charge against him.  He said that on the night in question he was in the store in
front of his house when Felices and another policeman came.  Without much ado, Felices grabbed his
necklace and the other policeman took <s>P</s><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">1,000.00 </span>from his pocket.  They told him he was under arrest for drug-pushing.  He refused to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">go </span>with them because they had no warrant.  However, he finally submitted when Pat.
Rizalito Francisco, a childhood friend of his, arrived and advised him to obey
them.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">At the police station, he
was divested of his wallet containing </span><s><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">P</span></s><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">1,200.00.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A
lighter, a handkerchief, a </span>bracelet and a ring were also taken from him
but later returned.  He was tortured to
make him admit he was a drug <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pusher.  His genitals were electrified.  He was hit in the head several times with a
paperweight.  Later, he was taken back
to his house, which the policemen searched.  They found no shabu there.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Nario was corroborated by
Virgilio Francisco,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> who claimed to have witnessed his arrest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The appeal must fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nario's argument that he would not have sold shabu to the
policemen because he knew them as such is not believable.  His testimony is self-serving.  Regarding Pat. Francisco, it appears from
Nario's own words that his friend advised him to go with the other policemen
after they had already arrested him.  Francisco's subsequent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">appearance
could not have forwarned him of the operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is also no proof of his torture or of the theft of his
money.  No medical report of his
injuries has been submitted.  He did not
complain about his maltreatment until he testified at his trial.  He was not really that helpless in
denouncing the policemen because he had the assistance of competent counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, he had the support of his family which, he points out, is respected
and not without influence in the community.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the mock sale was transacted in an open place did
not make the sale any less credible.  We
have decided many cases where the buy-bust operation was carried out in public
places like markets and billiard halls, even in the daytime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, drug pushers have <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">become
increasingly reckless and, worse, openly defiant of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The search of Nario's house without a warrant does not disprove
that he had earlier sold two teabags of shabu to Felices.  That was a different operation.  Felices testified that they searched the
house with Nario's permission and so no warrant was necessary.  At any rate, as no shabu was found there,
the fruit-of-the-poisonous?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">tree
rule has no application in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued in the appellant's brief that if Nario had really
been caught red-handed, the policemen would not have found it necessary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to </span>torture him, or search his house,
to force him to admit he was a drug pusher.  But it is only the appellant who insists he was tortured; no
corroborative evidence has been offered.  As for the search of his house, the prosecutor explained that this was
done not to fish for evidence of the already established entrapment.  The purpose was to find out if he had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">more </span>shabu in his possession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Court has held in a
long line of cases that a buy-bust operation is not an instigation but an
entrapment.  In the case at bar, Nario
was ready to sell to anyone who wanted to buy shabu and in fact had three
teabags of the substance on his person.  The criminal intent was already present.  The operation merely affirmed, through his own act, that he was a
drug pusher.  We have repeatedly
stressed that in entrapment, the idea to commit the crime originates from the
accused.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> In the case at bar, that idea was activated,
so to speak, when Felices informed Nario that he was interested in buying
shabu.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant that the appellant has not imputed any false
motive to the policemen in arresting him.  This strengthens the presumption that they were in the regular discharge
of their duties when they entrapped him and thereafter charged him <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">with </span>drug-pushing.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Finally, the Court notes two
irrelevancies in the appellant's brief.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The first is the reference to the character of Nario's family
which, it is stressed, includes responsible professionals and respected members
of the community.  This fact has no
bearing at all on this case.  It certainly
does not add to the presumption of innocence in Nario's favor nor does it
lessen the evidence of his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second is the reference to another case in which the herein
appellant's counsel is charging the Navotas police with violating the human
rights of his client.  This charge has
yet to be proved and it is not even asserted that the same policemen are
involved.  Moreover, Nario's allegation
of maltreatment by the policemen who arrested him was dismissed by the trial
court as a mere fabrication.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We are satisfied with
Judge Marina L. Buzon that the evidence against Reynaldo Nario has overcome the
constitutional presumption of innocence in his favor and established his guilt
beyond reasonable doubt.  His punishment
is condign; it is here sustained.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Selling prohibited drugs
is an especially </span>vicious <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">crime
because it often breeds other crimes.  It is not what we might call a "contained" crime whose
consequences are limited to that crime alone, like swindling and bigamy.  Court and police records show that a
significant number of murders, rapes, and similar offenses have been committed
by persons under the influence of dangerous drugs, or while they are
"high." While spreading such drugs, the drug-pusher is also abetting,
through his greed and irresponsibility, the commission of other crimes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, the appeal is DISMISSED and the challenged
decision is AFFIRMED in full, with costs against the appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
