reached the city at around <st1:time hour="9" minute="0">9:00 o'clock A.M.</st1:time>
<span style="">of </span>the same day (p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon their arrival in their two-storey
apartment, her husband went to work, leaving her and her nephew in their
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After her husband left their
apartment, she locked its main door (p. 20.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the afternoon of <span style="">the same </span>day,
her nephew was sleeping in a room located at the upper floor of their
apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Her </span>nephew was at that time sick (p. 20) with flu (p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00

</span>The comfort <span style="">room was </span>then
closed (p. 16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> barged inside of the comfort room and thereafter
closed the door (p. 17<span class="GramE">)_</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, she had just finished '<span class="SpellE">dumudumi</span>' (p. 4) and had just stood up with her <span class="SpellE">maong</span> shorts and her panty down below her knees (p.
18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On top, she was wearing a blouse <span style="">(p. </span>7).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She was not able to pull up her panty and <span class="SpellE">maong</span>
shorts <span style="">(p. 6) </span>because she was
caught aback.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the main door of
their apartment was locked (p. 3), she suspected that <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
climbed thru the kitchen (where <span style="">one can
also </span>gain entry to their apartment).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> choked her (p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was able to shout for '<span class="SpellE">saklolo</span>' many times but <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
slapped her (pp. 5 &amp; 10), causing her mouth to bleed (p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And then <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
pushed her, causing her to fall to the ground of <span style="">the </span>comfort <span style="">room </span>(p.
5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her head fell near the side of the
closed door of the comfort room and her feet beside the '<span class="SpellE">inodoro</span>'
<span style="">(p. </span>19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, her panty and <span class="SpellE">maong</span> shorts were still down her knees (pp. 18 &amp; 6) but
her bra and blouse were still on (p. 21) and she has not washed herself yet (p.
18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite that, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
'put down' his short and <span style="">brief (p. 6) and suddenly <span class="GramE">laid</span> on top of her
(pp. 5 &amp; 18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She felt his private
part entered her </span>private part.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a few minutes (p. <span style="">7), </span>he
stood up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw her watch with a
leatherette bracelet and tried to grab it (p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pained her arms <span style="">(p. 9) </span>because she was reclining then
(p. 10), so she <span style="">just </span>removed her
watch and gave it to <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> (p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unsatisfied, he grabbed her necklace, hurting
her neck (p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also asked for her
money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For fear that he might harm <span class="GramE">her,</span> she got her One Hundred Twenty <span style="">(P120.00) </span>Pesos from <span style="">her
pocket (p. </span>7) and <span style="">gave </span>it to him (p. 9).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he went out of the comfort room and threatened <span style="">her </span>not to <span style="">tell her husband about </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">incident otherwise he will kill her (p. </span>7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Benedicto</span></span><span style=""> </span>left the

her panty and her shorts and went out of the comfort room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She found her nephew sitting downstairs (p.

passed beside her husband who had just <span style="">arrived
</span><span style="">and
did not </span>know what had happened to her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Her husband saw <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> (p. <span style="">9) </span>but only after the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her husband came near her, she related
to her husband that <span style="">she </span>was raped and her money and jewelries were taken (p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her husband immediately chased <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
created a commotion which attracted the attention of their neighbors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She learned from them (their neighbors) that
they did not help her because they thought <span style="">that </span>she and <span class="GramE">her</span> <span style="">husband were </span>just quarreling (p.
9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also learned from her nephew
that the latter, <span class="GramE">who</span> was then upstairs at the
beginning of the incident, went down to the <span style="">ground floor when he heard </span>heir
shout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But her nephew did not <span style="">do </span>anything, thinking that she and her
husband were only quarreling <span style="">(p. </span>20),
and besides, he was sick <span style="">with </span>flu
<span style="">at </span>that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, her nephew just came from the province

Rodriguez, Sr. Memorial Hospital, District Health Office II, at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span></st1:place></st1:city>, Metro Manila, for <span style="">medical examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She <span class="GramE">heed</span> </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">advice and on the same day, she went to E. Rodriguez Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She </span>arrived there at 7:00 o'clock in
the evening.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There, she <span style="">only </span>complained about the parts of her
body where <span style="">she
was slapped </span>and choked (p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She did not relate to the examining <span style="">doctor that she was raped because she was
told </span><span style="">by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Celso</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span style="">Cruz </span>that <span style="">they </span>do

<p class="2Q">She went back to the Police Station on<span style=""> </span>February 3, 1989.</p>

<p class="2Q">Ana's testimony on her injuries on her face and neck, caused when <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> choked and slapped her and when <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> abruptly grabbed her necklace, was confirmed on
stand by <span style="">Dr.
Jose <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> <span class="SpellE">Raquepo</span>, </span>the
resident physician who examined her at the E. Rodriguez Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Raquepo</span>
identified the above Medical Certificate he <span style="">issued </span>and declared in open court that:</p>

<p class="2Q">At around 7:30 PM on January <span style="">31,
1989 (TSN, Sept. 20, 1989, p. 7), he treated Ana's injuries on her </span>face
and neck (p. 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He explained that the
first and second entry (<span class="SpellE">Hematoma</span>) in the above
certificate is '<span class="SpellE">pasa</span>' which may have been caused by a
blunt object, like <span style="">a </span>wood,
stone, steel or an open fist; <span style="">while </span><span style="">the third entry (<span class="SpellE">Erythema</span>)
is '<span class="SpellE">namula</span>' which may have been caused by a blunt or
may have been caused </span>by choking or by scratching the skin by finger
nails.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Dr. <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> <span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span>,
the physician at the PC Crime Laboratory at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, who examined Ana on <st1:date year="1989" day="1" month="2">February 1, <span class="GramE">1989</span></st1:date>
also testified and he explained the method he used in arriving at his findings
embodied in the above Medical Report <span style="">he
</span>issued to Ana:</p>

<p class="2Q">He inserted a speculum in Ana's vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found that Ana's internal as well as the
external organ were already altered because the 'labia <span class="SpellE">mejora</span>
is already creeping hypertrophied labia <span class="SpellE">minora</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also 'the hymen shows deep insertion of the
vagina speculum and an index <span style="">finger
offers only slight resistance.' Thus, his conclusion </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">the above Medical Report that: 'subject is in non-virgin state
physically' (TSN, Oct. 31, 1989, p. 2).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He explained further that the hymen is a fleshy membrane that hangs and
partially covers the </span>opening of vaginal canal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">insertion
of any object to the vaginal canal will </span><span style="">or </span><span style="">may lacerate this membrane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The laceration of the hymen is usually caused
by sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination
of Ana's hymen, however, showed that there were shallow healed laceration at </span><span style="">7 </span><span style="">and deep healed lacerations at </span>3<span style="">, 6 and 9 o'clock position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
are like the face of the clock, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His finding is that Ana's laceration has
already recuperated, and usually laceration healed in two weeks time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he is quick in adding that if a woman has
already lost her virginity by </span>previous sexual intercourse, <span style="">succeeding intercourse cannot produce new
laceration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">He also explained that the entry under remarks in the medico legal
report: 'vaginal and <span class="SpellE">peri</span>-urethral smears are
positive for <span class="SpellE">extracellular</span> gram-negative <span class="SpellE"><span style="">diploccoci</span></span><span style=""> </span>but negative for <span style="">spermatozoa', means that Ana is negative for
spermatozoa of a male </span>germ cell but is positive of <span class="SpellE">extracellular</span>
bacteria ('<span class="SpellE">extracellular</span> gram-negative <span class="SpellE">diploccoci</span>').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="GramE">bacteria</span> is the one that cause gonorrhea (sic), usually
introduced by sexual <span style="">intercourse of an
infected partner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Very rarely could <span class="GramE">this bacteria</span> be transmitted or caused by using dirty water
because it cannot exist long outside of the vagina.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Usually, in order to be infected with
gonorrhea (sic), the bacteria should be inside the cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In Ana's case, there is no infection yet
because the <span class="GramE">bacteria <span style="">is</span></span></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">still
outside her cell.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is quick to
emphasize that the absence of spermatozoa does not necessarily mean that there
was no sexual intercourse because there are cases of rape of women where the
rapist could not have ejaculated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">The entry which says that 'there <span class="GramE">is no external
signs</span> of any form of trauma' means that there is no injury in the whole
body at the time of their examination.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But again he emphasized that this does not necessarily mean that before
he examined Ana, she sustained no <span style="">injuries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It
really depends on the </span>gravity of the injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are injuries which can only cause the
reddening of the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span style="">injuries could disappear the following day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Pat. <span class="SpellE">Celso</span> Cruz also confirmed on stand
that:</p>

<p class="2Q">At the date of <span style="">the </span>incident,
Ana came to their station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He advised
Ana to go to the E. <span style="">Rodriguez Hospital
and Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span> for medical examination because he
noticed that she has injuries (TSN, Sept. 11, 1989, p. 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took Ana's statement three (3) days after
(p. 12) the date of the incident.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Ana's husband, Jimenez <span class="SpellE">Esconde</span>,
substantiated Ana's testimony <span class="GramE">specially</span> on the events
that transpired immediately after the <span style="">rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He declared that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"They rent a small apartment (TSN, August 16, 1989, <span style="">pp. </span>8-9) consisting of two (2) floors
(p. <span style="">9).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>One </span>can enter their apartment thru its front door located at its
ground floor and by passing thru the <span style="">kitchen
at the back of their apartment, by using a stand (p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their ground floor has no window (p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this floor, their comfort room can be
found.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their comfort room measures about
1 1/2 by two (2) meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the upper
floor of their apartment, there are two (2) rooms (p. 9).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">At about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of January 31, 1989 the day
of the subject incident, he went home from his upholstery shop (p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the main entrance of their
apartment, he pushed their main door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was locked (p. 4), so he went around their house (p. <span style="">10) </span>and entered their apartment by passing through their kitchen
going to the second floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">When he was already near the door of their room.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>at the second floor (p. 4), he saw <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, then attired in shorts and blue t-shirt (p. 7),
facing the opened door (p. 6) of their comfort room (p. 5) and pointing his
finger and talking to '<span style="">s</span>omebody'
inside the comfort room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He hid
himself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But from his place where he was
at that <span style="">time, </span>he cannot see the
inner portion of the comfort room (p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He heard <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> to have said to that
'somebody' in the comfort room '<span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span> <span class="SpellE">huwag</span> <span class="SpellE">kang</span> <span class="SpellE">magsusumbong</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">asawa</span> mo, <span class="SpellE">papatayin</span> <span class="SpellE">kita</span>.' (p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he heard <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
uttered those words, he went out from where he is hiding (p. 16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> saw him
and passed beside him, and told him: '<span class="SpellE">Ikaw</span>, <span class="GramE">may</span> <span class="SpellE">atraso</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
akin'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not do anything as he was
caught aback by <span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> statement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was thinking about what his '<span class="SpellE">atraso</span>' is (p. 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> at that time had left by passing thru <span style="">the kitchen </span>(the same way he entered
their apartment) (p. 20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> left, he saw his wife came out from the comfort
room (p. 17).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her mouth was
bleeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came near her and asked her
what happened.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She related that she was
abused: '<span class="SpellE">Pinagsamantalahan</span> <span class="SpellE">daw</span>
<span class="SpellE">po</span> <span class="SpellE">siya</span>' (p. <span style="">5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Upon
hearing that, he immediately chased <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> but he
was not able to catch him because 'he was already at a far distance' (p. 6).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">When placed on stand, accused <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
claims <span style="">that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Ana is his neighbor (TSN, Nov. 10, 1989, p. 3) and his sweetheart
(p. 2) since December 8, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
date of the incident on January 31, 1989, he happened to pass by Ana's
apartment in going home from a day's heavy driving of a passenger
tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At Ana's apartment <span style="">door, h</span>e saw Ana standing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana called her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He came near her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She invited him to come inside their
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he acceded and he entered
Ana's apartment, Ana closed the door of the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She asked him to sit in the long sofa located
at the ground floor of their apartment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, she sat beside him and '<span class="SpellE">nilalandi</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span>.' She <span style="">is </span>'trying to embrace me and caress me'
(p. 4). <span class="GramE">then</span> they kissed each other (p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, <span style="">he </span>felt that someone is walking upstairs (p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">So </span>he
asked her if there are people upstairs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She answered 'yes' (p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana's
nephew went downstairs (p. 5), but immediately returned to the second floor <span style="">of </span>the apartment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana saw this <span class="GramE">opportunity,</span>
she invited him inside the comfort room (p. 5).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">He </span>followed her, but he
stopped in front of the door, outside the comfort room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana, once inside the comfort room, undressed
herself naked and beckoned him to come in (p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that position, Ana's husband arrived (pp.
3-6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This happened at about 7:00
o'clock P.M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw Ana's husband peeped
into the window the comfort room from outside <span style="">the </span>apartment (p. 3) and saw his wife naked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana's husband 'asked' her wife why there <span class="GramE">was other people</span> in their house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Ana did <span style="">not reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>He was about
to leave the comfort room when all of a sudden, Ana's husband slapped her (p.
4) twice inside the comfort room (pp. 6-7).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Ana has already put on her short and blouse at that time (p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing this, he stepped out of the house but <span style="">her </span>husband chased him with a <span style="">pointed </span>object (p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So he ran fast as he could.</p>

<p class="2Q">Thereafter the owner of the apartment which Ana and her husband are
renting had him apprehended (p. 4).</p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">&nbsp;</span>But on cross examination, he
declared that:</p>

<p class="2Q">At the time that Ana's husband peeped into the comfort room's
window, seeing her wife naked, he (<span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>) was
still there in front of the comfort room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was about to leave then (p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But Ana's husband proceeded first in changing his clothes (p. 8), after
which, he (Ana's husband) went to confront Ana and slapped her (p. 7).</p>

<p class="2Q">He also claims that he courted Ana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was able to win her heart on December 8, 1988 (p. 11).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although they kept their relationship secret,
they were seeing each other at the '<span class="SpellE">perya</span>'.</p>

<p class="2Q">At the time of <span style="">the </span>incident,
he knew that Ana was already married (p. 11).</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> testimony was corroborated by
<span class="GramE">his<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">sur</span></span>-rebuttal witness <span class="SpellE">Pampillo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Adona</span>, thus:</p>

<p class="2Q">He <span class="GramE">know</span> (sic) <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
because he is his long time friend (TSN, January 9, 1990, p. 7) and his
co-driver -- '<span class="SpellE">karelyebo</span>' in the passenger tricycle he
is driving (p 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He recounted having
met Ana in the '<span class="SpellE">perya</span>' in <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
(p. 3) on December 9, 1988.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he saw
Ana at the '<span class="SpellE">perya</span>' she and <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
were then 'holding hands'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> introduced Ana to him (witness) as his (<span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span>) girlfriend (pp. 4-5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims seeing them again last December 30,
1988 about to <span style="">ride a '</span><span class="SpellE">perryswheel</span>' in the '<span class="SpellE">perya</span>' (p.
5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This time, he saw <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> placed his arm on the shoulder of Ana while
riding the '<span class="SpellE">perryswheel</span>' (p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But he had <span style="">not </span>seen them together anymore in January 1989 (p. 8) and that
he has no knowledge if they still have a 'relationship' on that date.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">But <span class="GramE">Ana,</span> as a rebuttal witness of the
prosecution, disputed <span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> allegations <span style="">in </span>the latter's testimony and insists
that:</p>

<p class="2Q">When her husband arrived, he did not lift a finger or say anything
to her because her husband at that time did not know that she was raped and
robbed (TSN, December 11, 1989, p. 2).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She categorically denied any relationship with <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She insists that she does not know him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But her husband does (p. 2).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the incident, she claims that she has
never met this <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> (p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She categorically denied having allowed <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> entry to their apartment (p. <span style="">5).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">There is nothing incredible <span style="">in
</span>Ana's story.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no
evidence of her <span style="">insincerity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Neither is there any evidence of
motive for her to falsely testify against <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On the contrary, considering the inbred
modesty and antipathy of <span class="GramE">Filipino<span style="">&nbsp; </span>women</span> to air things that affect their
honor, it <span style="">is </span>not normal for a
Filipina like Ana to publicly admit that she had been criminally abused and
ravished, expose herself to the scandal, embarrassment and humiliation of a
public trial wherein she would not only admit but also narrate the violation <span style="">of </span>her person unless that is the
truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is her natural instinct to
protect her honor (see People v. <span class="SpellE">Dinola</span>, G.R. No.
54567, March. 22, 1990).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
ratiocination finds support in the case at bar where the victim, Ana, at the
time of the rape, had been married for only two (2) days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Given that condition, it is just inconsistent
with human experience that after she had voluntarily married her husband for
only two (2) days, would commit, as what <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
feigns, an adulterous act that early and right inside their conjugal abode,
unless Ana is a <span class="SpellE">nympho</span>, which has' not been
established by the evidence and is negated by <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
himself when he testified that he spent time <span style="">in </span>courting Ana after she allegedly agreed to his love proposal.</p>

<p class="2Q">In rape cases, the conduct of the woman immediately following the
alleged assault is of utmost importance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, the fact that Ana immediately reported the incide<span style="">n</span>t to the police and had her body
examined by <span style="">a </span>doctor negates
fabrication <span style="">or </span>prevarication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ana's willingness to face police
investigators and to submit to a physical examination is a mute eloquent
testimony of the truth of her charge against <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>.</p>

<p class="2Q">It <span style="">is </span>not Ana's but <span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> testimony <span style="">which
</span>rings with implausibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
declarations that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>after Ana's husband
peeped thru the window of the comfort room and seeing her naked,<span style=""> he </span>(Ana's husband) proceeded first <span style="">in </span>changing his.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">clothes</span> in their
room before confronting Ana why she is naked in the presence of a man inside
their apartment (TSN, November 9, 1989, pp. 3-4, TSN, Nov. 10, 1989, pp. 6-7
&amp; 10) is incredible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It's not <span style="">Filipino </span><span style="">custom </span>this way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
testimony is just beyond persuasion.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> argument that coition would
be impossible in a small comfort room measuring two (2) meters by one and a
half (1 1/2) meter (see Jimenez <span class="SpellE">Esconde's</span> testimony)
is undeserving of consideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Jurisprudence attests to the fact that Rape has been committed in many
different places including places which <span class="GramE">to</span> many would
appear to be unlikely and high risk places for sexual embraces. <span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Ratanan</span>, G.R. No. 48382, Feb.
28, 1990).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>It can be committed in
a five (5) meter room with five (5) people inside (People v. <span class="SpellE">Detuya</span>, 154 SCRA 410) or in the front seat of a jeep
(People v. <span class="SpellE">Ison</span>, 173 SCRA 118), or on a pathway
twenty (20) meters <span style="">away </span>from a
beauty contest in progress (People v. <span class="SpellE">Gamboa</span>, 145
SCRA 289 [1986] or on the roadside at high noon (People v. Lopez, 141 SCRA 385
[1986] or inside a washroom adjoining a house (People v. Jones, 137 SCRA 166
[1985] or on a '<span class="SpellE">pilapil</span>' <span style="">where people usually pass by (People v. Aragon, 138 SCRA 166 [1985]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">It may be uncomfortable having coitus <span style="">in </span><span class="GramE">a such</span> small room but it certainly is
not impossible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Besides, </span>it was not shown although the trial court may have
observed, <span style="">that either Ana or <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> is </span><span style="">too
</span><span style="">big </span><span style="">to make coition in the said room <span class="GramE">an <span class="SpellE">imposibility</span></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Man, once overcome by bestial desires,
chooses not the time, the place, the occasion, nor even the person (see People

<p class="2Q"><span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>, insisting on his innocence,
capitalizes <span style="">on </span>the absence of
spermatozoa on Ana as <span style="">borne-out by the
Medical Report.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can not be given weight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is determinative of rape </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">not the emission of semen but penetration of the female sexual organ
(see People </span>v. <span style="">Cruz, </span>G. R.
69251, <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="9"><span class="GramE">Sept</span>.
 13, <span style="">1989</span></st1:date><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, complete or total penetration of Ana's private organ </span>is not
necessary to consummate the crime of <span style="">rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The slightest penetration will suffice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">the </span>rupture <span style="">of the hymen essential for the offense of
consummated rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough that
there is proof of entrance of the male organ within the labia of the
pudendum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary to show to
what extent penetration of the woman's body has been made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is enough if the woman's body is entered,
(see People v. <span class="SpellE">Bacani</span> y <span class="SpellE">Poliosco</span>,
G.R. No. 77854, Jan. 24, 1990).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">We concur with the trial court when it concluded that there was no
lover relationship between <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> and Ana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If ever they have been lovers, it has not
been satisfactorily established that the relationship continued after the
marriage <span style="">of </span>Ana and up to the
date of the incident.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IS </span><span style="font-weight: normal;">THE COITION AGAINST ANA'S
WILL?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">It must be recalled that when <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span>
barged inside the comfort room, she has just stood <span style="">up </span>after she '<span class="SpellE">dumumi</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact she has not washed herself yet, and
her panty and short were still down below her knees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anybody in her position would be dumbfounded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate she shouted '<span class="SpellE">saklolo</span>'
many times, but he choked her and then slapped her, then pushed her to the
ground, her head hitting the stone wall <span style="">of
</span>the comfort room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> put down his shorts and lay on top of <span style="">h</span>er.</p>

<p class="2Q">The working of human mind when placed under <span style="">such </span>emotional stress is unpredictable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this given situation, some may shout, some
may faint, and some may be shocked into insensibility as what happened to
Ana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To Ana's mind at that point in
time, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> is determined to do whatever he <span style="">intends </span>to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fear of further injuries simply pinned her
mind, <span style="">overpowering and </span>stifling
any attempt to resist the sexual assault.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Ana </span>may have failed to <span style="">successfully resist the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
advances at the actual time of the </span>sexual assault <span style="">itself </span>but such is not a manifestation
of consent, but rather <span style="">an </span>indication
of involuntary submission (see People v. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, G.R.
84913-15, June 5, 1990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anyway, force or
intimidation itself is <span class="SpellE">sufficent</span> for a woman not to
put <span style="">up any resistance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only <span class="GramE">a firearm can</span>
produce intimidation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Intimidation is
addressed to the </span>mind. (<span class="GramE">see</span> People v. <span class="SpellE">Corales</span>, G.R. <span style="">No.

robbery shall have been accompanied with rape.' In other words, to be liable
under the said provision of law the offender must have the intent to take the
personal property belonging to another with intent to gain and <span style="">such </span>intent

<p class="2Q"><span style="">In </span>the case at bar,
the Rape was <span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> primary objective and his
taking away Ana's personal properties against her will was only an

complex crime of Robbery with Rape under Art. <span class="GramE">48 of the

Art. 48 of the Revised Penal Code on Complex Crime applicable because <span class="SpellE">Benedicto's</span> act of raping Ana and thereafter taking her
money and jewelries do not constitute a single act (but separate acts)
constituting <span style="">two </span>(2) or more

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">THE PENALTY<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Padalit</span> (1 Phil. 426) where the accused was
charged of Robbery with Homicide (also <span style="">a
</span>special complex crime), the Supreme Court infers that he <span style="">may </span>be convicted of any one of
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In People v. <span class="SpellE">Dinola</span>
(183 SCRA 496), the accused was charged and convicted of the crime of Robbery
with Rape but the Supreme Court modified the judgment of the lower court by
sentencing the accused to two distinct crimes of Robbery and Rape on account of
its findings that the original design of the accused was to commit Rape but the
accused after committing Rape also committed Robbery because the opportunity
presented itself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The crime of Rape is punished by Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>
(see Art. 335, <span style="">above), </span>thus, the
Indeterminate Sentence Law (Act No. 4103 as amended) is not applicable (see
People v. <span class="SpellE">Amores</span>, 58 SCRA 510).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should be punished by Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> for the crime of rape.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> has also committed Robbery and
must be punished by <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>
in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor in its medium
period (see Art. 294, Nov. 5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the
Indeterminate Sentence Law applies.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> should be penalized <span style="">with an </span>Indeterminate penalty within
the range of <span class="SpellE">arresto</span> mayor in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> in its
medium period of four (4) months and one (1) day to four (4) years and two (2)
months as minimum and within the range of <span style="">six (6) </span>years and one (1) day to eight (8)
years of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>
in its maximum period to <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor in its minimum
period, as maximum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, the judgment of the trial court is MODIFIED as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> M. Cruz is found guilty of RAPE and is sentenced
to Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span> under Art. <span class="GramE">27

<blockquote>2) <span class="SpellE">Benedicto</span> M. Cruz is also found guilty of the separate
crime of ROBBERY and is sentenced to the Indeterminate penalty of six (6)
months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>
as minimum to six (6) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span>
