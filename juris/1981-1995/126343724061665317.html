the commission of the offense with one Roberto Lacanilao <i><span style="">y </span></i>Evangelista on the basis of

Criminal Case No. 91­-91512 against Rodolfo Loza for illegal possession of
shabu and (b) Criminal Case No. 91-91513 against Ricardo Garcia for illegal
possession of one stick of handrolled marijuana cigarette.  These two accused were inside the shanty of
the accused-appellant at the time the latter was arrested during an alleged
buy-bust operation.  The trial court later
acquitted Loza for insufficiency of evidence and exonerated Garcia on the
ground of reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the pre-trial on 26 July 1991, the parties agreed that the
four accused were arrested on 7 February 1991 without any search warrant or

two-pieces of foil allegedly obtained by the peace officers from the accused at
the time of their arrest were examined and found to be positive for

the alleged poseur-buyer, who was then a member of<span style=""> </span>the Narcotics Section of the Western Police District assigned at
Police Station 1, North Bay, Balut, Tondo, Manila.  The defense presented all the four accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the witnesses testified before Judge Felix B. Mintu.</p>

<p class="BODY">The version of the prosecution is summarized by the trial court
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sometime in the evening of February 7, 1991 at about 11:30,
Pat. Arturo Buenaobra, 36 years old, married, a policeman, WPD and presently
residing at 969 N. Dagupan St., Tondo, Manila, acting as a poseur buyer together
with three other policemen, namely: Cpl. Cueto, Lumboy and Blanco conducted a
police buy bust operation somewhere along Prudencia St., Tondo, Manila.  The buy bust operation was conceived because
of several reports received by the Chief Narcotics Section of an alleged
selling of drugs at Prudencia St., near corner Coral (tsn, July 31, 1991, p.
4).  He conducted a surveillance to
verify the veracity of the information.  He went to the area and asked a friend who was residing near the
residence of the accused at Coral St., Tondo, Manila, about the information
they received (tsn, ibid, p. 4).  The
result of his surveillance confirms the report that the accused Doray, real name
Rhodora Sulit was found out to be positive selling prohibited drugs (tsn, ibid,
6).  With the confirmation and veracity
of the information, he reported back to his Chief, Lt. Jack Luna, Chief of the
Narcotics Section, WPD, whereupon the latter organized a team led by Cpl.
Cueto, Blanco, Lumboy and himself (tsn, ibid, p. 7) to conduct a buy bust
operation.  A briefing was conducted by
Cueto regarding the buy bust operation (tsn, ibid, p. 7).  At the briefing, Lt. Jack Luna handed down
to Cueto a P100.00 bill to be used in buying shabu.  Cueto marked the bill by putting up the initial 'NRC' (Exh.
D).  After Cueto marked the bill, he
gave the bill to him and they proceeded to the target area (tsn, ibid, pp.
8-9).  At about 11:20 in the evening of
February 7, 1991, he and a civilian informant proceeded to the residence of the
accused Doray while Cueto and his companions were hiding themselves from a
place where they could actually see the buying of the shabu (tsn, ibid, p.
9).  He and the civilian informant
proceeded to the place at house no. 1529 Prudencia St., Tondo, Manila, where
they saw accused Doray standing infront of her house (tsn, ibid, p. 9).  Upon seeing Doray, they approached her and
told her that he would like to buy P100.00 worth of shabu and gave Doray the
P100.00 without further introduction (tsn, ibid, pp. 9­-10).  After he gave the P100.00 to Doray, the
latter went inside her house and in a few seconds, Doray came back and gave him
one deck of shabu (Exh. B-a marked "x").  Doray, sensing that the buyer was a policeman, immediately
entered her house prompting the police poseur buyer Pat. Buenaobra to chase her
and once inside the residence of the accused, two male persons in the names of
Lacanilao and Ricardo Garcia were found (tsn, ibid, p. 10).  Rodolfo Lacanilao was sitting and holding an
aluminum foil while beside Ricardo Garcia who was also sitting, a black wallet
was found by Cpl. Cueto (tsn, ibid, p. 11).  Cpl. Cueto opened the wallet infront of Ricardo Garcia and found inside
the wallet one stick of marijuana (Exh. B-a-2) and several pieces of papers and
written on them the name Ricardo Garcia (tsn, ibid, p. 11).  The aluminum foil (Exh. B-a-1) held by
Rodolfo Lacanilao was taken by Cpl. Cueto.  He was just infront of Cpl. Cueto when the same was taken (witness
identifying all the accused inside the Courtroom).  After Cpl. Cueto found the marijuana stick from Garcia, the
aluminum foil from Rodolfo Lacanilao, Doray, Garcia and Lacanilao were brought
to the police headquarters, Narcotics Section (tsn, ibid, p. 14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Witness Buenaobra further testified that all the specimens found in
the persons of the accused Sulit, Garcia and Lacanilao (Exhs. B-a, B-a-1 and
B-a-2) thru Pat. Miranda, were examined by the NBI forensic chemist and found
to be positive for marijuana and methamphetamine hydrochloride (tsn, ibid, p.
14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On cross-examination, witness Buenaobra further testified to the
effect that previous to the buy bust operation, he does not know the accused
Rhodora Sulit @ Doray but knew her identification, her exact address and the
place where she operates (tsn, ibid, p. 18).  He was able to buy the prohibited drug from Doray because she is the
only Doray who lives in the place and she fits the exact description given to
him (tsn, ibid, p. 18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On further questioning by the Court regarding the other accused
Rodolfo Loza who was allegedly outside the house of Doray standing a few meters
away while watching and acting suspiciously during the buy bust operation, when
frisked by Blanco was found in his pant's pocket a deck of shabu (tsn, ibid,
pp. 23-14)."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the trial court observed that the
accused-appellant did not testify and, relying on the testimony of Pat.
Buenaobra, ruled that "there is no doubt ... that Rhodora Sulit sold to
Pat. Buenaobra a deck of shabu (Exh. B-a) on that particular evening of
February 7, 1991.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the accused-appellant's co-accused, Rodolfo Lacanilao,
it held that there is "a serious doubt" as to his participation
because although Pat. Buenaobra testified that Lacanilao was found
"holding an aluminum foil" with shabu, the aluminum foil is nowhere
to be found.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It<span style=""> </span>therefore acquitted him.  And, as earlier mentioned, it also acquitted
accused Rodolfo Loza in Criminal Case No. 91-91512 and Ricardo Garcia in <span style="">Criminal Case No. 91-91513.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant immediately filed her notice of appeal and
in her Appellant's Brief<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
filed with us through her counsel <i><span style="">de
oficio, </span></i>Atty. Yolanda M. Eleazar, alleges that the trial court
erred:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">“I</p>

<p class="BODY">In support thereof, the accused-appellant maintains that the
circumstances surrounding the alleged sale are contrary to human experience for
it is unbelievable that she would sell shabu to Pat. Buenaobra, a total str<span style="">a</span>nger, who allegedly handed to her a <span style="">P100 bill without further introduction; that
the filing of the information against her was the result of an unsuccessful
attempt at extortion; that even assuming that shabu and marijuana were indeed
found in the premises, these were inadmissible in evidence as being the fruits
of an unlawful search, for the prosecution admitted at the pre-trial that the
peace officers who allegedly seized the dangerous drugs had no search warrant
or warrant of arrest; and that the decision in question contains neither
findings of fact and law nor reasons and evidence to support such findings and
is therefore a nullity and open to direct attack, citing </span><i><span style="">Air France vs. Carrascoso.</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

State urges us to sustain the conviction of the accused-appellant but
recommends the reduction of the penalty from life imprisonment to <i><span style="">"prision correccional </span></i>to <i><span style="">reclusion perpetua </span></i>in its medium
period or a penalty of imprisonment ranging from six (6) years of <i><span style="">prision correccional </span></i><span style="">as </span>minimum to twelve (12) years of <i><span style="">prision mayor </span></i>as maximum" in
view of the latest amendments introduced by R.A. No. 7659, to Sections 15 and
20 of R.A. No. 6425, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed at the outset that the trial court gravely
erred in declaring that the accused-appellant "did not testify and present
evidence in her behalf."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a> The
fact is she did on 22 August 1991 before Judge Felix B. Mintu<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
and she was extensively cross-examined by Fiscal Armando Velasco.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
According to her, at about 11:30 p.m. of 7 February 1991, she was in her
residence together with Roberto Lacanilao, Ricardo Garcia, and one Remedios.
While her companions were conversing and she was changing her clothes, somebody
knocked at the door and after Ricardo opened it, four policemen suddenly barged
into her house and searched them.  One
of them, Pat. Buenaobra, touched her breast and her waist.  Nothing was taken from her or her
companions.  The policemen then brought
them to the police headquarters where they were investigated.  She further declared that it is not true
that there was a buy-bust operation; Pat. Buenaobra did not buy anything from
her nor give her P100.00.  At the police
headquarters and at the City Jail, he demanded money from her on the assurance
that no case will be filed against her, but she told him that she has nothing
to give.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court forgot that the accused-appellant had
testified.  This could be due to the
fact that the judge who rendered and promulgated the decision, Judge Ildefonso
E. Gascon, was not the one who tried the case.  Criminal Cases Nos. 91-91511, 91-91512, and 91-91513 were assigned to
him, as Assisting Judge, after all the witnesses of the parties had
testified.  His assessment on the
credibility of the witnesses must thus be received with caution since he
neither personally heard the testimonies of the witnesses nor observed their
deportment and manner of testifying.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> Just
like this Court in this appeal, Judge Gascon had nothing before him except the
documentary exhibits and the transcripts of the stenographic notes of the
testimonies -- which were apparently not complete since he explicitly declared
that the accused-appellant did not testify.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant's imputation of attempted extortion was not
rebutted by Pat. Buenaobra or by any member of the alleged buy-bust team.  The records also disclose that although the
alleged buy-bust operation was conducted in the evening of 7 February 1991, the
information, which was prepared after an <i>"ex­-parte </i>investigation,"
presumably pursuant to Section 7, Rule 112 of the Rules of Court, was filed in
court only on 12 February 1991.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if the testimony of the accused-appellant were to be
disregarded because it does not command faith and credit, we find, nevertheless,
the story of Pat. Buenaobra to be no less unworthy of faith and credit.  This is the inevitable conclusion to which
we are drawn after a careful evaluation of his testimony.  Accordingly, the presumption of innocence
which the Constitution guarantees the accused-appellant has remained
untarnished in this case for want of proof to the contrary.  It is safely entrenched in our jurisprudence
that unless the prosecution discharges its burden to prove the guilt of an
accused beyond reasonable doubt, the latter need not even offer evidence in his
behalf.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Acquittal then of the accused-appellant is in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some of the critical aspects of Pat. Buenaobra's testimony cast
serious doubts on the occurrence of a buy-bust operation.  For one, conspicuously absent in his
testimony is a narration of how he was able to recover possession of the
alleged marked P100 bill.  According to
him, upon seeing the accused-appellant in front of her house, he told her that
he "would like to buy P100<span style=""> </span>deck
of shabu" and then he gave the P100<span style="">
</span>bill to her.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, she went inside her house and when she returned, she gave him
"a deck of shabu."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
However, when "she realized that she was transacting the sale with a
police officer, she left and entered the house." He "immediately
followed her."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Clearly then from his testimony, Pat. Buenaobra was no longer in possession of
the marked money when the shabu was allegedly delivered to him.  He made no further testimony that at any
time after he allegedly received the shabu from the accused-appellant he was
able to recover from her the marked money.  Yet, he was in possession of what he claimed to be the marked money when
he testified in court; he produced it -- it was forthwith marked as Exhibit
"D" -- when asked who gave it to him during the conference
immediately preceding the so-called buy-bust operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
At the pre-trial of the case, although the prosecution requested the marking of
its other exhibits, it did not mention the marked money.  We are inclined to believe that the alleged
marked money had always been in the possession of Pat. Buenaobra.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then too, whether it was shabu or marijuana which Pat. Buenaobra
retrieved from the accused-appellant is unclear from his testimony.  On direct examination, he mentioned shabu
allegedly contained in a foil.  Yet, on
cross-examination, he explicitly clarified that what she handed to him was
marijuana.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
Doray<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">In another portion of his cross-examination, Pat. Buenaobra
further clarified that his informant had told him that Doray was selling <u>marijuana</u>
or <u>prohibited</u> drugs.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
the informant does [sic] not tell you anybody was selling <u><span style="">marijuana</span></u> except for Doray, is that
correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">  Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Why
did you include and search Lacanilao when he was not included in the
information that you received?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to telephone
information it was only Doray who was selling prohibited drug.”<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Marijuana is a prohibited drug.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
Methamphetamine hydrochloride or shabu is a regulated drug.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also, in the pre-trial, as disclosed in the Pre-Trial Order,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
"the accused admits that Exhibit B-A-1 and Exh. B-A-2 the specimens for
Crim. Case No. 91-91511, 91-91512 and 91-91513 respectively when examined were
found to be positive of Methamphetamine Hydro Chloride." On direct
examination, however, Pat. Buenaobra declared that the foil marked as <u>Exhibit</u>
<u>B-a</u> was the one he allegedly recovered from the accused-appellant.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
about the shabu which you said was given to you by accused Doray?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This aluminum foil

<p class="BODY">Finally, if indeed Pat. Buenaobra was the poseur-buyer in this
case, we find it hard to believe that when the accused-appellant allegedly
handed to him the deck of shabu and he received it, he did not immediately
arrest her.  She was still able to
re-enter her house.</p>
