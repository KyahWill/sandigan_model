				<H3>TEODORO B. PANGILINAN, PETITIONER, VS.
GUILLERMO T. MAGLAYA, THE EXECUTIVE SECRETARY, SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner complains that he has been removed from office
without due process and just cause in disregard of his constitutional security
of tenure.  Worse, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">his </span>removal was made in bad faith,
immediately after his expose of certain anomalies in which his superiors were
involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Teodoro B. Pangilinan joined the government service on July 18,
1966, when he was appointed agent in the National Bureau of Investigation, a
position for which he had the appropriate civil service eligibility.  He had risen to Supervising Agent when he
resigned to accept appointment as Executive Director of the Land Transportation
Office on July 8, 1987.  He assumed
office on July 16, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner says that from February 19, 1988 to November 30,
1988, he was detailed to the Manila International Airport Authority, where he
served as Assistant General Manager in charge of finance and administration and
also of security and general services.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon his return to the LTO, he was designated as Resident
Ombudsman in addition to his regular duties.  As such, he discovered, among other anomalies, irregularities in the
purchase of motor vehicle license plates.  The license plates ordered were not reflective as required by P.D. 98
and B.P. 43.  He says he brought this
matter to the attention of Asst. Secretary Manuel Sabalza of the Department of
Transportation and Communications and later of Secretary Pete Prado.  Neither of them took any action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 27, 1991, the petitioner called a press conference
to expose what the media later described as "the license plate mess."
He also announced his intention to file graft charges with the Ombudsman
against Prado, Sabalza and Undersecretary Jose Valdecañas, also of the DOTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, Secretary Prado relieved Pangilinan as Executive
Director of the LTO and replaced him with Guillermo Maglaya as
officer-in-charge.  However, the
petitioner continued receiving his salary (although his allowances were
withheld) until December 31, 1991.  When
he asked why his pay had been discontinued, he was informed by Asst. Secretary
Juan V. Borra, Jr. that Maglaya had already been designated as Acting Executive
Director of the LTO.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, Pangilinan prays for reinstatement on the
ground that no charge has been filed or proved against him to justify his
removal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Required to comment, the Solicitor General argues that Pangilinan
was validly separated because he was appointed to the disputed position in an
acting capacity only.  He does not
possess the qualifications prescribed for the office of Executive Director of
the LTO, which is a career executive service position for which only a career
executive service official is eligible.  The petitioner is not a career executive service official.  Hence, he could not be, and was not,
extended a permanent appointment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The public respondents cite Sec. 5(1) of P.D. 807 which provides
that membership in the career executive service requires:</p>

<blockquote>(i)  that the official must
be included in the register of career executive eligibles; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(ii) that the official must have been appointed to an appropriate
class in the Career Executive Service.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Augusto B. Araneta, who was later designated to
replace Maglaya, submitted the following certification from the Executive
Director of the Career Executive Service Board:<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">CERTIFICATION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>This is to certify that the position of Executive Director in the
Land Transportation Office, Department of Transportation and Communications is
classified as a position belonging to the Career Executive Service (CES).  This is to certify further that per records
of the Career Executive Service Board (CESB), MR. TEODORO B. PANGILINAN, former
Executive Director of said office is not a CES eligible, and was not appointed
to a rank in the CES.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This certification is issued upon the request of Atty. Augusto B.
Araneta for whatever purpose it may serve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Sgd.)  ELMOR D. JURIDICO</blockquote>

<blockquote>Executive Director</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondents also invoke the case of Achacoso v. Macaraig,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>It is settled that a permanent appointment can be issued only
"to a person who meets all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the
requirements </span>for the position to which he is being appointed, including
the appropriate eligibility prescribed." Achacoso did not.  At best, therefore, his appointment could be
regarded only as temporary.  And being
so, it could be withdrawn at will by the appointing authority and "at a
moment's notice," conformably to established jurisprudence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The mere fact that a position belongs to the Career Service does
not automatically confer security of tenure on its occupant even if he does not
possess the required qualifications.  Such right will have to depend on the nature of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">his </span>appointment, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">which </span>in
turn depends on his eligibility or lack of it.  A person who does not have the requisite qualifications for the position
cannot be appointed to it in the first place, or, only as an exception to the
rule, may be appointed to it merely in an acting capacity in the absence of
appropriate eligibles.  The appointment
extended to him cannot be regarded as permanent even if it may be so
designated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The purpose of an acting or temporary appointment is to prevent a
hiatus in the discharge of official functions by authorizing a person to
discharge the same pending the selection of a permanent or another
appointee.  The person named in an
acting capacity accepts the position under the condition that he shall
surrender the office once he is called upon to do so by the appointing
authority.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his reply, Pangilinan submits that the Achacoso case is not
applicable because the petitioner therein was, to begin with, not a civil
service eligible.  The petitioner says
he is, having passed the board examination for certified public accountants.  He also argues that his appointment must be
likened to the provisional appointment under the old Civil Service Act before
it was replaced by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">P.D. 807.  The
provisional appointment enjoyed security of tenure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pangilinan adds that even on the assumption that his appointment
was not permanent, his separation must still be for a valid cause because
Article IX-B, Section 2(3), of the Constitution applies to all officers and
employees in the civil service without distinction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Invoking the case of Gray v. De Vera,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt"> </span>Pangilinan likens himself to the
petitioner therein who was summarily <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">relieved
when, as the board secretary of the People's Homesite and Housing Corporation,
he sent a telegram to the President of the Philippines imputing irregularities
to the directors.  His separation also
came the following day.  Although Gray
was holding a primarily confidential position </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">without any fixed term, this Court
ordered his reinstatement.  We held that
he had been denied procedural due process and there was no valid cause for his
removal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Also cited by the petitioner are Cariño v. ACCFA,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Floreza v. Ongpin<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
and Jocom v. Robredo (not Regalado),<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> in
all of which cases the security of tenure of the dismissed employees was
upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner raises a new issue, to wit, that even if he were
considered only an acting appointee, he nevertheless could not be replaced
except by a person possessing the required qualifications, as required by PD
807.  He has produced certifications,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
also from the Executive Director of the Career Executive Service Board, that
neither Guillermo T. Maglaya nor Augusto B. Araneta is a CES eligible or a
career executive service officer.  He <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">also
argues, belatedly too, that as a presidential appointee, he could be replaced
only by the President of the Philippines and not by only the Secretary of
Transportation and Communications.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As required by the Court, the respondents have submitted a
Compliance manifesting that Juan A. Magarro, Jr., the new appointee to the
position of Executive Director of the LTO (replacing Guillermo Maglaya and
Antonio B. Araneta) possesses the prescribed qualifications for the office.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">They repeat that the applicable case is Achacoso, not Gray.  Gray was extended a permanent appointment
whereas Achacoso, like Pangilinan, could be appointed only in an acting
capacity for lack of the prescribed qualifications for the office.</p>

<p class="BODY">We must hold for the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gray and the other cases cited by the petitioner involved
permanent appointees who therefore had security of tenure.  Pangilinan was only an acting appointee
because he did not have the requisite qualifications; as such, he could not
claim security of tenure.  This Court
has <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">repeatedly
held that this guaranty is available only to permanent appointees.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> The fact
that Pangilinan was qualified for his initial appointment as agent in the NBI
does not mean he was qualified for all other positions he might later occupy in
the civil service.  The law does not
prescribe uniform qualifications for all public positions regardless of nature
or degree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although Gray was holding a highly confidential position, the
Court regarded his separation as a <b>removal </b>and so applied the
constitutional prohibition against the suspension or dismissal of an officer or
member of the civil service without cause as provided by law.  That was a rather loose interpretation of
the term "dismissal," which is defined as the ouster of the incumbent
before the expiration of his term.  Subsequent decisions have made it clear that where a person holds his
position at the pleasure of a superior or subject to some supervening event,
his separation from office is not a removal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> It
is effected by the will of the superior or by the happening of the contingency,
resulting in another and different mode of terminating official relations known
as expiration of the term.</p>

<p class="BODY">Chief Justice Concepcion explained the distinction between
removal and expiration of the term in Alajar v. Alba<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, the term of respondent Alajar as Vice Mayor of
the City of Roxas <b>is not fixed by law.  </b>However, the latter, in effect,<b> vests in the President the power
to fix such term.  </b>When in November
1955, petitioner Alba was designated as Acting Vice-Mayor of said City, the
term of respondent Alba was, hereby, fixed implicitly by the President, in the
exercise of his aforementioned authority.  Thus, the <b>term </b>of office of Alajar expired and his right to hold
office was extinguished, with the same legal effect as if the <b>term </b>had
been fixed by Congress itself.  In other
words, Alajar was not removed from office, for "to remove an officer is to
oust him from office <b>before the expiration of </b>his term" (Manalang
v. Quitoriano et al., 50 Off. Gaz., 2515).  Alajar merely lost the right to hold the office of Vice-Mayor of the
City of Roxas by <b>expiration of </b>his <b>term</b> as such.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's invocation of the provisional appointment as
comparable to his position is a grasping at straws.  The provisional appointment has long been abolished and has no
legal application or effect in this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">case.  There are now only two kinds of appointment under the Administrative
Code of 1987, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>SEC. 27.  <b>Employment
Status. </b>- Appointment in the career service shall be permanent or
temporary.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(1)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]--><b>Permanent status.  </b>A
permanent appointment shall be issued to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a
</span>person who meets all the requirements for the position to which he is
being appointed, including the appropriate eligibility prescribed, in
accordance with the provisions of law, rules and standards promulgated in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">pursuance thereof.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->(2)<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]--><b>Temporary appointment.  </b>In the absence of appropriate eligibles and it becomes necessary in
the public interest to fill a vacancy, a temporary appointment shall be issued
to a person who meets all the requirements for the position to which he is
being appointed except the appropriate civil service eligibility:  <b>Provided, </b>That such temporary
appointment shall not exceed twelve months, but the appointee may be replaced
sooner if a qualified civil service eligible becomes available.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Strictly speaking, the petitioner's temporary appointment as Executive
Director of the LTO should have ended twelve months after he assumed office, or
on July 16, 1988.  From that date, his
appointment had ceased to be valid even if a qualified replacement was not yet
available and consequently had to be discontinued pursuant to the above-quoted
provision.  Indeed, even on the
assumption <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">that
his appointment could be and had been validly extended </span>beyond the
one-year limit, that extended term was nevertheless validly terminated with the
appointment of his qualified replacement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's contention that he could not be relieved by
Secretary Prado but only by the President of the Philippines is also a shot in
the da<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">r</span>k.  It has long been settled, and does not
require further elaboration here, that the acts of a Department Secretary, when
"performed and promulgated in the regular course of business" are
presumptively the acts of the President unless "disapproved or
reprobated" by him.  This doctrine
dates back to 1939, when it was first laid down by Justice Laurel in Villena v.
Secretary of the Interior,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> and
has been consistently observed since then.  Parenthetically, the petitioner's own appointment to the disputed
position was signed not by President Corazon C. Aquino but by Executive
Secretary Joker P. Arroyo.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing considerations, we hold that Pangilinan
has lost the right to the position of Executive Director of the LTO and so
cannot be reinstated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Shall the Court end here?  There is more to be said.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not difficult to see that the petitioner was replaced
because of his expose and his threat to bring charges against his
superiors.  His relief was clearly an
act of punishment if not personal vengeance.  This is not denied.  The
respondents, while invoking the law to justify his separation, have made no
effort whatsoever to justify their motives.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Gray, the Court held that the board secretary, while holding a
highly confidential position, owed his loyalty not to the board but to the
government.  In the present case,
Pangilinan was not even holding a similar position.  His continued incumbency did not depend upon his enjoyment of the
confidence of his superiors who had no personal claim to his loyalty.  In exposing what he considered the anomalies
in the DOTC, he was, like Gray, manifesting his concern for the government
whose interests he wanted to protect.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a </span>sorry
day, indeed, if a civil servant could be summarily removed from his position
for the "sin" of complaining about the irregularities of his
superiors.  This would not only impair
the integrity of the civil service but also undermine the campaign to encourage
the public, including those in the civil service, to expose and denounce
venality in government.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pangilinan's denunciation of the non-reflective license plates
was not the act of a rabble-rouser or a publicity-seeker.  The record shows that he quietly brought the
matter to the attention of his superiors, giving reasons for his
misgivings.  They took no action.  Feeling frustrated, he sought the attention
of the media and told them of his objection to the non-reflective license
plates.  He cited the laws that he
claimed had been violated.  He narrated
his efforts to prevent their violation.  He spoke of the indifference of his superiors.  In doing all these, he was exercising his right as a citizen, and
especially as a civil servant, to denounce official misconduct and improve the
public service.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not to say, of course, that Pangilinan's charges are
valid.  The Court is not prepared to do
so at this time because the evidence on this matter is not before it.  For all we know, there is a satisfactory
explanation for the attitude of his superiors; it is possible that it is
Pangilinan who has misinterpreted the law or misread the facts.  But true or not, the charges <b>per se</b>,
and standing alone, could not be the basis of Pangilinan's swift and summary
replacement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pangilinan was separated the day immediately following his press
conference.  The Court sees the action
as a retaliation.  The public
respondents say they were merely terminating his incumbency in accordance with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">existing
law.  The Court sees that termination as
a punishment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under the expanded definition of judicial power in Article VIII,
Section 1, of the Constitution, the Court can declare the acts of the public
respondents as tainted with grave abuse of discretion and therefore invalid.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it is not as simple as that.  The obstinate fact is that, regardless of the motives of his superiors,
Pangilinan no longer had any right to the disputed position when he was
separated from it in 1991.  He ceased to
be entitled to it in 1988 upon the lapse of the maximum period for his acting
appointment.  Obviously, he is not
entitled to it now.  Even if it be
supposed that the public respondents acted maliciously when they relieved him
in 1991, his reinstatement is still not possible under the law as it now
stands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner warns that the dismissal of his petition would
open the door to the summary separation of civil servants to the prejudice of
the integrity and independence of the civil service.  He claims that "there are about 2,067 CESO positions in the
entire Philippine civil service.  Of
this number only 372 or about 18% are occupied by Career Executive Service
eligibles."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The rest may be summarily separated as acting appointees and are therefore
subject to the whims of their superiors.  He suggests that "a ruling by this Honorable Court that would
sustain the position of petitioner would go a long way toward the upliftment of
the morale of the ‘ineligibles.’"</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming that the petitioner's statistics are correct, the Court
can only share his trepidation.  We can
do no more.  As judges, we can only
interpret and apply the law and, despite our doubts about its wisdom, cannot
repeal or amend it.  In the case at bar,
we have no power to give the petitioner the qualifications he does not
possess.  Qualifications for public officers
are prescribed by the Constitution or the law, or even by implementing regulations,
but not by the decisions of courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The problem posed by the petitioner is a serious threat to the
integrity and independence of the civil service.  As demonstrated in this case, the doctrine announced in Achacoso
may be used to muzzle and punish legitimate complaint and even to persecute
"difficult" subordinates.  That doctrine, let it be stressed, is only an interpretation and
application by the Court of the law as enacted by the legislative and
implemented by the executive.  That
doctrine can change only if the laws and regulations on which it was based are
also changed, not by this Court but by the political departments.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Javier v. Commission on Elections,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

we said:</p>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court is not only the highest arbiter of legal
questions but also the conscience of the government.  The citizen comes to us in quest of law but we must also give him
justice.  The two are not always the
same.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed they are not, and sadly so for the petitioner.  For ironically, the law he invokes for the
protection of his right has instead denied him the justice he seeks and
deserves.  This emphasizes, no less
sadly, the fallacy that for every legal wrong there is a judicial remedy.  Untrue, unfortunately.  The Court is not a panacea.  There are times, regrettably, when justice
is shackled by the law, and even this Court cannot break the chains.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PUNO, <i>J.</i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>p</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">onencia</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>lucidly states the facts.  Petitioner joined the government service in
1966 as an agent of the National Bureau of Investigation.  He served the NBI for about twenty (20)
years and slowly rose to the position of Supervising Agent.  After the EDSA revolution, he was appointed
as Executive Director of the Land Transportation Office on July 8, 1987, by
then Executive Secretary Joker Arroyo.  In addition, he was designated as its Resident Ombudsman.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was when petitioner seriously took <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">his </span>job as Resident Ombudsman that he got into problems.  He unearthed corruptions in his office,
including the notorious purchase of motor vehicle non-reflective license
plates.  Feeling he will get the
attentive ear of his superiors, he called their attention to the stinking
mess.  He was given the sphinx
treatment.  Petitioner, however, was the
crusading kind.  He did not give up and
on September 27, 1991, he called a press conference and blew the whistle on
what the press denounced as the license plate mess.  He threatened to file graft charges against his own
superiors:  Secretary Pete Nicomedes
Prado, Undersecretary Jose Valdecanas and Asst. Secretary Manuel Sabalza of the
Department of Transportation and Communications.  The retaliation against petitioner was, however, swift and
severe.  The day after his expose, he
was <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">unceremoniously relieved
by Secretary Prado who designated Atty. Guillermo Maglaya as officer-in-charge </span>of
the office.  Petitioner was merely
allowed to receive his salary but minus allowances but even that privilege was
to last only until December 31, 1991.  Thereafter, even his salary was stopped and he was informed that Atty.
Maglaya has already been designated as Acting Executive Director of the LTO.</p>

<p class="BODY">Haste breeds errors.  In
their desire to eliminate petitioner at once, respondents filled up his
position with ineligibles.  Atty.
Maglaya turned out to be not a "CES eligible" nor a "Career
Service Executive Officer." He was changed by Augusto B. Araneta, Jr., who
was no better.  Araneta was also neither
a "CES eligible" nor a "Career Service Executive Officer."
The search for a qualified person ended with the appointment of Juan A. Magano
to the same position.  Rightfully, the <u>ponencia</u>
branded the termination of petitioner as a "punishment".  Regrettably, however, it dismissed the
petitioner on the ground that as an acting official with no eligibility,
petitioner has no right to security of tenure.</p>

<p class="BODY">With due deference, it is my submittal that the <u>ponencia</u>
has unduly focused on the lack of security of tenure of the petitioner.  To my mind, however, the issue is whether
the petitioner has been the subject of intentional, malicious and wrongful acts
which ought to be proscribed.  If the
petitioner is such a victim, it is not material that he does not enjoy security
of tenure.  The end-result of the <u>ponencia</u>
is unfortunate for it offers no succor to a public official who was wantonly
terminated from office not for doing bad but ironically for doing good to the
government.  Here is petitioner who
could well be a role model for other government officials.  He faithfully discharged his duties as
Acting Executive Director of the LTO.  As its resident ombudsman, he displayed rare courage by exposing in
public and in print the license plate mess allegedly involving no less than his
top superior, former Secretary Prado.  While promoting honesty and integrity in the public service, petitioner
was stopped, divested of his office using as convenient cover his status as a
temporary official.  The result is
undoubtedly inequitous, yet the <u>ponencia</u> posits the disquieting
proposition that this is a case "when <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">justice is shackled by the law and even this Court </span>cannot
break the chains."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is my humble submission that these shackles are more of straws
which this Court can break off.  For
even granting that petitioner is merely an acting Executive Officer of the LTO,
he enjoys certain rights which cannot be violated because they are protected by
the laws of the land.  For instance,
even as an acting official he cannot be denied his constitutional right to due
process and equal protection of the laws and his statutory right to be treated
with justice, honesty and good faith by his superior officials.  These protected rights were in no way waived
or diminished by his acceptance of a government job in an acting or temporary
capacity.  There is no law that gives a
license to abuse a government official just because he has no security of
tenure.  When such injustices and abuses
are perpetrated, said official has a right to their immediate abatement and it
is the unavoidable duty of this Court to check-off their continuance.  In taking this suggested stance, this Court
will not be ruling that petitioner has security of tenure to his office for it
is conceded that the law grants him none.  The ruling merely recognizes the right of petitioner to be protected
from certain illegal acts even if he is an acting official; it will go no further
than to hold that the temporary nature of one's employment cannot be misused to
frustrate good government.  If the
annulment of the illegal acts will lead to petitioner's reinstatement for a
short while, the benefit is incidental and ought to be allowed.  Again, his reinstatement is not a recognition
of his irremovability for he may later be terminated in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">With due respect, I shudder at the mischiefs that may flow from
the <u>ponencia</u>.  Appointments in
acting capacity may be preferred to be extended by the unscrupulous for they
know that they possess the sword of Damocles over these kind of appointees as
they can be removed under the pretext that they have no security of
tenure.  The making of this mischief
could not have been intended by our civil service laws, rules and regulations.  It is self-evident that these civil service
laws, rules and regulations that classify government officials into permanent
and temporary have one objective and that is, the promotion of good government.  To interpret them in a manner that will not enhance
our efforts to establish good government is to ignore this noble intent.</p>

<p class="BODY">In order to vindicate the right of the petitioner, I do not
consider the later appointment of Juan Magano as an insuperable obstacle.  It is evident that this appointment is part
of the malicious machination to remove petitioner by fair and foul method.  The malice of respondents exhibited itself
when they relieved petitioner on the pretense he has no eligibility and yet
recklessly appointed to the same position, Messrs. Maglaya and Araneta, who
were equally ineligible.  It is plain
that they removed petitioner not to strengthen the civil service with better
qualified officials but to perpetrate an act of vendetta.  When they realized their recklessness, they
appointed Magano to legalize the illegal.  I submit that Magano cannot profit from the fruits of this crude
cover-up.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, I vote to grant the petition and to annul the dismissal
of petitioner because it will enhance the State policy "to maintain
honesty and integrity in the public service and take positive and effective
measures against graft and corruption (Art. II, sec. 221 the Constitution); it
will give more life to the postulate that a "public office is a public
trust.  Public officers and employees
must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost
responsibility, integrity, loyalty and efficiency, act with patriotism and
justice" (Art XI, sec. 1 of the Constitution); and hopefully, it will
frustrate the misuse of our civil service rule on security of tenure to promote
bad government.</p>
