"People of the Philippines vs. Ariel </span>Limbauan alias Acio, Leonor

<blockquote>'That on or about the 14th day of December, 1986, in the
Municipality of Delfin Albano, province of Isabela, Philippines, and within the
jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the herein accused, all armed with
assorted firearms, conspiring and confederating together and all helping one

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, Ariel Limbauan entered a plea of guilty; the
rest of the accused pleaded not guilty.  In the course of the trial, the case against accused Alfonso Laman and
Eliseo Sanchez was dismissed on 29 June 1988 on motion of the prosecution in
view of the demise of the said accused as shown in their death certificates.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
After the trial of the case, the trial court rendered the now appealed decision
of 26 March 1991.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the judgment of conviction, only accused Leonor Tamang has
appealed, alleging that:</p>

<blockquote>"THE COURT <i>A QUO</i>
GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING ACCUSED-APPELLANT LEONOR TAMANG OF THE COMPLEX
CRIME OF ROBBERY IN BAND WITH RAPE INSTEAD OF ROBBERY IN BAND ONLY."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant submits that he is guilty of robbery in band but not of
the complex crime of robbery with rape as charged.  He maintains that the mere fact that he brought Elisa Austria
downstairs and upon reaching the ground floor of the house, Ariel Limbauan took
hold of Elisa and forced her to go with him outside said house of Marcela
Bacani, where Limbauan raped her, does not prove that he (appellant) conspired
with Limbauan in the rape of Elisa Austria.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant claims that his purpose in forcing Elisa to go
downstairs was for her to join the others on the ground floor but not to turn
her over to Limbauan.  In support of his
claim, appellant refers to the testimony of Marcela Bacani who, on
cross-examination, declared that Elisa was beside her when Limbauan forcibly
brought Elisa outside the house to rape her.  This assertion of appellant clearly lacks merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the testimony of Elisa Austria, she referred to one Renzi
Bacani, daughter of Marcela Bacani, who was inside the room where she (Elisa)
was sleeping.  When appellant entered <span style="">the room, he could not have missed seeing
Renzi together with Elisa inside the room.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> If, as appellant claims, his purpose in
forcing Elisa Austria to go downstairs was for her to join the others on the
ground floor, why did he pick on Elisa only and leave Renzi inside the room
upstairs?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching the living room on the ground floor, appellant
handed Elisa Austria over to Ariel Limbauan who forcibly took her outside the
house and brought her to the banana grove to rape her.  Elisa's testimony, both during direct and
cross examinations, shows how appellant forced her out of the room and handed
her over to Ariel Limbauan.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the statement (Exh. "E") given by Elisa
Austria before the investigating officer on 15 December 1986, a few hours after
the incident happened, states unequivocably the participation of appellant in
the commission of the felony.</p>

positively pointing to Leonor Tamang as the person who helped and aided Ariel Limbauan
in committing the felony.  We quote with
approval the finding of the trial court that -</p>
