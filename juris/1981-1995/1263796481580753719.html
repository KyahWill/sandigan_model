				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue litigated in this case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">is </span>whether the municipal court has jurisdiction over <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span>forcible entry and <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case involving agricultural tenants.</p>

<p class="BODY">A complaint for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, with prayer
for temporary, restraining order, dated <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="6">June
 5, 1982</st1:date>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was filed </span>by
private respondents Roberto <span class="SpellE">Padios</span>, et al., as
plaintiffs, and petitioners Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Sorioso</span>, et al.,
as defendants, before the municipal court of <span class="SpellE">Barotac</span>
Viejo, <st1:city><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:city>, docketed as Civil
Case No. 37.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint alleged that
plaintiffs were among nine (9) tenants of a 33-hectare parcel of land belonging
to the Philippine National Bank situated <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Barrio Vista </span><span class="SpellE">Alegre</span>, <span class="SpellE">Anilao</span>,
Iloilo, each of whom occupying and cultivating portions of the land ranging
from 4.5 hectares to 3/4 hectares in area, aggregating a total of 20 hectares,
more or less, devoted to rice and corn; that their possession of the area
claimed by them were recognized and sanctioned by an order of the Court of
Agrarian Relations of Iloilo in CAR Cases Nos. 4046, 4107-4117; that sometime
in April 1982, the defendants by means of force and intimidation forcibly
dispossessed plaintiffs of the areas cultivated by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On June, 1982, the municipal court issued an
ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> temporary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">restraining order, enjoining the defendants from interfering and
disturbing the peaceful possession of their respective areas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On June 17, 1982, the defendants filed a
motion to dismiss on the ground that the case involved agricultural tenancy and
therefore not within the jurisdiction of the municipal court, and that a case
was pending before the Court of Agrarian Relations involving the same subject
matter, the same parties and issues, the very case cited by plaintiffs in their
complaint; defendants further prayed for the dissolution of the temporary
restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On July 29, 1982, the
municipal court ordered the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">complaint
temporarily dismissed a lifted the temporary restraining order, but on motion </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of the plaintiffs
the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">court on August 2, 1982
reconsidered <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">said order and </span>reinstated
the complaint together with the temporary restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the defendants filed the instant
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition and injunction with
prayer for temporary restraining order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On </span><st1:date year="1982" day="6" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">December 6, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, the petition was given due course and the
parties required to submit simultaneous memoranda.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The fact that the parties are agricultural tenants is not disputed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact, private respondents are
the plaintiffs in a case pending before the Court of Agrarian Relations of
Iloilo, docketed as CAR Cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Nos. </span>4046,
4107-4117, Iloilo-1979, entitled "Roberto <span class="SpellE">Padios</span>,
et al. vs. Philippine National Bank," in which the petitioners herein were
allowed to intervene <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>parties <span class="SpellE">intervenors</span>, having been adjudged bona fide tenants <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the same land in CAR Case No. 4048.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This being so, the Court of Agrarian
Relations has exclusive and original jurisdiction to take cognizance of and to
try the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as correctly
pointed out by petitioners, Section 1 of Rule 70 of the Rules of Court
explicitly provides that said rule shall not apply to cases covered by the
Agricultural Tenancy Act.</p>

questioned Order of the respondent municipal court and order said court to
desist from entertaining the complaint </span>filed by private respondents,
docketed as Civil Case No. 37.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against private respondents.</span></p>
