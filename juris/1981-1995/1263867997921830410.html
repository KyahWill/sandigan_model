				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1989</st1:date>,
the brothers, Jimmy and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>,
were charged with murder in <span class="GramE">an information</span> filed by
the Provincial Prosecutor of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, docketed as
Criminal Case <span style="">No. </span>5753 of the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about May 7, 1988 at midnight thereof, at <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Sirang</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Panique</span>,
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Aroroy</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-named accused with intent to kill, evident
premeditation and treachery, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously conspiring and helping each other, attack, <span class="GramE">assault</span>, box and stab with a knife one Ely <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span>, hitting the latter on the different parts of the
body, thereby inflicting wounds which directly caused his death.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law."</span> <span class="GramE">(p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>, assisted by counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>, entered a plea of "not guilty."
Trial ensued <span style="">only </span>against him,
because his co-accused, Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>, was, and still
is, at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="5">May 7,
 1988</st1:date>, a benefit dance was held in the dance hall at the public
plaza in <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Sirang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Panique</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aroroy</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Masbate</span></span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dance was managed by Roberto <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> who <span style="">was </span>president
of the affair.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the benefit dance was going on, Ely <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>, and Jimmy
<span class="SpellE">Laurio</span> drank beer "<span class="SpellE">grande</span>"
at a corner store near the plaza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
the three decided to retire, they offered <span style="">a
last </span>drink to Roberto <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span>, who accepted
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Shortly after eleven o'clock in the
evening, they asked permission to leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>
After the three had departed, <span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> went to the
comfort room about ten meters away.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While he was there, he saw <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span> suddenly box Ely <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span>
on the right jaw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The blow caused <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span> to fall on the ground.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instantly, Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>
plunged h<span style="">is </span>hand knuckle with a
protruding blade three times into <span class="SpellE">Banculo's</span> body as
he lay on the ground, wounding him on the right nipple, on the back, and in the
right armpit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the place of the scuffle was well-lighted by a fluorescent
lamp on a nearby coconut tree, <span class="SpellE">Dominador's</span> neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Andiolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Esquilona</span>, who chanced to
be passing by, witnessed the stabbing of <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span> by
Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After rendering <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span> prostrate, the <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span> brothers fled.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> reported the incident to the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain, who went after the <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>
brothers straightaway.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> was arrested, but his brother Jimmy went into
hiding and has remained at large.</p>

<p class="BODY">Someone informed <span class="SpellE">Banculo's</span> wife, Delia,
about the stabbing of her husband.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
rushed to the scene of the crime in time for her husband to inform her that he
was stabbed by Jimmy and <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Banculo</span> was brought to the Atlas Clinic
for emergency treatment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards, he
was moved to the clinic of Dr. Corpus, where he remained for two days and two
nights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As his condition worsened, upon
the advice of Dr. Corpus himself, <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span> was
transferred to the <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> Provincial Hospital where
he underwent an operation in the lungs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, infection had already set in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He died of cardio-pulmonary arrest secondary
to septicemia with severe <span class="SpellE">hemothorax</span>, secondary to
stab wounds, chest anterior (Dr. Enrique O. <span class="SpellE">Legaspi's</span>
Certification-<span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> Provincial Hospital).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated July 24, 1990, the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> (Br. 45) found <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span> guilty beyond reasonable doubt of murder and
sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
and to pay indemnity in the amount of P30,000 to the heirs of the victim, Ely <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span>, plus costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">He has appealed that decision, alleging that the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>erred:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
finding that he conspired with his brother, Jimmy, and employed treachery in
killing the victim; and</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
giving full credit to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses despite
material inconsistencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a basic principle of constitutional law that the accused
shall be presumed innocent until the contrary is proven beyond reasonable
doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lacking such certainty, the trial
court has the duty to render a verdict of acquittal (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Macasinag</span>, 173 SCRA 292).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same degree of proof necessary to establish the crime is required <span style="">to </span>establish a criminal conspiracy
(People vs. <span class="SpellE">Drilon</span>, Jr., 123 SCRA <span style="">72).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It
cannot be established by conjectures but by positive and conclusive evidence
(People vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Martinez</st1:place></st1:city>, 127 SCRA
260).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conspiracy may be inferred from
the circumstances attending the commission of the crime, but, like any other
ingredient of the offense, it must be established by clear and convincing
evidence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Agda</span>, 111 SCRA 330).</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence in this case shows only that the appellant, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>, and the
deceased quarreled over a woman and that they had a fist fight.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In anger, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
boxed <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span> on the jaw.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His brother, Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>,
immediately jumped into the fray by stabbing <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span>
in different parts of the body and inflicting wounds which caused his
death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence that the
brothers had conspired to kill <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span> or that <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> had foreknowledge of what Jimmy (who apparently
had no score to settle with <span class="SpellE">Banculo</span>) would do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a conspiracy between the brothers would
qualify to murder <span class="SpellE">Dominador's</span> act of boxing the
victim, but such <span style="">a </span>conspiracy
was not proven as indubitably as the homicide itself (People vs. Felix <span class="SpellE">Raquipo</span>, 188 SCRA 571).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Absent any evidence proving the gravity or duration of the physical
injury inflicted by <span class="SpellE">Dominador's</span> fist blow upon the
victim, or proof of a conspiracy of the <span class="SpellE">Laurio</span>
brothers to seriously injure or kill the victim, <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
is presumed, and should be held, liable for slight physical injuries only
(People vs. Bautista, 30 SCRA 558; Art. 266, Revised Penal Code, Vol. II, <span style="">1987 </span>Ed. by <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
pp. 603-605).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the
appealed decision is hereby modified, by finding appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span>
<span class="SpellE">Laurio</span> guilty of slight physical injuries only and
sentencing him to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for thirty (30) days of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">arresto</span></u></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>menor</u></span>, </span>with
the accessory penalties provided by law and to pay the costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he has been detained for longer than that
period, his immediate release from custody is hereby ordered, unless he is
being held to answer for some other offense or offenses.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
