<p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the 
<st1:date month="11" day="11" year="1968">November 11, 1968</st1:date> Order of 
the Court of First Instance of La Union, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>
<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING CONSIDERA­TIONS, the preliminary 
injunction already issued is made permanent and the defendants are enjoined not 
to prevent the plaintiff from getting sand and gravel from barrio <span class="SpellE">Nalvo</span> Norte."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The undisputed facts of this case are as follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">The Municipality of San Fernando, La Union which was 
<span>undertaking a cement road </span><span>construction </span><span>around 
its Supermarket and other municipal projects, needed sufficient gravel and sand 
from their source, </span><span>the </span><span>Municipality of 
</span><span>Luna but </span><span>its trucks sent </span><span>to 
</span><span>the latter municipality to </span>haul <span>said </span><span>road 
construction </span>materials <span>were allegedly charged unreasonable fees per 
truck load.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On March 18, 1968, the Municipality of San Fernando 
represented by its incumbent Municipal Mayor Lorenzo L. <span class="SpellE">Dacanay</span> filed a complaint for </span><span>Injunction 
</span><span>with Writ of Preliminary Injunction at the Court </span><span>of 
</span><span>First Instance of La Union against the Municipality of Luna 
</span><span>and </span><span>its offi­cials and authorized agents, praying that 
the defendants be immediately enjoined from </span><span>preventing 
</span><span>plaintiff's truck obtaining road construction materials from Luna, 
La Union and from levying unreasonable fees, and after trial to make the 
injunction permanent (Complaint "Annex A", <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 13).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On the same day the complaint was filed, the Court of First 
Instance of La Union (Branch II) issued an Order granting the Writ of 
Preliminary Injunction <em>ex-</em></span><span class="SpellE"><em>parte</em></span><span style="font-style: italic;"> 
</span><span>(Petition, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 7, "Annex", 
<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 18).<span>&nbsp; </span>On March 26, 
1968, the defendants filed their Answer wherein they averred that the license 
fees collected from the hauling of sand and gravel excavated from the 
municipality of Luna, La Union are by virtue of an ordi­nance duly approved 
</span>by <span>the Municipal Council of defendant municipality in consonance 
with its power to tax, and that the </span>fees <span>collected are reasonable, 
fair and legal.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Answer further pointed out that the remedy of 
Injunc­tion availed of is not the proper remedy.<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
</span><st1:date month="5" day="21" year="1968"><span>May 21, 
1968</span></st1:date><span>, after the issues were joined, the lower court 
issued an Order requiring the parties to submit their respective memoranda since 
the issue raised was purely a question of law.<span>&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date month="11" day="11" year="1968"><span>November 11, 1968</span></st1:date><span>, 
the lower court issued an Order making permanent the writ of preliminary 
injunction issued and further ordered the defendants not to prevent the 
plaintiff from getting sand and gravel from Barrio <span class="SpellE">Nalvo</span> Norte, a barrio of Luna, La 
Union.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span>Hence, this 
petition.</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The main issue in this case is whether or not the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span> 
of </span><st1:placename><span>Luna</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span> has

question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span>The Municipality of Luna insists on the validity of its 
Ordinance No. 1 imposing the license fees in question on the basis of its 
authority to exercise police power under Section 2238 of the Revised 
Administrative </span>Code, otherwise known as the General Welfare Clause and 
its power to levy licenses and fees for public purposes under Republic Act 2264 
(Petition, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 10) and justifies the 
inclusion of the Municipality of San Fernando <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, among the persons, partnership or cor­poration 
engaged in any business, occupation or calling to be charged for hauling sand 
and gravel from its sea­shore, claiming that respondent municipality in hauling 
sand and gravel for the improvement of its roads is engaged in a proprietary 
function as it can later exact higher license fees from those in the business 
center.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, for eventually obtaining profit by the improvement 
of its roads, the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename>San Fernando</st1:placename></st1:place> should allegedly pay 
license fees to the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype> of 
<st1:placename>Luna</st1:placename></st1:place> (Brief for Petitioner, pp. 5 and 
6).</p>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent Municipality alleges that the 
license fee embodied in Ordinance No. 1 is be­yond the authority of the 
Municipality of Luna, La Union to impose, as the sand and gravel deposits in the 
sea­shore of <span class="SpellE">Nalvo</span> Norte are classified as minerals 
under the Mining Laws of the Philippines and as such belong to the State, and 
fall under the administration and control of the Bureau of Mines and not of the 
Municipality of Luna.<span>&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, respondent Municipality 
obtained on <st1:date month="3" day="18" year="1968">March 18, 1968</st1:date>, 
a gratuitous Revocable Permit from the Bureau of Mines (Answer, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 55-56; Brief for Respondent, pp. 3 and 
4).<span>&nbsp; </span>Even granting <span class="SpellE"><em>arguendo</em></span> that 
the disposition of sand and gravel belongs to petitioner, <span>nevertheless, 
the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span> 
of </span><st1:placename><span>San 
Fernando</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span> does not fall under Ordinance 
No. 1 because the gravel and sand extracted by said municipality are used for 
the improvement of its streets which function is 
governmental.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>This issue in the case at bar is now governed by 
Presidential Decree No. 231, enacting a Local Tax Code (for Provinces, Cities, 
Municipalities and Barrios) which took effect on </span><st1:date month="7" day="1" year="1973"><span>July 1, 1973</span></st1:date><span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The Code provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 10.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><em>Sand and gravel fee</em>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— The province 
may levy and collect a fee of not exceeding seventy-five centavos per cubic 
meter of ordinary stones, sand, gravel, earth and other materials extracted from 
lakes, rivers, streams, creeks, and other public waters within the jurisdiction 
of the province.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 22.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><em>Specific limitations on power</em>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— 
Except as otherwise provided in this Code, the municipality shall not levy the 
following:</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>(a)<span ;="" roman="" new="" times="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--> Taxes, fees, and 
charges that the province or city is authorized to levy in this 
Code;</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>(b)<span ;="" roman="" new="" times="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--> Taxes on articles, 
subject to specific tax under the provisions of the National Internal Revenue 
Code; and</blockquote>
<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--> <span><span>(c)<span ;="" roman="" new="" times="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><!--[endif]--> Taxes and other 
impositions enume­rated in Section 5, Chapter I of this Code."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Section 10 of aforesaid decree was later amended by 
Presidential Decree No. 426, dated </span><st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1974"><span>March 30, 1974</span></st1:date><span>, and now 
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 10.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><em>Sand and gravel tax</em>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>— The province 
may levy and collect a tax of not exceeding seventy-five centavos per cubic 
meter of ordinary stones, sand, gra­vel, earth and other materials extracted 
from public and private lands of the government or from the beds of seas, lakes, 
rivers, streams, creeks and other public waters within the jurisdiction of the 
province.<span>&nbsp; </span>The municipality where the materials are extracted shall 
share in the proceeds of the tax herein authorized at a rate of not less than 
thirty per cent thereof as may be determined by the Provincial 
Board.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The permit to extract the materials shall be issued by the Director 
of Mines or his duly authorized representative and the extraction thereof shall 
be governed by regulations issued by the Director of Mines." <span class="GramE">(As amended by Presidential Decree No. 426).</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Under the above-quoted provisions of the Local Tax Code, 
there is no question that the authority to impose the license fees in dispute, 
properly belongs to the province concerned and not to the Municipality of 
</span>Luna <span>which is specifically prohibited under Section 22 of the same 
Code "from levying taxes, fees and charges that the province or city is 
authorized to levy in this Code." On the </span>other hand, <span>the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>Municipality</span></st1:placetype><span> 
of </span><st1:placename><span>San 
Fernando</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span> cannot extract sand and gravel

of </span><st1:placename><span>Luna</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span> 
without paying the corresponding taxes or fees that may be imposed by the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>province</span></st1:placetype><span> of 
</span><st1:placename><span>La 
Union</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
