				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issue in this case is whether or not the 33 pay-to-cash
checks of the private respondent were payment on his account with the
petitioner, or were simply <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> for his
accommodation by the company's cashier.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are not in dispute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is the conclusion to be derived from them where the trial court and
the Court of Appeals differ from each other.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court's findings of fact are quoted hereunder as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Plaintiff is a distributor of the tobacco products of defendant
corporation granted credit facilities that are secured by a mortgage on various
pieces of real estate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Starting with <span style="">a </span>modest amount of P24<span class="GramE">,480.00</span> <span style="">in </span>1966,
the credit arrangement expanded <span style="">as </span>the
volume of transactions grew until in 1970 it reached P700,000.00, duly secured
by additional mortgages (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. A, B to B-3, C to C-5,
D to D-3, E to E-3, F to F-3 and G to G­-3).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"Over the years
plaintiff under the above arrangement had been obtaining cigarettes from
defendant and distributing them to his outlets, remitting payment to defendant
regularly and receiving from the latter periodic statements of account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff testified that in May of 1973 he
received statements of account for the preceding months of January, February,
March and April.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not receive
further statements until <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="1">January 24,
 1974</st1:date> when company auditors came to his house to audit his accounts
and came up with a statement showing a balance of P574<span class="GramE">,685.42</span>
against him as of <st1:date year="1974" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1974</st1:date>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Surprised at the size of the amount, he made a check of his own and
found that the auditors failed to credit him with payments he made in 33 checks
under different dates and amounts (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. K to K-32)
with a total of P729<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, so that instead of
incurring an obligation of P574,685.42 he actually made an overpayment of
P154,314.58.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1974</st1:date>
plaintiff wrote to defendant giving notice that due to failing health he could
no longer continue his business relation with it and giving notice of the
termination of their contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. I).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, his lawyers in a separate
letter wrote to defendant demanding; (1) refund of the amount of P154,314.58 he
had overpaid; (2) release of the mortgage on his properties; and (3) issuance
of the corresponding clearance (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. H)<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendant</span> in answer
to plaintiff's letter Exhibit I asked him to reconsider his stand as the
arrangement had been mutually beneficial to them (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span style="">J) </span><span class="GramE">but</span>
this was declined by plaintiff.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March
<span style="">7, </span>1974 defendant answered the
letter Exhibit H of plaintiff's lawyer reiterating that plaintiff owed it
P574,711.06 as of that date, denied the request for the release of the
mortgaged collaterals, and demanded payment of the obligation within ten days
otherwise action would be taken to enforce collection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(pp. 36, 37, Orig. Record on appeal)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the plaintiff (now private respondent) filed an
action alleging the fact of his having paid 33 checks to the petitioner in the
amount of P729<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, resulting in a balance in his
favor of P154,314.58 and <span style="">praying that
defendant be ordered to release the mortgage on his collaterals, refund to him
the sum of P154,314.58 with interest and pay him damages and P50,000.00 as
attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer, the defendant denied that the 33 personal checks
issued by Perez were payments on his account.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It alleged that those checks were merely <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>
by Perez through the company's cashier, Dolores <span style="">Claudio, who delivered the proceeds to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For that reason, no official receipts were issued
to him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial, the court rendered judgment on <st1:date year="1975" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1975</st1:date> dismissing the complaint
and the defendant’s counterclaim for lack of evidence (p. 43, Record on
Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">Perez appealed to the Court of Appeals (AC-G.R. CV No. 58351,
August 2, 1983) which reversed the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of its decision reads as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is reversed, and
another one entered –</blockquote>

<blockquote>“1) Ordering the defendant to refund to the plaintiff the over­payment
of P154,314.58 together with the interest thereon from February 23, 1974 at 12%
per annum until full payment;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2) Ordering the defendant to execute the deeds of release of
mortgages;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“3) Ordering the defendant to pay attorney's fees of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“4) Ordering the defendant to pay the costs.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendant's counterclaims are dismissed.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The writ of preliminary injunction issued by the Court a quo
is made permanent." <span class="GramE">(p. 23, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for review.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a general rule, the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals
are conclusive on this Court and may not be reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, like any rule, this has
exceptions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the findings or
conclusion of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are contrary to each
other, the Supreme Court may scrutinize the evidence in the records (Cruz vs.
CA, 129 SCRA 222; <span class="SpellE">Petro</span> Port Service, Inc. vs. CA,
131 SCRA 365).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This we have done, and
the result is that we are unconvinced that the plaintiff, now private
respondent, was able to prove by a preponderance of evidence his claim that he
overpaid his account with the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is more than meets the eye in the testimonies of Perez and
the company's cashier, Claudio.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
reproduce hereunder the observations of the trial court which we find to be
more logical than the appellate court's.</p>

<blockquote>"It is obvious that the conflicting claims of <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> Perez and Dolores Claudio cannot both be true, and
it is the task of the Court to determine which of them is right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of them has attempted to take advantage
of the good faith of the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Either <span class="SpellE">Eufemio</span> Perez has <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> his
checks with Dolores Claudio with the intention of claiming later that said
checks were paid to the company for his account, relying on said checks to be his
receipts of payment or Dolores Claudio has received <span style="">said </span>checks from Perez as payment, omitted to issue the
corresponding receipts, and then cashed them and failed to turn over the
proceeds to the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also
possible that some of the checks were paid for Perez' account and some were <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> as an accommodation for him which may explain why
the total of the checks would result in an excess of P154<span class="GramE">,314.58</span>
over the amount of Perez' account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
truth is a secret known to only the two of them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are claims made on both sides that strain
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why, for example, should
Perez have to importune Claudio to cash his checks for him, and huge amounts at
that, when he had his own bank account where he could directly cash his
checks?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And knowing this, why should
Claudio have to leave her office to go to the bank to accommodate him, which
was both pointless and unnecessary?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Claudio said Perez was afraid of hold-ups.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But Perez need not be afraid of hold-ups on
the way to the bank, because he does not carry any money while going
there.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in coming out of the bank
with the money, he is just as exposed to hold-ups when the checks are cashed
for him by Claudio as when he cashes them himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the claim of Perez that he actually made
an overpayment of P154<span class="GramE">,314.58</span> is even harder to
believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ledger cards Exhibits 1 to
11 show that over the years the balance against him hovered in the neighborhood
of P700<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, necessitating his filing of additional
real estate mortgages to secure its payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And yet in about eight months (the period covered by the checks
Exhibit[s] K to K-32) he was not only able to settle it but to make an
overpayment of P154<span class="GramE">,314.58</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why should he make an overpayment and in such
an amount?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a businessman dealing in
transactions of this size he no doubt kept his own books and records and did
not have to rely on the company's statement of accounts which, by his own
complaint, were not set regularly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
the legal presumption that a person takes ordinary care of his concerns, Perez
knew of the state of his accounts at any given time, and therefore, could not
have made the overpayment he now claims.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is also difficult to believe that Perez would be <span class="GramE">so</span> naive and trusting as to remit payments in duly endorsed
cash checks without waiting for the covering receipts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The checks are in big amounts, sometimes to
the tune of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Anybody who came in possession of these
checks could have cashed them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The least
Perez could have done was to make them payable in the name of the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not having done so, ordinary prudence
requires that he demand a receipt for every payment, and again there is a legal
presumption that he did so.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Examining the evidence, it appears that there are dates when
Perez made remittances of more than one check.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, on <st1:date year="1973" day="10" month="5">May 10, 1973</st1:date>,
he made a payment of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for which he was
issued a receipt (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 107).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amount was credited to him in his ledger
card (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 4, reverse side).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perez' Exhibit K is a check for P56,250.00
also dated May 10, 1973, so that it would appear that on said date he remitted
two checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, if he was issued a
receipt for the payment of P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (which is
presumed to be dated truly) why did he not protest that he was not given a
receipt for P56,250.00 if the check was really a payment for his account?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1973</st1:date>,
he made payments of P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, P3,000.00 and
P100,000.00 all covered by receipts (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 81, 82 and
83) and duly entered in his ledger card (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Exhibit K-3 is a check of the
same date for the amount of P16<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, not covered by
a receipt or entered in his ledger card.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, why did he not protest that he was not given a receipt if it was
really a payment on his account?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1973</st1:date>
Perez was given a receipt for payment of P35<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 78) <span class="GramE">and</span> he was credited <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in his ledger card (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His Exhibits K-4 and K-5 are checks
of the same date for P40<span class="GramE">,749.50</span> and P32,000.00,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If these checks are
payments on account, it is indeed strange that he did not protest that he was
not given the corresponding receipts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same <span class="GramE">observation are</span> true with
respect to his checks Exhibits K-10, K-15, K-19, K-22, K-24, K-25, K-26, K-27,
K-29 and K-30.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A further and more
important question fairly cries to be asked:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If Perez was going to make remittances on the same date, why did he not
make them in a single check, instead of writing two or more?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may indeed be supposed that one check was
in payment of his account and the other or others were for encashment, and it
therefore stands to reason that he would be issued receipts for those checks
meant for payment, but not for those that were only <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There are elements both of probability and improbability in
the evidence for either side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is of
course incumbent upon plaintiff to show by preponderance of evidence that his
checks Exhibits K to K-32 were payments on his account notwithstanding that
defendant failed to issue any receipts for them or to acknowledge them as such
payments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under all the circumstances of
the case, the Court is not convinced that the proof warrants a finding in his
favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is noted that of the 33 checks, 15 with a total amount of
P217<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. K-2, K-3,
K-11, K-15, K-17 to K-22, K-25 to -28 and K-32) are all stamped ‘<span class="GramE">For</span> deposit only Quality Tobacco Corporation’ and appear to
have been so deposited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eighteen checks
with a total amount of P511<span class="GramE">,730.00</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. K, K-1, K-4 to -10, K-12 to -14, K-­16, K-24, K-29,
K-30 and K-31) are not so stamped and appear to have been cashed, presumably to
Claudio, the last endorser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether any
part of the proceeds went back to Perez or went to the company or to Claudio
cannot be ascertained, but the situation was made possible by the manner in
which Perez effected his remittances, and he therefore has only himself to
blame. <span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span>
<span class="GramE"><span style="">(pp. </span>40-42,
Original Record on Appeal.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The company's duplicates of the official receipts which it issued
to Perez over a period of one (1) year:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>from January 13, 1973 to January 21, 1974 (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
12 to 157), with few exceptions, indicated:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) the <span style="">Distributor's Report
that he submitted with his remittances, and (2) the number of the check
whenever his remittance was by check.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in the case of the 33 checks in question, Perez failed to
produce a single Distributor's Report which he should have submitted </span><span style="">if </span><span style="">those 33 checks were indeed payments on his account with the
company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Perez's explanation that he did
not submit a Distributor's Report with each of these remittances because such
reports are necessary only when he wants to be reimbursed for his expenses, is
lame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For why did he suddenly stop
asking for reimbursement of his expenses?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Perez's other <span class="GramE">allegation, that</span> no
receipts were issued to him for the 33 checks (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
K to K-32) because the checks had to be cleared first, is refuted by his own
Exhibits O to WW, official receipts of the company showing that, as is the
usual practice in commercial establishments, official receipts were issued to
him by the company for payments by checks, without waiting for prior clearance
from the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibits O to WW show that receipts issued to him by the company bore
the same dates as his checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That no
receipts were issued to him for the 33 checks and that he did not ask for any,
confirm Claudio's testimony that those checks were not payments on Perez's
account, but were merely <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> for him by Claudio
out of her collections to "accommodate" him or to tide him over
temporarily for, as the bank's stamp on the checks show, they were not
immediately deposited by Claudio in the company's bank account; she waited some
2 to 5 days before doing so (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. <span class="GramE">K-2,
K-3, K-8, K-9, K-10, K-11, K-19, K-20, K-21, K-22, K-25, K-27).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In fact, his check (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> K-18) dated Sept. 19, 1973 was deposited by
Claudio on <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1973</st1:date>
only, or after 13 days.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Claudio's incredible
story that she used to <span class="SpellE">encash</span> the checks herself at
Perez's bank (The Consolidated Bank &amp; Trust Co. in <span class="SpellE">Tabora</span>),
makes us wonder why she went to all that trouble to accommodate him despite the
fact that his ledger balance showed that he was never prompt in remitting
payments to the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One wonders
what was in it for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Through the
encashment of those pay-to-cash checks, did Claudio receive a commission or
"kick back" from Perez?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did
she conspire with him to create confusion as to whether those checks </span>were
payments on Perez's account or merely for encashment?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is confronted with the problem of
determining who is trying to defraud who in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Did Claudio defraud Perez and the company by
pocketing the proceeds of Perez's checks and forgetting to issue receipts for
them?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or, was Perez trying to cheat the
company by pretending that he did not receive the proceeds of the checks he <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> with Claudio because they were payments on his
account?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or did they both conspire to
defraud the company, or at least create this confusion and uncertainty and let
the courts decide perchance in Perez's favor?</p>

<p class="BODY">It is, however, significant that over a period of eight (8)
months from May 1973 to January 1974 - the period when he issued the 33 checks
- Perez did not ask the company either for a statement on the status of his
account, or, for a receipt for his "payments." This omission
disproves his pretense that he issued the checks as payments on his account with
the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">A person is expected to take ordinary care of his affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Perez intended to settle his account with
the company by issuing his personal checks, ordinary prudence would have
dictated that he issue the checks in a manner that would leave no doubt as to
his purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He would have:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) asked for a receipt for his payment; or
(2) indicated on the face of the check that the payee was the company - Quality
Tobacco Corporation; or (3) indicated on the back of the check, above his <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span>, that it was "payment on account with
Quality Tobacco Corporation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
any of these instances, there would have been no doubt that he discharged his
obligation to the company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By failing to
take any of these precautions, he showed lack of due care in the conduct of his
affairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If Claudio was able to
misappropriate his checks (without damage to the <span style="">company which had not issued official receipts </span><span class="SpellE">therefor</span>), it was because he enabled her to do so by the
mode of payment he adopted, hence, he should bear the loss.</p>
