				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Accused Danilo Daniel y Ramos, alias Boyet, was charged with Murder
before the Regional Trial Court of Malabon, Branch 169, under the following
Information:<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 25th day of May, 1982, in the
Municipality of Malabon, Metro Manila, Philippines and within the jurisdiction
of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with intent to kill, evident
premeditation and treachery, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously attack, assault and stab one Edgardo de Guzman with a Batangas
knife (balisong), (and) as <span style="">a </span>result
thereof, the said victim suffered fatal wounds which directly caused his death.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Contrary to law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, accused pleaded not guilty.  Trial on the merits ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">To establish its case against accused-appellant, the prosecution
presented four (4) witnesses, <i>viz:</i> Joseph Ang y Sandoval, Teofilo de
Guzman, Dr. Alberto M. Reyes and Edgardo F. Lazaro.</p>

<p class="BODY">Joseph Ang y Sandoval testified that on May 25, 1992, at about 6
p.m., he was standing at the corner of Anonas Street and Orange Street in
Malabon.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
From about seven (7) meters, he saw Edgardo de Guzman buying a cigarette.  Suddenly, accused Danilo Daniel y Ramos
appeared from behind Edgardo.  He kicked
Edgardo then stabbed him at the back.  Accused fled with the bloodstained knife.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> Ang
repeatedly called on Edgardo.  He was ignored.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ang ran to Edgardo's succor and asked:  "Napaano ka ba?" Edgardo told him he was stabbed by
accused.  Two of Edgardo's friends,
Jesus Tecson and Raymundo Catalan, came and also assisted the wounded Edgardo
to his house.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
At the gate, they saw Edgardo's father, Teofilo.  The three rushed Edgardo to the nearest hospital.  On the way, Edgardo related to his father
the stabbing incident.  He informed his
father that he recognized accused for he turned to him after he was kicked from
behind.</p>

<p class="BODY">Edgardo was operated on at the Chinese General Hospital.  In the meantime, Teofilo de Guzman,
accompanied by the police authorities, went back to the scene of the
crime.  They failed to find the
accused.  Teofilo filed <span style="">a </span>complaint with the CIS.  A manhunt of the accused was mounted.  Accused was arrested in due time in Davao.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Edgardo did not survive his operation.  He died from severe hemorrhage resulting from the stab wound.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
During the trial, Teofilo de Guzman presented the receipts (Exhibits
"D" to "D-14") evidencing the expenses he incurred relative
to the medical treatment and burial arrangements of his son.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After the prosecution rested its evidence, the defense counsel
moved, by way of demurrer, for the dismissal of the case.  The trial court denied the motion and set
the date for the reception of the evidence for the defense.  The accused opted not to adduce evidence and
submitted the case for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused was convicted of the crime charged.  The trial court made the following
disposition:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, the Court finds the accused
Danilo Daniel y Ramos, alias Boyet, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime
of Murder and is hereby sentenced to suffer RECLUSION PERPETUA with all the
accessory penalties provided for by law and to pay the cost.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The accused is hereby ordered to indemnify the offended party
the sum of P50,000.00 and actual expenses of P15,382.40.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence this appeal on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>1.  THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR
IN FINDING ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INCONSISTENT STATEMENTS MADE BY THE
WITNESSES LEAVE ROOM FOR DOUBT AS TO THE GUILT OF ACCUSED-APPELLANT;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">B.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>INCONSISTENCIES IN THE TESTIMONY OF THE
WITNESSES PERTAIN TO MATERIAL, NOT ONLY MINOR, MATTERS;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 85.5pt; text-indent: -20.7pt;">C.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>AT MOST, THE PROSECUTION'S EVIDENCE WAS
MERELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND NOT SUFFICIENT FOR CONVICTION.</p>

<blockquote>2.  THE LOWER COURT COMMITTED REVERSIBLE ERROR
IN HOLDING THAT THE FLIGHT OF HEREIN ACCUSED-APPELLANT IS AN INDICATION OF
GUILT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant faults the trial court for giving credence to
the testimonies of prosecution witnesses Joseph Ang and Teofilo de Guzman.  He claims that their testimonies contained
inconsistencies on material points thus making them unworthy of belief.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant maintains that Ang vacillated in his
testimony.  In his direct testimony, Ang
allegedly said that he only saw accused-appellant running away from the scene
of the crime holding a bloodstained knife.  However, during his cross-examination, he testified he actually saw
accused-appellant stab the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged variance was clarified by Ang in his re-direct
examination.  He recounted that he
initially saw the victim buying a cigarette at <span style="">a </span>nearby store.  From out
of nowhere, accused-appellant came from behind and kicked the victim.  Accused-appellant then stabbed the victim at
the back and fled.  Ang repeatedly
called on accused-appellant.  He was
ignored.  He approached the victim to
assist him.  A careful review of Ang's <b><i><span style="">entire testimony</span></i></b><span style=""> </span>precludes any doubt that he witnessed
the stabbing of the victim.  Thus, the
alleged inconsistency adverted to by accused-appellant is illusory.  There could not have been any mistake on the
identity of accused-appellant.  Ang was
a mere seven (7) meters away when the stabbing incident happened.  Moreover, the victim himself saw
accused-appellant immediately before he was stabbed by the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, accused-appellant faults the testimony of Teofilo
de Guzman that on their way to the hospital, the wounded Edgardo recounted to
him the stabbing incident, thus:  While
Edgardo was buying a cigarette, someone kicked him from behind.  Edgardo then turned around and faced his assailant.  It was then that Edgardo saw and recognized
accused?appellant.  Facing
Edgardo, accused-appellant then stabbed Edgardo's back.  Accused-appellant urges that this version is
preposterous considering the location of the stab wound of the victim <i>vis-a-vis</i>
the relative positions of the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the contention.  The victim related to his father that after accused-appellant
kicked him from behind, he turned and it was at that point that he recognized
his assailant.  Nowhere in the records
is it categorically stated that the victim <b><i>completely</i></b> turned
around and <b><i><span style="">actually </span>stood
face-to-face with </i></b><b><i><span style="">accused-appellant</span></i></b><span style=""> </span><span style="">which
would have </span>rendered it physically improbable for accused-appellant to
stab the victim at the back.  More
accurately, Teofilo de Guzman testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>â€œQ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Was
your son able to talk to you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
did he tell you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
(sic) the way x x x to the hospital, he told me that he was<i style=""> </i>buying a cigarette in (sic) the corner of Anonas Street and Orange
Road at a sari-sari store when a certain person kicked him behind and <b><i style=""><span style="">when </span></i></b><b><i style=""><span style="">he
turn(ed) back, he saw this Danilo </span>Daniel and (he) stabbed him at the
back</i></b> <span style="">by </span>a
"balisong," sir."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It will be noted that in describing the
stabbing incident, the witness declared that the victim "turned back"
-- not "turned around" -- thus enabling the victim to identify his
assailant.  Surely, the victim need only
turn his head sideways to verify the identity of accused-appellant.  This position certainly would not preclude
accused-appellant from stabbing the victim at the back.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant also scores the prosecution for not presenting
as witnesses Jesus Tecson and Raymundo Catalan, the two (2) friends of the
victim who accompanied the latter to the hospital.  Again, this is groundless.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies of prosecution witnesses Joseph Ang and Teofilo
de Guzman sufficiently proved the guilt of accused-appellant beyond reasonable
doubt.  There <span style="">was </span>no necessity to present Tecson and Catalan.  Their testimonies would only be
corroborative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, accused-appellant takes exception to a portion of the
trial court's decision which stated:</p>

<blockquote>"It is equally important to note that accused jumped bail in
1983 and was only rearrested in 1991.  The fact that it took eight (8) years to arrest accused shows that he
went into hiding.  Flight is an
indication of a guilty mind x x x (and) is evidence of guilt x x x."
(Rollo, at p. 15)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">He contends that it took the authorities eight (8) <span style="">years </span>to arrest him but that does not
necessarily mean he tried to evade arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime was committed on May 25, 1982.  Trial on the merits was conducted only after
accused-appellant was arrested in October 1993 for his presence in court was
necessary for his identification by the prosecution witnesses.  Noticeably, accused-appellant, in his Brief,
never categorically denied that he went into hiding.  Neither did he offer any reason for his stay in Davao for a
period of eight (8) years.  There is
reason to conclude that accused-appellant fled to evade arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since accused-appellant waived his right to adduce evidence, he
failed to deny or explain his presence at the scene of the crime at the time of
its commission.  Neither did he ascribe
any bias or improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses that could
have prompted them to testify falsely.  We are satisfied that the prosecution evidence established his guilt
beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant was meted the correct penalty.  He caught the unarmed and unsuspecting
victim by surprise and stabbed him at the back for no apparent reason.  Treachery attended the commission of the crime.  Murder qualified by treachery is punished
under the Revised Penal Code by <b><i>reclusion temporal</i> in its maximum
period to death</b>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Since no mitigating or aggravating circumstance attended the commission of the
crime, the impossable penalty is <b><i>reclusion</i></b> <b><i>perpetua</i></b>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">IN VIEW WHEREOF</span></b><span style="">, </span>the appealed Decision is hereby <span style="">AFFIRMED </span><i>in toto</i>.  Costs against accused-appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
