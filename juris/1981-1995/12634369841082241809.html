				<BR><STRONG>NOCON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">was the observation by the Metropolitan
Trial Court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
in its joint decision dated October <span style="">30,
1990 </span>in Civil Case Nos. <span style="">12961-63,
</span>affirmed by the Regional Trial Court<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> and
reaffirmed by the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants referred to above are the very petitioners in the
present case.  They were ordered by the
MTC to vacate the premises they were leasing at Medel Compound, a thickly
populated tenanted 5-parcel residential land in Mandaluyong with an area of
31,052.5 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower courts were consistent in their finding of facts.  In 1986, the tenants of Medel Compound,
desirous of owning the land they were leasing, which some of them have been
occupying since their birth, organized themselves to form the Medel Compound
Tenants Association, Inc.  The
Association was later registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
with some 300 or so original members, including herein petitioners.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With the full support and assistance of <span style="">the </span>Mandaluyong Municipal Government and the National Home
Mortgage Finance Corp (NHMFC), the land was finally acquired and its five
titles were transferred in favor of the Association in February 1989.  The land was subdivided among the
Association members pursuant to the guidelines set by the NHMFC in relation to
the Community Mortgage Program of the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">In October 27, 1989, spouses Mariano Torio and Maria Bautista,
Florentina Bautista, and Renato Bautista, were sent a letter by the
Association, through its lawyer, demanding that they vacate Lot Nos. 135, 145
and 147, which were respectively held by them as tenant-lessees.  When petitioners refused to do so,
respondent filed a complaint for "Unlawful Detainer with Damages."
Respondent alleged that petitioners never became active members and refused to
participate in the acquisition of the lot; that although they were one of the
incorporators of the Association, they did not pay a single centavo of the
membership dues, other assessments, the critical downpayment for the respective
lots they were leasing and rentals despite demands and grace period given them.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioners raised as defense that they never
relinquished their membership.  However,
they could not immediately pay their obligation to the Association because they
allegedly had to put up the money to pay their dues.   When they were ready to pay, the Association allegedly ignored
them.  They further claimed that they
never received any formal notices of deadline for payment of membership dues as
<b><span style="">most of the time they were staying in
Wawa, Baras, Rizal.<o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="BODY">Ruling in favor of the respondent Association, the MTC rejected
petitioners' proposition that they were protected by Sec. 5, 2<sup>n</sup><sup><span style="">d</span></sup><span style=""> </span>paragraph, of B.P. Blg. 877<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>,
noting that the complaint was based on termination of the lease<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and need of the premises<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>.  Likewise, the trial court dismissed
petitioners' reliance on P.D. 1517, Sec. 6<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> on
the rationale the said provision prohibits the Medels from selling their
property to third person without giving the tenants the right of first
refusal.  In this case, however, the
Medels sold the property to the tenants' association and not to anybody else.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, petitioners questioned the MTC's jurisdiction over the
case, arguing that since the controversy is between the Association and its
members, the case should have been adjudicated before the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC) pursuant to P.D. 902-A.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The RTC, however, upheld the MTC stating that jurisdiction over the subject
matter is determined by the allegations in the complaint and not the facts
averred in the answer or opposition of the adverse party.  The case filed being for unlawful detainer,
the MTC was sustained in assuming jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The RTC also agreed with the MTC that respondent can rightly
demand for petitioners to vacate the premises on the strength of Article 1687<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Civil Code, considering that the period of the lease was on a month to
month basis.  The RTC, however, rejected
MTC's application of Sec. 5(c) of B.P. Blg. 877, on the need of the premises by
the immediate member of the family of the lessor, as this particular provision
is intended to cover only natural persons.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In their appeal to the appellate court, petitioners raised as
issues RTC's reliance on Article 1687 of the Civil Code and its failure to
apply P.D. 2016<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
which prohibits the eviction of occupant families from land identified as areas
for priority development.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the first issue, said court referred to the case of <i>Rivera
v. Florendo</i><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
where it was held that the determination of the period of the lease can still
be made in accordance with Article 1687, because what is suspended by Section 6
of B.P. Blg. 25 is Article 1673 and not Article 1687.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
As to the application of P.D. 2016, the Court of Appeals cited with approval
the ratiocination of the MTC, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"This (provision) is an injunction against the owner, in this
case the Medels, to sell the lot to others without giving the tenants the right
of first refusal.  But the Medels sold
it to the tenants' association and to nobody else.  The provision aforequoted has not been violated..."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The court a quo further observed that:</p>

<blockquote>"Finally, petitioners were not <u>bona fide</u> occupants of
the lots in question because, admittedly, they were most of the time residing
at Baras, Rizal.  And what is worse,
petitioners were renting out their houses erected on subject lots to other
people."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a vain hope to get a reversal of the referred decisions,
petitioners now filed this present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> on
the same arguments they have raised in the lower courts, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The respondent court seriously erred in not dismissing the
complaints for ejectment for lack of jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Assuming such jurisdiction, the respondent court seriously
erred and gravely abused its discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction in upholding the ejectment of petitioners based on the expiration
of the period of the lease contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The respondent court seriously erred and gravely abused its
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in disregarding the
prohibition against the ejectment of petitioners by the lessor's
successor-in-interest to whom the property was sold."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find the petition unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of jurisdiction, we cite the decision in <i><span style="">Viray v. Court of Appeals,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>penned by Mr. Justice Isagani Cruz,
which states that:</p>

<blockquote>"It should be obvious that not every
conflict between a corporation and its stockholders involves corporate matters
that only the SEC can resolve in the exercise of its adjudicatory or quasi
judicial powers.  If for example, a
person leases an apartment owned by a corporation of which he is a stockholder,
there should be no question that a complaint for his ejectment for non-payment
of rentals would still come under the jurisdiction of the regular courts and
not of the SEC."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed a contrary interpretation would distort the meaning and
intent of P.D. 902-A, the law reorganizing the Securities and Exchange
Commission.  The better policy in
determining which body has jurisdiction over a case would be to consider not
only the relationship of the parties but also the nature of the question that
is the subject of their controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners tried to substantiate their second argument with the
proposition that the contract between the Association and its members is not a
lease contract, but a contract of sale on installment and presented as proof a
purported contract signed by the Association President and one of its members.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners specifically pointed out the provision in the said contract which
states:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"SECTION 11.  SPECIAL CONDITIONS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It is hereby agreed by the parties that all rental payments shall
be considered as installment payment of the purchase price of the unit awarded
to the LESSEE.  Upon expiration of the
lease term, and payment by the LESSEE of all rentals due and payable including
penalties and surcharges, full title and ownership shall vest unto the
LESSEE.  The LESSOR or its Assignee
shall execute the necessary Deed of Absolute Sale, and all rental payments
shall be credited against the purchase price."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The contract, however, also provides as follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"SECTION 2.  TERM<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>X X X</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.2 Subject to
the LESSOR's <b><u>right of termination</u> </b>under Section 4 and other
applicable provisions hereunder and the LESSEE's exercise of his/her right of <b><u>option
to purchase</u></b> under Section 11 hereof, it being understood that the
payment of the aggregate rental for the full period of this lease is the very
essence and special consideration of this Agreement.  (emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<blockquote>X X X</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"SECTION 10.  EVENTS OF DEFAULT<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>X X X</blockquote>

<blockquote>"10.2. Effects of Default.  Upon default by the LESSEE, each of the following remedies shall accrue

<blockquote>“b. The lease shall
be <b><u>terminated</u> </b>and the LESSEE shall voluntarily surrender
possession of the PROPERTY to the LESSOR/ITS ASSIGNEE and if the LESSEE fails
to do so, the LESSEE may be summarily ejected and the LESSOR/ITS ASSIGNEE may
enter the premises where the property is located . . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
(emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded by petitioners' second argument for the
following reasons:  1) the alleged
contract was not presented in the trial court thus its genuineness,
authenticity and due execution was not established; 2) if petitioners had
entered into such a Lease/Purchase Agreement with the respondent, they should
have attached to the complaint said document which they allegedly signed, but
this they did not do; and 3) the document presented to sustain their allegation
is a pro-forma lease/purchase agreement which does not even name the lessor and
is bare of other essential facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In short, there is nothing in the record to show that petitioners
entered into a Lease/Purchase Agreement with the Association and that
petitioners never paid their rent to the Association, despite demands and grace
period given them.  Hence, even if, for
the sake of argument, we are to apply the provisions of the purported contract
to petitioners, as they want us to do, it is but right to evict them having
defaulted in their payments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' third argument is a mere reiteration of their
argument in the trial court to apply Section 5, 2<sup>nd</sup> paragraph, of
B.P. Blg. 877 which we have previously disposed of.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly observed by the MTC:</p>

<blockquote>". . . But then, where were they (petitioners) when their help
was most needed.  Had they put in their
share into the concerted communal effort of the membership toward the
attainment of the association's goal?  Should their indifference be rewarded?  Understandably, defendants having transferred their residence to Baras,
Rizal long before the acquisition process had reached its peak, they could be
the least concerned.  To them, the
project would not really mean land for the poor.  Having rented out their houses, it is more of the entrepreneur's
instinct that moved them to hold on to the premises."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
