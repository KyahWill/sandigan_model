				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Private respondent Pablo Coralis, employed as a miner by
petitioner Benguet Corporation since July 6, 1976, was dismissed by the latter
on December 3, 1984 for “highgrading,” or theft of gold ore.  According to the notice of dismissal,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
on November 13, 1984, he had been caught, red-handed as it were, while picking
out and collecting pieces of high-grade ore inside a stope (excavation) <span style="">in </span>his employer's Acupan Mines <span style="">in </span>Itogon, Benguet, which was not his
assigned workplace.  He had signed a
statement admitting his guilt in the <span style="">investigation
</span>conducted on the same day.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Three weeks later, on December 28, 1984, Coralis filed a
complaint for illegal dismissal against Benguet Corporation,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">in </span>support of which he
thereafter submitted his affidavit of February 8, 1985 to the effect that he
had been made to sign his previous confession by one L.M. Belwa of the
company's Acupan security office, without understanding or being informed of
its contents and upon assurances of being allowed to return to work if he
signed.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for hearing following the filing of a motion to
dismiss by Benguet Corporation.  Position papers were thereafter filed, by Coralis on September 10, 1986,
and by Benguet Corporation on October 30, 1986.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Then,
on September 8, 1987, a decision was rendered by Executive Labor Arbiter Norma
Olegario who rejected Coralis' protestations of innocence, found that he had
been dismissed for cause, and threw out the complaint for lack of merit.  Withal the Arbiter sought to mitigate what
she called the "harshness" of the law in a manner that to her mind
"would (not) obliterate the line that should divide those who had rendered
faithful and efficient service * * * and those whose dismissals are for valid
and just cause," by granting Coralis separation pay for only six, instead
of his actual more than eight, years of service.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Predictably, the decision did not sit well with Benguet
Corporation, which found it self-contradictory and so professed in an appeal to
the National Labor Relations Commission that dwelt, in the main, on the
proposition that since Coralis' dismissal was found to have been for just
cause, no separation pay was lawfully owed him and none should have been
awarded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coralis, for his part, did not appeal.  This notwithstanding, the NLRC to all intents and purposes opened
the entire case to review when it took up and resolved, not only the question
of whether or not the Executive Arbiter had correctly awarded Coralis
separation pay notwithstanding her finding that he had been lawfully dismissed
-- the only issue raised in Benguet Corporation's appeal -- but examined and
resolved the basic issue of legality of Coralis' dismissal despite absence of
any appeal as regards said finding of the Arbiter, as already stated.</p>

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span> its judgment
promulgated on May 31, 1988 and assailed in the present petition, the NLRC
through its Fourth Division reversed the appealed decision of the Executive
Labor Arbiter, held that Coralis had been illegally dismissed and ordered his
reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and diminution of benefits, and
with back wages from the time of dismissal to actual reinstatement.  It directed also that if reinstatement was
no longer practicable, Coralis be paid separation pay equivalent to one month's
salary for every year of service, a fraction of six<b> </b>months to be
considered as one year for this purpose, in addition to backwages.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the present action, Benguet Corporation imputes to the NLRC
grave abuse of discretion amounting to want of jurisdiction in resolving its
appeal in the manner just set forth.  It
is correct.  Respondent NLRC not only
set at naught its own rules, but also disregarded relevant precedent when it
reviewed and reversed the Arbiter Olegario's finding that Coralis was lawfully
dismissed although that finding was never put in issue in the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rules in question as they stood at the time<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
very clearly provided that:</p>

<blockquote>“(o)nce the appeal is perfected in accordance with these Rules, <u><span style="">issues </span>not raised on appeal shall </u><u><span style="">become </span>final and executor</u><u><span style="">y</span>, and the Commission shall limit
itself to reviewin</u><u><span style="">g</span> and
decidin</u><u><span style="">g</span> s</u><u><span style="">p</span></u><u><span style="">ecific </span>issues that were elevated on </u><u><span style="">appeal</span></u><span style="">." (underscoring </span><span style="">supplied)</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Public respondent's present Rules provide somewhat differently in
that they appear to reserve to said Commission the discretion to review on
appeal issues not raised by the Appellants, <u>viz</u>.:<span style="font-size: 3pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“(s)ubject to the provisions of Article 218 (of P.D. No. 442, as
amended), once the appeal is perfected in accordance with these rules, the
Commission may limit itself to reviewing and deciding specific issues that were
elevated on appeal."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Whatever the effect of this last-cited proviso on appeals taken
after the current Rules of which they are part went into effect -- which is not
now inquired into -- ­one thing is at least clear:  it cannot be given retroactive application so as to validate the
NLRC's reversing or setting aside the Arbiter's resolution of issues not raised
in an appeal from the latter's decision, where such appeal was taken under the <u>aegis
</u>of the earlier Rules, which quite peremptorily limited the NLRC's review to
only those issues that were raised on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">A strong analogy exists between this case and <u>Itog</u><u><span style="">on-­</span>Suvoc Mines, </u><u><span style="">Inc. vs. </span>NLRC</u><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">which, </span>coincidentally, also
involved alleged highgrading.  There,
the petitioning company had applied for clearance to terminate its employment
of the private respondent <span style="">for </span>said
offense.  The Labor Arbiter had denied
the application on the ground that ?????ere was no sufficient evidence to
support the charge and ordered said respondent's immediate reinstatement with
back wages and without loss of seniority.  On appeal, the NLRC reversed the Arbiter and found sufficient evidence
to decree the private respondent's severance for breach of trust with, however,
entitlement to separation pay on equitable grounds.  The petitioner appealed that decision to this Court, which held:</p>

<blockquote>"It should be stressed at this juncture, that the findings of
fact of respondent Commission may be deemed as accepted by private respondent,
considering that said party did not file any motion for reconsideration of the
aforementioned decision, much less appeal therefrom.  The net result is that private respondent cannot now impugn the
correctness of the findings of facts contained in the decision subject of this
petition.  The rule is well-settled that
a party cannot impugn the correctness of a judgment not appealed from by him;
and while he may make counter assignment of errors, he can do so only to
sustain the judgment on other grounds but not to seek modification or reversal
thereof, for in such case he must appeal."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It results that the only issue that the NLRC could resolve in the
appeal before it was whether or not it was proper for the Arbiter to award
Coralis separation pay notwithstanding her having found that said respondent
had been lawfully dismissed for theft of his employer's property.  In this regard, prevailing doctrine distinguishes
between dismissals for "valid but not iniquitous" causes and those
for serious misconduct or causes reflecting on the employee's moral character,
upholding the propriety of giving separation pay in the former, but proscribing
it in the latter.  The reason for the <span style="">distinction is </span>set forth in <u>Philippine
Long Distance Telephone Co. vs. NLRC</u><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court, after justifying such grant in principle not alone on
considerations of equity but also of positive constitutional commands for the
promotion of social justice<span style=""> and the
protection of workers' rights, nonetheless said:</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Court feels that distinctions are in order.  We note that heretofore the separation pay,
when it was considered warranted, was required regardless of the nature or
degree of the ground proved, be it mere inefficiency or something graver like
immorality or dishonesty.  The
benediction of compassion was made to cover a multitude of sins, as<i> </i>it
were, and to justify the helping hand to the validly dismissed employee
whatever the reason for his dismissal.  The policy should be re-examined.  It is time we rationalized the exception, to make it fair to both labor
and management, especially to labor.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"There should be no question that where it comes to <span style="">such </span>valid but not iniquitous causes
as failure to comply with work standards, the grant of separation pay to the
dismissed employee may be both just and compassionate, particularly if he has
worked for sometime with the company.  For example, a subordinate who has irreconcilable policy or personal
differences with his employer may be validly dismissed for demonstrated loss of
confidence.  A working mother who has to
be frequently absent because she has also to take care of her child may also be
removed because of her poor attendance, this being another authorized
ground.  It is not the employee's fault
if he does not have the necessary aptitude for work but on the other hand the
company cannot be required to maintain him just the same at the expense of the
efficiency of its operations.  He too
may be validly replaced.  Under these
and similar circumstances, however, the award to the employee of separation pay
would be sustainable under the social justice policy even if the separation is
for cause.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But where the cause of the separation is more serious than
mere inefficiency, the generosity of the law must be more discerning.  There is no doubt it is compassionate to
give separation pay to a salesman if he is dismissed for inability to fill his
quota but surely he does not deserve such generosity if his offense is
misappropriation of the receipts of his sales.  This is <span style="">no </span>longer mere
incompetence but clear <span style="">dishonesty.  A security guard found sleeping on the job
is doubtless subject to dismissal but may be allowed separation pay since his
conduct, while inept, is not depraved.  But if he was in fact not really sleeping but sleeping with a prostitute
during his tour of duty and in the company premises, the situation is changed
completely.  This is not only
inefficiency but immorality and the grant of separation pay would be entirely
unjustified.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We hold that henceforth <span style="">separation
</span>pay shall be allowed as a measure of social justice only in those
instances where the employee is validly dismissed for causes other than serious
misconduct or those reflecting on his moral character.  Where the reason for the valid dismissal is,
for example, habitual intoxication or an offense involving moral turpitude,
like theft of illicit sexual relations with a fellow worker, the employer may
not be required to give the dismissed employee separation pay, or financial
assistance, or whatever other name it is called, on the ground of social
justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The policy of social justice is not intended to countenance
wrongdoing simply because it is committed by the underprivileged.  At best it may mitigate the penalty but it
certainly will not condone the offense.  Compassion for the poor is an imperative of every humane society but
only when the recipient is not a rascal claiming an undeserved privilege.  Social justice cannot be permitted to be the
refuge of scoundrels <span style="">any </span>more
than can equity be an impediment to the punishment of the guilty.  * * *."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Subsequent decisions have uniformly hewed to this ruling, as
pointed out in <u>Cosmopolitan Funeral Homes, Inc. vs. Maalat</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the NLRC, review of which is
sought, is REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  That
of the Executive Labor Arbiter subject of said decision, is reinstated, but
only insofar as it upholds the validity of private respondent Pablo CoraIis’
dismissal, and striking therefrom the award of separation pay, said respondent
not being entitled thereto.  No
pronouncement as to costs.</p>
