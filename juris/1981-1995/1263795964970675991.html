<p class="BODY">This<span> is</span> a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 
65 of the Revised Rules of Court, with prayer for preliminary injunction, 
seeking to annul and set aside the Orders of the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, Branch IV (now Regional Trial Court) 
through Respondent Judge, dated February 19, 1982, February 24, 1982, and July 
29, 1982, which ordered, allegedly without trial, (1) the exclusion of certain 
parcels of land from the administration of the regular administrator of the 
estates of Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, in Special Proceedings No. 754-IV, and likewise (2) 
ordered that possession of said properties be maintained <span>in </span>favor 
of Private Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> P. <span class="SpellE"><span>Llanes</span></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The petition also 
assails the order of Respondent Judge, dated April 15, 1982, enjoining 
</span><span>Petitioner to </span>desist from interfering <span>with</span> 
<span>the possession of the properties excluded from the Inventory, and ordering 
the tenants of the estates to deliver all shares of the harvests from said 
properties including 3 sheep to respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> 
P. <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, under pain of being declared in contempt of 
court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">It is indicated that the parties-litigants in this case are 
related to each other, tracing their common ancestry from the original owners of 
the properties involved, who appear to be <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and Irene Blanco, to whom was born an only son,

<span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and later

Teresa Blanco, to which marriage Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> were born 
(Memorandum of Petitioner, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 
135).<span>&nbsp; </span>Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> later <span>was 
married to <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Isidoro</span>

<p class="BODY">After the death of <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and later, Teresa Blanco, all properties left by them 
intestate, consisting of 35 parcels of untitled agricultural lands, located 
mostly in the towns of <span class="SpellE">Paoay</span> <span>and </span><span class="SpellE">Pinili</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, were 
inherited by Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> 
de <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span> died on <st1:date month="1" day="19" year="1959">January 19, 1959</st1:date> without any issue and without any 
will.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> inherited the entire estate of her sister, Maxima.</p>
<p class="BODY">Upon the death of <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> on August 5, 1976, Petitioner Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, <span class="SpellE">Violeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cresencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, who are all

intestate estate of <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> as they were the latter's nephews and 
nieces.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On May 28, 1977, Petitioner Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> filed a Petition for Letters of Administration with 
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, praying 
that after due hearing and publication, letters of administration be issued to 
him for the administration of the intestate estate of Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, and that the said 
estates of Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> be settled and distributed among their legal 
heirs.<span>&nbsp; </span>This Intestate Proceedings was docketed as Special 
Proceedings No. 754-IV.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="10" day="7" year="1977">October 7, 
1977</st1:date>, Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, assisted by<span> </span>her husband, Felix G. <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, filed her opposition to the Petition.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>She alleged that Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span> was only an illegitimate child of the deceased 
<span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Jovite</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> was the only 
legitimate child of the spouses Teresa Blanco and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and, therefore, it 
should be <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> alone 
who should succeed to the entire estate left by her mother Teresa Blanco, except 
for such portion that may be <span class="SpellE">alloted</span> to an 
illegitimate child as prescribed by Art. 895 in relation to Article 983 of the 
New Civil Code; that at the time of the death of Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, her only legal heir was her husband <span class="SpellE">Basilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span>; that Petitioner 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and the other heirs mentioned in the 
Petition are precluded from inheriting the estate of <span>Maxima </span><span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> who was an illegitimate child; that furthermore <span class="SpellE"><span>Jovita</span></span><span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> 
had disposed of all her properties before her death and Respondent spouses <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, acquired by purchase from <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> parcels 3, 5, 6, 8, 
10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 22, 23 (to the extent of 1/3 of the whole only) and parcels 
25, 26, 27, and 32, in the Inventory of Properties co-owned by Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> de <span class="SpellE">Quianzon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>; and that 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> was disqualified to be appointed as 
administrator.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The lower court on <st1:date month="2" day="20" year="1978">February 20, 1978</st1:date>, appointed the Clerk of the lower 
court, Atty. Julian <span class="SpellE">Duco</span>, as special administrator of 
the intestate estate in question but on <st1:date month="1" day="13" year="1979">January 13, 1979</st1:date>, said appointment was revoked and 
petitioner Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> was appointed administrator 
of the estate.<span>&nbsp; </span>The latter then submitted to the Court an Inventory 
and Appraisal of the Real and Personal Estate of the decedents Maxima <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">A Motion for Reconsideration of the Order of January 13, 1979 
appointing Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, as the regular 
administrator was filed by Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> who insisted that they are the legal owners and 
possessors of the real properties in the Inventory to the extent of one-third of 
the whole of the real properties in paragraphs 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 
22, 23 of said Inventory and the whole of those in paragraphs 25, 26, 27 and 32 
of the same.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="11" day="16" year="1979">November 16, 
1979</st1:date>, the lower court issued an order denying said motion for 
reconsideration for lack of merit.</p>
<p class="BODY">This development led Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, along with her 
husband and her daughter Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> to file an 
independent Civil Action to Quiet Title <span>with </span>damages in Branch IV 
<span>of </span>the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, alleging 
<span>therein that respondent spouses purchased most of the lots </span><span>in 
</span><span>question from deceased <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>; that the other lots were donated by the late <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> to Evangeline P. 
<span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, daughter of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> and Felix <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was, therefore, prayed that the 
properties described in paragraphs 3, 4, 5, 6, </span><span>7, </span><span>and 
8 of their complaint be excluded from the Inventory of the Estate of <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> and that a 
judgment be decreed in their favor, declaring them as the absolute and exclusive 
owners and legal possessors of the stated properties.<span>&nbsp; </span>This case 
was docketed as Civil Case No. 1128?IV in the lower court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">In his Answer to the complaint in Civil Case No. 1128-IV, 
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> disputed the claim of <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> regarding the ownership and possession of the 
properties in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>He contended that the instruments of sale 
and donation in favor of the <span class="SpellE">Llaneses</span> are fictitious, 
that the house and lot claimed in the said Civil Case No. 1128-IV by respondents 
<span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> <span>is </span>titled under O.C.T. No. 0-44 
which is still registered in the name of Teresa Blanco; and that the properties 
allegedly sold by the late <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> to the <span class="SpellE">Llaneses</span> were not 
exclusive proper<span>ties of <span class="SpellE">Jovita</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>, as the same were owned by Teresa 
Blanco.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 1128-IV is said to be still pending in the trial 
court.</p>
<p class="BODY">In Special Proceedings No. 754-IV, Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> filed on 
<st1:date month="9" day="10" year="1980">September 10, 1980</st1:date> a Motion 
to <span class="GramE">Exclude</span> from the administration of Petitioner the 
properties being claimed by her.</p>
<p class="BODY">The lower court treated said motion as a Motion-Complaint and thus 
Petitioner Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> filed his Answer 
thereto.<span>&nbsp; </span>He once again denied the allegations of <span class="SpellE">movant</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> and stressed the 
fact that the properties covered by O.C.T. No. 0-44 are still registered in the 
name of Teresa Blanco.<span>&nbsp; </span>He insisted that the other properties were 
never validly transferred to <span class="SpellE">Oppositors</span> as the 
referred deeds of conveyances are fictitious.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1981">January 22, 
1981</st1:date>, Respondent Judge issued an order denying respondent <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>' motion to exclude properties.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, 
under date of <st1:date month="8" day="29" year="1981">August 29, 
1981</st1:date>, respondent <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, through counsel, 
filed a pleading entitled "Rejoinder to:<span>&nbsp; </span>Motion to Exclude <span class="SpellE">Oppositor's</span> Properties from Administration and Rejoinder 
to:<span>&nbsp; </span>Opposition for Admission to Inventory and Appraisal of Real 
Estate Dated <st1:date month="12" day="12" year="1980">December 12, 
1980</st1:date> and <st1:date month="1" day="15" year="1981">January 15, 
1981</st1:date> <span>(See </span>page 71, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>).<span>&nbsp; </span>To this pleading, petitioner 
filed his Reply.</p>
<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge, in his order of <st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1982">February 19, 1982</st1:date>, reconsidered his order of <st1:date month="1" day="22" year="1981">January 22, 1981</st1:date>, and his order of 
<st1:date month="11" day="16" year="1979">November 16, 1979</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>His finding was that respondents <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> have 
been in actual possession under claim of ownership of the properties in question 
to the extent of 1/3 of the whole of Lots 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 19, 22, 
<span>23 and the whole of Lots Nos. 25, 26, 27, and 32, in the Inventory.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>He ordered, therefore, that these properties be excluded from the 
inventory under administration, and maintained the possession asserted by <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>On February 24, 1982, the lower court issued an order 
amending its February 19, 1982 order by directing the total exclusion from the 
inventory of the properties </span><span>under </span><span>administration to 
the extent of not only 1/3 of </span>each of said lots but the whole of each of 
Lots 3, 5, 6, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 
32, 34, and 35, and 1/3 of parcels 23, 24, and 27; and ordering also that the 
possession thereof by respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> be maintained (Annex N, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 76).</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner herein filed a Motion for Reconsideration of the above 
order but the same was denied by the trial court in its order dated <st1:date month="3" day="19" year="1982">March 19, 1982</st1:date>.</p>
<p class="BODY">On April 25, 1982, the lower court, acting on the Manifestation 
filed by counsel for respondent <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span>, issued an 
order directing Administrator Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> to 
desist from interfering with the possession of the properties excluded from the 
Inventory and ordered the tenants of said properties to deliver the owner's 
share<span> in the harvests thereon to <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> and not to Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">As the motion for reconsideration of Administrator Francisco <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span> was denied, the present petition for <i>Certiorari</i> 
was, therefore, filed with this Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">Under the Resolution of <st1:date month="4" day="13" year="1983">April 13, 1983</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, 
p. 125) <span>of </span>this Court, the Petition was given due course.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioner avers in his Petition that the issues are:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(1) whether or not the Court orders, alleged to have been issued without 
trial, excluding the properties claimed by respondents <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> from the Inventory submitted, are null and void; (2) 
whether or not the exclusion of the properties in question by virtue of the 
court orders of February 1982, allegedly to be based mainly on the "Special 
Administrator's Inventory-Report on the Status and Posses<span>sors of 
Properties" was arbitrary; </span><span>(3) </span><span>whether or not private 
respondent's claims of possession and/or ownership based on the alleged 
documents of sale, donation and oral contract of sale have any factual or legal 
basis.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On the first issue regarding denial to petitioner of his right to 
due process because there was no actual trial conducted on the Private 
Respondents' motion-complaint and the Respondent Court simply disposed of the 
matter by issuing the orders of exclusion complained of, Petitioner argues that 
pursuant to the pronouncements in the case of <em>Coca vs. Pangilinan</em>, 
L-29547, January 31, 1978 (81 SCRA 278-286), "it became the duty of the trial 
court, after the issues have been joined and no amicable settlement has been 
reached, to receive evidence or conduct a full dress hearing and if necessary to 
pass upon the validity of the donations of the portions of the estate." 
Petitioner contends that if a hearing had been held, due process could have been 
rightfully accorded him and his co-heirs.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the above submissions of Petitioner.</p>
<p class="BODY">Due process was properly observed by the Respondent Judge because 
Petitioner in fact made a Reply to private respondents' pleading, entitled 
"Rejoinder to:<span>&nbsp; </span>Motion to Exclude <span class="SpellE">Oppositor's</span> Properties from Administration and Rejoinder 
to:<span>&nbsp; </span>Opposition for Admission to Inventory and Appraisal of Real 
Estate dated December 12, 1980 and January 15, 1981."</p>
<p class="BODY">Further to this, in the order of <st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1982">February 24, 1982</st1:date>, it appears that the case was called 
for hearing on said date, but only <span class="SpellE">Oppositor's</span> 
counsel, <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Guerrero, appeared; that 
Petitioner-Administrator, through counsel, was notified of the hearing of the 
motion for reconsideration, amending the order of <st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1982">February 19, 1982</st1:date>, but neither petitioner nor his counsel 
appeared.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, Respondent Judge amended his order of February 19, 
1982, so that the whole of parcels 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 
22, 25, 26, 28, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35; and one-third of parcels 23, 24, and 
27 were excluded from the Inventory and the possession thereof in <span class="SpellE">Oppositor</span> <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> was maintained (Annex N, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, p. 76).<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner's Motion 
for Reconsideration of the above order was later denied for want of merit (Annex 
O, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, 77).</p>
<p class="BODY">Another hearing of the case was called on <st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1982">April 15, 1982</st1:date> but only Atty. <span class="SpellE">Wilfredo</span> Guerrero for Private Respondents herein 
appeared.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner and his counsel were both absent.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the application of the principle of due process, what is sought 
to be safeguarded is not lack of previous notice but the denial of opportunity 
to be heard (<span class="SpellE"><em>Cornejo</em></span><em> vs. Secretary of 
Justice</em>, L-32818, June 28, 1974, 57 SCRA 663).<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent 
Judge afforded Petitioner and his counsel ample opportunity to be heard at the 
hearings of <st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1982">February 24, 
1982</st1:date> and <st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1982">April 15, 
1982</st1:date>, but Petitioner and his counsel were absent at those 
hearings.<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that petitioner was afforded 
opportunity to be heard and he even later filed motions for reconsideration of 
the challenged orders.<span>&nbsp; </span>Even assuming that Petitioner was not given 
prior notice of the various motions of private respondents or her rejoinders, it 
has been held that there is no denial of due process where the adverse parties 
<span>were given the opportunity to file a motion for reconsideration of an 
order which was issued pursuant to a petition filed without prior notice to them 
(<span class="SpellE"><em>Dormitorio</em></span><em> vs. Fernandez</em>, L-25897, 
August 21, 1976, 72 SCRA 388).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>As the assailed orders of </span><st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1982"><span>February 19, 1982</span></st1:date><span>, 
</span><st1:date month="2" day="24" year="1982"><span>February 24, 
1982</span></st1:date><span> and </span><st1:date month="4" day="15" year="1982"><span>April 15, 1982</span></st1:date><span>, do not appear to have 
been issued with grave abuse of discretion, said orders cannot be set 
aside.<span>&nbsp; </span>In said orders, Respondent Judge provisionally passed upon 
the question of exclusion of property from the Inventory.<span>&nbsp; </span>His 
conclusions regarding the ownership of said properties are not final but 
provisional.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><em>Barreto</em></span><em> 
Realty Development, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals</em>, 131 SCRA 606, this Court 
stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE"><span>x</span></span><span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>even with such presumption and refusal, the 
respondent court still acted within its jurisdiction and not with grave abuse of 
discretion.<span>&nbsp; </span>After all, the juris<span>prudence and rule are both 
to the effect that the probate court 'may' provisionally pass upon the question 
of exclusion, not ‘should'.<span>&nbsp; </span>The obvious reason is the probate 
court's limited jurisdiction and the principle that questions of title or 
ownership, which result to inclusion in or exclusion from the inventory of 
property, can only be settled in a separate action.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hence, even if 
respondent court presumed all the way that the properties sold by <span class="SpellE">Drepin</span> to petitioner were part of <span class="SpellE">Drepin's</span> <span class="GramE">estate, that</span> would not 
prevent nor defeat petitioner's remedy in a separate suit." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Pio</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Barreto</em></span><em> Realty Development, Inc. vs. Court of 
Appeals</em>, L-62431-33, August 31, 1984, 131 SCRA 606,

<p class="BODY">The final determination of the ownership of the properties in 
question in the case at bar, is not to be made in the Intestate Proceedings, Sp. 
Proc. 754-IV, but in Civil Case No. 1128-IV which is the separate Civil Action 
to Quiet Title, filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte.<span>&nbsp; </span>The assailed orders of exclusion 
in the intestate proceed<span>ings are merely interlocutory orders, because the 
question of title of the properties excluded from the Inventory of the 
Administrator cannot be determined by the intestate court. <span>&nbsp;</span>In an 
earlier case, this Court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"We hold that the order of exclusion dated <st1:date month="8" day="9" year="1973">August 9, 1973</st1:date> was not a final order.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It was interlocutory in the sense that it did not settle once and for all 
the title to the <st1:place><st1:placename>San Lorenzo</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Village</st1:placetype></st1:place> lots.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
probate court in the inclusion incident could not determine the question of 
title." <span class="GramE">(<em>Valero Vda. de Rodriquez vs. Court of 
Appeals</em>, L-39532, July 20, 1979, 91 SCRA 540).</span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Reliance of Petitioners on the pronouncements made in the case of 
<em>Coca vs. Pangilinan</em>, L-29547, January 31, 1978 (81 SCRA 278-285) that 
after the issues have been joined and in case no amicable settlement had been 
reached, the probate court should receive evidence or conduct a full dress 
hearing on the motion in the form of complaint, is not applicable to the case at 
bar.<span>&nbsp; </span>In <em>Coca vs. Pangilinan</em>, the <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> therein did not institute a separate action to 
determine the ownership of the twelve (12) hectares or portion of the estate 
involved.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because of this circumstance, it was ruled that it would 
be just, expeditious and inexpensive solution to require the heirs of Francisco 
<span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span> to file in the intestate proceedings, a 
motion in the form of complaint setting forth therein their claim for the twelve 
(12) hectares portion which the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, should then file their Answer 
there<span>to.<span>&nbsp; </span>After the issues have been joined and no amicable 
settlement reached, the probate court should receive 
evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">However, in the case at bar, there was already a separate 
<span>action </span>that had been filed by respondents <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> in Civil Case No. 1128-IV of the CFI of <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte for the quieting of title over the properties 
excluded from the Inventory before the assailed orders in this case were 
issued.<span>&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Llanes</span> opted to file 
a separate civil action and this was aright she could exercise.</p>
<blockquote>"The general rule is that question of title to property cannot be 
passed upon in a testate or intestate proceeding.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, when 
the parties are all heirs of the decedent, <span>it is optional upon them to 
submit to the probate court the question of title to property and, when so 
submitted, the probate court may definitely pass judgment thereon." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Sebial</em></span><em> vs. Sebial</em>, 
L-23419, June 27, 1975, 64 SCRA 385).</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The second issue raised by Petitioner Administrator as to whether 
or not the exclusion of the properties in question by the lower court was 
arbitrary for being based mainly on the Special Administrator's Inventory-Report 
on the Status and Possession of Properties, which report has no valid 
basis.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner is raising a factual issue which is not a proper 
subject of <i>certiorari</i> proceedings. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Ygay</em></span><em> vs. Escareal</em>, L-44189, February 28, 
1985, 135 SCRA <span>78, 82).</span></span><span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">As to whether or not private respondents' claim of possession 
and/or ownership based on the alleged documents of sale, donation and oral 
contract of sale has any factual or legal basis, again the same should not be 
resolved at this time and by means of a special civil action for 
<i>certiorari</i>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The resolution of the conflicting ownership 
claims should be threshed out in the separate civil action (Civil Case No. 
1128-IV), already filed by Private Respondent <span class="SpellE">Iluminada</span> <span class="SpellE">Pobre</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
a similar question, <span class="GramE">We</span> ruled:</p>
<blockquote>"Even assuming the truth of the private respondents' allegations 
that the sale of December 29, 1971 was effected under suspicious circumstances 
and tainted with fraud and that the right of <span class="SpellE">Rufina</span> as 
alleged half-sister and sole heir of Irene remains open to question, these 
issues may only be threshed out in a separate civil action filed by the 
respondent administrator against the petitioner and not in the intestate 
proceedings." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE"><em>Quizon</em></span><em> 
vs. Ramolete</em>, L-51291, May 29, 1984, 129 SCRA 495; 501).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
