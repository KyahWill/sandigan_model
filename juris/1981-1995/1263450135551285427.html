in excess of jurisdiction and/or with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the
questioned order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the parties have
submitted their respective pleadings, the petition was given due course and was
deemed submitted for decision by a resolution<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">8</span></span></a> of this Court dated <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="5">May 14, 1980</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition proceedings under Rule
65 of the Rules of Court, there is, on the part of the petitioner, an emphatic
assertion of violation of petitioner's constitutional and statutory rights when
respondent Judge issued the questioned order of August 27, 1979 which cited him
for indirect contempt of court and suspended him indefinitely from the practice
of law in total disregard of the fundamental safeguards of procedural due
process such <span style="">as
</span>notice to petitioner that he was to be tried that day for indirect
contempt, a reasonable time and opportunity to submit his written explanation,
opportunity to present witnesses in his own behalf, opportunity to be heard of
the charge for indirect contempt because what was heard on August 27, 1979 was
petitioner's motion for disqualification, violating therefore Rule 71, Section
3 of the Rules of Court which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indirect <span class="SpellE">contempts</span> to <span style="">be </span>punished after charge and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After charge in writing has been filed, and
an opportunity given to the accused to be heard by himself or counsel, a person
guilty of any of the following acts may be punished for contempt:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span>"<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the indefinite suspension imposed upon him from the practice of
law, petitioner maintained that respondent Judge took this action without
regard to Rule 71, Section 6 of the Rules of Court, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Punishment
if found guilty</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If the accused <span style="">is </span>thereupon
adjudged guilty of contempt committed against a superior court or judge, he may
be <u>fined not exceeding one thousand pesos or imprisoned not more than </u><u><span style="">six </span></u><u><span style="">6 months, or both</span></u><span style="">; if adjudged guilty of contempt committed
against an inferior court or judge, he may be fined not exceeding one hundred
pesos or imprisoned not more than one (1) month, or both, and if the contempt
con</span><span style="">sists
in </span><span style="">the violation of an
injunction, he may also be ordered to </span><span style="">make </span><span style="">complete restitution to the party injured by such violation."
(Underscoring ours).</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is clear from the foregoing provision
that the imposable penalty, if the accused <span style="">is, </span>after hearing, adjudged guilty of
contempt committed against a superior court or judge, is fine not exceeding one
thousand pesos or imprisonment of not more than <span style="">six (6) </span>months, or both.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner also stressed that Rule 138, Section 30 of a the Rules
of Court <span class="SpellE">mandatorily</span> requires that "No attorney
shall be removed or suspended from the practice of his profession, until he has
full opportunity upon reasonable notice to answer the charges against him, to
produce witnesses in his own behalf, and to be heard by himself or
counsel." No clearer demand for the observance of procedural process can
be imagined before a lawyer is removed or suspended from the practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, respondent Judge Gregorio U. <span class="SpellE">Aquilizan</span>,
in his comment, pointed out that when petitioner was asked during the joint
hearing of CAR Case No. 1912 and CAR Case No. 3271 on August 27, 1979 as to his
reasons for failing to comply with the order of June 19, 1979, petitioner
responded that he did not receive the said order which, according to
respondent, was received on July 11, 1979.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent also contended that petitioner promised to submit the necessary
papers substantiating his claim that he never received the resolution of <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1978</st1:date> and that of <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1979</st1:date> within the period of
one <span style="">(1) </span>month but instead
decided to argue his case with the Honorable Tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent judge, noticeably, did not reason out his order of
indefinite suspension from the practice of law in his comment, not until after
he filed his opposition to the reply of petitioner wherein he alleged that it
was <span style="">based on grounds of "<span class="SpellE">wilful</span> disobedience of any <span style="">lawful order of </span>superior court" as provided for under Section
27, Rule 138 of the </span>Rules of Court inasmuch as petitioner continued <span style="">to </span>ignore the Honorable Court's
resolution, orders, and notices of hearing claiming not to have received said
notices when the records clearly show that he received all of them.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">9</span></span></a> In
addition, respondent cited Section 14, P. D. No. 946 in relation to Section 28,
Rule 138 of the Rules of Court in arguing that the Court of Agrarian Relations,
possessing "all the powers and prerogatives inherent in or belonging to
the Court of First Instance," has likewise the power to suspend a lawyer
from the practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fundamentally, therefore, the decisive issue in these two (2)
cases before Us pertains to the all important issue of procedural due
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Definitely, the inquiry here
reflects more on the manner with which the contempt and sus­pension powers of
courts of justice were exercised by respon­dent judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">From what may be gathered from the records of the instant case,
We are convinced of petitioner's plea of denial of procedural due process of
law; first, on the procedure adopted for indirect contempt against petitioner;
and second, on the procedure followed in his indefinite suspen­sion from the
practice of law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the proceedings for
indirect contempt against the petitioner, the </span>grave error of the
respondent judge is manifest when, under the circumstances disclosed in the
records, petitioner was denied his right to notice of hearing, to have his day
in court and present witnesses <span style="">in his </span>behalf,
a reasonable time to <span style="">explain in </span>writing
why he should not be cited for indirect contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claimed that he did not receive the order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1979</st1:date> which, according to the
respondent judge, was received on <st1:date year="1979" day="11" month="7">July
 11, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it is beyond
Our domain to ascertain the conflicting factual incidents alleged by both
parties, nevertheless, it is arguable that if petitioner<span style=""> did in fact receive the said order of June 19, 1979, fairness requires
that at least, respondent judge should have given the petitioner reasonable
time to explain in writing why he should not be cited for indirect
contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An order directing petitioner
to explain in writing or to show cause constitute, under the law, the written
charge for indirect contempt contemplated under Section 3, Rule 71.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, in reality, a compelling mandate of
procedural due process, with its stress on fairness, that petitioner be
afforded a reasonable time and opportunity by giving a definite period within
which to submit a written explanation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, Section <span style="">3, </span>Rule
71 requires that there must be a hearing of the indirect contempt charge after
notice thereof is validly served on the person charged with indirect
contempt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As adverted to earlier, an
order requiring petitioner to submit a written explanation constitutes the
written <span style="">charge for indirect contempt,
and at the </span><span style="">same time serves as </span><span style="">notice
of said charge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, such notice
cannot by all means, be considered as a notice of hearing itself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two notices are different, for they have
distinct object and purpose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it is noteworthy that during the scheduled joint
hearing of CAR Case No. 1912 and CAR Case No. 3271 respondent judge, at the
start of the proceedings, inquired from petitioner <span class="SpellE">Balasabas</span>
as to his explanation, and petitioner explained, in open court, that he was out
of office for almost three (3) months and would make it of record that he and
his family met a vehicular accident; that he was seriously injured, his brother
died, his father is physically disabled, his mother died last July 1979, his
aunt and the helpers were also injured and that there were 15 of them in the
hospital.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">10</span></span></a> <span class="SpellE">Inspite</span> of such oral explanation, respondent judge issued
on that same day the questioned order of <st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without being overly technical, such an oral explanation given by the
petitioner sufficiently satisfies, under the circumstances, what <span style="">was </span>sought for by respondent in his
order of <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, respondent judge should have
given petitioner ample opportunity to substantiate his explanation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The non-observance of the fundamental right of due process as
enunciated above manifests arbitrariness, unfairness and injustice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court frowns upon <span style="">proceedings </span>which
depart from the solemn adherence to the tenets of justice and fairness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court too has its responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regard for the requirements of due process of
law inescapably imposes upon it an exercise of judgment upon the whole course
of the proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As this Court <span style="">said, </span>thru
Justice Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, the due process clause is
designed to secure justice as a living reality,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">11</span></span></a> especially so, it may be
postulated, when courts exercise this inherent power to punish for contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">A contempt of court has been distinctly described as an offense
against the State not against the judge personally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge should always bear in mind that the
power of the court to punish for contempt should be exercised for purposes that
are impersonal, because that power is intended as a safeguard not for the
judges as persons, but for the functions that they exercise.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">12</span></span></a>
Rightly then, such power of the courts must be used sparingly in a preservative
and not on the vindictive principle, and must be used on the corrective rather
than on the retaliatory idea of punish­ment.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13</span></span></a> In this regard, when one is
charged with contempt of court, the proceedings attendant thereto partake of
the nature of a criminal action<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">14</span></span></a> even when the acts complained of
is an incident of a civil action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
case at bar, the respondent judge did not observe the procedure outlined in
Rule 71 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">That is not all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
worse, to Our mind, is the fact that respondent judge not only cited petitioner
for indirect contempt in open court; he summarily suspended him indefinitely
from the practice of law in violation of the procedure prescribed under Rule
138 and 139 of the Rules of Court relative to suspension of lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner here was indefinitely suspended
unless he explains satisfactorily and meritoriously his failure to comply with
the resolution of the court dated <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="6">June
 19, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, pending
the submission of a satisfactory and meritorious explanation, he is, under all
circumstances, already placed under indefinite suspension.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event that he submits an explanation
which the court may find not satisfactory and meritorious, the indefinite
suspension would go on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an
indefinite suspension meted out as a penalty for alleged indirect contempt is
absolutely not permitted under the law and jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is tantamount to disbarment without due
process of law not sanctioned by the provisions of Rule 138 and Rule 139 of the
Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The order of <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="6">June 19,
 1979</st1:date>, construed as a notice that petitioner is charged with indirect
contempt cannot be considered as a notice to explain in writing why he should
not be suspended from the practice of law.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As early as 1920, this Court ruled that the notice served upon a lawyer
to appear before a Judge of the Court of First Instance and show cause why he
should not be sentenced for contempt, cannot be considered as a notice to show
cause why he should not be suspended from the practice of his profession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These things are different; they have
distinct objects and for each of them a different procedure is established.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">15</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, respondent judge should have limited his
ruling on the charges of indirect contempt.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under the provisions of Section 6 Rule 71 of the Rules of Court which
prescribe in categorical language the punishment for contempt, suspension from
the practice of law is not indicated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that a Court of Agrarian Relations under P. D. 946,
like a Court of First Instance, may suspend a<span style=""> lawyer "for <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> disobedience of any
lawful order of a superior court" pursuant to Section 27 Rule 138 or may
suspend on other grounds other than those enumerated by said provision,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">16</span></span></a><span style=""> notwithstanding such broad power to suspend,
suspension must not be meted as a punishment for indirect contempt which has
its own corresponding penalty, as provided by the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granting, <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span>,
that suspension falls within the domain of the inherent power of courts to
punish for contempt, nevertheless, respondent judge should have exercised such
broad power in full observance of the rules on suspension and disbarment
specifically provided for under Rule 139 of the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Suspension from the practice of law requires an entirely separate
procedure under the Rules with all the attendant constitutional and statutory
safeguards of procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
should have applied Section 6, Rule 71 on punishment for indirect contempt not
Section 27 Rule 138 on suspension and removal of lawyers from the practice of
law which is entirely a different matter requiring different procedure as to
motion or complaint, service of motion or complaint, investigation, hearing,
confidentiality of investigation, etc.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear that under Section 29 of Rule 138 that upon such suspension
by the Court of Appeals or the Court of First Instance, either court shall forthwith
transmit to the Supreme Court a certified copy of the order of suspension and a
full statement of the facts upon which the same was based.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of such certified copy and
statement, the Supreme Court shall make full investigation of the facts
involved and make such order revoking or extend­ing the suspension, or removing
the attorney from his office as such, as the facts warrant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, in view of the foregoing, the Order issued by
the Court of Agrarian Relations dated <st1:date year="1979" day="27" month="8">August
