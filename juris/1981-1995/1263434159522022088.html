of the Court <span style="">of </span>Appeals in
C.A.-G. R. SP Nos. 11090-93 which nullified the order of Branch 46 of the
Regional Trial Court<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> (RTC)
of Pangasinan in CAR Cases Nos. 760-802 and 806-810 dated 29 October 1985.  The order adverted to dismissed the said
cases for lack of jurisdiction and advised the parties to file the same before
the Ministry of Agrarian Reform.</p>

<p class="BODY">In issue then is the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Courts
over agrarian cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts, as gathered from the pleadings, are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">In June of 1972, twenty-seven (27) complaints were filed by the
private respondents or their predecessors-in-interest against petitioner
Antonio Tiongson with the defunct Court of Agrarian Relations in Urdaneta,
Pangasinan; these cases were docketed as CAR Cases Nos. 1842-TP’72 to
1875-TP’72.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The complaints sought (a) a change from share tenancy to the leasehold system,
(b) the fixing of legal rentals, and (c) the award of damages.  Complainants claimed to be the tenants in
the petitioner's landholding in Pinmaludpod, Urdaneta, Pangasinan, and alleged
that with the declaration of the area where the said landholding is located as
a land reform area, their tenancy relationship with the petitioner
automatically became one governed by the leasehold system.  In his Answer, petitioner denied the
material allegations in the complaints; asserted as special and affirmative
defenses that based on the milling contract, the subject landholding is
primarily devoted to sugarcane and that the private respondents are not tenants
but mere seasonal or hired laborers working thereon who have no right to demand
a shift to the leasehold system; and set up counterclaims for damages and
attorney's fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pre-trial then ensued and was terminated on 15 December
1972.  The initial joint hearing on the
merits set for 11 and 12 May 1973 was postponed and reset for 4 June 1973
because of the possibility of an amicable settlement.  During the next two (2) hearings scheduled after the
postponement, however, the private respondents failed to appear despite due
notice.  This prompted the court to
dismiss the complaints without prejudice for failure to prosecute, but allowed
the petitioner to present his evidence <i>ex-parte</i> in support of his
countercIaims.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Following an urgent <i><span style="">ex-parte </span></i>motion
filed by the petitioner to prohibit private respondents from entering his
landholding, the court, in an order dated 7 November 1973, commanded the
private respondents to refrain from entering the landholding in question and to
stop molesting and disturbing the petitioner's possession and cultivation
thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
On 10 June 1974, the Court of Agrarian Relations promulgated a decision
ordering private respondents to pay the petitioner P200.00 as attorney's fees;
dismissing all other claims and/or counterclaims of the petitioner; and making
permanent the interlocutory order dated 7 November 1973.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondents appealed this decision to the Court of Appeals which
docketed the same as C.A.-G.R. Nos. SP 03165-91.  On 1 April 1976, the said court promulgated its decision
declaring the lower court's order of 7 November 1973 as temporary in nature
until after the issue of tenancy shall have been resolved and holding that the
private respondents may refile their complaints within a reasonable time.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, in June of 1978, the private respondents filed,
against the petitioner, new cases before Branch 46 of the RTC of Pangasinan for
the change of share tenancy to the leasehold system and for the fixing of
rentals.  The cases were docketed as CAR
Cases Nos. 760-802-UP’78 and 806-810-UP’78.  After the answers with counterclaims were filed, the private respondents
moved for the withdrawal of the complaints and/or their referral to the then
Ministry of Agrarian Reform (MAR) pursuant to Presidential Decree (P.D.) No.
946.  After hearing the opposition
thereto, the court resolved to deny the motion.  Again, the private respondents moved to dismiss their
counterclaim and/or refer the same -- together with the petitioner's opposition
thereto, the motion for liquidation and the amendment and supplement to the
latter -- to the MAR.  Acting thereon,
the trial court, then presided over by respondent Judge Juanito Cagampan,
issued on 29 October 1985 an order<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> the
dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing considerations, the
above-entitled cases are hereby dismissed for lack of jurisdiction thus
consequently the counterclaim of the defendant as well as its motion for
liquidation become of no consequence.  The parties are hereby advised to file their causes of action before the
Ministry of Agrarian Reform, the proper forum.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner challenged this order in a petition for <i>certiorari </i>and
<i>mandamus </i>which he filed with the public respondent Court of Appeals and
which was docketed therein as C.A.-G.R. SP Nos. 11090-93.  The principal issue raised therein was
whether or not the trial court acted with grave abuse of discretion in
dismissing the cases and in denying the petitioner's motion for accounting and
liquidation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 25 May 1988, public respondent promulgated its decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the dispositive portion of which reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the petition is hereby granted;
accordingly, the questioned Order dated October 29, 1985, is declared null and
void, and the lower court is directed to assume jurisdiction over the cases
before it insofar <span style="">as </span>the
defendant’s motion for liquidation is concerned, after which, the proceedings
shall be suspended to allow the Ministry (now Department) of Agrarian Reform to
certify whether or not the cases are proper for trial.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It supported this disposit<span style="">i</span>on
with the following disquisitions:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Nowhere in the entire body of<i> </i>agrarian reform laws or
its implementing rules and regulations is there a provision sustaining the
lower court's Order in question.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Notably, Section 12 of P.D. No. 946, a portion of which is quoted
by the lower court in its Order, is a general provision <span style="">on </span>the jurisdiction, original and exclusive, of the Court of
Agrarian Relations over the subject matter of agrarian disputes.  The portion quoted in the questioned Order
admits a (sic) proviso wherein <u><span style="">matters</span></u><span style=""> <u>involving</u> </span><u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">administrative</span></u><span style=""> <u>implementation</u> <u>of</u></span> <u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> <u>transfer</u> <u>of</u></span><span style="">
</span><u><span style="">land</span></u><span style="">, </span>etc. is cognizable by the Secretary
of Agrarian Reform (emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The case at bar does not involve the administrative implementation
of the transfer of land.  Rather, the
issues raised are whether or <span style="">not </span>the
plaintiffs are the tenants of the landholding and whether or not the subject
lands are primarily devoted to corn or sugarcane.  We believe that the jurisdiction to determine these issues
properly belongs to the lower court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>However, since the instant case involves the issue of tenancy
wherein the defendant <span style="">as </span>landowner
denies the existence and further claims that the land is not primarily devoted
to corn but to sugarcane which could result in ejectment, referral to the
Ministry of Agrarian Reform <span style="">is </span>mandatory,
<span style="">in </span>which case suspension of the
proceedings is proper.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>As provided in the penultimate paragraph of Section 12, P.D. No.
946:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'SEC. 12.  [<i>penultimate
par.</i>].  No judge of the Courts of
Agrarian Relations, Courts of First Instance, municipal or city courts, or any
other tribunal or fiscal shall take cognizance of any ejectment case or any
other case designed to harass or remove <span style="">a
</span><span style="">tenant of an agricultural </span>land
primarily devoted to rice and/or corn, <span style="">unless
</span>certified by the Secretary of Agrarian Reform as a proper case for trial
or hearing by a Court or Judge or other officer of competent jurisdiction, and
if any such case is filed, the case shall first be referred to the Secretary of
Agrarian Reform or his authorized representative in the locality for a
preliminary determination of the relationship between the contending
parties.  If the Secretary of Agrarian
Reform or his authorized representative in the locality finds the case is (sic)
a proper case for the Court or Judge or other hearing officer to hear, he shall
so certify and such Court, Judge or other hearing officer may assume
jurisdiction over <span style="">the </span>dispute or
controversy.'</p>

<blockquote>This brings Us to the issue of liquidation
of the harvest during the referral period or when the jurisdiction of the court
is temporarily suspended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A leading authority on agrarian laws, retired Ju<span style="">s</span>tice Milagros A. German (now Special
Consultant of the Department of Agrarian Reform) <span style="">is </span>of the opinion as inscribed in her book:  <u>The</u><span style=""> </span><u>Agrarian</u> <u>Law</u> <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>New</u>

<p class="2Q">The foregoing case illustrates that, although the jurisdiction of
the Court is temporarily suspended, where an interlocutory order must be issued
to determine temporarily to whom the harvest shall <span style="">go </span>or shall belong during the pendency of the referral, the
Court on motion of either of the parties can virtually <span style="">reassume </span>jurisdiction on account of the fact that the DAR Team
Office does not have the power to issue an interlocutory order, much less
enforce one if ever at all it has dated to do so.</p>

<blockquote>The exponent substantiates her opinion by
citing the case of Santos v. Santos, CAR Case No. 1404-P (1974), wherein the
court, on motion for the supervision or temporary division of harvest to
protect the interest of the parties without waiting for the MAR certification,
reassumed jurisdiction and issued an order for the temporary liquidation of the
palay harvest."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question that at the time the complaints in CAR
Cases Nos. 760-802-UP'78 and 806-810-UP'78 were filed, the RTC of Pangasinan
had no jurisdiction over them pursuant to Section 12 (a) and (b) of P.D. No.
946 which invested the then Courts of Agrarian Relations with original
exclusive jurisdiction over cases involving rights granted and obligations
imposed by presidential issuances promulgated in relation to the agrarian
reform program.  However, when Batas
Pambansa Blg. 129, otherwise known as the Judiciary Reorganization Act of 1980,
took effect, the Courts of Agrarian Relations were integrated into the Regional
Trial Courts and the jurisdiction of the former was vested in the latter
courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It can thus be seen that at the time Branch 46 of the RTC of
Pangasinan dismissed the agrarian cases on 29 October 1985, Regional Trial
Courts already had jurisdiction over agrarian disputes.  The issue that logically crops up then is
whether Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 automatically conferred upon the aforesaid
Branch 46 jurisdiction over the subject agrarian cases considering that these
cases were filed seven (7) years earlier at a time when only the Courts of
Agrarian Relations had exclusive original jurisdiction over them.  We rule that it did not, for such a defect
is fatal.  Besides, the grant of
jurisdiction to the Regional Trial Courts over agrarian cases was not meant to
have any retroactive effect.  Batas
Pambansa Blg. 129 does not provide for such retroactivity.  The trial court did not then err in dismissing
the cases.  What puzzles Us,<span style=""> </span>however, is the unreasonable delay
that characterized the disposition of the cases.  Be that as it may, it likewise appears that the parties
themselves exerted no special efforts to expedite the determination of their
respective rights.  The conspiracy of
inaction is simply astounding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Doubtless, if Batas Pambansa Blg. 129 were to be accorded
retroactive application and no subsequent law was enacted that would have
affected the jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court over agrarian cases, the
challenged decision would be correct.  But this is not the case.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 July 1987, the President of the Republic of the Philippines
promulgated Executive Order (E.O.) No. 229<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
providing for the mechanisms for the implementation of the Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Program instituted by Proclamation No. 131 dated 22 July
1987.  Section 17 thereof provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 17.  <i><span style="">Quasi-</span>Judicial Powers of the DAR.</i>  -- The DAR is hereby vested with
quasi-judicial powers to determine and adjudicate agrarian reform matters, and
shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all matters involving
implementation of agrarian reform, except those falling under the exclusive
original jurisdiction of the DENR and the Department of Agriculture (DA).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The decisions of the DAR may, in proper cases, be appealed to the
Regional Trial Courts but shall be immediately executory notwithstanding such
appeal."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision not only repealed Section 12 (a) and (b) of P.D.
No. 946,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
it also divested the Regional Trial Court of its general jurisdiction over
agrarian cases under Section 19 (7) of B.P. Blg. 129.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The abovequoted Section 17 of E.O. No. 229 was the governing law
at the time the challenged decision was promulgated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then, too, Section 50 of R.A. No. 6657, the Comprehensive
Agrarian Reform Law, substantially reiterates said Section 17 while Sections 56
and 57 provide for the designation by this Court of at least one (1) branch of
the Regional Trial Court in each province to act as a special agrarian court
which shall have exclusive original jurisdiction only over petitions for the
determination of just compensation and the prosecution of criminal offenses
under said Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <i>Quismundo vs. Court of </i><i><span style="">Appeal</span>s</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court, speaking thru Mr. Justice
Florenz D. Regalado, declared:</p>

<blockquote>"However, with the enactment of Executive Order No. 229, which
took effect on August 29, 1987, fifteen (15) days after its release for
publication in the Official Gazette [83 O.G. (Supp. No. 30) 3422-0-36, <span style="">July </span>27, 1987 issue], the regional
trial courts were divested of their general jurisdiction to try agrarian reform
matters.  The said jurisdiction is now
vested in the Department of Agrarian Reform.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, in the case at bar, the Regional Trial Court of <span style="">Angeles City, </span>at the time private
respondents filed their complaint, was already bereft of authority to act on
the same.  The allegation of private
respondents that their complaint was filed on November 3, 1987, and not on
February 13, 1988 as found by the Court of Appeals, is immaterial since as of
either date Executive Order No. 229 was already in effect.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The foregoing holding is further sustained by the passage of
Republic Act No. 6657, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Law, which took effect
on June 15, 1988.  The said law contains
provisions which evince and support the intention of the legislature to vest in
the Department of Agrarian Reform exclusive jurisdiction over all agrarian
reform matters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 50 of said Act substantially reiterates Section 17 of
Executive Order No. 229 vesting in the Department of Agrarian Reform exclusive
and original jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of
agrarian reform, to wit:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'<span style="">SECTION 50.  </span><i>Quasi-Judicial Powers of the DAR</i>.

and adjudicate agrarian reform matters and shall have exclusive original
jurisdiction over all matters involving the implementation of agrarian reform,
except those falling <span style="">under </span>the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department
of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR).'</p>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>In addition, Sections 56 and 57 thereof provide for the designation
by the Supreme Court of at least one (1) branch of the regional trial court
within each province to act as a special agrarian court.  The said special court shall have original
and exclusive jurisdiction only over petitions for the determination of just
compensation to landowners and the prosecution of criminal offenses under s<span style="">aid </span>Act.  Said provisions thus delimit the jurisdiction of the regional
trial courts in agrarian cases only to these two instances.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is also worth noting at this juncture that the resolution of
this case by the Department of Agrarian Reform is to the best advantage of
private respondents since it is in a better position to resolve agrarian
disputes, being the administrative agency possessing the necessary expertise on
the matter.  Further, the proceedings
therein are summary in nature and the department is not bound by technical
rules of procedure and evidence, to the end t<span style="">h</span>at agrarian reform disputes and other issues will be
