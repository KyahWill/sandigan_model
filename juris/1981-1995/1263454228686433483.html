is the correctness of the Order for the issuance of the Alias Writ of Execution
by the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch VI, in Civil Case No. 9490,
which was affirmed by the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. SP-12295, making
petitioner Zenith Insurance Corporation liable for more than the amount of the
bond it had issued in favor of its principal, William B. Murphy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The controversy stemmed
from the following facts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On September 5, 1966,
William B. Murphy filed a case for collection of a sum of money, accounting and
damages, in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch VI, Pasig, against
private respondent Pedro Mejorada (Civil Case No. 9490).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Murphy likewise prayed for a Writ of
Preliminary Attachment, which the Trial Court granted upon a bond of
P250,000.00 issued by petitioner Zenith Insurance Corporation in favor of
Murphy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">After hearing on the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">From the said Decision,
Murphy and petitioner, as surety, appealed to the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No.
53497-R).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pending appeal, and upon motion
of respondent, judgment was partially executed in the amount of P115,680.55.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On May 22, 1979, the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Murphy moved for
reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was denied by the
Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Murphy then appealed
by way of <i>Certiorari</i> to this Court (G.R. No. 53536).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pe­tition was denied for late filing in
this Court's Reso­lution of June 13, 1980.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, private respondent proceeded against the balance of
petitioner's attachment bond coverage, and collected P80,000.00 on July 24,
1980 and P54,319.45 on August 15, 1980, adding up to the full value of the bond
of P250,000.00, including the amount of P115,680.55 already partially
executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent acknow­ledged
the last payment on August 15, 1980 to be "in full satisfaction of the
writ of execution issued."</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 26, 1980, private respondent filed a Motion for the
Issuance of an Alias Writ of Execution to enforce the judgment award.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Trial Court initial­ly denied alias
execution as against petitioner on January 26, 1981, reasoning that, in
executing the judg­ment, only the dispositive portion is to be looked into in
the absence of such ambiguity as would justify resort to the body of the
Decision, and that as the judgment is clear, the liability of petitioner is
confined to the amount of the bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent moved for reconsideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On April 9, 1981, the Trial Court issued the
questioned Order reconsidering its Order of January 26, 1981, and granting the
Motion for the issuance of an Alias Writ <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of
Execution, petitioner's liability "not (being) limited </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

by private respondent, there having intervened malice and bad faith" on
petitioner's part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alias Writ was issued
and served upon petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter's
cash deposit at the Commercial Bank and Trust Company, Escolta Branch, and at
the Philippine Bank of Communications, Juan Luna Branch, were garnished.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed with the Court of Appeals, a Peti­tion for
"<i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with Preliminary Mandatory
Injunction" (CA-G.R. No. SP-12295) imputing grave abuse of discretion to
respondent Judge in the issuance of the Order of April 9, 1981 granting the
Alias Writ.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On May 21, 1981,
respondent Court of Appeals upheld the Alias Writ of Execution, petitioner's
"solidary lia­bility (having) been clearly pronounced by this Court in
case CA-G.R. No. 53497-R" when it held that petitioner is equally liable
for all the damages that resulted from the wrongful issuance of the writ (of
attach­ment)." Petitioner moved for reconsideration arguing that liability
on the attachment bond is not to be confounded with liability on the judgment,
and that its liability cannot exceed the amount of the attach­ment bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reconsideration was denied for lack of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed the present Petition stating that respondent
Judge acted without or in excess of juris­diction in issuing the Order for the
issuance of the Alias Writ of Execution for the further enforcement of the
judgment against petitioner; and that respond­ent Court of Appeals acted with
grave abuse of dis­cretion or erred in sustaining the said Order consi­dering
that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>private
respondent has been paid the full value of the P250,000.00 attachment bond
posted by petitioner for plaintiff, as required by the judgment and has, upon
receipt of the last installment completing such payment, acknowledged the same
to be 'in full satisfaction of the writ of execution';</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the alias writ of execution would have
petitioner surety company satisfy, not the judgment with respect to the damages
resulting from the wrongful issuance of the writ of at­tachment, but the
judgment on the causes of action asserted by defendant (herein private
respondent) in his counterclaims against plaintiff;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the alias writ of execution would have
petitioner surety company pay more than the value of the attach­ment bond, in
disregard of the express limitation in the judgment of its liability to the
value of the bond as well as of settled jurisprudence."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 16, 1981, we issued a Temporary Restraining Order
enjoining enforcement of the Order dated April 9, 1981, and on November 4,
1981, we resolved to give due course and required the filing of Memoranda by
the parties, which they have done.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The only issue to be
determined in this Petition is whether or not respondent Court committed grave
abuse of discretion in ordering the issuance of the Alias Writ of Execution
making petitioner solidarily liable for all costs and damages, or, for more
than the amount of its bond.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We find for petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that in CA-G.R. No. 53497-R (the appeal from the Trial
Court's Decision), petitioner was pronounced "equally liable with its
principal for all damages sustained resulting from the wrong­ful issuance of
the Writ (of Preliminary Attachment)".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The phrase “all damages" refers to those resulting from the
undertaking itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not mean
that the surety is answerable for all costs and damages that may be adjudged
against its principal over and above what is adjudged against it in the
dispositive portion of the Decision, as it would be unreasonable to expand
petitioner's liability for any and all amounts arising from the case as if it
were a "solidary judgment debtor."</p>

Luzon Surety Co., Inc. 68 SCRA 207 (1975), which increased the surety's liabi­lity
beyond the maximum of the bond by making it liable to pay interest because of
its failure to pay its obli­gation on demand, does not apply in this case,
because petitioner herein has settled its obligation, and its liability had
already been fully satisfied, unlike in the cited case where the increased
liability was "not because of the contract but because of the default and
the necessity of judicial collection".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
