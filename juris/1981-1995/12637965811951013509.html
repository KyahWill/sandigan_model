				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>,
Deputy Sheriff of the Court of First Instance, Branch IV, <span class="SpellE">Bauang</span>,
La Union, was charged with "grave abuse of authority, insubordination and
conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service" under an
administrative complaint dated <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="6">June
 18, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was
referred to Hon. Angel A. <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span>, Acting Presiding
Judge of said Court for investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his answer to what he described as
"the unfounded administrative complaint of the Honorable Administrator of
the Supreme Court," <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> did nothing more
than to invoke Section 19, Article IV of the "New Constitution of the
Philippines", dealing with the rights of an accused in a criminal
prosecution, in as much as, according to him, he had a "pending Criminal
Case at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span><span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
Court ** for:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Violation of Republic Act
No. 3019, Sub-paragraph (e)".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hearings were thereafter had on the charges before Judge <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Daquigan</span></span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">,</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> the respondent <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>
being </span>represented at all said hearings by counsel, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Ponciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Arnobit</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> testified
in his own behalf.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also presented the
testimony of his wife, and that of a police officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He submitted, too, documentary proofs,
inclusive of the medical report of Dr. Rosa <span class="SpellE">Tibayan</span>,
the Head of the <span class="GramE">Psychiatry Department of the </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Baguio</span></span><span class="GramE"> General</span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">Hospital</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE">, and the record of her testimony before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Daquigan</span> found that the evidence
clearly and convincingly established the charges against respondent <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>, the "defense put up by the respondent **
(being) not only nil, but untenable and unmeritorious." According to His
Honor, the evidence showed that respondent Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>
had been commissioned to enforce a writ of execution issued by the Municipal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Naguilian</span>, La Union in Civil Case No. 300
entitled, "Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Casilla</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tranquilino</span> <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>"; that
in the company of several persons, <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> had levied
on and taken actual custody of two (2) pregnant <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span>
in implementation of the writ despite the protestations of the possessor that
the animals did not belong to the judgment debtor; that he had thereafter loaded
the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> on a pick-up and brought them to the
residence of one of his companions, a Pedro Castaneda, to whom, on the same
day, he sold and delivered the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> in
consideration of the price of P3,300.00, which was paid to him the following
day; that the <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> in fact belonged to a Mr.
Rivera Camacho, and a Mr. Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Cales</span>, and had an
aggregate value of P11,000.00; that the sale was consummated by respondent
sheriff privately and not by public auction, and without any notice to any
party whatever; that <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> turned over to the
judgment creditor only the amount of P3,000.00, appropriating P300.00 for
himself; and that at the time he carried out the execution in the manner just
described, there was a standing administrative order issued by CFI Executive
Judge Romeo N. <span class="SpellE">Firme</span> dated <span class="SpellE">Ocrtober</span>
17, 1977, prohibiting him from exercising the duties of a deputy sheriff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence further shows, indeed it is
admitted by respondent <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>, that on the basis of
these acts, he was prosecuted in the <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sandiganbayan</span></i></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>for a violation of the Anti-Graft and
Corrupt Practices Act, convicted thereof, and sentenced to suffer imprisonment
of at least four (4) years, with the accessory penalty of perpetual
disqualification from public office, but without any declaration of forfeiture
of benefits due him under the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">A review of the record convinces us of the correctness of the
findings of the Investigating Judge, as well as his recommendation for the
"dismissal of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span> from the service with special perpetual
disqualification from public office but without forfeiture of whatever benefits
due him under the law by reason of his service." The non-forfeiture of
benefits is justified by the fact that respondent may have acted under some mental
or psychiatric aberration, as indicated by the above mentioned report of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Tibayan</span>, who had occasion to examine <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the Court APPROVES the report and
recommendation of the Investigating Judge and ORDERS THE DISMISSAL from the
service of respondent <span class="SpellE">Sancho</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Gapasin</span>
as Deputy Sheriff, without forfeiture of whatever benefits may be due him under
the law by reason of his past services.</p>
