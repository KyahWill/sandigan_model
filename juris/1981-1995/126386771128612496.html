				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The need to render substantial justice as against technicality is
put to test in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents were drivers and conductors of
petitioner-corporation which was operating <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">buses </span>it leased from the Metro Manila Transit Corporation
(MMTC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the period 1983-1986, it
appears that incurred serious business losses and failed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pay </span>rentals to the MMTC which in turn
instituted a civil action against it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the case the MMTC was
able to repossess all the buses operated by petitioner corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since it had no more buses to operate and was
severely financially distressed, it stopped its operations and the employment
of private respondents was discontinued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents thus filed a case for illegal dismissal in
the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which was subsequently amended
to a complaint for payment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">separation
pay.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Impleaded</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">in </span>the complaint was petitioner <span class="SpellE">Prudencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jaring</span> who is sought to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">principally </span>liable with the petitioner corporation as president
thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties submitted their position papers, the labor
arbiter rendered a decision declaring private respondents entitled to
separation pay and ordering the petitioners to jointly and severally pay
private respondents their separation pay computed from the date of hiring up to
their termination <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">at </span>the rate of
one-half (1/2) month for every year of service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period for appeal,
petitioners filed a notice of appeal and a memorandum of appeal with the
respondent NLRC wherein they questioned the award of separation pay despite the
acknowledgment by the labor arbiter that petitioner corporation suffered
business losses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was also advocated
in the same appeal that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Jaring</span> was no
longer an officer at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>time of
the termination of private respondents, and granting that he was the president
of petitioner corporation then, the latter has a separate and distinct
personality from petitioner <span class="SpellE">Jaring</span> who cannot be
jointly and severally be held liable in this case with petitioner corporation.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="1">January 30,
 1990</st1:date> an order was issued by the NLRC stating that as the
petitioners failed to post the required bond, their appeal was rendered
imperfect making the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>decision
appealed from final <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">A </span>motion for
reconsideration filed by petitioners was denied by the NLRC in a resolution
dated <st1:date year="1990" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1990</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition for review, which this Court will treat as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>special civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">a</span>ction for <i>certiorari</i>, whereby petitioners raised the sole
issue that the NLRC erred in not giving due course to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">appeal </span>for failure to satisfy a purely
technical requirement when issues involving substantial rights were raised in
the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 223 of the Labor Code as amended by Republic Act No. 6715
provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 223.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Appeal</u>
x <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span>. - In case of a judgment involving a monetary award, an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">appeal by the employer </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">may </span>be perfected only upon </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>posting of a cash or surety bond</u>
issued by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>reputable bonding
company <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">d</span>uly accredited by the
Commission in the amount equivalent to the monetary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">award in the judgment appealed from." (Underscoring supplied.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC Interim Rules on Appeals under Republic Act No. 6715,
which took effect on <st1:date year="1989" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1989</st1:date>,
provide in Section 5 thereof as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">
</span></p>

<blockquote>"Secti<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">o</span>n 5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Requisites of Appeal; <u>When Perfected</u>.
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> shall be under oath

or surety bond as provided in Section 7 of these rules</u>. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">x</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>"(Underscoring <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">s</span>upplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appeal interposed by petitioners to the NLRC was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">made </span>on <st1:date year="1989" day="11" month="9">September 11, 1989</st1:date>, or just after six (6) days from the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
Interim Rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In undertaking the
appeal, the counsel of petitioners relied on the notice of the decision in the
case which stated the requirements of an appeal without any mention that a bond
must <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">be </span>filed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Apparently said counsel did not know as yet of said new law and Interim Rules
requiring the posting of a bond on appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It also appears that private respondents did not know about it as no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">opposition </span>to the appeal was made on
this account.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in the appealed decision of the labor arbiter the exact
total amount due to the private respondents as separation pay is not stated
which would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>the basis of the
bond that is required to be filed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">petitioners
</span>under the said law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus even if
petitioners may be expected to know the law, then they allege that they would
have to go to the socio-analyst of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the </span>NLRC
to compute <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">the approximate amount </span>due
the private respondents as the basis of the amount of the bond to be filed so
that it is not probable that they may be able to secure such computation within
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">non-</span>extendible period of ten
(10) days to appeal provided for by law.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also assert that at that time the petitioner
corporation was in financial distress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate they offered to post the bond in compliance with the
requirement of the law so that they may be afforded the relief of an appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that while Article 223 of the Labor Code, as
amended by Republic Act No. 6715, requiring a cash or surety bond <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">in </span>the amount equivalent to the
monetary award in the judgment appealed from for the appeal to be perfected,
may be considered a jurisdictional requirement, nevertheless, adhering to the
principle that substantial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">justice is better
served </span>by allowing the appeal on the merits threshed out by the NLRC,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court finds and so holds that the foregoing requirement of the law should
be given a liberal interpretation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Sun Insurance
Office, Ltd. vs. <span class="SpellE">Maximiano</span> C.

of the rule that the payment of the docket fees is jurisdictional.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More so when the party involved demonstrated
his willingness to abide by the rules to pay the docket fees required.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court held that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">p</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ayment of said </span>fees <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">may be authorized </span>by the Court within
a reasonable time but in no case beyond the applicable prescriptive or <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The greater interest of justice will be served <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">by </span>giving due course to the appeal despite the much delayed
filing of the appeal bond.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, the circumstances of the non-filing of the bond are
understandable and could be attributed to excusable oversight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court holds that petitioners should be
given the opportunity to file the required bond and avail of the remedy of
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further, considering that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in
</span>the appeal valid issues are raised as to whether or not under Rule 1,
Section 9 of the Implementing Rules of the Labor Code where the termination of
employment is due to serious business losses or financial reverses, as in this
case, the employee shall still be entitled to separation pay, and whether or
not petitioner <span class="SpellE">Jaring</span>, assuming that he was president
of petitioner corporation at the time of the separation from the service of
private respondents, can be held jointly and severally liable with petitioner
corporation for the separation pay due private respondents.</p>
