with facilitating the issuance of a writ of execution of the judgment, thus
unduly favoring and assisting the defendants in the execution of the writ and
restoring them in possession of the premises (Complaint, par. 5).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The investigating Justice
concluded that respond­ent had indeed facilitated the issuance of the writ of
execution "thereby violating the cold neutrality re­quired of an impartial
judge." This conclusion was based on the following circumstances:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.  Respondent ordered
execution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the dispositive
portion of the decision itself;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  He ordered the issuance
of the writ of execution on the very day that the motion for its issuance was
filed [November 27, 1988];<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  He signed the writ of
execution himself;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  He issued the writ on the same day that the
official copies of the decision were sent to the parties on the case (Report,
A.M. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">No. RTJ-86-50, p. 4).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">When respondent ordered
the issuance of the writ of execution in the decision itself sought to be
enforced and on the basis of the <u>ex</u> <u>p</u></span><u>arte</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motion for execution, he displayed his
inclination to favor defend­ants to the prejudice of the plaintiff.  Respondent issued and signed the writ of
execution himself, when this chore is left to the clerk of court.  He caused the issuance of the writ even
before copies of the decision were served on the plaintiff, the party adversely
affected by the enforcement of the judgment.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Respondent contends that
the order of execution was allowed under Section 18 of the Rules on Summary
Procedure, which provides that the decision rendered be "immediately
executory." This contention has no merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As held by this Court in <u>Dy</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Appeals</u>, 195 SCRA 585 [1991], the judgment or order of a regional trial
court must first be served on the losing party before the same may be
considered immediately executory under the Rules on Summary Procedure.  The reason is that, if such judgment or
order may be immediately executed without prior notice to the losing party,
then such a party shall be left without any remedy even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">against a judgment not supported by any evidence and/or the applicable
law, as in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Rules on Summary Procedure contemplate the filing of a motion
for execution on the part of the prevailing party, which, like an ordinary
motion must be set for hearing; otherwise, it becomes a mere slip of paper which
a judge should ignore.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A very queer circumstance
that throws a cloud of suspicion on the </span><u>bona</u> <u>fides</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> of respondent is the fact that the
defendants filed their motion for execution on the same day the decision of
respondent was rendered, and respondent, in effect, granted the motion in the
said decision.  This only means that
defendants knew that the decision yet to be signed and promulgated by
respondent would be favorable to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

money from practicing lawyers claiming that his salary as a judge was not
sufficient (Complaint, p. 1).</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in the middle
of June, 1985, respond­ent asked the complainant to buy for him and Mrs.
Dictado tickets to Manila from Sarkies Tours, which was complied with by
complainant (Complaint, p. 1).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Every time respondent went home to Manila on week­ends, he
required complainant to buy the bus tickets for him.  This went on until September, 1985 when the com<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">plainant failed to get the respondent his
ticket because it was "Peñafrancia time" and all the Sarkies Tours
buses were fully booked.  When
complainant failed to purchase a ticket for respondent, he sent the price of
the ticket to respondent through the latter's emissary (Complaint, p. 2).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondent would drop at
the complainant's residence and would ask to be fed in a restaurant with his
two <u>alalays</u> (Complaint, p. 2).</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondent got <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>permanent pass from Sarkies Tours
despite the fact that the said company has pending cases before his sala
(Complaint, p. 1).</p>

<p class="BODY">The only witness who testified on the alleged acts of graft and
corruption was the complainant.  The
investigating Justice, however, doubted complainant's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">credibility, considering that (i) complainant could not recall when
respondent allegedly asked money from lawyers, and could only state that these
alleged impositions occurred in respondent's chambers (TSN, May 17, 1991, p.
15); (ii) no other evidence was presented to corroborate complainant's
testimony that he had bought Sarkies Tours tickets for respondent or that he
had dined with respondent at restaurants; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the administrative complaint only after he had been ordered jailed for contempt
by respondent in con­nection with Civil Case No. 2981, and only after the </span>lapse
of three years, which delay he could not explain (TSN, June 10, 1991, pp. 4-7);
(iv) although complain­ant had attached to his reply in this complaint a photo<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">copy of an affidavit of a certain Atty.
Fidencio H. Gerro, and had alluded to a pleading filed by a certain Atty.
Subra, both attesting to respondent's alleged corrupt practices, complainant
did not endeavor to procure and present the originals or certified true </span>copies
of the documents, nor to present the lawyers; and, (v) Atty. Lapak made
contradictory statements on important details, which contradictions were unex­plained
(Report, A.M. No. RTJ-88-222, pp. 3-7).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Respondent admits that he
rides Sankies Tours buses free of charge, but asserts that this privilege was
granted to him by Delia Carapiet, Vice-President and General Manager of Sarkies
Tours, his cousin, who issued a certification to this effect (Rollo, p.
53).  Respondent further asserts that at
the time he assumed office, there was already a pending case involving Sarkies
Tours (Civil Case No. 5271), against whom respondent issued an adverse ruling
(Answer, pp. 1-2; Rollo, pp. 35-36).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">That the privilege was
extended by and through respondent's relative is not exculpating and does not
negate the fact that respondent, a judge, received benefits from a
litigant.  Such act constitutes grave
misconduct.</span></p>

come to his station (in Camarines Norte) to hold trials on a Tuesday and then
leave his station on a Thursday (Complaint, p. 1).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent, on the other hand, contends that complainant may be
referring to the days when he (respond­ent) availed of his leave privileges
granted under law, and that he has more than four hundred leave credits
(Answer, p. 1; Rollo, p. 35).</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial in <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Homer</u> <u>Bulalacao</u>
(Criminal Case No. 6134), a criminal case for reckless imprudence, began in
June, 1989.  After several
postponements, hear­ings were set for October 10 and 11, 1989.  However, on these dates, a typhoon in Bicol
rendered roads impassa­ble.  The accused
and his counsel, who lived in Buho, Camarines Norte were unable to attend the
hearings.  On October 11, they sent a
telegram to the trial court informing respondent of their predicament.  This notwithstanding, respondent on October
11 ordered the arrest of the accused, and on October 12 granted the prosecu­tion's
motion for the accused to be tried <u>in</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

accused] still would not appear.  Upon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">learning </span>of the above orders, the
accused and his counsel filed an "explanation and motion to lift the order
of arrest".  Though the court
accepted the explanation, the order of arrest was not lifted, and a subsequent
motion for reconsideration was denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Court
of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 19430).  The
appellate court held that respondent "committed grave abuse of discretion
in not lifting his order of arrest, trying [the accused] <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

DENR and the provincial prosecutor, objected to the seizure on the ground that
these flitches and lumber were not the ones involved in Criminal Case No. 3399,

issued an order dated April 28, 1989, denying the request of the provincial

Branch 41, his former station, as his living quarters; (2) his taking
cognizance of cases over which he had no jurisdiction under the Election Code;
and (3) his holding a party in the court room with litigants (Complaint, p.4).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent does not deny that he occupied one of the six rooms in
Branch 41.  He, however, contends that
this had been the practice of judges assigned to that branch.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It does not appear that

<p class="BODY">However, We cannot sanction the use of the court premises as
living quarters for the judges.  Firstly, government property should not be used for the personal
convenience of the judge.  Secondly, the
premises should be used exclusively for the administration of justice.  We deem respondent's act of converting a
room of the court as his living quarters as misconduct, which under­mines the
dignity of the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to respondent's taking cognizance of election cases over which
he had no jurisdiction, complainant presented copies of restraining orders

81784 entitled "Rolando O. Esturias v. Judge Dictado" and in G.R. No.

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After Civil Case No. 2981
was remanded to the trial court for re-hearing, complainant for himself, with
Atty. Lapak, filed a motion for voluntary inhibition alleging that "[he]
feels that he has no chance of winning the case against the plaintiff in whose
favor</span> [respondent] rendered a favorable judgment"; that res­pondent
"may no longer possess the cold neutrality of a judge to be able to render
an impartial judgment;" that "the annulment of the judgment [by the
Court of Appeals] may have antagonized [respondent]" (Record, Civil Case
No. 2981, p. 393).</p>

<p class="BODY">This motion was denied during the hearing of July 19, 1988 and in
respondent's order dated July 19, 1988.  In this order, complainant and Atty. Lapak were held in direct comtempt
and sentenced to three days imprisonment.  The basis of the direct contempt charge was the "clearly vicious
antics of Atty. Jose L. Lapak in plac­ing this court open to doubt by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">public </span>[which] will eventually erode
the confidence of the people who con­sider the court the last bastion of
fairness, equity and justice" (Record, Civil Case No. 2981, p. 399).  After their motion for reconsideration was
denied, complainant and Atty. Lapak were committed to prison.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Lapak filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the Court
of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 15149) asking for the nullification of respondent's
July 19, 1988 order.  The appellate
court denied the petition stating that "[a] mere general averment that a
previous decision of the respondent judge in Civil Case No. 2981 has been re­versed
by the Court of Appeals, and the case has been ordered reopened, is not a
sufficient proof of bias or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prejudice
as would justify our issuance of an order disqualifying the judge from further
proceeding in the instant case" (Record, Civil Case No. 2981, p.
421).  The appellate court further
stated that the issue on the validity of complainant and Atty. Lapak's had
become moot and academic, as at the time the decision was promulgated, they had
already served their three-day sentence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Lapak apparently also filed a petition for <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>
with the Supreme Court (UDK-8770).  The
writ was granted; however, the case was eventually dropped from the Court's
agenda in a resolution dated February 9, 1989 for failure of Atty. Lapak to
file the appropriate pleading.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated August 10, 1989 in G.R. No. 84239 (Delfin
Ang, et al. v. Dictado), We dismissed complainant's petition on the inhibition
of respondent "[i]n view of the fact that a decision of a trial judge
against the herein petitioner will not necessarily lead to a repetition of the
same adverse judgment when the case is remanded by the appellate court to the
trial court" (Record, Civil Case No. 2981, p. 463).</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant Ang and Atty. Lapak allege that respondent used his
contempt powers oppressively.  On the
other hand, respondent deemed the statements in the motion for voluntary
inhibition contemptous.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Direct contempt is

Lee, Jr., 169 SCRA 513 [1989]; and cases cited therein).  The mere fact that respondent did not see
any validity in the grounds given in the motion for his voluntary inhibition
does not render the movants liable for direct contempt.  It may be true that the contents of the
motion were criti­cal of respondent's prior actuations and expressed concern
regarding his impartiality.  Ang and
Atty. Lapak may have insulted respondent.  This, however, cannot be considered derogatory, offensive, or malicious

<blockquote>“It should be stressed that appellant's conviction was based solely
on the testimony of the NBI expert.  On
the other hand, only appellant could testify in his defense.  Under the circumstances, appellant was

documents to the PC Crime Laboratory for another examination.</blockquote>

(Sec. 11, Rule 116, Rules of Court).  Appellant's motion that the questioned documents be ordered transmitted

to specific circumstances which may show that respondent consciously and
deliberately intended to </span>perpetrate an injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">These two charges, being
interrelated, shall be discussed jointly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Complainant alleges that
respondent removed from the record of Civil Case No. 5287 (Amada Balon v.
Santos Ropeta) the duplicate original of the decision in that case and
substituted in its place a supposed original.</span>  According to complainant, the decision initially at­tached to the
record contained the date when the deci­sion was received by the clerk of court
of respondent's sala, whereas the copy inserted in substitution gave no such
indication.  The substitution was
allegedly done to conceal the fact that the decision was antedated, and to
feign compliance with the 90-day period for deciding cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Civil Case No. 5287 was considered submitted for
decision on November 4, 1987, pursuant to the respondent's order of October 20,
1987, which provided that the "parties are given 15 days from [that day]
within which to submit their memorandum simultaneously, with or without which,
the case will be consid­ered submitted for decision." Plaintiff's
memorandum dated October 28, 1987 appears in the record, but no­where in the
record is defendant's memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendant filed a motion for voluntary inhibition on March 7,
1988, which respondent denied in his order dated March 11, 1988.  In this order, respondent stated<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

x x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court, after going over the motion for
voluntary inhibition is convinced that said motion is now moot and academic
considering that the court has already decided the case as of January 18, 1988,
the release of which was delayed due to the many works (sic) that the steno-reporters
of this court have.  x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The original of the decision attached to the record is dated
"January 18, 1988" or well-within the 90-day period mandated by the
Constitution.  The registry receipts
attached to the decision show that copies thereof were mailed to the counsel of
the parties on March 9, 1988 and March 10, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record, while giving rise to the suspicion that
respondent antedated his decision, is not sufficient in law to support said
charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, while it may be accepted that respondent did pen the
decision within the 90-day-period, We cannot ignore the fact that he failed to
timely release the same.  It is not
enough that a judge writes his deci­sion; it is important to promulgate and
make it known to all concerned at the earliest possible time (Nidua v. Lazaro,
174 SCRA 581 [1989]; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Mangulabnan </span>v.
Tecson, 101 SCRA 810 [1980]) if only to dispel any suspicion that something
sinister is going on.  One of the
laments of litigants is the withholding by judges of their deci­sions which
they had long prepared and signed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot understand respondent's passing the blame for the delay
in the release of the decision, as distinguished from its preparation, to the
stenographers-reporters.  The respondent
cannot take refuge behind the inefficiency or mismanagement of his court
personnel (Nidua v. Lazaro<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="NUM" style="text-indent:-.5in"><u>II.</u>  <u>Knowingly</u> <u>rendering</u> <u>an</u> <u>unjust</u> <u>judgment</u></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent decided Civil Case No. 5287 in favor of the plaintiff
therein.  On appeal, the Court of
Appeals (CA-G.R. No. CV No. 17765) reversed the decision stating that "the
evidence was not sufficient to sustain the judgment of the trial court and that
said judgment was contrary to the law and jurisprudence."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the matter of the
motion for inhibition, the </span>appellate court stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In the language of the renowned Justice Holmes of the United
States Bench, "a judge must learn to suppress his personal emotion, must
show a willingness to suspend judgment until a comprehensive survey of the
ground, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and an appreciation and understanding
of the different attitudes and </span>viewpoints of those involved in the
controversy has been made and must learn to transcend his own narrow preju­dices
or prejudgment." <u>We</u> <u>find</u> <u>these</u> <u>worthy</u> <u>traits</u>
<u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>judge</u> <u>wanting</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>author</u>
<u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>decision</u> <u>now</u> <u>on</u> <u>appeal,</u> <u>and</u>
<u>find</u> <u>his</u> <u>honor</u> <u>lacking</u> <u>in</u> <u>that</u> <u>degree</u>
<u>of</u> <u>impartiality</u> <u>expected</u> <u>of</u> <u>him</u> (Record,
Civil Case No. 5287, p. 140; Underlining supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On appeal to the Supreme
Court (G.R. No. 90064), We affirmed the above resolution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court found that the decision of the respondent was
not supported by the evidence, and furthermore, was contrary to law and
jurisprudence, thus prompting said court to question respondent's impartiality.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We find that respondent's
actuations in the instant case display his partiality.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
