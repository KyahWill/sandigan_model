				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The sole issue in the instant case is whether herein petitioners,
Philippine National Bank, PNB for brevity, and National Investment Development
Corporation, NIDC for brevity, are deemed to have received a copy of the
decision of the trial court on January 23, 1992 when the mail containing the
decision was received by the PNB mailing clerk from the post office or only on
January 28, 1992 when the mail was delivered by said clerk to the Legal
Department of the PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 16, 1973, private respondents Clara Reyes Pastor and
other stockholders of the C &amp; C Commercial Corporation filed a complaint
against PNB and NIDC for termination of the Voting Trust Agreement, Accounting
and Damages with prayer for injunction and receivership with Branch 31 of the
then Court of First Instance of Rizal, Quezon City.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nineteen years after, judgment was rendered on January 20, 1992
rescinding the voting trust agreement executed between PNB and Clara Reyes
Pastor, herein private respondent in her capacity as majority stockholder of C
&amp; C Commercial Corporation, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, judgment is hereby rendered as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  Rescinding the Voting Trust Agreement
executed on March 5, 1969, by plaintiff Clara Reyes Pastor, a majority
stockholder of C &amp; C Commercial Corporation, as Trustor, in favor of the
defendants, Philippine National Bank and National Investment Development
Corporation, as Trustees;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Declaring that the secured loans of
P490,000.00 and P76,000.00 of the plaintiffs from the Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP), under the promissory notes dated May 16, 1960 and May 8, 1961,
secured by real estate mortgages on the same dates, executed by plaintiff Clara
Reyes Pastor for herself and as attorney-in-fact of her husband, Antonio C.
Pastor, in favor of the DBP, which were assigned by the DBP to defendant PNB
are already considered fully paid by the plaintiffs by reason of set
off/compensation with the damages and attorney's fees awarded to the plaintiffs
in this judgment, and, the said secured loans are, therefore, no longer payable
to defendant PNB from the plaintiffs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Cancelling thereby the aforesaid real estate
mortgages covering the mortgaged twenty (20) parcels of land described therein,
together with all the buildings and other improvements existing or which may
hereafter be created or constructed thereon, situated at Barrio Napindan,
Municipality of Taguig, province of Rizal (now Metro Manila), under Original
Certificate of Title No. 2224 of the Registry of Deeds of the province of Rizal
(now of Pasig, Metro Manila);</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Making permanent the writ of preliminary
injunction issued on March 23, 1990;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  Ordering, as a consequence, the Register of
Deeds of the Province of Rizal (now of Pasig, Metro Manila) to cancel the
mortgage annotations, pertaining to the said real estate mortgages, made at the
back of Original Certificate of Title No. 2224 of the Registry of Deeds of the
Province of Rizal (now of Pasig, Metro Manila);</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.  Ordering, as well, the Register of Deeds of
the Province of Rizal (now of Pasig, Metro Manila) to return and deliver to the
plaintiffs the owner's duplicate copy of Original Certificate of Title No. 2224
of the Registry of Deeds of the Province of Rizal (now of Pasig, Metro Manila);</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.  Ordering the defendants to pay to plaintiff <span style="">C &amp; </span>C Commercial Corporation,
jointly and severally, actual damages in the amounts of:  (a) P4,520,000.00, as business <span style="">losses; (b) P6,599,224.00, </span>as
unrealized profits; (c) P8,084,631.00, as capital deficiency; AND (d)
P781,993.00, representing decrease in assets, including the sum of
P1,000,000.00 as exemplary damages <span style="">as </span>well
as P500,000.00, in reasonable attorney's fees, or for the total net amount of
P20,199,848.00, in net amount of P20,199,848, in damages and attorney's fees,
after deducting from the gross total of the aforesaid awarded damages and
attorney's fees, the total secured loans of P1,286,000.00 by way of set
off/compensation;</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.  Ordering the defendants to pay the plaintiff
C &amp; C Commercial Corporation, also jointly and severally, interests on the
total actual damages of P19,985,848.00, at the rate of 6% per annum from the
date of this judgment until fully paid;</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.  Dismissing the counterclaim of the
defendants for lack of merit; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>10. With costs
against the defendants."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Gauged by the rather turtle-like pace of the aforementioned
decision, a copy thereof was instantaneously sent by registered mail on January
23, 1992 to the office of Atty. Avamor Perez, PNB's counsel, which was at the
6th Floor of the PNB Building, Escolta, Manila.  However, the copy of the decision was received by the Litigation
Division of the PNB only on January 28, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioners filed a notice of appeal on February 10, 1992
but the same was denied by respondent judge, Rodolfo A. Ortiz, who issued a
writ of execution of his decision on the ground that the appeal was late and
that the decision had become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 18, 1992, Atty. Avamor Perez, counsel for herein
petitioners <span style="">received </span>a copy of
the motion seeking the immediate execution of the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 11, 1992, the trial court issued an order granting the
writ of execution.  The order reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The decision dated January 20, 1992 being already final and
executory, as the notice of appeal of defendant PNB was filed only on February
10, 1992 three (3) days beyond the reglementary period of fifteen (15) days from
January 23, 1992, the date when defendants' counsel is considered to have
received this court's decision dated January 20, 1992, it is now the
ministerial duty of the court to order the issuance of a writ of execution for
its enforcement."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the trial court issued a writ of execution and on
the same day <span style="">served </span>a notice of
garnishment on the cashier of the PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">A petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Rules of
Court was filed by herein petitioners PNB and NIDC in the Court of Appeals seeking
the nullification of the trial court's order dated June 11, 1992 denying their
notice of appeal dated February 10, 1992 and the issuance of the writ of
execution dated June 22, 1992 and the notice of garnishment on the same date.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals dismissed the petition hence, the present
appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners now contend that respondent judge of the trial court
committed a grave abuse of discretion in holding the decision of January 20,
1992 final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">More particularly, the question to be resolved is whether
petitioners are deemed to have received a copy of the decision sent to them by
registered mail on January 23, 1992, when the mail containing the decision was
received by the PNB mailing clerk from the post office or <span style="">only </span>on January 28, 1992 when the mail <span style="">was </span>delivered by said clerk to the
Legal Department of the PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners anchor <span style="">thei</span>r<span style=""> </span>contention <span style="">on </span>the case of <i><span style="">PLDT vs.
NLRC,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>where the Court has ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"The bailiff, instead of serving the notice of the decision at
the lawyer on the ninth floor which is clearly indicated in the notice of
decision, left the notice at the ground floor of the petitioner's main
building.  We have held time and again
that notices to counsel should properly be sent to the address of record in the
absence of due notice to the court of change of address (Phil. Suburban Dev.
Corp. vs. Court of Appeals, 100 SCRA 109).  Hence, practical considerations and the realities of the situation
dictate that the service made by the bailiff on March 23, 1981 at the ground
floor of the petitioner's building and not at the address of record of
petitioner's counsel on record at the 9th floor of the PLDT building cannot be
considered a valid service.  It was only
when the Legal Services Division actually received a copy of the decision on
March 26, 1981 that a proper and valid service may be deemed to have been
made."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The PLDT case has no applicability to the case at bar due to
factual differences.  <span style="">In </span>the PLDT case, the notice of the
decision was served on a person not an employee <span style="">of the </span>company.  However,
in the instant case, a copy of the decision was received by the <span style="">official </span>and authorized mailing clerk
of PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is revealing is the hearing held on March 17, 1992 in Civil
Case No. <span style="">RQ­-</span>18176, where the
respondent judge had the opportunity to inquire into <span style="">the </span>procedure of herein petitioners in receiving their mail
matters from petitioners' counsel, thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">It is crystal clear that Mr. Catalino M. Sandoval, the PNB
employee permanently assigned with petitioner PNB's Mailing Division, General
Service Department is in charge of collecting all PNB mailing matters,
correspondence, pouches, printed matters, letters, notices, etc. for PNB.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although not detailed with PNB Legal Department,<span style=""> </span>Mr. Sandoval had nonetheless and for
years been receiving orders and notices for petitioners and signing all the
corresponding registry return cards without any complaint or protest from
petitioners, including the registry return card of the envelope containing the
copy of the Decision of the respondent judge dated January 20, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the trial court correctly observed:</p>

<blockquote>"For, during the oral arguments pertaining to this incident on
March 17, 1992, defendants' counsel admitted that all the previous orders of
this Court in this case and all notices to him were also received by him
through defendant PNB's Mailing Division and all these orders and notices were
honored by him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants' counsel also admitted in open court that he never
questioned before the validity of the service of these previous orders and
notices in this case, to him, as defendants' counsel, although not received in
the first instance by the litigation division of defendant PNB, since it is
through the Mailing Division that all officials in defendant PNB receive their
mails.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He likewise admitted that the PNB employee detailed at its
Mailing Division who received the mails for the different departments and
employees of defendant PNB, that day, January 23, 1992, was duly authorized to
do so.  In fact, according to him, this
PNB employee detailed at the Mailing Division had been signing registry return
receipts for orders and notices sent to defendants' counsel, without any
complaint from the litigation division.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under these circumstances, this Court holds defendants'
counsel cannot now be validly heard to complain, apparently for the first time,
against the regularity of the service on him of the decision of this Court
dated January 20, 1992, by registered letter, received and signed for by the
PNB employee of its Mailing Division, since he is already estopped from
questioning the validity of the service of the decision to him, thru the
Mailing Division, not having questioned before the validity and efficacy of the
service to him of the prior orders and notices of this Court in this case all
of which he had honored without any complaint whatever, especially, as it
appears, that the litigation and Collection Division of the Legal Department of
defendant PNB and its mailing Division of its General Services Department, are
housed and located at the same PNB Building at Escolta, Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Verily, since, obviously, the PNB employee at the Mailing
Division, being, admittedly, authorized to receive all PNB mails, it follows
that he had also the authority to sign registry return receipts for registered
letters he had received.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What is more, to subject the efficacy of the service to him
of the decision dated January 20, 1992, to the internal procedure defendant PNB
made and devised as to how and when the mails for its different offices and
employees shall be delivered to them, would be an uncalled for and an
unwarranted encroachment upon the provisions of the rules of court pertaining
to service of notices, orders and judgments, which should not be countenanced,
since, if allowed, it will unduly place upon the whims and caprices of a party
litigant as to when an order or a decision shall become effective which will
certainly cause havoc to, and will endanger the administration of justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Indeed, it is incumbent upon the Litigation and Collection
Division of defendant PNB, of which defendants' counsel is a part, to provide
and adopt a system in their office that efficiently takes into account all
Court notices, orders and decisions received by its Mailing Division, and for
want of diligent supervision, the inexcusable negligence of the sorting clerk
of the Mailing Division is attributable to the Litigation and Collection
Division including defendants' counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This negligence of defendant's counsel, which can only be
characterized as gross, was made even more manifest by his unexplained failure
to appeal within the period of fifteen (15) days from January 23, 1992, the
date of receipt by the mailing Division of defendant PNB, which he could not
have missed to see and notice by the exercise of ordinary diligence as it is
plainly stamp marked on the face of the registered letter containing the decision
addressed to him.  Verily, since there
was plenty of time from January 28, 1992, the date when the registered letter
was turned over to the Litigation and Collection Division, until February 7,
1992, the expiry date of reglementary period of fifteen (15) days from January
23, 1992, within which defendants' counsel could have, by ordinary diligence,
easily made and filed his one-paragraph notice of appeal but which he failed to
do, obviously, because of gross negligence, for which his clients are bound."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

had the occasion to say:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court is not unaware of the practice of some lawyers who,
lacking plausible support for their position, simply claim a denial of due

virtually only a pro forma argument.  Due process is not to be bandied like a slogan.  It is not a mere catch-phrase.  As the highest hallmark of the free society,
its name should not be invoked in vain but only when justice has not been truly
