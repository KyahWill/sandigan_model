				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this Petition for Review by <i>certiorari,</i> petitioner <span class="SpellE">Antolin</span> <span class="SpellE">Jariol</span>, Jr. assails the
Decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandigan­bayan</span> dated 29 November 1979
finding him, along with several others, guilty on twenty-two <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(22) </span>counts of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>
through falsification of public and commercial documents and sentencing him to
the penalties specified in that Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The background facts which are uncontested are set out in the
Decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"The Ministry of Public Highways is divided into thirteen (13)
regions and each region is in turn sub-divided into districts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of these regions is Region VII based in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City and covers the Provinces of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, and
Sub-province of <span class="SpellE">Siquijor</span> and the cities in said
provinces, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Cities of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, <span class="SpellE">Danao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lapu-lapu</span> and Toledo in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, the Cities of <span class="SpellE">Bais</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kanlaon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> in the
Province of <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Oriental and <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>
City in the Province of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, Region VII is
subdivided into fifteen (15) Highway Engineering Districts, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> First, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> 2nd, <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Mandawe</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Lapu-lapu</span> City,
Toledo City, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>
1st, <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> 2nd, <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span>
City, <span class="SpellE">Bais</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Kanlaon</span>
City, <span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span> City, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Oriental and <span class="SpellE">Siquijor</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>[B]<span class="SpellE">ased</span> on the standard operating procedure
of the funding of the different offices of the national government, the said
regions are funded in the following manner:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Ministry of the Budget at the beginning of each quarter
releases to the Ministry of Public Highways the corresponding Advices of
Allotment (<span class="SpellE">AAs</span>), which is the authority to obligate,
and the Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC), which is the authority to
disburse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Ministry or Central Office
will now release Sub-Advices of Allotment (<span class="SpellE">SAAs</span>) to
the various regional offices, with the Central Office retaining a portion of
the allot­ment for its own use.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Sub-Allotment Advice (SAA) released to the various regional offices is
addressed to the regional director and is accompanied by an Advice of Cash
Disbursement Ceiling (ACDC).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
receipt thereof, the Chief Accountant of the region debits the receivable
accounts and credits the allotments in the Journal Voucher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Letters of Advice of Allot­ment (<span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>) based on the program of work submitted by the
district and Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceiling (<span class="SpellE">ACDCs</span>)
are prepared by the region for release to the different districts composing the
region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">ACDCs</span> are signed by the Regional Director
addressed to the District Engineer but are usually received by an authorized
liaison officer of the district.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With
the receipt of the <span class="SpellE">LAAs</span> and the <span class="SpellE">ACDCs</span>,
the district is now equipped with authority to incur obligations and authority
to disburse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of procedure,
however, upon receipt of the LAA, a Requisition for Supplies or Equipment (RSE)
is prepared by the Property Custodian wherein the District Accountant certifies
as to the availability of funds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Project Engineer prepares a Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) which is
likewise certified as to availability of funds by the District Account­ant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Requisition for Supplies or Equipment,
together with a copy of the program of work, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>transmitted to the Regional
Director for approval and returned to the district.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If approved, canvass bid forms are sent to
different contract­ors or suppliers for them to quote prices for the materials
or supplies called for in the approved Requisition for Supplies or
Equipment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all the bid forms are
submitted, they are opened on specified dates and the determination of the
lowest quoted price is made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is
reflected in the Abstract of Sealed Quotations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A Purchase Order is now prepared in favor of the winning bidder or
contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Deliveries then are made by
the contractor and, thereafter, General Vouchers, supported by delivery
receipts and tally sheets which are consolidated in the Inspection Report and
other supporting documents, are processed for the payment of the
deliveries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Finally, the corresponding
check is prepared and released to the contractor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the end of the month, the District Accountant prepares several
reports including the Report of Obligations Incurred (ROI) and the Report of
Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officer (RCIDDO) which are submitted to
the region.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These reports form the bases
of the trial balance prepared by the regions for submission to the Central
Office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The different regional trial
balances are then consolidated in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>single trial balance prepared by the
Central Office for the entire Ministry of Public Highways which is then
submitted to the Commission on Audit.</blockquote>

19, 1977 to May 31, 1978, after he was re-assigned to the 2nd Highway Engineering
District of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>, all the accused government
officials actually discharged the functions pertaining to their office as
alleged in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> during the period that
the supposed crimes were committed; that the Letters of Advice of Allotment
under which the disburse­ments in question were made are Exhibits 'R', 'R-1' to
'R-118' with a total amount of P6,530,000.00 all addressed to the <span class="SpellE">Danao</span> City HED and signed and sent by Assistant Regional

it was made to appear that materials were needed in those places, we found out
that there is no need to put those materials in this portion of the highway

condition</u>; and the fact that <u>during the ocular inspection there was no
overlaying of premix of the Wharf Road including the concrete portion which

may issue the order of discharge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Once a
co-accused is discharged and the released witness actually testifies, any legal

Court originally issued a temporary restraining order preventing the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> from continuing with the proceedings against <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span>, by reason of which
trial of the co-accused including petitioner was suspended, that restraining
order was lifted on <st1:date year="1979" day="11" month="7">11 July 1979</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the lifting of that restraining order,
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> proceeded with the trial of the one
hundred twenty-six (126) cases before it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This final claim of petitioner was made in the hope that he could
benefit from the constitutional law issues which had been raised by <span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> <span class="SpellE">Nuñez</span> before the Supreme
Court:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the statute creating the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> had violated the equal protection and due
process clauses of the Constitution as well as the constitutional prohibition
of <u>ex</u> <u>post</u> <u>facto</u> legislation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court settled those issues in 1982 when
it promulgated its decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Nuñez</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
