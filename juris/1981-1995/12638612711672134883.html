<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1968</st1:date>,
private respondents filed Civil Case No. 4168 with the then Court of First

by the probate and cadastral courts, were null and void for lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, in their
answer to the complaint, specifically deny the allegations of fraud and
misrepresentation and interposed as defense the fact that the questioned
conditional sales of May 27, 1959 and August 30, 1959 were voluntarily executed
by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> Ramos and truly
expressed the intention of the parties; that the action, if any, has long
prescribed; that the questioned orders of January 22, 1960 and April 18, 1960,
approving the consolidation of ownership of the lands in question in favor of petitioners
were within the jurisdiction of the lower court, in its capacity as a probate
court insofar as Lot No. 4033 is concerned, and acting as a cadastral court
with respect to Lot No. 4221; and that said lands subject of the conditional
sales were in <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span>

documents purporting to be deeds of conditional sale, marked as Exhibits

<p class="BODY">We find the petition devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1602 of the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The contract shall be presumed to be an equitable mortgage,
in any of the following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) When the price of a sale with right to repurchase is unusually
inadequate;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) When the vendor remains in possession as lessee or otherwise;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) When upon or after the expiration of the right to repurchase
another instrument extending the period of redemption or granting a new period
is executed;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) When the purchaser retains for himself a part of the purchase
price;</blockquote>

sold;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6) In any other case where it may be fairly inferred that the real
intention of the parties is that the transaction shall secure the payment of a
debt or the performance of any other obligation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In any of the foregoing cases, any money, fruits, or other benefit
to be received by the vendee as rent or otherwise shall be considered as
interest which shall be subject to the usury laws."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, in holding that the two (2) deeds
purporting to be <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>
sale contracts are equitable mortgages, relied on the following factual
findings of the trial court, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Several undisputed circumstances persuade this Court (that)
the questioned deeds should be construed as equitable mortgages as contemplated
in Article 1602 of the Civil Code, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) plaintiff vendor remained in possession until 1964 of the properties
she allegedly sold in 1959 to defendants; (2) the sums representing the alleged
purchase price were actually advanced to plaintiff by way of loans, as
expressly admitted by the parties at the hearing of February 17, 1971,
reflected in an Order of the same date; and (3) the properties allegedly
purchased by defendant Oscar Ramos and his wife have never been declared for
taxation purposes in their names.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Exhibits K, K-1, L and L-1."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Even if we indulge the petitioners in their contention that they
are justified in not taking possession of the lots considering that what were
allegedly sold to them were only the rights, shares, interests and
participation of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> Ramos in
the said lots which were under administration,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
however, such fact will not justify a reversal of the conclusion reached by
respondent court that the purported deeds of sale <u>con</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u> are equitable
mortgages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a conclusion is
buttressed by the other circumstances catalogued by respondent court especially
the undisputed fact that the two deeds were executed by reason of the loan
extended by petitioner Oscar Ramos to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span>
Ramos and that the purchase price stated therein was the amount of the loan
itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above-stated circumstances are more than sufficient to show
that the true intention of the parties is that the transaction shall secure the
payment of said debt and, therefore, shall be presumed to be an equitable
mortgage under Paragraph 6 of Article 1602 hereinbefore quoted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Settled is the rule that to create the presumption
enunciated by Article 1602, the existence of one circumstance is enough.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The said article expressly provides <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> "in
any of the following cases," hence the existence of any of the
circumstances enumerated therein, not a concurrence nor an overwhelming number
of such circumstances, suffices to give rise to the presumption that the
contract with the right of repurchase is an equitable mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly stated by the Court of Appeals:</p>

<blockquote>"Thus, it may be fairly inferred that the real intention of
the parties is that the transactions in question were entered into to secure
the payment of the loan and not to sell the property (Article 1602, Civil
Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Article 1603, of the Civil
Code it is provided that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘In case of
doubt, a contract purporting to be a sale with right to repurchase shall be
construed as an equitable mortgage’.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this case, we have no doubt that the transaction between the parties is that of
a loan secured by said properties by way of mortgage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, we find that Exhibits B and G do not
reflect the true and real intention of the parties and should accordingly be
reformed and construed as equitable mortgages."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Equally puerile is the other contention of petitioners that
respondent court erred in not applying the exclusionary <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence rule in ascertaining the true intendment of the contracting
parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The present case falls squarely
under one of the exceptions to said rule as provided in then Section 7 of Rule
130, thus:</p>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing or its failure
to express the true intent and agreement of the parties, or the validity of the
agreement is put in issue by the pleadings;”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is a well entrenched principle in the interpretation
of contracts that if the terms thereof are clear and leave no doubt as to the
intention of the contracting parties the literal meaning of the stipulation
shall control but when the words appear to be contrary to the evident intention
of the parties, the latter shall prevail over the former.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The admission of <span class="SpellE">parol</span> testimony to
prove that a deed, absolute in form, was in fact given and accepted as a
mortgage does not violate the rule against the admission of oral evidence to
vary or contradict the terms of a written instrument.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Sales with a right to repurchase, as defined by the Civil Code, are not
favored.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We will not construe
instruments to be sales with a right to repurchase, with the stringent and
onerous effects which follow, unless the terms of the document and the
surrounding circumstances require it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whenever, under the terms of the writing, any other construction can
fairly and reasonably be made, such construction will be adopted and the
contract will be construed as a mere loan unless the court can see that, if
enforced according to its terms, it is not an unconscionable one.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the faces thereof, the contracts purport to be sales with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>; however, since the
same were actually executed in consideration of the aforesaid loans said
contracts are indubitably equitable mortgages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rule is firmly settled that whenever it is clearly shown that a deed
of sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u>,
regular on its face, is given as security for a loan, it must be regarded as an
equitable mortgage.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the orders dated January 22, 1960 and April 18,
1960, issued by the court below acting as a probate court and cadastral court,
respectively, the same could not preclude the institution of the case now under
review.</p>

<p class="BODY">A reading of the order of the probate court will show that it is
merely an approval of the deed of conditional sale dated <st1:date year="1959" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1959</st1:date> executed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span> Ramos in favor of petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in said order providing for
the consolidation of ownership over the lots allegedly sold to petitioners nor
was the issue of the validity of said contract discussed or resolved
therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"To give approval"
means in its essential and most obvious meaning, to confirm, ratify, sanction
or consent to some act or thing done by another.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The approval of the probate court of the conditional sale is not a conclusive
determination of the intrinsic or extrinsic validity of the contract but a mere
recognition of the right of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Adelaida</span>

the approval by the settlement court of the assignment <span class="SpellE"><u>pendente</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>lite</u></span>, made by one heir in favor of the other
during the course of the settlement proceedings, is not deemed final until the
estate is closed and said order can still be vacated, hence the assigning heir
remains an interested person in the proceeding even after said approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the probate jurisdiction of the former court of first instance
or the present regional trial court relates only to matters having to do with
the settlement of the estate and probate of wills of deceased persons, and the
appointment and removal of administrators, executors, guardians and trustees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subject to settled exceptions not present in
this case, the law does not extend the jurisdiction of a probate court to the
determination of questions of ownership that arise during the proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The parties concerned may choose to bring a
separate action as a matter of convenience in the preparation or presentation
of evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Obviously, the approval by the probate court of the conditional sale was
without prejudice to the filing of the proper action for consolidation of
ownership and/or reformation of instrument in the proper court within the
statutory period of prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same jurisdictional flaw obtains in the order of
consolidation issued by the cadastral court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The court of first instance or the regional trial court, acting as a
cadastral court, acts with limited competence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It has no jurisdiction to take cognizance of an action for consolidation
of ownership, much less to issue an order to that effect; such action must have
been filed in the former court of first instance, now in the regional trial court,
in the exercise of its general jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That remedy, and the procedure <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, is
now governed by Rule 64 of the Rules of Court as a special civil action
cognizable by the regional trial court in the exercise of original general
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Antecedent thereto, Article 1607 of the Civil Code provided for
consolidation as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In case of real property, the consolidation of ownership in
the vendee by virtue of the failure of the vendor to comply with the provisions
of article 1616 shall not be recorded in the Registry of Property without a
judicial order, after the vendor has been duly heard."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Hence in <span class="SpellE"><u>Crisologo</u></span><u>,</u>
<u>et</u> <u>al.</u> <u>vs.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Centeno</u></span><u>,</u>
<u>et</u> <u>al.,</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
we ruled that said Article 1607 contemplates a contentious proceeding wherein
the vendor <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> must be named respondent in the caption and
title of the petition for consolidation of ownership and duly summoned and
heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An order granting the vendee's
petition for consolidation of ownership, without the vendor <u>a</u> <u>retro</u>
being named as respondent, summoned and heard, is a patent nullity for want of
jurisdiction of the court over the person of the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned order of consolidation issued by the cadastral
court, being void for lack of jurisdiction, is in contemplation of law
non-existent and may be wholly disregarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such judgment may be assailed any time, either directly or collaterally,
by means of a separate action or by resisting such judgment in any action or
proceeding whenever it is invoked.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
It is not necessary to take any step to vacate or avoid a void judgment; it may
simply be ignored.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of prescription, in addition to what has been said,
the present case, having been filed on <st1:date year="1960" day="28" month="2">February
 28, 1960</st1:date>, approximately seven (7) years from the execution of the
questioned deeds, was seasonably instituted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The prescriptive period for actions based upon a written contract and
for reformation is ten (10) years under Article 1144 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such right to reformation is expressly
recognized in Article 1365 of the same code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1602 of the Civil Code is designed primarily to curtail
the evils brought about by contracts of sale with right of repurchase, such as
the circumvention of the laws against usury and <span class="SpellE"><u>pactum</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>commissorium</u></span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case before us, to rule otherwise would contravene the
legislative intent to accord the vendor <u>a</u> <u>retro</u> maximum
safeguards for the protection of his legal rights under the true agreement of
the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judicial experience in
cases of this nature and the rationale for the remedial legislation are worth
reiterating, considering that such nefarious practices still persist:</p>

<blockquote>"It must be admitted that there are some cases where the
parties really intend a sale with right to repurchase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although such cases are rare, still the
freedom of contract must be maintained and respected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the contract under consideration
is preserved, but with adequate safeguards and restrictions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"One of the gravest problems that must be solved is that
raised by the contract of sale with right of repurchase or <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span>
<u>de</u> <u>retro</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evils
arising from this contract have festered like a sore on the body politic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is a matter of common knowledge that in practically all of
the so-called contracts of sale with right of repurchase, the real intention of
the parties is that the pretended purchase-price is money loaned, and in order
to secure the payment of the loan a contract purporting to be a sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u> <u>retro</u> is drawn up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is thus that the provisions contained in
articles 1859 and 1858 of the present Civil Code which respectively prohibit
the creditor from appropriating the things given in pledge or mortgage and
ordering that said things be sold or alienated when the principal obligation
becomes due, are circumvented.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, it is well-known that the practice in these
so-called contracts of sale with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span> <u>de</u>
<u>retro</u> is to draw up another contract purporting to be a lease of the
property to the supposed vendor, who pays in money or in crops a so-called
rent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, no secret to
anyone that this simulated rent is in truth and in fact interest on the money
loaned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In many instances, the interest
is usurious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the usury law is also
circumvented.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is high time these transgressions of the law were
stopped.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is believed by the
Commission that the plan submitted for the solution of the problem will meet
with the approval of an enlightened public opinion, and in general, of everyone
moved by a sense of justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the deliberations of the Commission the question arose
as to whether the contract of purchase with <span class="SpellE"><u>pacto</u></span>
<u>de</u> <u>retro</u> should be abolished and forbidden.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On first impression, this should be done, but
there is every reason to fear that in such a case the usurious money-lenders
would demand of the borrowers that, although the real agreement is one of loan
secured with a mortgage, the instrument to be signed should purport to be an
absolute sale of the property involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Should this happen, the problem would become aggravated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it must be admitted that there are
some cases where the parties really intend a sale with right to
repurchase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although such cases are
rare, still the freedom of contract must be maintained and respected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the contract under consideration
is preserved in the Project of Civil Code, but with adequate safeguards and
restrictions."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>
