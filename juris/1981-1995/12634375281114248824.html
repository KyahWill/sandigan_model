of the Regional Trial Court of Makati (Branch 148), dismissing on the ground of
improper venue a complaint which the spouses Virgilio B. Gesmundo and Edna C.
Gesmundo filed against the JRB Realty Corpora­tion and Jaime R. Blanco.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 7, 1980, petitioner Virgilio B. Gesmundo, as lessee, and
respondent JRB Realty Corporation, represented by its president, respondent
Jaime R. Blan­co, as lessor, entered into <span style="">a
</span>lease contract covering Room 116, Blanco Suites, at 246 Villaruel St.,
Pasay City, the parties stipulating that the</p>

<blockquote>venue for all suits, whether for breach
hereof or damages or any cause between the LESSOR and the LESSEE, and persons
claiming under each, being the courts of appropriate jurisdiction in Pasay
City. . .</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On March 19, 1993, petitioners filed the complaint below for
damages against respondents.  They
alleged that from April 8, 1980 to November 1992, they had been in possession
of the leased premises; that on or about November 9, 1992, they were
"shocked and stunned" upon receiving respondents' letter terminating
their lease effective November 30, 1992; that no other tenant in the building
had been sent a similar letter; that during their conversation over the
telephone, respondent Blanco told petitioner Virgilio B. Gesmundo that since
the Corporation for which the latter works did not pay him (Blanco) his
retainer fees, he did not want petitioners in any of his apartment units; that
on November 18, 1992, petitioners sent respondents <span style="">a </span>letter asking for reconsideration of the termination of their
lease; that on November 27, 1992, respondents sent petitioners a statement of
accounts reiterating their letter of November 9, 1992; that on November 28,
1992, petitioners were forced to vacate the leased premises and consequently
they leased an apartment at P2,500.00 monthly; and that respondents' action was
"unwarranted, unjustified, malicious, abusive, and capricious."
Petitioners prayed for P33,500.00 as actual or compensatory damages;
P1,000,000.00 as moral damages; P50,000.00 as attorney's fees, and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents moved to<span style=""> </span>dismiss
the case on the ground that the venue of the action had been improperly laid in
the RTC of Makati.  They contended that
pursu­ant to their lease contract, the venue of the action was in a court of
competent jurisdiction in Pasay City.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their opposition to the motion to dismiss, petitioners alleged
that their cause of action is not based on the lease contract and, therefore,
the case is not covered by the stipulation <span style="">as </span>to venue.  Instead it
is governed by the general rule as to venue stated in Rule 4, sec. <span style="">2(b).</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>They also alleged that even assuming
that the stipulation is applicable, it does not operate to limit the venue to
Pasay City but merely provides for an additional forum.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 28, 1990, the trial court dismissed petitioners’ action on
the ground of improper venue.  <span style="">On </span>July 9, 1993, it denied their motion
for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition based on the <span style="">following </span>grounds:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I.</p>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT BELOW ERRED IN
CONSIDERING THE ACTION FOR DAMAGES AS REAL ACTION AND NOT PERSONAL.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II.</p>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT BELOW ERRED IN
CONSIDERING THE LEASE CONTRACT EXECUTED BETWEEN ONLY ONE OF THE PETITIONERS AND
ONLY ONE OF THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS APPLICABLE TO THE INSTANT COM­PLAINT.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN CONSIDERING
THE COMPLAINT AS BASED ON THE CONTRACT OF LEASE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV.</p>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT BELOW ERRED IN
UTILIZING THE VERY ACT COMPLAINED OF (THE RIGHT ABUSED) TO DEFEAT THE COMPLAINT
FILED BY PETITIONERS.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">V.</p>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT BELOW ERRED IN
ATTEMPTING TO CAUSE THE FILING OF THE COMPLAINT IN A JURISDICTION OTHER THAN
THE PLACE WHERE ALL THE PARTIES ARE FOUND WITHOUT ANY JUSTIFIABLE REASON.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VI.</p>

<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT ERRED IN SUSTAINING A
DISMISSAL SOLELY GROUNDED ON A TECHNICALITY.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">VII.</p>

<blockquote>ASSUMING FOR THE SAKE OF ARGUMENT THAT THE
LEASE AGREEMENT IS APPLICABLE, THE HONORABLE COURT BELOW ERRED IN CONSIDERING
THE PROVISION STIPULATING THE VENUE OF THE ACTION EXCLUSIV­ISTIC.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These contentions boil down to one main issue:  whether venue was properly laid in the
Regional Trial Court of Makati.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold in the negative.  We have in the past held stipulations limiting venue as valid and
binding on the contracting parties,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> based
on Rule 4, sec. 3 which provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>Venue by agreement.</i>  - By <span style="">written agree</span>ment of
the parties, the venue of an action may be changed or transferred from one prov­ince
to another.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, it is clear from the parties' contract that
the venue of any action which they might bring are the courts of competent
jurisdiction in Pasay City, whether the action is for "breach [of the
lease agreement] or damages or any other cause between the LESSOR and LESSEE
and persons claiming under each."</p>

<p class="BODY">The language used leaves no room for interpretation.  It clearly evinces the parties' intent to <span style="">limit </span>to the "courts of
appropriate jurisdiction of Pasay City" the venue of all suits between the
lessor and lessee and those between parties claiming<span style=""> </span>under them.  This means a
waiver of their right to institute action in the courts provided for in Rule 4,
sec. 2(b).</p>

<p class="BODY">This case, therefore, differs from the cases<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> cited
by petitioner.  It is true that in <i><span style="">Polytrade </span>Corporation v. Blanco,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
a stipulation that "The parties agree to sue and be sued in the City of
Manila" was held to merely provide an additional forum in the absence of
any qualifying or restrictive words.  But here, by laying in Pasay City the venue for <span style="">all </span>suits, the parties made it plain that in no other place may
they bring suit against each other for "breach [of their lease contract]
or damages or any other cause between [them] and persons claiming under each
[of them]."<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The stipulation in this case is similar to that involved in <i><span style="">Hoechst Philippines, Inc. v. Torres</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>where the parties agreed that
"in case of any litigation arising out of this agreement, the venue of any
action shall be in the competent courts of the Province of Rizal." This
court held:  "No further
stipulations are necessary to elicit the thought that both parties agreed that
any action by either of them would be filed only in the competent courts of
Rizal province exclusively."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
similarity </span>in the language used in the stipulation in this case and that
in the <i><span style="">Hoechst</span></i><span style=""> </span>case is striking.  Again in <i>Villanueva v. </i><i><span style="">Mosqueda</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">it
</span>was stipulated that if the lessor violated the contract of lease he
could be sued in Manila, while if it was the lessee who violated the contract,
the lessee could be sued in Masantol, Pampanga.  It was held that there was an agreement concerning venue of
action and that the parties were bound by their agreement.  The agree­ment as to venue was not
permissive but mandatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that neither they nor the private respondent
Jaime Blanco reside in Pasay City.  This
fact is, however, irrelevant to the resolution of the issue in this case since
parties do stipulate concerning the venue of an action without regard to their
residence.  In one case, it was held
that the parties stipulated that the venue of action shall be in the City of
Manila.  It was held that it was
reasonable to infer that the parties intended to fix the venue of their action,
in connection with the contract sued <span style="">upon,
in the proper court of the </span><span style="">City
of Manila </span><span style="">only, </span>notwithstanding
that neither one was a resident of Manila.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is nonetheless contended that the stipulation as to venue is
inapplicable because (1) only one of the petitioners (Virgilio B. Gesmundo) and
only one of the private respondents (JRB Realty) are parties to the lease
contract and (2) their cause of action is not based on the lease contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.  Petitioner Edna C. Gesmundo is the wife of the lessee Virgilio B.
Gesmundo, while Jaime R. Blanco is the president of the lessor JRB Realty
Corporation.  Their inclusion in this
case is not necessary.  What is more, <span style="">as </span>already noted, by its terms the
stipulation applies not only to the parties to the contract but to "any
persons claiming under each."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners claim that their cause of action is not based on the
lease contract because it seeks neither its implementation nor its the
cancellation.  The contention is also
without merit.  Petitioners' action is
for alleged breach of the lease contract which, it is contended, was terminated
to spite them.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Peti­tioners view this act of respondents as an abuse of right under arts. 19,
20, and 21 of the Civil Code, warranting an award of damages.  Their cause of action is ultimately anchored
on their right under the lease contract and, therefore, they cannot avoid the
limita­tion as to the venue in that contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there any warrant for petitioners' view that a motion to
dismiss on the ground of improper venue is based on a "mere technicality"
which "does not even pretend to invoke justice" and, therefore, must
not be sustained.  As we have in other
cases<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
held, "procedural rules are not to be belittled or dismissed simply
because their non-observance may have resulted in prejudice to a party's
substantive rights.  Like all rules,
they are required to be followed except only for the most persuasive of reasons
when they may be relaxed to relieve a litigant of an injustice not commensurate
with the degree of his thoughtlessness in not complying with the procedure
prescribed." Here what is involved is no less than the parties' agreement
to limit the venue of any action between them and those claiming under them
under the contract.  Petitioners must
abide by that agreement.</p>

from is AFFIRMED.</p>
