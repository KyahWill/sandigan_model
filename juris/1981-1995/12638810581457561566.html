the now defunct Workmen's Compensation Commission granting a limited award to
petitioner-claimant <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> <span class="SpellE">Zaragosa</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was employed by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> (Phil.) Inc. from <st1:date year="1954" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1954</st1:date>, to <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1965</st1:date>, as a laboratory tester in its refinery
in <span class="SpellE">Bauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1965</st1:date>,
he was found by the medical officer of <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>, Dr.
Jose <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>, to be suffering from allergic or contact
dermatitis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>test on the petitioner showed that he became distinctly
reactive to cracked <span class="SpellE">naptha</span> and benzene, hydrocarbons
which he had been handling in his work for the past 11 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>
recommended that direct contact with said hydrocarbons be avoided or
minimized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From <st1:date year="1965" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1965</st1:date>, up to <st1:date year="1966" day="21" month="9">September 21, 1966</st1:date>, the petitioner was treated
successively by Dr. Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>, Dr. Lourdes <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> and Dr. Luis Torres.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1965</st1:date>,
the petitioner requested transfer to another department, but <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> denied the request, explaining that it had in fact
an excess of personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zaragosa</span> was constrained to accept an offer for the
termination of his services due to redundancy, for which he received the sum of
P10,799.67 as cash separation settlement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was already 47 years old at that time.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner subsequently filed a claim for compensation with
the Regional Office No. 5 Workmen's Compensation Unit at <st1:place><st1:placename>San
  Pablo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> against
<span class="SpellE">Caltex</span>, and <st1:place>Liverpool</st1:place> and <st1:city><st1:place>London</st1:place></st1:city>
and Globe Insurance Co. Ltd., the insurance carrier, represented by Wise and
Co. Inc. as agent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1967" day="11" month="1">January 11, 1967</st1:date>,
Acting Referee Antonio <span class="SpellE">Atienza</span> rendered a decision,
disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, respondents are hereby
directed, jointly and severally:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1. To pay the
claimant, through this Office, the sum of One Hundred Seventy-Eight Pesos and
Thirty-Three Centavos (P178.33) as compensation, computed as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Compensation<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of 60% of his
average weekly wage from October 15, 1965 to November 2, 1965, a period of 19
days, or 2-5/7 weeks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sixty per centum
of his average weekly wage which was P109.50 equals P65.70 and for 2-5/7 weeks
he is entitled to P178.33."</p>

<blockquote>2. To pay counsel
for the claimant five per centum (5%) of the compensation due (P178.33 x .05)
or Eight Pesos and Ninety-Two Centavos (P8.92) as attorney's fee under the <span style="">provision of Section 31 of the Act;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3. To pay this
Office the sum of Five Pesos (P5.00) as fee due the Workmen's Compensation
Fund, under the provision of Section 55 of the Act;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. To have the
claimant examined immediately by a medical specialist at their expense and have
him treated, also at their own expense, until his allergic dermatitis is
pronounced cured and/or arrested.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner appealed to the Workmen's Compensation
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He argued that he was
entitled to compensation under Section 14 or 16 of the Workmen's Compensation
Act, as well as to reimbursement of the doctors' fees and the cost of the
medicines he had purchased.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated <st1:date year="1970" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1970</st1:date>, Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Paciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Villavieja</span> affirmed the appealed decision except as to the
amount of attorney's fees and the administrative fees, which were
increased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner said:</p>

<blockquote>The first error raised by claimant's counsel cannot be
sustained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have reviewed the entire
records and evidence and we fail to see whether the referee committed an
error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the compensation
awarded the claimant <span style="">in </span>this
case is based on Section 14 of <span style="">the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> Act.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">For clarity let us quote
hereunder the said section of the Act, relied upon by appellant in his petition
for review, in order to substantiate our stand.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"SEC. 14.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Total
disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>– In case the injury or
sickness causes temporary total disability for labor the employer shall, during
such disability, pay to the <span style="">injured
employee a weekly compensation equivalent to sixty per centum of his average
weekly wage but not less than fourteen pesos per week, except in the case
provided for in the next following paragraph.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No compensation shall be allowed for the first three calendar days of
incapacity resulting from an injury except the benefits provided for in the
preceding section; but if the incapacity extends beyond that period, compensation
shall be allowed from the first day of such incapacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Such weekly payments shall in no case
continue after the disability has ceased, nor shall the aggregate sum paid as
compensation exceed in any case six thousand pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But no award of permanent disability shall
take effect until after two weeks have elapsed from the date of the injury</u>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>It is thus clear that the amount of compensation awarded in the
decision under review is correct, having been computed on the basis of actual
number of days or weeks wherein herein claimant was rendered totally but
temporarily incapacitated to perform his work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We find Section 16, invoked by claimant's counsel, inapplicable in
this case since there <span style="">is </span>no
partial disability for labor, as this term is understood in this section.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can Section 18 of the Act be invoked,
because claimant does not suffer from any disfigurement of any kind, since his
illness was found to be contact allergy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, so long as claimant does not get in <span style="">touch with those he used to handle in
respondent's laboratory, there would be no </span>reaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, p. 30 hearing of Sept. 21, 1966).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, according to one of claimant's
doctors, Dr. Luis P. Torres, once the causative agent, the allergen, is
avoided, the claimant is free from allergy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, P. 52, hearing of October 24, 1966).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, record shows that on <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1965</st1:date>, the claimant was found, by the medical
officer of the respondent company to be suffering from "contact" or
allergic dermatitis, hence he was treated by the company doctor on the same
date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But claimant continued on working
for respondent and only did stop working on <st1:date year="1965" day="14" month="10">October 14, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was on sick leave with pay from <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1965</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1965</st1:date> after which he elected to resign voluntarily
due to "redundancy" and was thus paid a termination pay amounting to
P10,799.67.</blockquote>

<blockquote>His then attending physician, Dr. Rosalina S. Rosette, affirmed the
fact that claimant's temporary total disability for labor was only for 12
working days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit B, or the
Physician's Report).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said lady doctor
likewise declared that claimant was already well, so long as he is not in
contact with chemicals such <span style="">as </span>"cracked
<span class="SpellE">naptha</span> and benzene" (Exhibit B and C).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, claimant cannot return to his
former occupation, as laboratory tester of respondent's oil firm, as his
illness will recur after contact with said chemicals (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It is, therefore, crystal clear <span style="">that </span>claimant's disability for labor has already ceased as early
as <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1965</st1:date> when
he personally presented himself to the respondent's management requesting that
he be assigned to another work in respondent's company, meaning he is or was at
that time able and willing to work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, respondent turned down his plea due to
"redundancy" or excess of laborers performing the functions claimant
wished to do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead, claimant was
allowed to resign from the company and was granted all his monetary privileges
due him upon retirement, effective <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="11">November
 2, 1965</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">With respect to the claim
for reimbursement of medical expenses the same cannot be allowed not being duly
supported by corresponding receipts nor substantiated by the testimony of the
attending physicians.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(MRR Co. vs. M.
Rivera, G.R. No. L-23021, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="29" month="5"><span style="">May 29, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration having been denied on <st1:date year="1970" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1970</st1:date>, by the Commission <u>en</u>
<u>banc</u>, the petitioner has come to this Court, alleging that:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Workmen's Compensation Commission erred
and abused its discretion in holding that your petitioner was rendered totally
but temporarily incapacitated instead of totally and permanently incapacitated
by his <span style="">illness of contact or allergic
dermatitis under Section 14 of the Workmen's Compensation Law.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Workmen's Compensation Commission erred <span style="">in </span>not awarding to petitioner
P6,000.00 compensation in addition to its order to respondents to have
petitioner examined by a medical specialist and have him treated at their
expense until his allergic dermatitis is pronounced cured and/or arrested.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that the petitioner's sickness is
compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The public respondents had
already ruled as much on the basis of the Employer's Report of Accident or
Sickness that <span class="SpellE">Zaragosa</span> was suffering from
"allergic dermatitis" due to "contact with petroleum products"
while he was engaged in his "regular occupation." There was also the
memorandum of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> to the personnel manager to
the effect that the petitioner was "distinctly reactive to cracked <span class="SpellE">naptha</span> and benzene" and advising that direct contact
with the said materials be avoided or minimized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contact dermatitis is generally recognized <span style="">as a </span>compensable injury.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The real problem is the amount of disability benefits to which
the petitioner is entitled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The public respondents held that the petitioner merely suffered a
temporary total disability for labor during the period from <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1965</st1:date>, to <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1965</st1:date>, when he went on
sick leave as advised in the Physician's Report of Sickness or Accident
submitted by Dr. Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Rosete</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner contends, on the other hand,
that his disability should be categorized as permanent total or that he should
at least be awarded P6,000.00, the maximum benefits for temporary total
disability.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases of Romero vs. WCC,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Gonzales vs. WCC,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
and <span class="SpellE">Corales</span> v. ECC,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">&nbsp; </span>this Court declared that:</p>

<blockquote>Disability, as <span style="">a basis </span>for
compensation, is the combination of partial or total physical incapacity and of
inability to work, or inability to work with the same ease and competency as
before the injury, or the loss, total or partial, of earning power from the
injury.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>,
Section 535, p. 813).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Disability is used either in the <u>medical</u> or <u>physical </u>sense,
as evidenced by obvious loss of members or by <span style="">medical </span>testimony that the claimant simply cannot make the
necessary muscular movements and exertions;<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>it is used to mean <u>de facto inability to earn wages</u>, <span style="">as </span>evidenced by proof that claimant
has not in fact earned anything.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This medical and wage-loss aspects of disability <span style="">may </span>be more clearly illustrated as
follows:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A claimant <span style="">may </span>be, in <span style="">a medical </span>sense, utterly shattered and ruined, but may by sheer
determination and ingenuity contrive to make a<span style=""> </span>living for himself; conversely, a claimant may be able to work,
in both his and doctor's opinion, but awareness of his injury may lead
employers to refuse him employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The problem of the administrators of the Act is the proper
balancing of these medical and wage-loss factors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An absolute insistence on medical disability
in the abstract would produce a denial of compensation in the latter case,
although the wage-loss is as real and <span style="">as
</span>directly traceable to the injury as in any other instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the other extreme, "an insistence on
the wage-loss as the test would deprive the claimant in the former illustration
of an award, thus not only penalizing his laudable efforts to make the best of
his misfortune but also fostering the absurdity of <span style="">pronouncing </span><span style="">a man </span><span style="">non-disabled in spite of the unanimous
contrary evidence of medical experts and of common observation" (Larson,
Vol. II, p. 3).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span> vs. ECC,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
we reaffirmed the <span class="SpellE">Corales</span> Case and again held that
the Workmen's Compensation Act observes the wage-loss factor <span style="">as basis </span>for the granting of disability
benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not denied that the petitioner commenced employment at <span class="SpellE">Caltex</span> in 1954 as laboratory tester where he handled
hydrocarbons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that year, he
contracted contact dermatitis, the allergen (cause of the allergy) being
hydrocarbons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was treated and was
apparently cured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continued working
until his sensitivity to cracked <span class="SpellE">naptha</span> and benzene
again manifested itself on <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="9">September
 28, 1965</st1:date>, forcing him to stop working and go on sick leave from <st1:date year="1965" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1965</st1:date>, to <st1:date year="1965" day="2" month="11">November 2, 1965</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since his continued employment as laboratory
tester would further impair his health, and because his request for transfer to
another department was denied, he opted to resign and avail himself of
separation compensation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his
resignation, he sought other employment but to no avail because of his age and
lack of training in other work.</p>

<p class="BODY">The public respondent's submission that the petitioner is only
entitled to the amount of P178.33 <span style="">as </span>compensation
equivalent to 60% of his weekly wage for <span style="">2</span>-5/7
weeks is not sustainable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It loses sight
of the significance of the petitioner's resignation, the cause of such
resignation, and his ensuing continued unemployment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a consequence of his ailment, the
petitioner suffered a <u>de facto inability to earn wages</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
And this was not because of lack of effort on his part to have himself
re-employed but directly because of the allergic dermatitis which forced his
resignation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where an employee is constrained to retire at an early age due to
his illness and the illness persists even after retirement, resulting in his
continued unemployment, such a condition amounts to total disability, which
should entitle him to the maximum benefits allowed by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, we hold that the petitioner should be allowed the
maximum benefits of P6,000.00 under Section 14 of the Act (reproduced above),
for temporary total<span style="">&nbsp; </span>disability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, his claim for medical expenses
should be, and was properly disallowed by the WCC, for lack of supporting
receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conformably to the social justice policy and the constitutional
mandate for the protection of labor, the Workmen's Compensation Act should be
construed liberally in favor of the worker.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This piece of social legislation was <span style="">in </span>fact enacted for <span style="">his </span>benefit,
to provide him and his dependents with financial assistance when he is no
longer able to earn a living as he used to because of the employment-related
malady or accident that has afflicted him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The predicament of the petitioner falls squarely under the language and
motivation of the benevolent law, and we see no reason why its solicitude
should be withheld from him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Workmen's Compensation
Commission is REVERSED and SET ASIDE and the private respondents are ordered:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pay the petitioner
the sum of Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00) as compensation benefits;</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To provide claimant such
