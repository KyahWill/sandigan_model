filed an action for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">cancellation of
a mortgage credit in the sum of P200,000.00 annotated as a lien on the Transfer

the defendant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In its complaint
petitioner alleged, among others, that Roman R. Santos was the registered owner
of the <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span> Pare Estate covered by Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. 21761 and 1777 of the land records of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,

1941 and 1942, respectively; that on May 10, 1939 the four promissory notes
were assigned to the Philippine National Bank; that on June 14, 1940, the
Commonwealth of the Philippines, thru the defunct Rural Progress
Administration, purchased from Roman S. Santos the <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span>

Rural Progress Administration, the predecessor of the Land Tenure
Administration, lost the receipts of payment and/or deed of release of mortgage

registration of the Deed of Sale, TCT Nos. 28975 and 1478 were issued in lieu
of TCT Nos. 21761 and 1777 in the name of the Commonwealth of the Philippines
with the Philippine National Bank's lien annotated on said titles; that the
petitioner demanded on several occasions the cancellation of the lien annotated
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">on its </span>titles but defendant
refused to the prejudice not only of the petitioner but also of the hundreds of
tenants and occupants who had purchased from the government a portion of the <span class="SpellE">Bahay</span> Pare Estate; that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
