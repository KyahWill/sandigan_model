due proceedings, the lots were sold by the Sheriff to petitioner Fuentes as

"Special Civil Action No. V-3909 (For Contempt of Court)" before the

Cirilo Bacanto, Antonio Edaño and Arnaldo Vasquez, alleging among others, that

expose our Courts of justice to open ridicule and disrespect;'"<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

for the issuance of an order:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

rental of P500.00 per hectare for the 10 hectares at present planted by him to
sugarcanes on Lots Nos. 1652, 1653, 1655 and 1657 for the agricultural years
1975 and 1976, and after harvesting the present standing sugar crop, to desist

<p class="BODY">Respondent Cirilo Bacanto received summons on <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="4">April
 6, 1976</st1:date>, all defendants through counsel moved for an extension of
time to file an answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion was
granted by the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1976</st1:date>, defendant Antonio Edaño
filed his answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not one of the Bacanto
clan filed any answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1976</st1:date>,
the pre-trial hearing was set for <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="9">September

later reset to <st1:date year="1976" day="17" month="9">September 17, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On that date scheduled for pre-trial, all the
defendants and their counsel failed to appear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon motion of plaintiff Francisco <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">A.
Fuentes, all the defendants were declared in default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff was directed to present his
evidence before a commissioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1976</st1:date>,
upon motion of Arnaldo Vasquez, the court lifted the declaration of default
insofar as he was concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 3, 1977, respondent Cirilo Bacanto filed a motion to
quash/dismiss the complaint alleging as grounds therein that - (a) the facts
charged do not constitute an offense and/or the complaint states no cause of
action and (b) the cause of action is barred by statute of limitations and/or that
the criminal action or liability has been extinguished.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">After conducting hearings
on said motion, the respondent Judge issued the questioned order of </span><st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">July 27,
 1977</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, dismissing the
complaint for contempt as to respondent Cirilo Bacanto.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The court stated:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">“The Court finds that the
Complaint does not state that after the lands in question have been </span>delivered
to the plaintiffs, that actual ejectment of the defendants was effected by the
proper authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact it is
admitted in the Complaint that said defendants refused to remove their houses
and vacate the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it disobedience
for Cirilo Bacanto to re­fuse to vacate the premises even if he is not a party
to the original action, Civil Case No. 72 for Unlawful Detainer?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court says no, because the Court has not
acquired jurisdiction on his person.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court finds that defendant is not charged with conspiracy
to interfere or impede the enjoyment of the properties in question by
plaintiffs after the said properties were 'delivered' and that defendant has
not been actually ejected from the property in question."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">A motion for
reconsideration was denied prompting the petitioners to file the instant
petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The main issue raised by the
petitioners is -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>May a party after being duly summoned, and after nine months is
duly declared in default move to dismiss the complaint against him on the
ground that it does not state a cause of action without first moving for and
obtaining an order lifting the order of default?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">It is argued by
petitioners that when a defendant is declared in default, he loses his standing
or is considered out of court, and consequently cannot appear in court, adduce
evidence and be heard, and he is not entitled to notice of the proceedings
until the final termination of the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">To refute the respondent
Judge's finding that the complaint states no cause of action, the petitioners
argued further that there were sufficient allegations in the complaint stating
valid cause for injunction and damages, particularly the gathering of the
fruits of the coconut trees and bamboos standing on the parcels of land in
question by the defendants and their refusal to vacate the premises.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">On the other hand, the
private respondent claims that since he was not a party in Civil Case No. 72
for </span>unlawful detainer in the municipal court of Pilar, Capiz, the
failure to allege that he conspired with his co-defendants in the complaint for
contempt filed before the respondent court is tantamount to failure to state a
cause of action against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, Francisco A. Fuentes was sole plaintiff and
Emilio Bacanto, sole defendant in Civil Case No. 72 for unlawful detainer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Cirilo Bacanto was not a party in
Civil Case No. 72 but was included as a party with various other defendants in
the contempt of court charges arising from the detainer case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was the basis of Cirilo Bacanto's
invocation of lack of cause of action in his motion to quash or dismiss the complaint
and of the respondent court's finding of lack of jurisdiction over his person.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the rules of civil procedure in ordinary civil actions, the
private respondent could no longer file a motion to dismiss after he had been
declared in default and had done nothing to lift or set aside the said default
declaration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">A </span>defendant declared in default is not entitled to notice of
subsequent proceedings nor to take part in the trial (Sec. 2, Rule 18, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that a defaulting defendant does not completely lose
his standing under the revised Rules such as the right to appeal from the
judgment without having to file a petition to set aside the order of default,
the right to file a motion to dismiss is not among those granted to him (Cf.
Sec. 4, Rule 13; Sec. 2, Rule 41). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It is
not clear, therefore, why the respondent court acted favorably on the
defendant's motion to dismiss more than eight months after having declared him
in default.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">But more important, the
respondent court overlooked the fact that the case before it was a contempt
case and not the ejectment case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court erred in assuming that a contempt proceeding is governed by the
rules </span>of ordinary civil actions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A contempt case is a special civil action governed by Rule 71 of the
Rules of <span class="GramE">Court,</span> and by the rules on ordinary civil
actions only insofar as they are not inconsistent with the rules of the special
civil action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 1, Rule 62).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">A </span>contempt
charge partakes of the nature of a criminal prosecution and should follow
procedure similar to criminal prose­cutions (Flores <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">vs. </span>Ruiz, 90 SCRA 428; Lee Yick Hon. vs. Collector of Customs,
41 Phil. 548, 552).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Rule 71, a respondent in a contempt charge is not required
to file a formal answer similar to that in ordinary civil actions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the court must set the contempt
charge for hearing on a fixed date, on which date the respondent must make his
"appearance to answer the charge" (Sec. 5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If he shall fail to appear on the date fixed
for the hearing (and thus fail to answer or offer his testimony), the court may
order his arrest (Sec. 8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
does not declare him in default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
procedure is analogous to what follows the non-appearance of an accused in a
criminal case during arraignment to enter his plea.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The finding of the
respondent court that it </span>had not acquired jurisdiction over the person
of the private respondent in the contempt case because he was not a party to
the original action, Civil Case No. 72 for Unlawful Detainer, cannot be
sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent was not
asking for the dismissal of the ejectment case, but of the contempt proceeding
filed against him where he was duly summoned and, thru counsel, filed a motion
for extension of time to file an answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had therefore been placed under the jurisdiction of the court insofar
as the contempt case was concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The mishandling of this case by the respondent judge
notwithstanding, we have to sustain his order dismissing the complaint against
Cirilo Bacanto to avoid a remand that will result in unnecessary court
proceedings. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It was error for the
petitioners to file a petition for contempt of court as a mode of relief from
the refusal of the Bacanto clan to vacate the premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A refusal to obey the implementation of a
writ of execution in an ejectment case is not contempt of court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners should have filed a petition for the issuance of
a special order to destroy, demolish or remove the improvements on the property
subject of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This special order
may only issue upon the plaintiff's petition after due hearing and upon the
defendant's failure to remove the improvements within a reasonable time to be
fixed by the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 14, Rule 39,
Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Sec. 13, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, it is not enough
for the sheriff, in the enforcement of a judgment for delivery or restitution
of property, to merely direct the defeated party to <span class="GramE">effect</span>
such delivery or restitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
refusal of the defeated party to surrender the property to the winning party
upon the order of the sheriff does not constitute contempt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sheriff himself must oust the defeated
party from the property and <span class="GramE">effect</span> the delivery or
restitution by placing the winning party in possession of the property (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. Ramayat, 22 Phil. 183).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, if
to place the winning party in possession, the sheriff has to remove an
improvement made by the defeated party, he cannot do so, unless upon special
order of the court issuing the execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And this order may be granted only upon motion of the plaintiff with
notice and after hearing, and upon the defeated party's failure to remove the
improvement within the reasonable time given him by the court (Guevara v.
Laico, 64 Phil. 144).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is in
accordance with Sec. 14, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proper recourse of the petitioners, therefore, was to apply
for a special order of the court for demolition and removal of the judgment
debtor's hose, with due notice to the judgment debtor, and not the institution
of the contempt charge against the judg­ment debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Rom v. Cobadora, 28 SCRA 758, 763).</p>
