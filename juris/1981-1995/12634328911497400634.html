Bank of the Philippines, formerly Philippine <span class="SpellE">Amanah</span>
Bank (PAB) accuses public respondent Civil Service Commission (CSC) of grave
abuse of discretion in imposing the minimum penalty of suspension of one (1)
year under CSC Memorandum Circular No. 8, s. 1970 on<span style="font-size: 4pt;"> </span>private respondent Napoleon M. <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span>,
the Branch Manager of the bank in <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank
deemed the penalty incommensurate with the <span class="SpellE">CSC's</span>
finding that the private respondent was guilty of a serious grave misconduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are not disputed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are stated in the <span class="SpellE">CSC's</span>
Resolution No. 90-1014, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Respondent/Appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> was
formally charged by the then PAB Acting President Farouk A. <span class="SpellE">Carpizo</span>
for Neglect of Duty, Inefficiency and Incompetence arising from the alleged
unauthorized and illegal encashment of commercial checks drawn against <span class="SpellE">uncleared</span> and unfunded deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said checks were all deposited, through a
series of several deposits, in the Savings Account of one <span class="SpellE">Portri</span>
<span class="SpellE">Gandarosa</span> in the PAB, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Branch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The transactions under question covered the period from <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1986</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged deposits were allegedly approved
by the former Cashier, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Sayson</span>
and all withdrawals were made and approved by the said branch accountant and
approved by the Respondent/Appellant as Branch Manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be it noted, that during those times of the
alleged commission of the said irregularities, Respondent/Appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">was </span>then the Manager of the <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Branch.</blockquote>

directly or indirectly from the transactions to the detriment of the bank and
therefore he is presumed to have acted in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for his failure to give a convincing
proof that he exercised due care and diligence like a good father of a family
in the performance of his duties, respondent Napoleon M. <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span>
is hereby found guilty of NEGLECT OF DUTY.</p>

</span>Under the Civil Service Rules, Neglect of Duty is a light offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Credited in his favor are three (3)
mitigating circumstances (length of service, first offense and good faith) with<span style="font-size: 4pt;"> </span>no aggravating circumstances, hence, the
imposable penalty would be the minimum for light offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Reprimand or fine or

<blockquote>Upon<span style=""> </span>receipt of the report of
the Investigating Committee, the same was referred by the then PAB Acting
President to the Corporate Secretary, Atty. Ernesto Duran for comment and
recommendation, who recommended that Respondent/Appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span>
should be charged of either Misconduct or Conduct Prejudicial to the Best
Interest <span style="">of </span>the Bank; that
nevertheless, even under the charge of Neglect of Duty for which he was found
guilty by the Investigating Committee, a higher penalty is imposable under CSC
Memorandum Circular No. 8, s. 1970; that <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> must
also be found guilty of violating the Central Bank's Manual of Regulations for
Banks and other Financial Intermediaries; and that contrary to the findings of
the Investigating Committee that there are no aggravating circumstances, abuse
of confidence should be considered against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The then PAB Acting President submitted both the Report of the
Investigating Committee and the recommendation of Atty. Duran to the PAB Board
of Directors for appropriate action.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The PAB Board of Directors, in its Resolution No. 1714-K, dated
March 7, 1989, resolved to approve the finding of the Investigating Committee
that Respondent/Appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> is guilty of Neglect
of Duty with an imposable penalty of 'Forced Resignation without prejudice to
Reinstatement.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>Respondent/Appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> appealed to
the MSPB, which found out and ruled, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘After a careful and thorough evaluation of all the records of the
case, this Board agrees with the findings of the Investigating Committee that
there is no proof that respondent-appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span>
tolerated the anomalies nor is there any showing that he benefited directly or
indirectly from the transactions to the detriment of the Bank and therefore is
presumed to have acted in good faith.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, for his failure to exercise due care and diligence of a good
father of a family in the performance of his duties and observance of his obligation,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> is hereby found guilty of Neglect
of Duty and is hereby meted the penalty of suspension for six (6) months
notwithstanding the presence of mitigating circumstances of length of service
considering that the Bank suffered loss of money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Loss or abuse of confidence cannot be
considered as an aggravating circumstance being analogous to the other grave
circumstances as contended by the Acting President of the Philippine <span class="SpellE">Amanah</span> Bank." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.

pertaining to the instant appeal, the Commission finds Respondent/Appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> guilty <span style="">not </span>only
of 'Gross Neglect of Duty,' which is a less grave offense under CSC Memorandum
Circular No. 8, s. 1970 but also of ‘Grave Misconduct and Conduct Prejudicial
to the Best interest of the Service’ which are grave offenses under the same
Memorandum Circular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, as
correctly alleged by the then PAB Acting President <span class="SpellE">Carpizo</span>
in his 'Comment on Appellant's Appeal to the MSPB' dated <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="7">July 26, 1989</st1:date>, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The appellant is fully aware that his previous position as Branch
Manager of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span>
is lodged with very high responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The exercise of his responsibilities is not merely ministerial but laden
with decision making.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Out there, in his
own branch, he is a little president whose actuation and decision must be
endowed with great prudence and care lest incompetence and inefficiency will
result into financial loss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">True, it is the Branch Cashier, <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sayson</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span>
solely approved the series of withdrawals against unfunded deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the appellant was fully aware that under
the Bank's Manual on Signing Authority, a Branch Cashier is authorized to
approve cash withdrawals up to P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and beyond
such amount the approval of the Branch Manager is required.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">The series of unauthorized withdrawals made upon the sole authority
of the Cashier ranges from a minimum withdrawn amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
to a maximum amount of P86,500.00 blatantly beyond the authority of the
Cashier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And what was aggravating was
the fact that it was committed thirteen (13) times under the very nose of the
appellant from <st1:date year="1986" day="28" month="1">28 January 1986</st1:date>
up to <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="9">05 September 1986</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Yet due to the sheer incompetence, appellant
even approved the series of accountant's blocking sheets containing and showing
the unauthorized withdrawals made by the Branch Cashier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">The argument of the appellant that the approval of the Accountant's
blocking sheets does not mean approval of the irregular transactions is flimsy
and incongruous with the Bank's Job Description Manual which provides that:</p>

<p class="2Q">I.<span style=""> </span><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Basic</u> <u>Function</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>Branch</u> <u>Manager</u></p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 76.5pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">Assumes
direct control, responsibility for and supervision over activities and business
affairs of the Branch.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">II<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Responsibilities</u></span></p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 76.5pt; text-indent: 0in;">Reviews daily
transactions and results of operations; analyzes trends in deposit,
withdrawals, clearing operations; cash position, fund transfers, loaning grants
and collection.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, it is crystal clear therefore that the function
and responsibilities of a Branch Manager is (sic) not merely ministerial but
laden with decision-making and analysis of transactions and results of
operation, particularly those involving money matters.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the instant case, when the appellant was then a Branch Manager,
he was expected and presumed to have read, reviewed and analyzed the contents
of the Accountant's blocking sheets containing the anomalous transactions
including the supporting proof sheets and withdrawal slips made on the unfunded
deposits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the appellant was remiss
in observing even the ordinary care and prudence in the discharge of his
function and responsibilities.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can
he argue that his approval of the Accountant's blocking sheet does not mean he
approved of the irregular transaction, when under the Bank's Job Description
Manual, he is responsible and duty bound to review daily transactions and
results of operations, analyze trends in deposit withdrawals, clearing operations,
cash position, fund transfers, loan grants and collections which were all
reflected, stated and contained in the Accountant's blocking sheets.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘By affixing his signature in the Accountant's blocking sheets
which contain and carry the irregular transactions he is grossly incompetent
and negligent in the observance and discharge of his duties and
responsibilities spelled out in the Bank's Job Description Manual.’</p>

<blockquote>Be it noted that the Investigating Committee, the PAB Board of
Directors and the MSPB are one in their findings that Respondent/Appellant <span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> is guilty of 'Neglect of Duty.' However, based on
the facts and circumstances of the instant case <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
CSC Memorandum Circular No. 8, s. 1970, which does not penalize 'Neglect of
Duty' but 'Gross Neglect of Duty' as a less grave offense, respondent/appellant
<span class="SpellE">Malbun</span> should have been charged and found guilty of
'Gross Neglect of Duty.' Nevertheless, considering that he is now found guilty
of the said offense by this Commission based on the aforesaid allegations, he
should also be penalized for 'Serious/Grave Misconduct' and 'Conduct
Prejudicial to the interest of the Banking System.' The Supreme Court in the
case of <span class="SpellE">Oyao</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Pabatao</span> (78
SCRA 93) ruled that a transgression of some established and definite rule of
action, more particularly, unlawful behavior or gross negligence by the public
officer is a Serious Misconduct. A Serious or Grave Misconduct is a grave
offense under the said CSC Memorandum Circular No. 8, s. 1970.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, considering the existence
of the two (2) mitigating circumstances of length of service in the government
service and first offense and the aggravating circumstance of abuse of
confidence, the minimum of the penalty for grave offense under CSC Memorandum
Circular No. 8, s. 1970 of suspension of one (1) year is imposable.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 38-40)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner bank filed a motion for reconsideration of the
aforesaid resolution stating therein that the circumstance of prior conviction
of the private respondent in 1979 for “neglect of duty as charged and upon
suspension from the service for four (4) months effective upon receipt of this
approval, xxx” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 11) should be considered in
determining the proper penalty (which should be dismissal) to be imposed on the
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The CSC, however, refused to consider this "prior
conviction" of the private respondent on the ground that this is not a
newly discovered evidence and that the petitioner in its exercise of reasonable
diligence could have discovered and produced the document during the hearing
conducted or could have presented the same in its appeal to the Merit Systems
Protection Board (MSPB) as well as in the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated <st1:date year="1991" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1991</st1:date>, we gave due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition <span style="">is </span>impressed
with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 695 of the Revised Administrative Code of 1917 provides
that a civil service subordinate officer or employee, may for neglect of duty
or violation of reasonable office regulations x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> be removed from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Memorandum Circular No. 8, Series
of 1970 of the Civil Service Commission (Guidelines in the Application of
Penalties) provides the penalties for grave offenses, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Transfer</span> or demotion in rank or salary from two to three grades
or suspension for one year in its minimum period.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Forced resignation without prejudice to
reinstatement to forced resignation with prejudice to reinstatement in its
medium period.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissal</span> in its maximum period."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The following are considered mitigating circumstances:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Good
faith</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Length of service in the government.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span><span class="GramE">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Analogous</span>
circumstances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Civil Service Commission considered as mitigating
circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) length of service,
and (2) first offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The CSC also
considered abuse of confidence as aggravating circumstance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the private respondent joined the bank on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He committed the offense in 1986.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is no dispute that length of
service in the government can be considered a mitigating circumstance in his
favor.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, we do not agree that the mitigating circumstance of <u>first</u>
<u>offense</u> can be considered in favor of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted that the private respondent was found guilty of
approving a series of accountant's blocking sheets containing and showing
thirteen (13) transgressions of the branch cashier wherein the latter approved
unauthorized withdrawal against unfunded deposits ranging from P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to P86,570.00 which are beyond the P5,000,00 limit
that a branch cashier is authorized to approve as regards cash withdrawals to
the detriment of the petitioner bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
fact, the petitioner bank lost P597<span class="GramE">,450.05</span> as a result
of these unauthorized withdrawals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
these circumstances, we cannot categorize the private respondent's grave
misconduct as <u><span style="">first</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>offense</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent committed thirteen
(13) offenses at different times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
private respondent’s repeated transgressions, standing alone, warrant
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we ruled in the case of
<u>Philippine</u> <u>National</u><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> </span><u><span style="">Bank</span></u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">
</span><u>v</u>. <u>Intermediate</u> <u>Appellate</u> <u>Court</u> (187 SCRA
757 [1990]):</p>

<blockquote>"The Court of Appeals reduced the penalty from dismissal to
suspension for six (6) months without pay by reason of mitigating
circumstances--good faith and disparity between the penalties imposed on the
respondent and on other implicated offenders.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it may indeed be questionable that other persons were not as
severely punished, (unfortunately they are beyond the court's reach),
petitioner's repeated violations (92 times), standing alone, merit
dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> (Adm.
Matter No.</span> P-312, 78 SCRA 210), gross misconduct in office by a sheriff
was punished by dismissal from the service with forfeiture of all
benefits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was reiterated in <span class="SpellE">Abdulwahid</span> v. Reyes (Adm. Matter No P-902 &amp; 926, <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="1">Jan. 31, 1978</st1:date>; Antonio v. Diaz, Adm.
Matter No. P-1568, 94 SCRA 890), where a deputy sheriff found guilty of serious
misconduct in office was likewise dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Good faith cannot be appreciated in favor of private respondent
considering the repeated violations." (<span class="GramE">at</span> p. 762)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, we agree with the petitioner that "prior
conviction" should have been considered by the Commission in imposing the
proper penalty on the private respondent although it was presented only in the
petitioner's motion for reconsideration/motion for new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the document showing the private respondent's
prior conviction in 1979 is not a newly discovered evidence but "forgotten
evidence" considering that the same already existed or was available
before or during the trial which was known and obtainable by the petitioner
bank and could have been presented were it not for the oversight or
forgetfulness of the petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Tumang</span> v. Court of
Appeals, 172 SCRA 328 [1989]), and therefore, applying rigid technical rules,
such document is not admissible as evidence against the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, administrative
agencies like the Civil Service Commission exercising quasi-judicial functions
are free from the rigidity of certain procedural requirements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Esquig</span> v. Civil
Service Commission, 188 SCRA 166 [1990]) We rule that in the case of the
document showing prior conviction of the private respondent, such should have
been admitted considering that it is a public document and within the judicial
notice of the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 12(4)
of Chapter 3, Book VII of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 12.</span> <span class="GramE">Rules of
Evidence.</span> -</blockquote>

<blockquote>In a contested case:</blockquote>

technical or scientific facts within its specialized knowledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties shall be notified and afforded an
opportunity to contest the facts so noticed." (Official Gazette, Vol. 83,
No. 39, p. 171)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Commission is the central personnel agency of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the repository of all
government appointments as well as all records of final decisions in
administrative cases against government employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is deemed to have judicial notice
of such prior conviction of the private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What the Commission should have done,
therefore, was to notify the private respondent to rebut such document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the records reveal that the
document showing prior conviction of the private respondent is
indisputable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily, even if we
consider the private respondent's repeated violations as <u>one</u> offense,
the admission of this document would readily reveal that this is not his first
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the Commission also applied CSC Memorandum Circular No. 6,
Series of 1991, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
[I]n the appreciation of any mitigating circumstances in favor of the
respondent in an administrative case and/or aggravating circumstances against
him, the same must be invoked or pleaded by the proper party, otherwise the
said circumstances shall not be considered in the determination of the proper
penalty to be imposed against the respondent concerned." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 56-57)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">to</span> the instant
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission held that the Memorandum
Circular should be applied retroactively insofar as it benefits the respondent
but it would not be applied to increase the penalty imposable to the private
respondent otherwise this will be tantamount to violating the prohibition on <u>ex-post</u>
<u>facto</u> law as the Memorandum was issued after the commission of the
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that the Circular was filed with the University
of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Philippines</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Law</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> only on <st1:date year="1991" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 4, Chapter 2, Book VII of the Revised Administrative Code of 1987
provides <span style="">that "</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> each rule shall become effective fifteen (15) days from
the date of filing x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
The Commission issued its resolution on <st1:date year="1991" day="21" month="3">March
 21, 1991</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, the
Commission erred in applying the said circular insofar as it benefited the
private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Memorandum
Circular was not yet in effect at the time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The well-entrenched principle is that "a statute operates
prospectively only and not retroactively, <u><span style="">unless</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">le</span>g</u><u><span style="">islative</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>intent</u> <u>the</u> <u>contrary</u> <u>is</u><span style=""> </span><u>made</u> <u><span style="">manifest</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>either</u>
<u>b</u><u><span style="">y</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>express</u> <u>terms</u>
<u><span style="">of</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>the</u> <u>statute</u> <u><span style="">or</span></u><span style=""> <u>by</u> <u>neces</u></span><u>sary</u>
<u>implication</u>." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> v.
Court of Appeals, 128 SCRA 519 [1984] cited in <span class="SpellE">Puzon</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Abellera</span>, 169 SCRA 789 [1989]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>We rule that the same principle is applicable
to administrative rules and regulations issued by the government agencies in
their duty to implement laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Memorandum Circular does not in indicate that it should be applied
retroactively, hence the general rule that a statute operates prospectively
must be followed.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing considerations, the only remaining mitigatin<span style="">g</span> <span style="">circumstance in favor </span>of the private respondent is length of
service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">is, </span>however, offset by the aggravating circumstance of abuse of
confidence found by the Commission.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under these circumstances, we <span style="">rule
</span>that the proper penalty for<span style=""> </span>the
repeated offenses committed by the private respondent against the beneficial
interest of the petitioner is dismissal from the government service with
forfeiture of benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">And finally, the Civil Service Commission totally ignored the fact
that the respondent is a Bank Manager who is in charge of daily transactions
involving millions of pesos.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is <span style="">a </span>tremendous difference between the
degree of <span style="">responsibility, </span>care,
and trustworthiness expected of a clerk or ordinary employee in the bureaucracy
and that required of bank managers, cashiers, finance officers, and other
officials directly handling large sums of money and properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The standards in the interpretation of good faith, due care,
diligence of a good father of a family, neglect of duty, grave misconduct and
conduct prejudicial to the interest of the service are not rigid or inflexible
terms to be applied like the bed of <span class="SpellE">Procrustes</span>
without considering attendant circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, a bank manager who did not learn from an earlier four months
suspension for neglect of duty in 1979 and who allowed kiting operations under
his very nose to happen in 1986 until his bank lost P597<span class="GramE">,450.05</span>
should not be returned to his former position as Bank Manager.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no room for negligence and
carelessness in managing a bank.</p>

Service Commission are REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp;
