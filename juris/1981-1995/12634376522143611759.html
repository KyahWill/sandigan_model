				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The value-added tax (VAT) is levied on the sale, barter or

<p class="BODY">These questions will be dealt in the order they are stated
above.  As will presently be explained
not all of these questions are judicially cognizable, because not all
provisions of the Constitution are self executing and, therefore, judicially
enforceable.  The other departments of
the government are equally charged with the enforcement of the Constitution,
especially the provisions relating to them.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">I. PROCEDURAL ISSUES</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of petitioners is that in enacting Republic Act
No. 7716, or the Expanded Value-Added Tax Law, Congress violated the
Constitution because, although H. No. 11197 had originated in the House of
Representatives, it was not passed by the Senate but was simply consolidated
with the Senate version (S. No. 1630) in the Conference Committee to produce
the bill which the President signed into law.  The following provisions of the Constitution are cited in support of the
proposition that because Republic Act No. 7716 was passed in this manner, it
did not originate in the House of Representatives and it has not thereby become
a law:</p>

<blockquote><i>Art. VI, § 24</i>:  All
appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public
debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall originate exclusively
in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with
amendments.</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Id., § 26(2)</i>:  No
bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it has passed three
readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have
been distributed to its Members three days before its passage, except when the
President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a
public calamity or emergency.  Upon the
last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed, and the vote
thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the <i>yeas</i> and <i>nays</i>
entered in the Journal.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on various dates between July 22, 1992 and August
31, 1993, several bills<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> were
introduced in the House of Representatives seeking to amend certain provisions
of the National Internal Revenue Code relative to the value-added tax or
VAT.  These bills were referred to the
House Ways and Means Committee which recommended for approval a substitute
measure, H. No. 11197, entitled</p>

<blockquote>AN ACT RESTRUCTURING
THE VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT) SYSTEM TO WIDEN ITS TAX BASE AND ENHANCE ITS
ADMINISTRATION, AMENDING FOR THESE PURPOSES SECTIONS 99, 100, 102, 103, 104,
105, 106, 107, 108 AND 110 OF TITLE IV, 112, 115 AND 116 OF TITLE V, AND 236,
237 AND 238 OF TITLE IX, AND REPEALING SECTIONS 113 AND 114 OF TITLE V, ALL OF
THE NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The bill (H. No. 11197) was considered on second reading starting
November 6, 1993 and, on November 17, 1993, it was approved by the House of
Representatives after third and final reading.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was sent to the Senate on November 23, 1993 and later referred
by that body to its Committee on Ways and Means.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 7, 1994, the Senate Committee submitted its report
recommending approval of S. No. 1630, entitled</p>

<blockquote>AN ACT RESTRUCTURING
THE VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT) SYSTEM TO WIDEN ITS TAX BASE AND ENHANCE ITS
ADMINISTRATION, AMENDING FOR THESE PURPOSES SECTIONS 99, 100, 102, 103, 104,
105, 107, 108, AND 110 OF TITLE IV, 112 OF TITLE V, AND 236, 237, AND 238 OF
TITLE IX, AND REPEALING SECTIONS 113, 114 and 116 OF TITLE V, ALL OF THE
NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It was stated that the bill was being
submitted "in substitution of Senate Bill No. 1129, taking into
consideration P. S. Res. No. 734 and H. B. No. 11197. "</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 8, 1994, the Senate began consideration of the bill
(S. No. 1630).  It finished debates on
the bill and approved it on second reading on March 24, 1994.  On the same day, it approved the bill on
third reading by the affirmative votes of 13 of its members, with one
abstention.</p>

<p class="BODY">H. No. 11197 and its Senate version (S. No. 1630) were then
referred to a conference committee which, after meeting four times (April 13,
19, 21 and 25, 1994), recommended that "House Bill No. 11197, in
consolidation with Senate Bill No. 1630, be approved in accordance with the
attached copy of the bill as reconciled and approved by the conferees."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Conference Committee bill, entitled "AN ACT
RESTRUCTURING THE VALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT) SYSTEM, WIDENING ITS TAX BASE AND
ENHANCING ITS ADMINISTRATION AND FOR THESE PURPOSES AMENDING AND REPEALING THE
RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED, AND FOR
OTHER PURPOSES," was thereafter approved by the House of Representatives
on April 27, 1994 and by the Senate on May 2, 1994.  The enrolled bill was then presented to the President of the
Philippines who, on May 5, 1994, signed it.  It became Republic Act No. 7716.  On May 12, 1994, Republic Act No. 7716 was published in two newspapers
of general circulation and, on May 28, 1994, it took effect, although its
implementation was suspended until June 30, 1994 to allow time for the
registration of business entities.  It
would have been enforced on July 1, 1994 but its enforcement was stopped
because the Court, by the vote of 11 to 4 of its members, granted a temporary
restraining order on June 30, 1994.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>First</i>.  Petitioners'
contention is that Republic Act No. 7716 did not "originate
exclusively" in the House of Representatives as required by Art. V1, § 24
of the Constitution, because it is in fact the result of the consolidation of
two distinct bills, H. No. 11197 and S. No. 1630.  In this connection, petitioners point out that although Art. VI,
§ 24 was adopted from the American Federal Constitution,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> it is
notable in two respects:  the verb
"shall originate" is qualified in the Philippine Constitution by the
word "exclusively" and the phrase "as on other bills" in
the American version is omitted.  This
means, according to them, that to be considered as having originated in the
House, Republic Act No. 7716 must retain the essence of H. No. 11197.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument will not bear analysis.  To begin with, it is not the law – but the revenue bill – which
is required by the Constitution to "originate exclusively" in the
House of Representatives.  It is
important to emphasize this, because a bill originating in the House may undergo
such extensive changes in the Senate that the result may be a rewriting of the
whole.  The possibility of a third
version by the conference committee will be discussed later.  At this point, what is important to note is
that, as a result of the Senate action, a distinct bill may be produced.  To insist that a revenue statute – and not
only the bill which initiated the legislative process culminating in the
enactment of the law – must substantially be the same as the House bill would
be to deny the Senate's power not only to "<b>concur with amendments</b>"
but also to "<b>propose amendments</b>." It would be to violate the
coequality of legislative power of the two houses of Congress and in fact make
the House superior to the Senate.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the constitutional design is to limit the
Senate's power in respect of revenue bills in order to compensate for the grant
to the Senate of the treaty-ratifying power<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> and
thereby equalize its powers and those of the House overlooks the fact that the
powers being compared are different.  We
are dealing here with the legislative power which under the Constitution is
vested not in any particular chamber but in the Congress of the Philippines,
consisting of "a Senate and a House of Representatives."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The exercise of the treaty-ratifying power is not the exercise of legislative
power.  It is the exercise of a check on
the executive power.  There is,
therefore, no justification for comparing the legislative powers of the House
and of the Senate on the basis of the possession of such nonlegislative power
by the Senate.  The possession of a
similar power by the U.S. Senate<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> has
never been thought of as giving it more legislative powers than the House of
Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the United States, the validity of a provision (§ 37) imposing
an <i>ad valorem</i> tax based on the weight of vessels, which the U.S. Senate
had inserted in the Tariff Act of 1909, was upheld against the claim that the
provision was a revenue bill which originated in the Senate in contravention of
Art. I, § 7 of the U.S. Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> Nor
is the power to amend limited to adding a provision or two in a revenue bill
emanating from the House.  The U.S.
Senate has gone so far as changing the whole of bills following the enacting
clause and substituting its own versions.  In 1883, for example, it struck out everything after the enacting clause
of a tariff bill and wrote in its place its own measure, and the House
subsequently accepted the amendment.  The U.S. Senate likewise added 847 amendments to what later became the
Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act of 1909; it dictated the schedules of the Tariff Act
of 1921; it rewrote an extensive tax revision bill in the same year and recast
most of the tariff bill of 1922.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Given, then, the power of the Senate to propose amendments, the Senate can
propose its own version even with respect to bills which are required by the
Constitution to originate in the House.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is insisted, however, that S. No. 1630 was passed not in
substitution of H. No. 11197 but of another Senate bill (S. No. 1129) earlier
filed and that what the Senate did was merely to "take [H. No. 11197] into
consideration" in enacting S. No. 1630.  There is really no difference between the Senate preserving H. No. 11197
up to the enacting clause and then writing its own version following the
enacting clause (which, it would seem, petitioners admit is an amendment by
substitution), and, on the other hand, separately presenting a bill of its own
on the same subject matter.  In either
case the result are two bills on the same subject.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, what the Constitution simply means is that the <b>initiative</b>
for filing revenue, tariff, or tax bills, bills authorizing an increase of the
public debt, private bills and bills of local application must come from the
House of Representatives on the theory that, elected as they are from the
districts, the members of the House can be expected to be more sensitive to the
local needs and problems.  On the other
hand, the senators, who are elected at large, are expected to approach the same
problems from the national perspective.  Both views are thereby made to bear on the enactment of such laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor does the Constitution prohibit the filing in the Senate of a
substitute bill in anticipation of its receipt of the bill from the House, so
long as action by the Senate as a body is withheld pending receipt of the House
bill.  The Court cannot, therefore,
understand the alarm expressed over the fact that on March 1, 1993, eight
months before the House passed H. No. 11197, S. No. 1129 had been filed in the
Senate.  After all it does not appear
that the Senate ever considered it.  It
was only after the Senate had received H. No. 11197 on November 23, 1993 that the
process of legislation in respect of it began with the referral to the Senate
Committee on Ways and Means of H. No. 11197 and the submission by the Committee
on February 7, 1994 of S. No. 1630.  For
that matter, if the question were simply the priority in the time of filing of
bills, the fact is that it was in the House that a bill (H. No. 253) to amend
the VAT law was first filed on July 22, 1992.  Several other bills had been filed in the House before S. No. 1129 was
filed in the Senate, and H. No. 11197 was only a substitute of those earlier
bills.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Second</i>.  Enough has
been said to show that it was within the power of the Senate to propose S. No.
1630.  We now pass to the next argument
of petitioners that S. No. 1630 did not pass three readings on <b>separate days</b>
as required by the Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
because the second and third readings were done on the same day, March 24,
1994.  But this was because on February
24, 1994<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and again on March 22, 1994,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> the
President had certified S. No. 1630 as urgent.  The presidential certification dispensed with the requirement not only
of printing but also that of reading the bill on separate days.  The phrase "except when the President
certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment, etc." in. Art. VI,
§26(2) qualifies the two stated conditions before a bill can become a law:  (i) the bill has passed three readings on
separate days and (ii) it has been printed in its final form and distributed
three days before it is finally approved.</p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, the "unless" clause must be read in
relation to the "except" clause, because the two are really coordinate
clauses of the same sentence.  To
construe the "except" clause as simply dispensing with the second
requirement in the "unless" clause (<i>i.e., </i>printing and
distribution three days before final approval) would not only violate the rules
of grammar.  It would also negate the
very premise of the "except" clause:  the necessity of securing the immediate enactment of a bill which is
certified in order to meet a public calamity or emergency.  For if it is only the printing that is
dispensed with by presidential certification, the time saved would be so
negligible as to be of any use in insuring immediate enactment.  It may well be doubted whether doing away
with the necessity of printing and distributing copies of the bill three days
before the third reading would insure speedy enactment of a law in the face of
an emergency requiring the calling of a special election for President and
Vice-President.  Under the Constitution
such a law is required to be made within seven days of the convening of
Congress in emergency session.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That upon the certification of a bill by the President the
requirement of three readings on separate days and of printing and distribution
can be dispensed with is supported by the weight of legislative practice.  For example, the bill defining the <i>certiorari</i>
jurisdiction of this Court which, in consolidation with the Senate version,
became Republic Act No. 5440, was passed on second and third readings in the
House of Representatives on the same day (May 14, 1968) after the bill had been
certified by the President as urgent.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no merit in the contention that presidential
certification dispenses only with the requirement for the printing of the bill
and its distribution three days before its passage but not with the requirement
of three readings on separate days, also.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is nonetheless urged that the certification of the bill in
this case was invalid because there was no emergency, the condition stated in
the certification of a "growing budget deficit" not being an unusual
condition in this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that no member of the Senate saw fit to
controvert the reality of the factual basis of the certification.  To the contrary, by passing S. No. 1630 on
second and third readings on March 24, 1994, the Senate accepted the
President's certification.  Should such
certification be now reviewed by this Court, especially when no evidence has
been shown that, because S. No. 1630 was taken up on second and third readings
on the same day, the members of the Senate were deprived of the time needed for
the study of a vital piece of legislation?</p>

<p class="BODY">The sufficiency of the factual basis of the suspension of the
writ of habeas corpus or declaration of martial law under Art. VII, § 18, or
the existence of a national emergency justifying the delegation of
extraordinary powers to the President under Art. VI, § 23(2), is subject to
judicial review because basic rights of individuals may be at hazard.  But the factual basis of presidential certification
of bills, which involves doing away with procedural requirements designed to
insure that bills are duly considered by members of Congress, certainly should
elicit a different standard of review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also invite attention to the fact that the President
certified S. No. 1630 and not H. No. 11197.  That is because S. No. 1630 was what the Senate was considering.  When the matter was before the House, the
President likewise certified H. No. 9210 then pending in the House.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Third</i>.  Finally it
is contended that the bill which became Republic Act No. 7716 is the bill which
the Conference Committee prepared by consolidating H. No. 11197 and S. No.
1630.  It is claimed that the Conference
Committee report included provisions not found in either the House bill or the
Senate bill and that these provisions were "surreptitiously" inserted
by the Conference Committee.  Much is
made of the fact that in the last two days of its session on April 21 and 25,
1994 the Committee met behind closed doors.  We are not told, however, whether the provisions were not the result of
the give and take that often mark the proceedings of conference committees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there anything unusual or extraordinary about the fact
that the Conference Committee met in executive sessions.  Often the only way to reach agreement on
conflicting provisions is to meet behind closed doors, with only the conferees
present.  Otherwise, no compromise is
likely to be made.  The Court is not
about to take the suggestion of a cabal or sinister motive attributed to the
conferees on the basis solely of their "secret meetings" on April 21
and 25, 1994, nor read anything into the incomplete remarks of the members,
marked in the transcript of stenographic notes by ellipses.  The incomplete sentences are probably due to
the stenographer's own limitations or to the incoherence that sometimes
characterize conversations.  William
Safire noted some such lapses in recorded talks even by recent past Presidents
of the United States.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, in the United States conference committees had been
customarily held in executive sessions with only the conferees and their staffs
in attendance.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Only in November 1975 was a new rule adopted requiring open sessions.  Even then a majority of either chamber's
conferees may vote in public to close the meetings.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the possibility of an entirely new bill emerging out of a
Conference Committee, it has been explained:</p>

<blockquote>Under congressional rules of procedure, conference committees are
not expected to make any material change in the measure at issue, either by
deleting provisions to which both houses have already agreed or by inserting
new provisions.  But this is a difficult
provision to enforce.  Note the problem
when one house amends a proposal originating in either house by striking out
everything following the enacting clause and substituting provisions which make
it an entirely new bill.  The versions
are now altogether different, permitting a conference committee to draft
essentially a new bill. . . .<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The result is a third version, which is
considered an "amendment in the nature of a substitute," the only
requirement for which being that the third version be germane to the subject of
the House and Senate bills.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, this Court recently held that it is within the power of a
conference committee to include in its report an entirely new provision that is
not found either in the House bill or in the Senate bill.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
If the committee can propose an amendment consisting of one or two provisions,
there is no reason why it cannot propose several provisions, collectively considered
as an "amendment in the nature of a substitute," so long as such
amendment is germane to the subject of the bills before the committee.  After all, its report was not final but
needed the approval of both houses of Congress to become valid as an act of the
legislative department.  The charge that
in this case the Conference Committee acted as a third legislative chamber is
thus without any basis.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, it is argued that under the respective Rules of the
Senate and the House of Representatives a conference committee can only act on
the differing provisions of a Senate bill and a House bill, and that contrary
to these Rules the Conference Committee inserted provisions not found in the
bills submitted to it. The following provisions are cited in support of this
contention:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in 10pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.3in;"><u><span style="font-size: 11pt; font-weight: normal;">Rules of

<blockquote>§ 26.  In the event that the

composition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The President shall designate the members of the conference

<blockquote><u>Each Conference Committee Report shall contain a detailed and
sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject

<blockquote>The consideration of such report shall not be in order unless the

been distributed to the Members.</blockquote>

<blockquote>§ 85.  <i>Conference
Committee Reports</i>.  - In the event
that the House does not agree with the Senate on the amendments to any bill or
joint resolution, <u>the differences may be settled by conference committees of
both Chambers</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The consideration of conference committee reports shall always be
in order, except when the journal is being read, while the roll is being called
or the House is dividing on any question.  Each of the pages of such reports shall be signed by the conferees.  <u>Each report shall contain a detailed,
sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject
measure</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The consideration of such report shall not be in order unless
copies thereof are distributed to the Members:  <i>Provided</i>, That in the last fifteen days of each session period it
shall be deemed sufficient that three copies of the report, signed as above
provided, are deposited in the office of the Secretary General.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, nothing in the Rules limits a conference committee to
a consideration of conflicting provisions.  But Rule XLIV, § 112 of the Rules of the Senate is cited to the effect
that "If there is no Rule applicable to a specific case the precedents of
the Legislative Department of the Philippines shall be resorted to, and as a
supplement of these, the Rules contained in Jefferson's Manual." The
following is then quoted from the Jefferson's Manual:</p>

<blockquote>The managers of a conference must confine themselves to the
differences committed to them … and may not include subjects not within
disagreements, even though germane to a question in issue.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Note that, according to Rule XLIX, § 112, in case there is no
specific rule applicable, resort must be to the legislative practice.  The Jefferson's Manual is resorted to only
as supplement.  It is common place in
Congress that conference committee reports include new matters which, though
germane, have not been committed to the committee.  This practice was admitted by Senator Raul S. Roco, petitioner in
G.R. No. 115543, during the oral argument in these cases.  Whatever, then, may be provided in the
Jefferson's Manual must be considered to have been modified by the legislative
practice.  If a change is desired in the
practice it must be sought in Congress since this question is not covered by
any constitutional provision but is only an internal rule of each house.  Thus, Art. VI, § 16(3) of the Constitution
provides that "Each House may determine the rules of its proceedings. . .
." </p>

<p class="BODY">This observation applies to the other contention that the Rules
of the two chambers were likewise disregarded in the preparation of the
Conference Committee Report because the Report did not contain a "detailed
and sufficiently explicit statement of changes in, or amendments to, the
subject measure." The Report used brackets and capital letters to indicate
the changes.  This is a standard
practice in bill-drafting.  We cannot
say that in using these marks and symbols the Committee violated the Rules of
the Senate and the House.  Moreover,
this Court is not the proper forum for the enforcement of these internal
Rules.  To the contrary, as we have
already ruled, "parliamentary rules are merely procedural and with their
observance the courts have no concern."<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> Our
concern is with the procedural requirements of the Constitution for the
enactment of laws.  As far as these
requirements are concerned, we are satisfied that they have been faithfully
observed in these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there any reason for requiring that the Committee's Report
in these cases must have undergone three readings in each of the two
houses.  If that be the case, there
would be no end to negotiation since each house may seek modifications of the
compromise bill.  The nature of the
bill, therefore, requires that it be acted upon by each house on a "take
it or leave it" basis, with the only alternative that if it is not
approved by both houses, another conference committee must be appointed.  But then again the result would still be a
compromise measure that may not be wholly satisfying to both houses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Art. VI, § 26(2) must, therefore, be construed as referring only
to bills introduced <b>for the first time</b> in either house of Congress, not
to the conference committee report.  For
if the purpose of requiring three readings is to give members of Congress time
to study bills, it cannot be gainsaid that H. No. 11197 was passed in the House
after three readings; that in the Senate it was considered on first reading and
then referred to a committee of that body; that although the Senate committee
did not report out the House bill, it submitted a version (S. No. 1630) which
it had prepared by "taking into consideration" the House bill; that
for its part the Conference Committee consolidated the two bills and prepared a
compromise version; that the Conference Committee Report was thereafter
approved by the House and the Senate, presumably after appropriate study by
their members.  We cannot say that, as a
matter of fact, the members of Congress were not fully informed of the
provisions of the bill.  The allegation
that the Conference Committee usurped the legislative power of Congress is, in
our view, without warrant in fact and in law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Fourth</i>.  Whatever
doubts there may be as to the formal validity of Republic Act No. 7716 must be
resolved in its favor.  Our cases<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
manifest firm adherence to the rule that an enrolled copy of a bill is
conclusive not only of its provisions but also of its due enactment.  Not even claims that a proposed
constitutional amendment was invalid because the requisite votes for its
approval had not been obtained<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> or
that certain provisions of a statute had been "smuggled" in the
printing of the bill<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> have
moved or persuaded us to look behind the proceedings of a coequal branch of the
government.  There is no reason now to
depart from this rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">No claim is here made that the "enrolled bill" rule is
absolute.  In fact in one case<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
we "went behind" an enrolled bill and consulted the Journal to determine
whether certain provisions of a statute had been approved by the Senate in view
of the fact that the President of the Senate himself, who had signed the
enrolled bill, admitted a mistake and withdrew his signature, so that in effect
there was no longer an enrolled bill to consider.<span style="font-size: 10pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">But where allegations that the constitutional procedures for the
passage of bills have not been observed have no more basis than another
allegation that the Conference Committee "surreptitiously" inserted
provisions into a bill which it had prepared, we should decline the invitation
to go behind the enrolled copy of the bill.  To disregard the "enrolled bill" rule in such cases would be
to disregard the respect due the other two departments of our government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><i>Fifth</i>.  An additional
attack on the formal validity of Republic Act No. 7716 is made by the
Philippine Airlines, Inc., petitioner in G.R. No. 11582, namely, that it
violates Art. VI, § 26(1) which provides that "Every bill passed by
Congress shall embrace only one subject which shall be expressed in the title
thereof.” It is contended that neither H. No. 11197 nor S. No. 1630 provided
for removal of exemption of PAL transactions from the payment of the VAT and
that this was made only in the Conference Committee bill which became Republic
Act No. 7716 without reflecting this fact in its title.</p>

<p class="BODY">The title of Republic Act No. 7716 is:</p>

<blockquote>AN ACT RESTRUCTURING
THE VALUE?ADDED TAX (VAT) SYSTEM, WIDENING ITS TAX BASE AND ENHANCING ITS
ADMINISTRATION, AND FOR THESE PURPOSES AMENDING AND REPEALING THE RELEVANT
PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, AS AMENDED, AND FOR OTHER
PURPOSES.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Among the provisions of the NIRC amended is § 103, which
originally read:</p>

<blockquote>§ 103.  Exempt
transactions.  - The following shall be
exempt from the value-added tax:</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>(q) Transactions which are exempt under special laws or
international agreements to which the Philippines is a signatory.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Among the transactions exempted from the
VAT were those of PAL because it was exempted under its franchise (P.D. No.
1590) from the payment of all "other taxes . . . now or in the near
future," in consideration of the payment by it either of the corporate
income tax or a franchise tax of 2%.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of its amendment by Republic Act No. 7716, § 103 of
the NIRC now provides:</p>

<blockquote>§ 103.  Exempt
transactions.  - The following shall be
exempt from the value-added tax:</blockquote>

<blockquote>. . . .</blockquote>

<blockquote>(q) Transactions
which are exempt under special laws, except those granted under Presidential
Decree Nos. 66, 529, 972, 1491, 1590. . . .</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The effect of the amendment is to remove the exemption granted to
PAL, as far as the VAT is concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question is whether this amendment of § 103 of the NIRC is
fairly embraced in the title of Republic Act No. 7716, although no mention is
made therein of P.D. No. 1590 as among those which the statute amends.  We think it is, since the title states that
the purpose of the statute is to expand the VAT system, and one way of doing this
is to widen its base by withdrawing some of the exemptions granted before.  To insist that P.D. No. 1590 be mentioned in
the title of the law, in addition to § 103 of the NIRC, in which it is
specifically referred to, would be to insist that the title of a bill should be
a complete index of its content.</p>

<p class="BODY">The constitutional requirement that every bill passed by Congress
shall embrace only one subject which shall be expressed in its title is
intended to prevent surprise upon the members of Congress and to inform the
people of pending legislation so that, if they wish to, they can be heard
regarding it.  If, in the case at bar,
petitioner did not know before that its exemption had been withdrawn, it is not
because of any defect in the title but perhaps for the same reason other
statutes, although published, pass unnoticed until some event somehow calls
attention to their existence.  Indeed,
the title of Republic Act No. 7716 is not any more general than the title of
PAL's own franchise under P.D. No. 1590, and yet no mention is made of its tax
exemption.  The title of P.D. No. 1590
is:</p>

<blockquote>AN ACT GRANTING A NEW
FRANCHISE TO PHILIPPINE AIRLINES, INC. TO ESTABLISH, OPERATE, AND MAINTAIN
AIR-TRANSPORT SERVICES IN THE PHILIPPINES AND BETWEEN THE PHILIPPINES AND OTHER
COUNTRIES.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trend in our cases is to construe the constitutional
requirement in such a manner that courts do not unduly interfere with the
enactment of necessary legislation and to consider it sufficient if the title
expresses the general subject of the statute and all its provisions are germane
to the general subject thus expressed.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is further contended that amendment of petitioner's franchise
may only be made by special law, in view of § 24 of P.D. No. 1590 which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>This franchise, as
amended, or any section or provision hereof may only be modified, amended, or
repealed expressly by a special law or decree that shall specifically modify,
amend, or repeal this franchise or any section or provision thereof.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This provision is evidently intended to prevent the amendment of
the franchise by mere implication resulting from the enactment of a later
inconsistent statute, in consideration of the fact that a franchise is a
contract which can be altered only by consent of the parties.  Thus in <i>Manila Railroad Co. v. Rafferty</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that an Act of the U.S. Congress, which provided for the payment of
tax on certain goods and articles imported into the Philippines, did not amend
the franchise of plaintiff, which exempted it from all taxes except those
mentioned in its franchise.  It was held
that a special law cannot be amended by a general law.</p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, in the case at bar, Republic Act No. 7716 expressly
amends PAL's franchise (P.D. No. 1590) by specifically excepting from the grant
of exemptions from the VAT PAL's exemption under P.D. No. 1590.  This is within the power of Congress to do
under Art. XII, 11 of the Constitution, which provides that the grant of a
franchise for the operation of a public utility is subject to amendment,
alteration or repeal by Congress when the common good so requires.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II. SUBSTANTIVE ISSUES<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="font-weight: normal;">A. <i>Claims of Press
Freedom, Freedom of Thought and Religious Freedom<o:p></o:p></i></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Philippine Press Institute (PPI), petitioner in G.R. No.
115544, is a nonprofit organization of newspaper publishers established for the
improvement of journalism in the Philippines.  On the other hand, petitioner in G.R. No. 115781, the Philippine Bible
Society (PBS), is a nonprofit organization engaged in the printing and
distribution of bibles and other religious articles.  Both petitioners claim violations of their rights under §§ 4 and
5 of the Bill of Rights as a result of the enactment of the VAT Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The PPI questions the law insofar as it has withdrawn the
exemption previously granted to the press under § 103 (f) of the NIRC.  Although the exemption was subsequently
restored by administrative regulation with respect to the circulation income of
newspapers, the PPI presses its claim because of the possibility that the
exemption may still be removed by mere revocation of the regulation of the Secretary
of Finance.  On the other hand, the PBS
goes so far as to question the Secretary's power to grant exemption for two
reasons:  (1) The Secretary of Finance
has no power to grant tax exemption because this is vested in Congress and
requires for its exercise the vote of a majority of all its members<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
and (2) the Secretary's duty is to execute the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">§ 103 of the NIRC contains a list of transactions exempted from
VAT.  Among the transactions previously
granted exemption were:</p>

<blockquote>(f)  Printing, publication,
importation or sale of books and any newspaper, magazine, review, or bulletin
which appears at regular intervals with fixed prices for subscription and sale
and which is devoted principally to the publication of advertisements.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 7716 amended § 103 by deleting ¶ (f) with the
result that print media became subject to the VAT with respect to all aspects
of their operations.  Later, however,
based on a memorandum of the Secretary of Justice, respondent Secretary of
Finance issued Revenue Regulations No. 11-94, dated June 27, 1994, exempting
the "circulation income of print media pursuant to § 4 Article III of the
1987 Philippine Constitution guaranteeing against abridgment of freedom of the
press, among others." The exemption of "circulation income" has
left income from advertisements still subject to the VAT.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is unnecessary to pass upon the contention that the exemption
granted is beyond the authority of the Secretary of Finance to give, in view of
PPI's contention that even with the exemption of the circulation revenue of
print media there is still an unconstitutional abridgment of press freedom
because of the imposition of the VAT on the gross receipts of newspapers from
advertisements and on their acquisition of paper, ink and services for
publication.  Even on the assumption
that no exemption has effectively been granted to print media transactions, we
find no violation of press freedom in these cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, we are not dealing here with a statute that <i>on its
face</i> operates in the area of press freedom.  The PPI's claim is simply that, <i>as applied </i>to newspapers,
the law abridges press freedom.  Even
with due recognition of its high estate and its importance in a democratic society,
however, the press is not immune from general regulation by the State.  It has been held:</p>

<blockquote>The publisher of a newspaper has no
immunity from the application of general laws.  He has no special privilege to invade the rights and liberties of
others.  He must answer for libel.  He may be punished for contempt of court. .
. .  Like others, he must pay equitable
and nondiscriminatory taxes on his business. . . .<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The PPI does not dispute this point,
either.</p>

<p class="BODY">What it contends is that by withdrawing the exemption previously
granted to print media transactions involving printing, publication,
importation or sale of newspapers, Republic Act No. 7716 has singled out the
press for discriminatory treatment and that within the class of mass media the
law discriminates against print media by giving broadcast media favored
treatment.  We have carefully examined
this argument, but we are unable to find a differential treatment of the press
by the law, much less any censorial motivation for its enactment.  If the press is now required to pay a
value-added tax on its transactions, it is not because it is being singled out,
much less targeted, for special treatment but only because of the removal of
the exemption previously granted to it by law.  The withdrawal of exemption is all that is involved in these cases.  Other transactions, likewise previously
granted exemption, have been delisted as part of the scheme to expand the base
and the scope of the VAT system.  The
law would perhaps be open to the charge of discriminatory treatment if the only
privilege withdrawn had been that granted to the press.  But that is not the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The situation in the case at bar is indeed a far cry from those
cited by the PPI in support of its claim that Republic Act No. 7716 subjects
the press to discriminatory taxation.  In the cases cited, the discriminatory purpose was clear either from the
background of the law or from its operation.  For example, in <i>Grosjean v. American Press Co</i>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
the law imposed a license tax equivalent to 2% of the gross receipts derived
from advertisements only on newspapers which had a circulation of more than
20,000 copies per week.  Because the tax
was not based on the volume of advertisement alone but was measured by the extent
of its circulation as well, the law applied only to the thirteen large
newspapers in Louisiana, leaving untaxed four papers with circulation of only
slightly less than 20,000 copies a week and 120 weekly newspapers which were in
serious competition with the thirteen newspapers in question.   It was well known that the thirteen
newspapers had been critical of Senator Huey Long, and the Long?dominated
legislature of Louisiana responded by taxing what Long described as the
"lying newspapers" by imposing on them "a tax on lying."
The effect of the tax was to curtail both their revenue and their
circulation.  As the U.S. Supreme Court
noted, the tax was "a deliberate and calculated device in the guise of a
tax to limit the circulation of information to which the public is entitled in
virtue of the constitutional guaranties."<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> The
case is a classic illustration of the warning that the power to tax is the
power to destroy.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the other case<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
invoked by the PPI, the press was also found to have been singled out because
everything was exempt from the "use tax" on ink and paper, except the
press.  Minnesota imposed a tax on the
sales of goods in that state.  To
protect the sales tax, it enacted a complementary tax on the privilege of
"using, storing or consuming in that state tangible personal
property" by eliminating the residents' incentive to get goods from
outside states where the sales tax might be lower.  The <i>Minnesota Star Tribune</i> was exempted from both taxes
from 1967 to 1971.  In 1971, however,
the state legislature amended the tax scheme by imposing the "use
tax" on the cost of paper and ink used for publication.  The law was held to have singled out the
press because (1) there was no reason for imposing the "use tax"
since the press was exempt from the sales tax and (2) the "use tax"
was laid on an "intermediate transaction rather than the ultimate retail
sale." Minnesota had a heavy burden of justifying the differential
treatment and it failed to do so.  In
addition, the U.S. Supreme Court found the law to be discriminatory because the
legislature, by again amending the law so as to exempt the first $100,000 of
paper and ink used, further narrowed the coverage of the tax so that "only
a handful of publishers pay any tax at all and even fewer pay any significant
amount of tax."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a> The
discriminatory purpose was thus very clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">More recently, in <i>Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
it was held that a law which taxed general interest magazines but not
newspapers and religious, professional, trade and sports journals was
discriminatory because while the tax did not single out the press as a whole,
it targeted a small group within the press.  What is more, by differentiating on the basis of contents (<i>i.e</i>.,
between general interest and special interests such as religion or sports) the
law became "entirely incompatible with the First Amendment's guarantee of
freedom of the press."</p>

<p class="BODY">These cases come down to this:  that unless justified, the differential treatment of the press creates
risks of suppression of expression.  In
contrast, in the cases at bar, the statute applies to a wide range of goods and
services.  The argument that, by
imposing the VAT only on print media whose gross sales exceeds P480,000 but not
more than P750,000, the law discriminates<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a> is
without merit since it has not been shown that as a result the class subject to
tax has been unreasonably narrowed.  The
fact is that this limitation does not apply to the press alone but to all
sales.  Nor is impermissible motive
shown by the fact that print media and broadcast media are treated differently.  The press is taxed on its transactions
involving printing and publication, which are different from the transactions
of broadcast media.  There is thus a
reasonable basis for the classification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases canvassed, it must be stressed, eschew any suggestion
that "owners of newspapers are immune from any forms of ordinary
taxation." The license tax in the <i>Grosjean</i> case was declared
invalid because it was "one single in kind, with a long history of hostile
misuse against the freedom of the press."<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a> On
the other hand, <i>Minneapolis Star</i> acknowledged that "The First
Amendment does not prohibit all regulation of the press [and that] the States
and the Federal Government can subject newspapers to generally applicable
economic regulations without creating constitutional problems."<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What has been said above also disposes of the allegations of the
PBS that the removal of the exemption of printing, publication or importation
of books and religious articles, as well as their printing and publication,
likewise violates freedom of thought and of conscience.  For as the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously
held in <i>Jimmy Swaggart Ministries v. Board of Equalization</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a>
the Free Exercise of Religion Clause does not prohibit imposing a generally
applicable sales and use tax on the sale of religious materials by a religious
organization.</p>

<p class="BODY">This brings us to the question whether the registration provision
of the law,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
although of general applicability, nonetheless is invalid when applied to the
press because it lays a prior restraint on its essential freedom.  The case of <i>American Bible Society v.
City of Manila</i><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a> is
cited by both the PBS and the PPI in support of their contention that the law
imposes censorship.  There, this Court
held that an ordinance of the City of Manila, which imposed a license fee on
those engaged in the business of general merchandise, could not be applied to
the appellant's sale of bibles and other religious literature.  This Court relied on <i>Murdock v.
Pennsylvania</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a> in
which it was held that, as a license fee is fixed in amount and unrelated to
the receipts of the taxpayer, the license fee, when applied to a religious
sect, was actually being imposed as a condition for the exercise of the sect's
right under the Constitution.  For that
reason, it was held, the license fee "restrains in advance those
constitutional liberties of press and religion and inevitably tends to suppress
their exercise."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But, in this case, the fee in § 107, although a fixed amount
(P1,000), is not imposed for the exercise of a privilege but only for the
purpose of defraying part of the cost of registration.  The registration requirement is a central
feature of the VAT system.  It is
designed to provide a record of tax credits because any person who is subject
to the payment of the VAT pays an input tax, even as he collects an output tax
on sales made or services rendered.  The
registration fee is thus a mere administrative fee, one not imposed on the
exercise of a privilege, much less a constitutional right.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the foregoing reasons, we find the attack on Republic Act No.
7716 on the ground that it offends the free speech, press and freedom of
religion guarantees of the Constitution to be without merit.  For the same reasons, we find the claim of the
Philippine Educational Publishers Association (PEPA) in G.R. No. 115931 that
the increase in the price of books and other educational materials as a result
of the VAT would violate the constitutional mandate to the government to give
priority to education, science and technology (Art. II,§17) to be untenable.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><i><span style="font-weight: normal;">B. Claims of
Regressivity, Denial of Due Process, Equal Protection, and Impairment of
Contracts</span></i><span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is basis for passing upon claims that on its face the
statute violates the guarantees of freedom of speech, press and religion.  The possible "chilling effect"
which it may have on the essential freedom of the mind and conscience and the
need to assure that the channels of communication are open and operating
importunately demand the exercise of this Court's power of review.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, however, no justification for passing upon the claims
that the law also violates the rule that taxation must be progressive and that
it denies petitioners' right to due process and the equal protection of the
laws.  The reason for this different
treatment has been cogently stated by an eminent authority on constitutional
law thus:  "[W]hen freedom of the
mind is imperiled by law, it is freedom that commands a momentum of respect;
when property is imperiled it is the lawmakers' judgment that commands
respect.  This dual standard may not
precisely reverse the presumption of constitutionality in civil liberties
cases, but obviously it does set up a hierarchy of values within the due
process clause."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the absence of threat of immediate harm makes the need for
judicial intervention less evident and underscores the essential nature of
petitioners' attack on the law on the grounds of regressivity, denial of due
process and equal protection and impairment of contracts as a mere academic
discussion of the merits of the law.  For the fact is that there have even been no notices of assessments
issued to petitioners and no determinations at the administrative levels of
their claims so as to illuminate the actual operation of the law and enable us
to reach sound judgment regarding so fundamental questions as those raised in
these suits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the broad argument against the VAT is that it is regressive
and that it violates the requirement that "The rule of taxation shall be
uniform and equitable [and] Congress shall evolve a progressive system of
taxation."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
Petitioners in G.R. No. 115781 quote from a paper, entitled "VAT Policy
Issues:  Structure, Regressivity,
Inflation and Exports" by Alan A. Tait of the International Monetary Fund,
that "VAT payment by low-income households will be a higher proportion of
their incomes (and expenditures) than payments by higher-income
households.  That is, the VAT will be
regressive." Petitioners contend that as a result of the uniform 10% VAT,
the tax on consumption goods of those who are in the higher-income bracket,
which before were taxed at a rate higher than 10%, has been reduced, while
basic commodities, which before were taxed at rates ranging from 3% to 5%, are
now taxed at a higher rate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Just as vigorously as it is asserted that the law is regressive,
the opposite claim is pressed by respondents that in fact it distributes the
tax burden to as many goods and services as possible particularly to those
which are within the reach of higher?income groups, even as the law
exempts basic goods and services.  It is
thus equitable.  The goods and
properties subject to the VAT are those used or consumed by higher-income
groups.  These include real properties
held primarily for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course
of business, the right or privilege to use industrial, commercial or scientific
equipment, hotels, restaurants and similar places, tourist buses, and the
like.  On the other hand, small business
establishments, with annual gross sales of less than P500,000, are
exempted.  This, according to
respondents, removes from the coverage of the law some 30,000 business
establishments.  On the other hand, an
occasional paper<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Center for Research and Communication cites a NEDA study that the VAT
has minimal impact on inflation and income distribution and that while
additional expenditure of the lowest income class is only P301 or 1.49% a year,
that for a family earning P500,000 a year or more is P8,340 or 2.2%.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lacking empirical data on which to base any conclusion regarding
these arguments, any discussion whether the VAT is regressive in the sense that
it will hit the "poor" and middle-income group in society harder than
it will the "rich," as the Cooperative Union of the Philippines (CUP)
claims in G.R. No. 115873, is largely an academic exercise.  On the other hand, the CUP's contention that
Congress' withdrawal of exemption of producers cooperatives, marketing
cooperatives, and service cooperatives, while maintaining that granted to
electric cooperatives, not only goes against the constitutional policy to
promote cooperatives as instruments of social justice (Art. XII, § 15) but also
denies such cooperatives the equal protection of the law is actually a policy
argument.  The legislature is not
required to adhere to a policy of "all or none" in choosing the
subject of taxation.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is the contention of the Chamber of Real Estate and Builders
Association (CREBA), petitioner in G.R. 115754, that the VAT will reduce the
mark up of its members by as much as 85% to 90% any more concrete.  It is a mere allegation.  On the other hand, the claim of the
Philippine Press Institute, petitioner in G.R. No. 115544, that the VAT will
drive some of its members out of circulation because their profits from
advertisements will not be enough to pay for their tax liability, while
purporting to be based on the financial statements of the newspapers in
question, still falls short of the establishment of facts by evidence so
necessary for adjudicating the question whether the tax is oppressive and
confiscatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, regressivity is not a negative standard for courts to
enforce.  What Congress is required by
the Constitution to do is to "evolve a progressive system of
taxation." This is a directive to Congress, just like the directive to it
to give priority to the enactment of laws for the enhancement of human dignity
and the reduction of social, economic and political inequalities (Art. XIII, §
1), or for the promotion of the right to "quality education" (Art.
XIV, § 1).  These provisions are put in
the Constitution as moral incentives to legislation, not as judicially
enforceable rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">At all events, our 1988 decision in <i>Kapatiran</i><a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
should have laid to rest the questions now raised against the VAT.  There similar arguments made against the
original VAT Law (Executive Order No. 273) were held to be hypothetical, with
no more basis than newspaper articles which this Court found to be
"hearsay and [without] evidentiary value." As Republic Act No. 7716
merely expands the base of the VAT system and its coverage as provided in the
original VAT Law, further debate on the desirability and wisdom of the law
should have shifted to Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">Only slightly less abstract but nonetheless hypothetical is the
contention of CREBA that the imposition of the VAT on the sales and leases of
real estate by virtue of contracts entered into prior to the effectivity of the
law would violate the constitutional provision that "No law impairing the
obligation of contracts shall be passed." It is enough to say that the
parties to a contract cannot, through the exercise of prophetic discernment,
fetter the exercise of the taxing power of the State.  For not only are existing laws read into contracts in order to
fix obligations as between parties, but the reservation of essential attributes
of sovereign power is also read into contracts as a basic postulate of the
legal order.  The policy of protecting
contracts against impairment presupposes the maintenance of a government which
retains adequate authority to secure the peace and good order of society.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In truth, the Contract Clause has never been thought as a
limitation on the exercise of the State's power of taxation save only where a
tax exemption has been granted for a valid consideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a>
Such is not the case of PAL in G.R. No. 115852, and we do not understand it to
make this claim.  Rather, its position,
as discussed above, is that the removal of its tax exemption cannot be made by
a general, but only by a specific, law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The substantive issues raised in some of the cases are presented
in abstract, hypothetical form because of the lack of a concrete record.  We accept that this Court does not only
adjudicate private cases; that public actions by "non-Hohfeldian"<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
or ideological plaintiffs are now cognizable provided they meet the standing
requirement of the Constitution; that under Art. VIII, § 1, ¶ 2 the Court has a
"special function" of vindicating constitutional rights.  Nonetheless the feeling cannot be escaped
that we do not have before us in these cases a fully developed factual record
that alone can impart to our adjudication the impact of actuality<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
to insure that decision-making is informed and well grounded.  Needless to say, we do not have power to
render advisory opinions or even jurisdiction over petitions for declaratory
judgment.  In effect we are being asked
to do what the Conference Committee is precisely accused of having done in
these cases — to sit as a third legislative chamber to review legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are told, however, that the power of judicial review is not so
much <b>power</b> as it is <b>duty </b>imposed on this Court by the
Constitution and that we would be remiss in the performance of that duty if we
decline to look behind the barriers set by the principle of separation of
powers.  Art. VIII, § I, ¶ 2 is cited in
support of this view:</p>

<blockquote>Judicial power includes the duty of the courts of justice to settle
actual controversies involving rights which are legally demandable and
enforceable, and to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any
branch or instrumentality of the Government.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To view the judicial power of review as a <b>duty</b> is nothing
new.  Chief Justice Marshall said so in
1803, to justify the assertion of this power in <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>:</p>

<blockquote>It is emphatically the province and <b>duty</b> of the judicial
department to say what the law is.  Those who apply the rule to particular cases must of necessity expound
and interpret that rule.  If two laws
conflict with each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Justice Laurel echoed this justification in 1936 in <i>Angara v.
Electoral Commission</i>:</p>

<blockquote>And when the judiciary mediates to allocate
constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other
departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the
legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred <b>obligation</b> assigned
to it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under
the Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the
rights which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This conception of the judicial power has
been affirmed in several cases<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a> of
this Court following <i>Angara</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It does not add anything, therefore, to invoke this
"duty" to justify this Court's intervention in what is essentially a
case that at best is not ripe for adjudication.  That duty must still be performed in the context of a concrete
case or controversy, as Art. VIII, § 5(2) clearly defines our jurisdiction in
terms of "cases," and nothing but "cases." That the other
departments of the government may have committed a grave abuse of discretion is
not an independent ground for exercising our power.  Disregard of the essential limits imposed by the case and
controversy requirement can in the long run only result in undermining our
authority as a court of law.  For, as
judges, what we are called upon to render is judgment according to law, not
according to what may appear to be the opinion of the day.</p>

Art. VII, § 10 provides:  "The
Congress shall, at ten o'clock in the morning of the third day after the
vacancy in the offices of the President and Vice-President occurs, convene in
accordance with its rules without need of a call and within seven days enact a
law calling for a special election to elect a President and a Vice-President to
be held not earlier than forty-five days nor later than sixty days from the
time of such call.  The bill calling
such special election shall be deemed certified under paragraph 2, Section 26,
Article VI of this Constitution and shall become law upon its approval on third
reading by the Congress.  Appropriations
for the special election shall be charged against any current appropriations
and shall be exempt from the requirements of paragraph 4, Section 25, Article
VI of this Constitution.  The convening
of the Congress cannot be suspended nor the special election postponed.  No special election shall be called if the
vacancy occurs within eighteen months before the date of the next presidential
election."</p>

The charge is an old one.  In the United
States, the same charge, including claims that important provisions were being
"surreptitiously added" in the committee, was made in the 1940s.  But no satisfactory alternative to the
conference committee has been devised.  And today, given the bicameral nature of the U.S. Congress, the charge
is no longer heard.  Compare the
following from a 1945 comment:  "As
a devise for oiling the machinery of legislation, committees of conference are,
under American conditions, useful, if not indispensable.  Nevertheless, they have shortcomings.  Without exception, they work behind closed
doors, hold no hearings, and give their proceedings no publicity.  Doubtless it would be difficult for them to
make headway if they did otherwise.  Nevertheless, in view of the power which they wield, strong objection
can be, and is, raised.  For, while the
committees are supposed to deal only with actual differences between the houses
and to stay well within the bounds set by the extreme positions which the
houses have taken, they often work into measures, as reported, provisions of
their own devising, even going so far as to rewrite whole sections with the
sole purpose of incorporating the views which the majority members happen to
hold. . . .  In practice, this often
results in the adoption of important provisions, more or less surreptitiously added,
without consideration by either house -- in other words, legislation nominally
by Congress but actually by conference committee.  Any remedy found will probably take the form of reducing the need
for using conference committees at all; and the principal suggestion to that
end is that bills and resolutions be referred, not, as now, to separate
committees of the two houses, but to joint committees, which not only would
hold single sets of hearings, but might deliberate and report back bills to the
two houses in such agreed form that further significant differences would not
be likely to develop.  Arrangements of
this nature yield excellent results in the legislature of Massachusetts.  But there are obstacles to adoption of the
plan for Congress, not the least of them being a natural aversion of House
members to joint committees in which senators seem likely to dominate; and, as <i>indicated</i>
below, the outlook for the reform is problematical." F.A. OGG AND P.O.
RAY, <i>supra</i> note 7 at 310-311.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">BELLOSILLO, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With a consensus already reached after due deliberations, silence
perhaps should be the better part of discretion, except to vote.  The different views and opinions expressed are
so persuasive and convincing; they are more than enough to sway the pendulum
for or against the subject petitions.  The penetrating and scholarly dissertations of my brethren should
dispense with further arguments which may only confound and confuse even the
most learned of men.</p>

<p class="BODY">But there is a crucial point, a constitutional issue which, I
submit, has been belittled, treated lightly, if not almost considered
insignificant and purposeless.  It is
elementary, as much as it is fundamental.  I am referring to the word "exclusively" appearing in Sec. 24,
Art. VI, of our 1987 Constitution.  This
is regrettable, to say the least, as it involves a constitutional mandate
which, wittingly or unwittingly, has been cast aside as trivial and
meaningless.</p>

<p class="BODY">A comparison of the particular provision on the enactment of
revenue bills in the U.S. Constitution with its counterpart in the Philippine
Constitution will help explain my position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the U.S. Constitution, "[a]ll bills for raising
revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may
propose or concur with amendments as on other bills" (Sec. 7, par. [1],
Art. I).  In contrast, our 1987
Constitution reads:  "All
appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the
public debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall originate <u>exclusively</u>
in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with
amendments" (Sec. 24, Art. VI; underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">As may be gleaned from the pertinent provision of our
Constitution, all revenue bills are required to originate
"exclusively" in the House of <span style="">Representatives.  On the other hand, the U.S. Constitution
does not use the word "exclusively;" it merely says, "[a]ll
bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the term "exclusively" has already been
adequately defined in the various opinions, as to which there seems to be no
dispute, I shall no longer offer my own definition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Verily, the provision in
our Constitution requiring that all revenue bills shall originate exclusively
from the Lower House is mandatory.  The
word "exclusively" is an "exclusive word," which is
indicative of an intent that the provision is mandatory.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Hence, all American authorities expounding
on the meaning and application of Sec. 7, par. (1), Art. I, of the U.S.
Constitution cannot be used in the interpretation of Sec. 24, Art. VI, of our
1987 Constitution which has a distinct feature of "exclusiveness" all
its own.  Thus, when our Constitution
absolutely requires - as it is mandatory - that a particular bill should
exclusively emanate from </span>the Lower House, there is no alternative to the
requirement that the bill to become valid law must originate exclusively from
that House.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the interpretation of constitutions, questions frequently
arise as to whether particular sections are mandatory or directory.  The courts usually hesitate to declare that
a constitutional provision is directory merely in view of the tendency of the
legislature to disregard provisions which are not said to be mandatory.  Accordingly, it is the general rule to
regard constitutional provisions as mandatory, and not to leave any discretion
to the will of the legislature to obey or disregard them.  This presumption as to mandatory quality is
usually followed unless it is unmistakably manifest that the provisions are
intended to be merely directory.  So
strong is the inclination in favor of giving obligatory force to the terms of
the organic law that it has even been said that neither by the courts nor by
any other department of the government may any provision of the Constitution be
regarded as merely directory, but that each and everyone of its provisions
should be treated as imperative and mandatory, without reference to the rules and
distinguishing between the directory and the mandatory statutes.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The framers of our 1987 Constitution could not have used the term
"exclusively" if they only meant to replicate and adopt <i><span style="">in </span>toto</i> the U. S. version.  By inserting "exclusively" in Sec.
24, Art. VI, of our Constitution, their message is clear:  they wanted it different, strong,
stringent.  There must be a compelling
reason for the inclusion of the word "exclusively," which cannot be
an act of retrogression but progression, an improvement on its precursor.  Thus, "exclusively" must be given
its true meaning, its purpose observed and virtue recognized, for it could not
have been conceived to be of minor consequence.  That construction is to be sought which gives effect to the whole
of the statute - its every word.  <i><span style="">Ut magis </span>valeat quam pereat</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, any reference to American authorities, decisions
and opinions, however wisely and delicately put, can only mislead in the
interpretation of our own Constitution.  To refer to them in defending the constitutionality of R.A. 7716,
subject of the present petitions, is to argue on a false premise, i.e., that
Sec. 24, <span style="">Art. </span>VI, of our 1987
Constitution is, or means exactly, the same as Sec. 7, par. (1), Art. I, of the
U.S. Constitution, which is not correct.  Hence, only a wrong conclusion can be drawn from a wrong premise.</p>

<p class="BODY">For example, it is argued that in the United States, from where
our own legislature is patterned, the Senate can practically substitute its own
tax measure for that of the Lower House.  Thus, according to the Majority, citing an American case, "the
validity of Sec. 37 which the Senate had inserted in the Tariff Act of 1909 by
imposing an <i>ad valorem</i> tax based on the weight of vessels, was upheld
against the claim that the revenue bill originated in the Senate in
contravention of Art. I, Sec. 7, of the U.S. Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In an effort to be more convincing, the Majority even quotes the footnote in <i>Introduction
to American Government by F.A. Ogg and P.O. Ray</i> which reads -</p>

<blockquote>Thus in 1883 the upper house struck out everything after the
enacting clause of a tariff bill and wrote <span style="">its </span>own measure, which the House eventually felt obliged to
accept.  It likewise added 847
amendments to the Payne-Aldrich tariff act of 1909, dictated the schedules of
the emergency tariff act of 1921, rewrote an extensive tax revision bill in the
same year, and recast most of the permanent tariff bill of 1922<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
-</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">which in fact suggests, very clearly,
that the subject revenue bill actually originated from the Lower House and was
only amended, perhaps considerably, by the Senate <u>after it was passed by the
former and transmitted to the latter</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the cases cited, where the statutes passed by the U.S.
Congress were upheld, the revenue bills did not actually originate from the
Senate but, in fact, from the Lower House.  Thus, the Supreme Court of the United States, speaking through Chief
Justice White in <i>Rainey v. United States</i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
upheld the <span style="">revenue </span>bill passed
by Congress and adopted the ruling of the lower court that -</p>

<blockquote>x x x the section in question is not void as a bill for raising
revenue originating in the Senate and not in the House of Representatives.  It appears that the section was proposed by
the Senate as an amendment to a bill for raising revenue which originated in
the House.  That is sufficient.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><i>Flint v. Stone Tracy Co.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> on
which the Solicitor General heavily leans in his Consolidated Comment as well
as in his Memorandum, does not support the thesis of the Majority since the
subject bill therein actually originated from the Lower House and not from the
Senate, and the amendment merely covered a certain provision in the House bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, in the cases cited which were lifted from American
authorities, it appears that the revenue bills in question actually originated
from the House of Representatives and were amended by the Senate only after
they were transmitted to it.  Perhaps,
if the factual circumstances in those cases were exactly the same as the ones
at bench, then the subject revenue or tariff bill may be upheld in this
jurisdiction on the principle of substantial compliance, as they were in the
United States, except possibly in instances where the House bill undergoes what
is now referred to as "amendment by substitution," for that would be
in derogation of our Constitution which vests solely in the House of
Representatives the power to initiate revenue bills.  A Senate amendment by substitution simply means that the bill in
question did not in effect originate from the lower chamber but from the upper
chamber and now disguises itself as a mere amendment of the House version.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also theorized that in the U.S., amendment by substitution
is recognized.  That may be true.  But the process may be validly effective
only under the U.S. Constitution.  The
cases before us present a totally different factual backdrop.  Several months before the Lower House could
even pass HB No. 11197, P.S. Res. No. 734 and SB No. 1129 had already been
filed in the Senate.  Worse, the Senate
subsequently approved SB No. 1630 "in substitution of SB No. 1129, taking
into consideration P.S. Res. No. 734 and HB No. 11197," and not HB No.
11197 itself "as amended." Here, the Senate could not have proposed
or concurred with amendments because there was nothing to concur with or amend
except its own bill.  It must be
stressed that the process of concurring or amending presupposes that there
exists a bill upon which concurrence may be based or amendments
introduced.  The Senate should have
reported out HB No. 11197, as amended, even if in the amendment it took into
consideration SB No. 1630.  It should
not have submitted to the Bicameral Conference Committee SB No. 1630 which,
admittedly, did not originate <u>exclusively</u> from the Lower House.</p>

<p class="BODY">But even assuming that in our jurisdiction a revenue bill of the
Lower House may be amended by substitution by the Senate - although I am not
prepared to accept it in view of Sec. 24, Art. VI, of our Constitution - still
R.A. 7716 could not have been the result of amendment by substitution since the
Senate had no House bill to speak of that it could amend when the Senate
started deliberating on its own version.</p>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, I cannot rest easy on the proposition that a
constitutional mandate calling for the exclusive power and prerogative of the
House of Representatives may just be discarded and ignored by the Senate.  Since the Constitution is for the observance
of all - the judiciary as well as the other departments of government - and the
judges are sworn to support its provisions, the courts are not at liberty to
overlook or disregard its commands.  And
it is not fair and just to impute to them undue interference if they look into
the validity of legislative enactments to determine whether the fundamental law
has been faithfully observed in the process.  It is their duty to give effect to the existing Constitution and to obey
all constitutional provisions irrespective of their opinion as to the wisdom of
such provisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is fixed that the duty in a proper case to declare a law
unconstitutional cannot be declined and must be performed in accordance with
the deliberate judgment of the tribunal before which the validity of the
enactment is directly drawn into question.  When it is clear that a statute transgresses the authority vested in the
legislature by the Constitution, it is the duty of the courts to declare the
act unconstitutional because they cannot shirk from it without violating their
oaths of office.  This duty of the
courts to maintain the Constitution as the fundamental law of the state is
imperative and unceasing; and, as Chief Justice Marshal said, whenever a
statute is in violation of the fundamental law, the courts must so adjudge and
thereby give effect to the Constitution.  Any other course would lead to the destruction of the Constitution.  Since the question as to the
constitutionality of a statute is a judicial matter, the courts will not
decline the exercise of jurisdiction upon the suggestion that action might be
taken by political agencies in disregard of the judgment of the judicial
tribunals.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is my submission that the power and authority to originate
revenue bills under our Constitution is vested <u>exclusively</u> in the House
of Representatives.  Its members being
more numerous than those of the Senate, elected more frequently, and more
directly represent the people, are therefore considered better aware of the
economic life of their individual constituencies.  It is just proper that revenue bills originate <u>exclusively</u>
from them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, we do not have to devote much time delving into
American decisions and opinions and invoke them in the interpretation of our
own Constitution which is different from the American version, particularly on
the enactment of revenue bills.  We have
our own Constitution couched in a language our own legislators thought
best.  Insofar as revenue bills are
concerned, our Constitution is not American; it is distinctively Filipino.  And no amplitude of legerdemain can detract
from our constitutional requirement that all appropriation, revenue or tariff
bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills of local
application, and private bills shall originate <u>exclusively</u> in the House
of Representatives, although the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this milieu, I am left no option but to vote to grant the
petitions and strike down R.A. 7716 as unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">separate opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i><span style="">J.</span></i><span style="">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is a curious and almost incredible fact that at the hearing of
these cases on July 7, 1994, the lawyers who argued for the petitioners - two
of them former presidents of the Senate and the third also a member of that body
- all asked this Court to look into the internal operations of their Chamber
and correct the irregularities they claimed had been committed there as well as
in the House of Representatives and in the bicameral conference committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">While a member of the legislature would normally resist such
intervention and invoke the doctrine of separation of powers to protect
Congress from what he would call judicial intrusion, these counsel practically
implored the Court to examine the questioned proceedings and to this end go
beyond the journals of each House, scrutinize the minutes of the committee, and
investigate all other matters relating to the passage of the bill (or bills)
that eventually became R.A. No. 7716.</p>

<p class="BODY">In effect, the petitioners would have us disregard the
time-honored inhibitions laid down by the Court upon itself in the landmark
case of U.S. v. Pons (34 Phil. 725), where it refused to consider extraneous
evidence to disprove the recitals in the journals of the Philippine Legislature
that it had adjourned <i><span style="">sine die</span></i><span style=""> </span>at midnight of February 28, 1914.  Although it was generally known then that
the special session had actually exceeded the deadline fixed by the
Governor-General in his proclamation, the Court chose to be guided solely by
the legislative journals, holding significantly as follows:</p>

<blockquote>* * * From their very nature and object, the records of the
legislature are as important as those of the judiciary, and to inquire into the
veracity of the journals of the Philippine Legislature, when they are, as we
have said, clear and explicit, would be to violate both the letter and the
spirit of the organic laws by which the Philippine Government was brought into
existence, to invade a coordinate and independent department of the Government,
and to interfere with the legitimate powers and functions of the
Legislature.  But counsel in his
argument says that the public knows that the Assembly's clock was <span style="">stopped </span>on February 28, 1914, at
midnight and left so until the determination <span style="">of </span>the discussion of all pending matters.  Or, in other words, the hands of the clock
were stayed in order to enable the Assembly to effect an adjournment apparently
within the fixed time by the Governor's proclamation for the expiration of the
special session, in direct violation of the Act of Congress of July 1,
1902.  If the clock was, in fact,
stopped, as here suggested, "the resultant evil might be slight as
compared with that of altering the probative force and character of legislative
records, and making the proof of legislative action depend upon uncertain oral
evidence, liable to loss by death or absence, and so imperfect on account of
the treachery of <span style="">memory."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>* * * The journals say that the Legislature adjourned at 12
Midnight on February 28, 1914.  This
settles the question, and the court did not err in declining to go beyond the
journals.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As one who has always respected the rationale of the separation
of powers, I realize only too well the serious implications of the relaxation
of the doctrine except only for the weightiest of reasons.  The lowering of the barriers now dividing
the three major branches of the government could lead to invidious incursions
by one department into the exclusive domains of the other departments to the
detriment of the proper discharge of the functions assigned to each of them by
the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still, while acknowledging the value of tradition and the reasons
for judicial non-interference announced in Pons, I am not disinclined to take a
second look at the ruling from a more pragmatic viewpoint and to tear down, if
we must, the iron curtain it has hung, perhaps improvidently, around the
proceedings of the legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY">I am persuaded even now that where a specific procedure is fixed
by the Constitution itself, it should not suffice for Congress to simply say
that <span style="">the </span>rules have been observed
and flatly consider the matter closed.  It does not have to be as final as that.  I would imagine that the judicary, and particularly this Court,
should be able to verify that statement and determine for itself, through the
exercise of its own powers, if the Constitution has, indeed, been obeyed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, the Court has already said that the question of whether
certain procedural rules have been followed is justiciable rather than
political because what is involved is the <i>legality</i> and not the <i>wisdom</i>
of the act in question.  So we ruled in
Sanidad v. Commission on Elections (73 SCRA 333) on the amendment of the
Constitution; in Daza v. Singson (180 SCRA 496) on the composition of the
Commission on Appointments; and in the earlier case of Tañada v. Cuenco (100
SCRA 1101) on the organization of the Senate Electoral Tribunal, among several
other cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the same token, the ascertainment of whether a bill underwent
the obligatory three readings in both Houses of Congress should not be
considered an invasion of the territory of the legislature as this would not
involve an inquiry into its <i>discretion</i> in approving the measure but only
the <i>manner</i> in which the measure was enacted.</p>

<p class="BODY">These views may upset the conservatives among us who are most
comfortable when they allow themselves to be petrified by precedents instead of
venturing into uncharted waters.  To be
sure, there is much to be said of the wisdom of the past expressed by vanished
judges talking to the future.  <i>Via
trita est tuttisima</i>.  Except when
there is a need to revise them because of an altered situation or an emergent
idea, precedents should tell us that, indeed, the trodden path is the safest
path.</p>

<p class="BODY">It could be that the altered situation has arrived to welcome the
emergent idea.  The jurisdiction of this
Court has been expanded by the Constitution, to possibly include the review the
petitioners would have us make of the congressional proceedings being
questioned.  Perhaps it is also time to
declare that the activities of Congress can no longer be smoke-screened in the
inviolate recitals of its journals to prevent examination of its sacrosanct
records in the name of the separation of powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">But then again, perhaps all this is not yet necessary at this
time and all these observations are but wishful musings for a more activist
judiciary.  For I find that this is not
even necessary, at least for me, to leave the trodden path in the search for
new adventures in the byways of the law.  The answer we seek, as I see it, is not far afield  It seems to me that it can be found through
a study of the enrolled bill alone and that we do not have to go beyond that
measure to ascertain if R.A. No. 7716 has been validly enacted.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled in this jurisdiction that in case of conflict
between the enrolled bill and the legislative journals, it is the former that
should prevail except only as to matters that the Constitution requires to be
entered in the journals. (Mabanag v. Lopez Vito, 78 Phil. 1).  These are the <i><span style="">yeas</span></i><span style=""> </span>and <i><span style="">nays</span></i><span style=""> </span>on the final reading of a bill or on any question at the request
of at least one-fifth of the members of the House (Constitution, Art. VI, Sec.
16 [4]), the objections of the President to a vetoed bill or item <span style="">(<i>Ibid, </i></span><i>Sec</i> 27 [1]), and
the names of the members voting for or against the overriding of his veto <span style="">(<i>Id. Section</i> </span>27 [1]), The origin
of a bill is not specifically required by the Constitution to be entered in the
journals.  Hence, on this particular
matter, it is the recitals in the enrolled bill and not in the journals that
must control.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article VI, Section 24, of the Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>Sec. 24.  All appropriation,
revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the public debt, bills
of local application, and private bills shall originate exclusively in the
House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">enrolled bill
submitted to and </span>later <span style="">approved </span>by
the President of the Philippines as R. A. No. 7716 was signed by the President
of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  It carried the following certification over
the signatures of the Secretary of the Senate and the Acting <span style="">Secretary of the House of Representatives:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>This Act which is a consolidation of House Bill No. 11197 and
Senate Bill No. 11630 was finally passed by the House of Representative and the
Senate on April 27, 1994, and May 2, 1994.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Let <span style="">us </span>turn to
Webster for the meaning of certain words,</p>

<p class="BODY">To "originate" is "to bring into being; to create
something (original); to invent; begin; start." The word
"exclusively" means "excluding all others" and is derived
from the word "exclusive," meaning "not shared or divided; sole;
single." Applying these meanings, I would read Section 24 as saying that
the bills mentioned therein must be brought into being, or created, or
invented, or begun or started, only or singly or by no other body than the
House of Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the certification, R.A. No. 7716 “is a consolidation
of House Bill No. 11197 and Senate Bill No. 1630." Again giving the words
used their natural and ordinary sense conformably to an accepted canon of
construction, I would read the word "consolidation" as a
"combination or merger" and derived from the word
"consolidate," meaning "to combine into <span style="">one; merge; unite</span><span style="">."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">two </span>bills were
separately introduced in their respective Chambers.  Both retained their independent existence until they reached the
bicameral conference committee where they were consolidated.  It was this consolidated measure that was
finally passed by Congress and submitted to the President of the Philippines
for his approval.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">House </span>Bill No.
11197 originated in the House of Representatives <span style="">but this was </span>not the bill that eventually became R. A. No.
7716.  The measure that was signed into
law by President Ramos was the consolidation of that bill and another bill, <i>viz</i>.,
Senate Bill No. 1630, which was introduced in the Senate.  The resultant enrolled bill thus did not
originate <i><span style="">exclusively</span></i><span style=""> </span>in the House of Representatives.  The enrolled bill itself says that part of
it (and it does <span style="">not </span>matter to
what extent) originated in the Senate.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would have been different if the only participation of the
Senate was in the amendment of the measure that was originally proposed in the
House of Representatives.  But this was not
the case.  The participation of the
Senate was not in proposing or concurring with amendments that would have been
incorporated in House Bill No. 11197.  Its participation was in <i>originating</i> <span style="">its </span>own Senate Bill No. 1630, which was not embodied in but <i><span style="">merged</span></i><span style=""> </span>with House Bill No. 11197.</p>

<p class="BODY">Senate Bill No. 1630 was not even an amendment by substitution,
assuming this was permissible.  To
"substitute" means "to take the place of; to put or use in place
of another." Senate Bill No. 1630 did not, upon its approval, <span style="">replace </span>(and thus eliminate) House Bill
No. 11197 Both bills retained <span style="">their </span>separate
identities until they were joined or united into what became the enrolled bill
and ultimately R.A. No. 7716.</p>

<p class="BODY">The certification in the enrolled bill says it all.  It is clear that R.A. No. 7716 did not
originate exclusively in the House of Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">To go back to my earlier observations, this conclusion does not
require <span style="">the reversal of </span>U.S. <span style="">vs. </span>Pons and an inquiry by this Court
into the proceedings <span style="">of </span>the
legislature beyond the recitals of its journals.  All we need to do is consider the certification in the enrolled
bill and, without entering the precincts of Congress, declare that by its own
admission it has, indeed, not complied with the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">While this Court respects the prerogatives of the other
departments, it will not hesitate to rise to <span style="">its </span>higher duty to require from them, if they go astray, full
and strict compliance with the fundamental law.  Our fidelity to it must be total.  There is no loftier principle in our democracy than the supremacy
of the Constitution, to which all must submit.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to invalidate R.A. No. 7716 for violation of Article VI,
Sec. 24, of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">DAVIDE, JR., <i>J.:</i></p>

<p class="BODY">The legislative history of R.A. No. 7716, as highlighted in the
Consolidated Memorandum for the public respondents submitted by the Office of
the Solicitor General, demonstrates beyond doubt that it was passed in violation
or deliberate disregard of mandatory provisions of the Constitution and of the
rules of both chambers of Congress relating to the enactment of bills.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>I therefore vote to strike down R.A. No. 7716 as
unconstitutional and as having been enacted with grave abuse of discretion.<o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution provides for a bicameral Congress.  Therefore, no bill can be enacted into law
unless it is approved by both chambers -- the Senate and the House of
Representatives (hereinafter <i>House</i>).  Otherwise stated, each chamber may propose and approve a bill, but until
it is submitted to the other chamber and passed by the latter, it cannot be
submitted to the President for its approval into law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 2, Section 26, Article VI of the Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote>"No bill passed by either House shall become a law unless it
has passed three readings on separate days, and printed copies thereof in its
final form have been distributed to its Members three days before its passage,
except when the President certifies to the necessity of its immediate enactment
to meet a public calamity or emergency.  Upon the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed,
and the vote thereon shall be taken immediately thereafter, and the yeas and
nays entered in the Journal."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The "three readings" refer to
the three readings in both chambers.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are, however, bills which must originate exclusively in the
House.  Section 24, Article VI of the
Constitution enumerates them:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 24.  All
appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the
public debt, bills of local application, and private bills shall originate
exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or
concur with amendments."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Webster's Third New International Dictionary<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
defines <u>originate</u> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<i>vt </i>1:  to cause
the beginning of:  give rise to:  INITIATE ... 2.  to start (a person or thing) on a course or journey … <i>vi</i>:  to take or have origin:  be derived:  ARISE, BEGIN, START ..."</blockquote>

defines the word <u>exclusively</u> in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"Apart from all others; only; solely; substantially all or for
the greater part.  To the exclusion of
all others; without admission of others to participation; in a manner to
exclude."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <i>City Mayor vs. The Chief of Philippine Constabulary</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The term 'exclusive' in its usual and generally accepted
sense, means possessed to the exclusion of others; appertaining to the subject
alone, not including, admitting or pertaining to another or others, undivided,
sole.  (15 Words and Phrases, p. 510,
citing Mitchel v. Tulsa Water, Light, Heat and Power Co., 95 P. 961, 21 Okl.
243; and p, 513, citing Commonwealth v. Superintendent of House of Correction,
64 Pa. Super. 613, 615)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indisputably then, only the House can cause the beginning or
initiate the passage of any appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill, any bill
increasing the public debt, any bill of local application, or any private
bill.  The Senate can only "propose
or concur with amendments."</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the Rules of the Senate, the first reading is the reading
of the title of the bill and its referral to the corresponding committee; the
second reading consists of the reading of the bill in the form recommended by
the corresponding committee; and the third reading is the reading of the bill
in the form it will be after approval on second reading.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">After approval on second reading, printed
copies thereof in its final form shall be distributed to the Members of the
Senate at least three days prior to the third reading, except in cases of
certified bills.  At the third reading,
the final vote shall be taken and the <i>yeas</i> and <i>nays</i> shall be

<p class="BODY">Under the Rules of the House, the first reading of a bill

<p class="BODY">Clearly, whether in the Senate or in the House, every bill must
pass the three readings on separate days, except when the bill is

<p class="BODY">After its passage by one chamber, the bill should then be
transmitted to the other chamber for its concurrence.  Section 83, Rule XIV of the Rules of the House expressly
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 83.  <i>Transmittal
to Senate</i>. -- The Secretary General, without need of express order, shall
transmit to the Senate for its concurrence all the bills and joint or
concurrent resolutions approved by the House or the amendments of the House to
the bills or resolutions of the Senate, as the case may be.  If the measures approved without amendments
are bills or resolutions of the Senate, or if amendments of the Senate to bills
of the House are accepted, he shall forthwith notify the Senate of the action
taken."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Simplified, this rule means that:</p>

<blockquote>1.  As to a bill originating
in the House:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The transmitted bill shall then pass three readings in the other
chamber on separate days.  Section 84,
Rule XIV of the Rules of the House states:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 84.  <i>Bills
from the Senate. </i>-- The bills, resolutions and communications of the Senate
shall be referred to the corresponding committee in the same manner as bills
presented by Members of the House."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and Section 51, Rule XXIII of the Rules
of the Senate provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 51.  Prior to
their final approval, bills and joint resolutions shall be read at least three
times."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is only when the period of disagreement is reached, <i>i.e</i>.,
amendments proposed by one chamber to a bill originating from the specifically
covered by Section 26, Rule XII of the Rules of the Senate which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 26.  In the event
that the Senate does not agree with the House of Representatives on the
provision of any bill or joint resolution, the differences shall be settled by
a conference committee of both Houses which shall meet within ten days after
its composition."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and Section 85, Rule XIV of the Rules of
the House which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 85.  <i>Conference
Committee Reports</i>. -- In the event that the House does not agree with the
Senate on the amendments to any bill or joint resolution, the differences may
be settled by conference committees of both Chambers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing provisions of the Constitution and the Rules of
both chambers of Congress are Mandatory.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Treatise On The Constitutional Limitations,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
more particularly on enactment of bills, Cooley states:</p>

<blockquote>"Where, for an instance, the legislative power is to be
exercised by two houses, and by settled and well-understood parliamentary law
these two houses are to hold separate sessions for their deliberations, and the
determination of the one upon a proposed law is to be submitted to the separate
determination of the other, the constitution, in providing for two houses, has
evidently spoken in reference to this settled custom, incorporating it as a
rule of constitutional interpretation; so that it would require no prohibitory
clause to forbid the two houses from combining in one, and jointly enacting
laws by the vote of a majority of all.  All those rules which are of the essentials of law-making must be
observed and followed; and it is only the customary rules of order and routine,
such as in every deliberative body are always understood to be under its
control, and subject to constant change at its will, that the constitution can
be understood to have left as matters of discretion, to be established,
modified, or abolished by the bodies for whose government in non-essential
matters they exist."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">  In respect of appropriation,
revenue, or tariff bills, bills increasing the public debt, bills of local
application, or private bills, the return thereof to the House after the Senate
shall have "proposed or concurred with amendments" for the former
either to accept or reject the amendments would not only be in conformity with
the foregoing rules but is also implicit from Section 24 of Article VI.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing as our guiding light, I shall now show the
violations of the Constitution and of the Rules of the Senate and of the House
in the passage of R.A. No. 7716.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 24, ARTICLE VI<br>
OF THE CONSTITUTION:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u> <u>violation</u>. -- Since R.A. No. 7716 is a

asserted by petitioner Tolentino, on the face of the enrolled copy of R.A. No.
7716, it is a "CONSOLIDATION OF HOUSE BILL NO. 11197 AND SENATE BILL NO.
1630." In short, it is an illicit marriage of a bill which originated in
the House and a bill which originated in the Senate.  Therefore, R.A. No. 7716 <u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>originate</u> <u>exclusively</u>
in the House.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only bill which could serve as a valid basis for R.A. No.
7716 is House Bill (HB) No. 11197.  This
bill, which is the substitute bill recommended by the House Committee on Ways and
Means in substitution of House Bills Nos. 253, 771, 2450, 7033, 8086, 9030,
9210, 9397, 10012, and 10100, and covered by its Committee Report No. 367,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

Interestingly, HB No. 9210,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
which was filed by Representative Exequiel B. Javier on 19 May 1993, was <u>certified</u>
by the President in his letter to Speaker Jose de Venecia, Jr. of 1 June 1993.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Yet, HB No. 11197, which substituted HB No. 9210 and the others above-stated,
was not.  Its certification seemed to
have been entirely forgotten.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 18 November 1993, the Secretary-General of the House, pursuant
to Section 83, Rule XIV of the Rules of the House, transmitted to the President
of the Senate HB No. 11197 and requested the concurrence of the Senate
therewith.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, HB No. 11197 had passed only its first reading in the
Senate by its referral to its Committee on Ways and Means.  That Committee never deliberated on HB No.
11197 as it should have.  It acted only
on Senate Bill (SB) No. 1129<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
introduced by Senator Ernesto F. Herrera on 1 March 1993.  It then prepared and proposed SB No. 1630,
and in its Committee Report No. 349<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
which was submitted to the Senate on 7 February 1994,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
it recommended that SB No. 1630 be approved "<b><u>in</u> <u>substitution</u>
<u>of</u> <u>S.B.</u> <u>No.</u> <u>1129,</u> <u>taking</u> <u>into</u> <u>consideration</u>
<u>P.S.</u> <u>Res.</u> <u>No.</u> <u>734</u> <u>and</u> <u>H.B.</u> <u>No.</u>

It must be carefully noted that SB No. 1630 was proposed and submitted for
approval by the Senate <u>in</u> <u>SUBSTITUTION</u> <u>of</u> <u>SB</u> <u>No.</u>
<u>1129</u>, <u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u>HB</u> <u>No.</u> <u>11197</u>.  Obviously, the principal measure which the
Committee deliberated on and acted upon <u>was</u> <u>SB</u> <u>No.</u> <u>1129</u>
<u>and</u> <u>not</u> <u>HB</u> <u>No.</u> <u>11197</u>.  The latter, instead of being the only
measure to be taken up, deliberated upon, and reported back to the Senate for
its consideration on second reading and, eventually, on third reading, was, at
the most, merely given by the Committee a passing glance.</p>

<p class="BODY">This specific unequivocal action of the Senate Committee on Ways
and Means, <i>i.e</i>., proposing and recommending approval of SB No. 1630 as a
substitute for or in substitution of SB No. 1129 demolishes at once the thesis
of the Solicitor General that:</p>

<blockquote>"Assuming that SB 1630 is distinct from HB 11197, amendment by
substitution is within the purview of Section 24, Article VI of the
Constitution."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">because, according to him, (a)
"Section 68, Rule XXIX of the Rules of the Senate authorizes an amendment
by substitution and the only condition required is that ‘the text thereof is
submitted in writing’; and (b) `[I]n <i>Flint vs. Stone Tracy Co</i>. (220 U.S.
107) the United States Supreme Court, interpreting the provision in the United
States Constitution similar to Section 24, Article VI of the Philippine
Constitution, stated that the power of the Senate to amend a revenue bill
includes substitution of an entirely new measure for the one originally
proposed by the House of Representatives.’"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This thesis is utterly without merit.  In the first place, it reads into the Committee Report something
which it had not contemplated, that is, to propose SB No. 1630 in substitution
of HB No. 11197; or speculates that the Committee may have committed an error
in stating that it is SB No. 1129, and not HB No. 11197, which is to be
substituted by SB No. 1630.  Either, of
course, is unwarranted because the words of the Report, solemnly signed by the
Chairman, Vice-Chairman (who dissented), seven members, and three <i>ex</i>-<i>officio</i>
members,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
leave no room for doubt that although SB No. 1129, P.S. Res No. 734, and HB No.
11197 were referred to and considered by the Committee, it had prepared the
attached SB No. 1630 which it recommends for approval "<u>in</u> <u>substitution</u>
<u>of</u> <u>S.B.</u> <u>No.</u> <u>11197</u>, <u>taking</u> <u>into</u> <u>consideration</u>
<u>P.S.</u> <u>No.</u> <u>734</u> <u>and</u> <u>H.B.</u>  <u>No.</u> <u>11197</u> <u>with</u> <u>Senators</u>
<u>Herrera,</u> <u>Angara,</u> <u>Romulo,</u> <u>Sotto</u>, <u>Ople</u> a<u>n</u>d

the judgment of the Committee with another that is completely inconsistent with
it, or, simply, to capriciously ignore the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, the Office of the Solicitor General

was there a general bill for the collection of revenue.  As originally introduced, it contained a
plan of inheritance taxation.  In the
Senate the proposed tax was removed from the bill, and the corporation tax, in
a measure, substituted therefor.  The
bill having properly originated in the House, we perceive no reason in the
constitutional provision relied upon why it may not be amended in the Senate in
the manner which it was in this case.  The amendment was germane to the subject-matter of the bill, and not
beyond the power of the Senate to propose." (Emphasis supplied) </p>

<p class="BODY">As shown above, the underlined portions were deliberately omitted
in the quotation made by the Office of the Solicitor General.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, a Senate amendment by substitution with an
entirely new bill of a bill, which under Section 24, Article VI of the
Constitution can only originate exclusively in the House, is not authorized by
said Section 24.  <i>Flint vs. Stone
Tracy Co</i>. cannot be invoked in favor of such a view.  As pointed out by Mr. Justice Florenz D.
Regalado during the oral arguments of these cases and during the initial
deliberations thereon by the Court, <i>Flint</i> involves a Senate amendment to
a revenue bill which, under the United States Constitution, should originate
from the House of Representatives.  The
amendment consisted of the substitution of a corporation tax in lieu of the
plan of inheritance taxation contained in a general bill for the collection of
revenue as it came from the House of Representatives where the bill originated.  The constitutional provision in question is
Section 7, Article I of the United States Constitution which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 7.  <i>Bills
and Resolutions</i>. -- All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the
House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments,
as on other Bills."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This provision, contrary to the
misleading claim of the Solicitor General, is not similar to Section 24,
Article VI of our Constitution, which for easy comparison is hereunder quoted
again:</p>

<blockquote>"All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing
increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills
shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may
propose or concur with amendments."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Note that in the former the word <u>exclusively</u>
does not appear.  And, in the latter,
the phrase "as on other Bills," which is found in the former, does
not appear.  These are very significant
in determining the authority of the upper chamber over the bills enumerated in
Section 24.  Since the origination is
not exclusively vested in the House of Representatives of the United States,
the Senate's authority to propose or concur with amendments is necessarily
broader.  That broader authority is
further confirmed by the phrase "as on other Bills," i.e., its power
to propose or concur with amendments thereon is the same as in ordinary
bills.  The absence of this phrase in
our Constitution was clearly intended to restrict or limit the Philippine
Senate's power to propose or concur with amendments.  In the light of the <u>exclusivity</u> of origination and the
absence of the phrase "as on other Bills," the Philippine Senate
cannot amend by substitution with an entirely new bill of its own any bill
covered by Section 24 of Article VI which the House of Representatives transmitted
to it because such substitution would indirectly violate Section 24.</p>

<p class="BODY">These obvious substantive differences between Section 7, Article
I of the U.S. Constitution and Section 24, Article VI of our Constitution are
enough reasons why this Court should neither allow itself to be misled by <i>Flint
vs. Stone</i> nor be awed by <i>Rainey vs. United States</i><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
and the opinion of Messrs. Ogg and Ray<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
which the majority cites to support the view that the power of the U.S. Senate
to amend a revenue measure is unlimited.  Rainey concerns the Tariff Act of 1909 of the United States of America
and specifically involved was its Section 37 which was an amendment introduced
by the U.S. Senate.  It was claimed by
the petitioners that the said section is a revenue measure which should
originate in the House of Representatives.  The U.S. Supreme Court, however, adopted and approved the finding of the
court <i>a quo </i>that:</p>

<blockquote>"the section in question is not void
as a bill for raising revenue originating in the Senate, and not in the House
of Representatives.  It appears that the
section was proposed by the Senate as an amendment to a bill for raising
revenue which originated in the House.  That is sufficient."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Messrs. Ogg and Ray, who are professors <i>emeritus</i>
of political science, based their statement not even on a case decided by the
U.S. Supreme Court but on their perception of what Section 7, Article I of the
U.S. Constitution permits.  In the <u>tenth</u>
edition (1951) of their work, they state:</p>

<blockquote>"Any bill may make its first
appearance in either house, except only that bills for raising revenue are
required by the constitution to 'originate' in the House of
Representatives.  Indeed, through its
right to amend revenue bills, even to the extent of substituting new 29 ones,
the Senate may, in effect, originate them also.”<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Their "in effect" conclusion
is, of course, logically correct because the word <u>exclusively</u> does not
appear in said Section 7, Article I of the U.S. Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can I find myself in agreement with the view of the majority
that the Constitution does not prohibit the filing in the Senate of a
substitute bill in anticipation of its receipt of the bill from the House so
long as action by the Senate as a body is withheld pending receipt of the House
bill, thereby stating, in effect, that S.B. No. 1129 was such an anticipatory
substitute bill, which, nevertheless, does not seem to have been considered by
the Senate except only after its receipt of H.B. No. 11179 on 23 November 1993
when the process of legislation in respect of it began with a referral to the
Senate Committee on Ways and Means.  Firstly, to say that the Constitution does not prohibit it is to render
meaningless Section 24 of Article VI or to sanction its blatant disregard
through the simple expedient of filing in the Senate of a so-called
anticipatory substitute bill.  Secondly,
it suggests that S.B. No. 1129 was filed as an anticipatory measure to
substitute for H.B. No. 11179.  This is
a speculation which even the author of S.B. No. 1129 may not have indulged in.
S.B. No. 1129 was filed in the Senate by Senator Herrera on 1 March 1993. H.B.
No. 11197 was approved by the House on third reading only on 17 November
1993.  Frankly, I cannot believe that
Senator Herrera was able to prophesy that the House would pass any VAT bill,
much less to know its provisions.  That
"it does not seem that the Senate even considered" the latter not
until after its receipt of H.B. No. 11179 is another speculation.  As stated earlier, S.B. No. 1129 was filed
in the Senate on 1 March 1993, while H.B. No. 11197 was transmitted to the
Senate only on 18 November 1993.  There
is no evidence on record to show that both were referred to the Senate
Committee on Ways and Means at the same time.  Finally, in respect of H.B. No. 11197, its legislative process did not
begin with its referral to the Senate's Ways and Means Committee.  It began upon its filing, as a Committee
Bill of the House Committee on Ways and Means, in the House.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u> <u>violation</u>. -- Since SB No. 1129 is a revenue
measure, it could not even be validly introduced or initiated in the
Senate.  It follows too, that the Senate
cannot validly act thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Third</u> <u>violation</u>. -- Since SB No. 1129 could not
have been validly introduced in the Senate and could not have been validly
acted on by the Senate, then it cannot be substituted by another revenue
measure, SB No. 1630, which the Senate Committee on Ways and Means introduced
in substitution of SB No. 1129.  The
filing or introduction in the Senate of SB No. 1630 also violated Section 24,
Article VI of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">VIOLATIONS OF SECTION 26(2), ARTICLE VI OF THE
CONSTITUTION:</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>First</u> <u>violation</u>. -- The Senate, despite its lack of
constitutional authority to consider SB No. 1630 or SB No. 1129 which the
former substituted, opened deliberations on second reading of SB No. 1630 on 8
February 1994.  On 24 March 1994, the
Senate approved it on <u>second</u> <u>reading</u> and on <u>third</u> <u>reading</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
That approval on the same day violated Section 26(2), Article VI of the
Constitution.  The justification
therefor was that on 24 February 1994 the President certified to "the
necessity of the enactment of SB No. 1630 ... to meet a public emergency."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I submit, however, that the Presidential certification is void <i>ab
initio</i> not necessarily for the reason adduced by petitioner Kilosbayan,
Inc., but because it was addressed to the Senate for a bill which is prohibited
from originating therein.  The only bill
which could be properly certified on permissible constitutional grounds even if
it had already been transmitted to the Senate is HB No. 11197.  As earlier observed, this was not so
certified, although HB No. 9210 (one of those consolidated into HB No. 11197)
was certified on 1 June 1993.<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also, the certification of SB No. 1630 cannot, by any stretch of
the imagination, be extended to HB No. 11197 because SB No. 1630 did not
substitute HB No. 11197 but SB No. 1129.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the certification of SB No. 1630 is void, its
approval on second and third readings in one day violated Section 26(2),
Article VI of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Second</u> <u>violation</u>. -- It further appears that on 24
June 1994, after the approval of SB No. 1630, the Secretary of the Senate, upon
directive of the Senate President, formally notified the House Speaker of the
Senate's approval thereof and its request for a bicameral conference "in
view of the disagreeing provisions of said bill and House Bill No. 11197."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It must be stressed again that HB No. 11197 was never submitted
for or acted on second and third readings in the Senate, and SB No. 1630 was never
sent to the House for its concurrence.  Elsewise stated, both were only half-way through the legislative
mill.  Their submission to a conference
committee was not only anomalously premature, but violative of the
constitutional rule on three readings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The suggestion that SB No. 1630 was not required to be submitted
to the House for otherwise the procedure would be endless, is unacceptable for,
firstly; it violates Section 26, Rule XII of the Rules of the Senate and
Section 85, Rule XIV of the Rules of the House, and, secondly, it is never
endless.  If the chamber of origin
refuses to accept the amendments of the other chamber, the request for
conference shall be made.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">VIOLATIONS OF THE RULES OF BOTH CHAMBERS;<br>
GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION.</p>

<p class="BODY">The erroneous referral to the conference committee needs further
discussion.  Since S.B. No. 1630 was not
a substitute bill for H.B. No. 11197 but for S.B. No. 1129, it (S.B. No. 1630)
remained a bill which originated in the Senate.  Even assuming <i>arguendo</i> that it could be validly initiated
in the Senate, it should have been first transmitted to the House where it
would undergo three readings.  On the
other hand, since HB No. 11197 was never acted upon by the Senate on second and
third readings, no differences or inconsistencies could as yet arise so as to
warrant a request for a conference.  It
should be noted that under Section 83, Rule XIV of the Rules of the House, it
is only when the Senate shall have approved with amendments HB No. 11197 and
the House declines to accept the amendments after having been notified thereof
that the request for a conference may be made by the House, not by the
Senate.  Conversely, the Senate's
request for a conference would only be proper if, following the transmittal of
SB No. 1630 to the House, it was approved by the latter with amendments but the
Senate rejected the amendments.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indisputably then, when the request for a bicameral conference
was made by the Senate, SB No. 1630 was not yet transmitted to the House for
consideration on three readings and HB No. 11197 was still in the Senate
awaiting consideration on second and third readings.  Their referral to the bicameral conference committee was palpably
premature and, in so doing, both the Senate and the House acted without
authority or with grave abuse of discretion.  Nothing, and absolutely nothing, could have been validly acted upon by
the bicameral conference committee.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">GRAVE ABUSE OF DISCRETION COMMITTED BY<br>
THE BICAMERAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE.</p>

<p class="BODY">Serious irregularities amounting to lack of jurisdiction or grave
abuse of discretion were committed by the bicameral conference committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, it assumed, and took for granted that SB No. 1630 could
validly originate in the Senate.  This
assumption is erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, it assumed that HB No. 11197 and SB No. 1630 had properly
passed both chambers of Congress and were properly and regularly submitted to
it.  As earlier discussed, the
assumption is unfounded in fact.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third, per the bicameral conference committee's proceedings of 19
April 1994, Representative Exequiel Javier, Chairman of the panel from the
House, initially suggested that HB No. 11197 should be the "frame of
reference," because it is a revenue measure, to which Senator Ernesto
Maceda concurred.  However, after an
incompletely recorded reaction of Senator Ernesto Herrera, Chairman of the
Senate panel, Representative Javier seemed to agree that "all amendments
will be coming from the Senate." The issue of what should be the
"frame of reference" does not appear to have been resolved.  These facts are recorded in this wise, as
quoted in the Consolidated Memorandum for Respondents:<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"CHAIRMAN JAVIER.</blockquote>

<blockquote>First of all, what would
be the basis, no, or framework para huwag naman mawala yung personality namin dito
sa bicameral, no, because the bill originates from the House because this is a
revenue bill, so we would just want to ask, <u>we</u> <u>make</u> <u>the</u> <u>House</u>
<u>Bill</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>frame</u> <u>of</u> <u>reference</u>, and
then everything will just be inserted?</blockquote>

<blockquote>HON. MACEDA.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yes.  That's true for every revenue measure.  There's no other way.  <u>The</u> <u>House</u> <u>Bill</u> <u>has</u>
<u>got</u> <u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>the</u> <u>base</u>.  Of course, for the record, we know that this
is an administration; this is certified by the President and I was about to put
into the records as I am saying now that your problem about the impact on
prices on the people was already decided when the President and the
administration sent this to us and certified it.  They have already gotten over that political implication of this
bill and the economic impact on prices.</blockquote>

<blockquote>CHAIRMAN HERRERA.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Yung</u> <u>concern</u>
<u>mo</u> <u>about</u> <u>the</u> <u>bill</u> <u>as</u> <u>the</u> <u>reference</u>
<u>in</u> <u>this</u> <u>discussion</u> is something that we can just ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>CHAIRMAN JAVIER.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We will just ... <u>all</u>

<u>Senate</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(BICAMERAL CONFERENCE ON
MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HB NO. 11197 AND SB NO. 1630 [Cte. on Ways &amp;
Means] APRIL 19, 1994, II-6 and II-7; underscoring supplied)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These exchanges would suggest that Representative Javier had
wanted HB No. 11197 to be the principal measure on which reconciliation of the
differences should be based.  However,
since the Senate did not act on this Bill on second and third readings because
its Committee on Ways and Means did not deliberate on it but instead proposed
SB No. 1630 in substitution of SB No. 1129, the suggestion has no factual
basis.  Then, when finally he agreed
that "all amendments will be coming from the Senate," he in fact
withdrew the former suggestion and agreed that SB No. 1630, which is the Senate
version of the Value Added Tax (VAT) measure, should be the "frame of reference."
But then SB No. 1630 was never transmitted to the House for the latter's
concurrence.  Hence, it cannot serve as
the "frame of reference" or as the basis for deliberation.  The posture taken by Representative Javier
also indicates that SB No. 1630 should be taken as the amendment to HB No.
11197.  This, too, is unfounded because
SB No. 1630 was not proposed in substitution of HB No. 11197.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since SB No. 1630 did not pass three readings in the House and HB
No. 11197 did not pass second and third readings in the Senate, it logically
follows that no disagreeing provisions had as yet arisen.  The bicameral conference committee
erroneously assumed the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even granting <i>arguendo</i> that both HB No. 11197 and SB No.
1630 had been validly approved by both chambers of Congress and validly
referred to the bicameral conference committee, the latter had very limited
authority thereon.  It was created
"in view of the disagreeing provisions of" the two bills.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Its duty was limited to the reconciliation of disagreeing provisions or the
resolution of differences or inconsistencies.  The committee recognized that limited authority in the opening paragraph
of its Report<sup><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: red;">36</span></sup> when it said:</p>

<blockquote>"The Conference Committee on the disagreeing provisions of
House Bill No. 11197 x x x and Senate Bill No. 1630 x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Under such limited authority, it could
only either (a) restore, wholly or partly, the specific provisions of HB No.
11197 amended by SB No. 1630, (b) sustain, wholly or partly, the Senate's
amendments, or (c) by way of a compromise, to agree that neither provisions in
HB No. 11197 amended by the Senate nor the latter's amendments thereto be
carried into the final form of the former.</p>

<p class="BODY">But as pointed out by petitioners Senator Raul Roco and
Kilosbayan, Inc., the bicameral conference committee not only struck out
non-disagreeing provisions of HB No. 11197 and SB No. 1630, <i>i.e</i>.,
provisions where both bills are in full agreement; it added more activities or
transactions to be covered by VAT, which were not within the contemplation of
both bills.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since both HB No. 11197 and SB No. 1630 were still half-cooked in
the legislative vat, and were not ready for referral to a conference, the
bicameral conference committee clearly acted without jurisdiction or with grave
abuse of discretion when it consolidated both into one bill which became R.A.
No. 7716.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 5pt 0in;">APPROVAL BY BOTH CHAMBERS OF CONFERENCE<br>
COMMITTEE REPORT AND PROPOSED BILL DID<br>
NOT CURE CONSTITUTIONAL INFIRMITIES.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot agree with the suggestion that since both the Senate and
the House had approved the bicameral conference committee report and the bill
proposed by it in substitution of HB No. 11197 and SB No. 1630, whatever
infirmities may have been committed by it were cured by ratification.  This doctrine of ratification may apply to
minor procedural flaws or tolerable breachs of the parameters of the bicameral
conference committee's limited powers but never to violations of the
Constitution.  Congress is not above the
Constitution.  In the instant case,
since SB No. 1630 was introduced in violation of Section 24, Article VI of the
Constitution, was passed in the Senate in violation of the "three
readings" rule, and was not transmitted to the House for the completion of
the constitutional process of legislation, and HB No. 11197 was not likewise
passed by the Senate on second and third readings, neither the Senate nor the
House could validly approve the bicameral conference committee report and the
proposed bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the conclusion is inevitable that for
non-compliance with mandatory provisions of the Constitution and of the Rules
of the Senate and of the House on the enactment of laws, R.A. No. 7716 is
unconstitutional and, therefore, null and void.  A discussion then of the intrinsic validity of some of its
provisions would be unnecessary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion, however, invokes the enrolled bill doctrine
and wants this Court to desist from looking behind the copy of the assailed
measure as certified by the Senate President and the Speaker of the House.  I respectfully submit that the invocation is
misplaced.  First, as to the issue of
origination, the certification in this case explicitly states that R.A. No.
7716 is a "<u>consolidation</u> of House Bill No. 11197 and Senate Bill
No. 1630." This is conclusive evidence that the measure did not originate
exclusively in the House.  Second, the
enrolled bill doctrine is of American origin, and unquestioned fealty to it may
no longer be justified in view of the expanded jurisdiction<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">37</span></span></a> of
this Court under Section 1, Article VIII of out Constitution which now
expressly grants authority to this Court to:</p>

<blockquote>"determine whether or not there has
been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on
the part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Third, even under the regime of the 1935
Constitution which did not contain the above provision, this Court, through Mr.
Chief Justice Makalintal, in <i>Astorga vs. Villegas</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">38</span></span></a>
declared that it cannot be truly said that <i>Mabanag vs. Lopez Vito</i><a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i><span style="font-size: 8pt;">39</span></i></span></a>
has laid to rest the question of whether the enrolled bill doctrine or the
journal entry rule should be adhered to in this jurisdiction, and stated:</p>

<blockquote>"As far as Congress itself is concerned, there is nothing
sacrosanct in the certification made by the presiding officers.  It is merely a mode of authentication.  The lawmaking process in Congress ends when
the bill is approved by both Houses, and the certification does not add to the
validity of the bill or cure any defect already present upon its passage.  In other words, it is the approval of
Congress and not the signatures of the presiding officers that is
essential.  Thus the (1935) Constitution
says that ‘[e]very bill passed by the Congress shall, before it becomes law, be
presented to the President.’ In <i>Brown vs. Morris, supra</i>, the Supreme
Court of Missouri, interpreting a similar provision in the State Constitution,
said that the same 'makes it clear that the indispensable step in the passage'
and it follows that if a bill, otherwise fully enacted as a law, is not
attested by the presiding officer, other proof that it has 'passed both houses
will satisfy the constitutional requirement.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Fourth, even in the United States, the
enrolled bill doctrine has been substantially undercut.  This is shown in the disquisitions of Mr.
Justice Reynato S. Puno in his dissenting opinion, citing <u>Sutherland,</u> <u>Statutory</u>
<u>Construction</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Last, the pleadings of the parties have established beyond doubt
that HB No. 11197 was not acted on second and third readings in the Senate and
SB No. 1630, which was approved by the Senate on second and third readings in
substitution of SB No. 1129, was <u>never</u> transmitted to the House for its
passage.  Otherwise stated, they were
only passed in their respective chamber of origin but not in the other.  In no way can each become a law under
paragraph 2, Section 26, Article VI of the Constitution.  For the Court to close its eyes to this fact
because of the enrolled bill doctrine is to shirk its duty to hold
"inviolate what is decreed by the Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">40</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I vote then to GRANT these petitions and to declare R.A. No. 7716
as unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">NARVASA, <i>C.J.</i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">I fully concur with the conclusions set forth in the scholarly
opinion of my learned colleague, Mr Justice Vicente V. Mendoza.  I write this separate opinion to express my
own views relative to the procedural issues raised by the various petitions and
dealt with by some other Members of the Court in their separate opinions.</p>

<p class="BODY">By their very nature, it would seem, discussions of
constitutional issues prove fertile ground for a not uncommon phenomenon:  debate marked by passionate partisanship
amounting sometimes to impatience with adverse views, an eagerness on the part
of the proponents on each side to assume the role of, or be perceived as, staunch
defenders of constitutional principles, manifesting itself in flights of
rhetoric, even hyperbole.  The peril in
this, obviously, is a diminution of objectivity -- that quality which, on the
part of those charged with the duty and authority of interpreting the
fundamental law, is of the essence of their great function.  For the Court, more perhaps than for any
other person or group, it is necessary to maintain that desirable
objectivity.  It must make certain that
on this as on any other occasion, the judicial function is meticulously performed,
the facts ascertained as comprehensively and <span style="">as </span>accurately as possible, all the issues particularly
identified, all the arguments clearly understood; else, it may itself be
accused, by its own members or by others, of a lack of adherence to, or a careless
observance of, its own procedures, the signatures of its individual members on <span style="">its </span>enrolled verdicts notwithstanding.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the matter now before the Court, and whatever reservations
some people may entertain about their intellectual limitations or moral
scruples, I cannot bring myself to accept the thesis which necessarily implies
that the members of our august Congress, in enacting the expanded VAT law,
exposed their ignorance, or indifference to the observance, of the rules of
procedure set down by the Constitution or by their respective chambers, or what
is worse, deliberately ignored those rules for some yet undiscovered purpose
nefarious in nature, or at least some purpose other than the public weal; or
that a few of their fellows, acting as a bicameral conference committee, by
devious schemes and cunning maneuvers, and in conspiracy with officials of the
Executive Department and others, succeeded in "pulling the wool over the
eyes" of all their other colleagues and foisting on them a bill containing
provisions that neither chamber of our bicameral legislature conceived or
contemplated.  This is the thesis that
the petitioners would have this Court approve.  It is a thesis I consider bereft of any factual or logical foundation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Other than the bare declarations of some of the petitioners, or
arguments from the use and import of the language employed in the relevant
documents and records, there is no evidence before the Court adequate to
support a finding that the legislators concerned, whether of the upper or lower
chamber, acted otherwise than in good faith, in the honest discharge of their
functions, in the sincere belief that the established procedures were being
regularly observed or, at least, that there occurred no serious or fatal
deviation therefrom.  There is no
evidence on which reasonably to rest a conclusion that any executive or other
official took part in or unduly influenced the proceedings before the bicameral
conference committee, or that the members of the latter were motivated by a desire
to surreptitiously introduce improper revisions in the bills which they were
required to reconcile, or that after agreement had been reached on the mode and
manner of reconciliation of the "disagreeing provisions," had
resorted to stratragems or employed under-handed ploys to ensure their approval
and adoption by either House.  Neither
is there any proof that in voting on the Bicameral Conference Committee (BCC)
version of the reconciled bills, the members of the Senate and the House did so
in ignorance of, or without understanding, the contents thereof or the bills
therein reconciled.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also unacceptable is the theory that since the Constitution
requires appropriation and revenue bills to originate exclusively in the House
of Representatives, it is improper if not unconstitutional for the Senate to
formulate or even think about formulating, its own draft of this type of
measure in anticipation of receipt of one transmitted by the lower
Chamber.  This is specially cogent as
regards much-publicized suggestions for legislation (like the expanded VAT Law)
emanating from one or more legislators, or from the Executive Department, or
the private sector, etc. which understandably could be expected to forthwith
generate much Congressional cogitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Exclusive origination, I submit, should have no reference to time
of conception.  As a practical matter,
origination should refer to the affirmative act which effectively puts the
bicameral legislative procedure in motion, <i>i.e., </i>the transmission by one
chamber to the other of a bill for its adoption.  This is the purposeful act which sets the legislative machinery
in operation to effectively lead to the enactment of a statute.  Until this transmission takes place, the
formulation and discussions, or the reading for three or more times of proposed
measures in either chamber, would be meaningless in the context of the activity
leading towards concrete legislation.  Unless transmitted to the other chamber, a bill prepared by either house
cannot possibly become law.  In other words,
the first affirmative, efficacious step, the operative act as it were, leading
to actual enactment of a statute, is the transmission of a bill from one house
to the other for action by the latter.  This is the origination that is spoken of in the Constitution in its
Article VI, Section 24, in reference to appropriation, revenue, or tariff
bills, etc.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be that in the Senate, revenue or tax measures are
discussed, even drafted, and this before a similar activity takes place in the
House.  This is of no moment, so long as
those measures or bills remain in the Senate and are not sent over to the
House.  There is no <i>origination </i>of
revenue or tax measures by the Senate in this case.  However, once the House completes the drawing up of a similar tax
measure in accordance with the prescribed procedure, even if this is done
subsequent to the Senate's own measure -­- indeed, even if this be inspired by
information that a measure of the same nature or on the same subject has been
formulated in the Senate -- and after third reading transmits its bill to the
Senate, there is origination by (or in) the House within the contemplation of
the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">So it is entirely possible, as
intimated, that in expectation of the receipt of a revenue or tax bill from the
House of Representatives, the Senate commences deliberations on its own concept
of such a legislative measure.  This,
possibly to save time, so that when the House bill reaches it, its thoughts and
views on the matter are already formed and even reduced to writing in the form
of a draft statute.  This should not be
thought illegal, as interdicted by the Constitution.  What the Constitution prohibits is for the Senate to begin the
legislative process <i><span style="">first, </span></i>by
sending its own revenue bill to the House of Representatives for its
consideration and action.  This is the
initiation that is prohibited to the Senate.</p>

<p class="BODY">But petitioners claim that this last was what in fact happened,
that the bill that went through the legislative mill and was finally approved
as R.A. No. 7716, was the Senate version, SB 1630.  This is disputed by the respondents.  They claim it was House Bill 11197 that, after being transmitted
to the Senate, was referred after first reading to its Committee on Ways and
Means; was reported out by said Committee; underwent second and third readings,
was sent to the bicameral conference committee and then, after appropriate
proceedings therein culminating in extensive amendments thereof, was finally
approved by both Houses and became the Expanded VAT Law.</p>

<p class="BODY">On whose side does the truth lie?  If it is not possible to make that determination from the
pleadings and records before this Court, shall it require evidence to be
presented?  No, on both law and
principle.  The Court will reject a case
where the legal issues raised, whatever they may be, depend for their
resolution on still unsettled questions of fact. Petitioners may not, by
raising what are concededly novel and weighty constitutional questions, compel
the Court to assume the role of a trier of facts.  It is on the contrary their obligation, before raising those
questions to this Court, to see to it that all issues of fact are settled in
accordance with the procedures laid down by law for proof of facts.  Failing this, petitioners would have only
themselves to blame for a peremptory dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, what is really proven about what happened to HB 11197 after
it was transmitted to the Senate?  It
seems to be admitted on all sides that after going through first reading, HB
11197 was referred to the Committee on Ways and Means chaired by Senator
Ernesto Herrera.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is however surmised that after this initial step, HB 11197 was
never afterwards deliberated on in the Senate, that it was there given nothing
more than a "passing glance," and that it never went through a proper
second and third reading.  There is no
competent proof to substantiate this claim.  What is certain is that on February 7, 1994, the Senate Committee on
Ways and Means submitted its Report (No. 349) stating that HB 11197 was <i>considered,
</i>and recommending that SB 1630 be approved "in substitution of S.B. No.
1129, taking into consideration P.S. Res. No. 734<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> and
H.B. No. 11197." This Report made known to the Senate, and clearly
indicates, that H.B. No. 11197 was indeed deliberated on by the Committee; in
truth, as Senator Herrera pointed out, the BCC later "agreed to adopt (a
broader coverage of the VAT) which is closely adhering to the Senate version **
** with some new provisions or amendments." The plain implication is that
the Senate Committee had indeed discussed HB 11197 in comparison with the
inconsistent parts of SB 1129 and afterwards proposed amendments to the former
in the form of a new bill (No. 1630) more closely akin to the Senate bill (No.
1129).</p>

<p class="BODY">And it is as reasonable to suppose as not that later, during the
second and third readings on March 24, 1994, the Senators, assembled as a body,
had before them copies of HB 11197 and SB 1129<span style="">,</span> as well as of the Committee's<span style=""> </span>new "SB 1630" that had been recommended for their
approval, or at the very least were otherwise perfectly aware that they were
considering the particular provisions of these bills.  That there was such a deliberation in the Senate <span style="">on </span>HB 11197 in light of inconsistent
portions of SB 1630, may further be necessarily inferred from the request, made
by the Senate on the same day, March 24, 1994, for the convocation of a
bicameral conference committee to reconcile "the disagreeing provisions of
said bill (SB 1630) and House Bill No. 11197," a request that could not have
been made had not the Senators more or less closely examined the provisions of
HB 11197 and compared them with those of the counterpart Senate measures.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Were the proceedings before the bicameral conference committee
fatally flawed?  The affirmative is
suggested because the committee allegedly overlooked or ignored the fact that
SB 1630 could not validly originate in the Senate, and that HB 11197 and SB
1630 never properly passed both chambers.  The untenability of these contentions has already been
demonstrated.  Now, demonstration of the
indefensibility of other arguments purporting to establish the impropriety of
the BCC proceedings will be attempted.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is the argument, for instance, that the conference
committee never used HB 11197 even as "frame of reference" because it
does not appear that the suggestion therefor (made by House Panel Chairman
Exequiel Javier at the bicameral conference committee's meeting on April 19,
1994, with the concurrence of Senator Maceda) was ever resolved, the minutes
being regrettably vague as to what occurred after that suggestion was
made.  It is, however, as reasonable to
assume that it was, as it was not, given the vagueness of the minutes already
alluded to.  In fact, a reading of the
BCC Report persuasively demonstrates that HB 11197 was not only utilized as a
"frame of reference" but actually discussed and deliberated on.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said BCC Report pertinently states:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

as <i>reconciled </i>and <i>approved </i>by the conferees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Approved."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Report, it will be noted, explicitly adverts to House Bill
No. 11197, it being in fact mentioned ahead of Senate Bill No. 1630;
graphically shows the very close identity of the subjects of both bills
(indicated in their respective titles); and clearly says that the committee met
in <i>"<u>full </u></i><u><span style="">and </span><i>free
conference" </i></u><u><span style="">on the </span><i>"disagreeing
</i></u><i><u><span style="">provisions</span></u></i><i><span style="">"</span></i><span style=""> </span>of both bills (obviously in an effort to reconcile them); and
that reconciliation of said "disagreeing provisions" had been
effected, the BCC having agreed that "House Bill No. 11197, in
consolidation with Senate Bill No. 1630, be approved in accordance with the
attached copy of the bill <i><u>as</u></i><i><u><span style=""> </span>reconciled</u></i> and approved by the conferees."</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be concluded, in other words, that, conformably to the
procedure provided in the Constitution with which all the Members of the
bicameral conference committee cannot but be presumed to be familiar, and no
proof to the contrary having been adduced on the point, it was the original
bill (HB 11197) which said body had considered and deliberated on in detail,
reconciled or harmonized with SB 1630, and used as basis for drawing up the
amended version eventually reported out and submitted to both houses of
Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is further contended that the BCC was created and convoked
prematurely, that SB 1630 should first have been sent to the House of
Representatives for concurrence It is maintained, in other words, that the latter
chamber should have refused the Senate request for a bicameral conference
committee to reconcile the "disagreeing provisions" of both bills,
and should have required that SB 1630 be first transmitted to it.  This, seemingly, is nit-picking given the
urgency of the proposed legislation as certified by the President (to both
houses, in fact).  Time was of the
essence, according to the President's best judgment -- as regards which
absolutely no one in either chamber of Congress took exception, general acceptance
being on the contrary otherwise manifested -- and that judgment the Court will
not now question.  In light of that
urgency, what was so vital or indispensable about such a transmittal that its
absence would invalidate all else that had been done towards enactment of the
law, completely escapes me, specially considering that the House had
immediately acceded without demur to the request for convocation of the
conference committee.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">What has just been said should dispose of the argument that the
statement in the enrolled bill, that "This Act which is a <i>consolidation
</i>of House Bill No. 11197 and Senate Bill No. 11630 was finally passed by the
House of Representatives and the Senate on April 27, 1994 and May 2,
1994," necessarily signifies that there were two (2) bills separately
introduced, retaining their independent existence until they reached the
bicameral conference committee where they were <i>consolidated, </i>and
therefore, the VAT law did not originate exclusively in the House having
originated in part in the Senate as SB 1630, which bill was not embodied in but
merely merged with HB 11197, retaining its separate identity until it was
joined by the BCC with the house measure.  The more logical, and fairer, course is to construe the expression,
"consolidation of House Bill No. 11197 and Senate Bill No. 11630" in
the context of accompanying and contemporaneous statements, <i>i.e.:</i>  (a) the declaration in the BCC Report, <i>supra</i>,
that the committee met to reconcile the disagreeing provisions of the two
bills, "and after full and free conference" on the matter, agreed and
so recommended that "House Bill No. 11197, in consolidation with Senate
Bill No. 1630, be approved in accordance with the attached copy of the bill as
reconciled and approved by the conferees;" and (b) the averment of Senator
Herrera, in the Report of the Ways and Means Committee, <i>supra, </i>that the
committee had actually "considered" (discussed) HB No. 11197 and
taken it "into consideration" in recommending that its own version of
the measure (SB 1630) be the one approved.</p>

<p class="BODY">That the Senate might have drawn up its own version of the
expanded VAT bill, contemporaneously with or even before the House did, is of
no moment.  It bears repeating in this
connection that no VAT bill ever <i>originated </i>in the Senate; neither its
SB 1129 or SB 1630 or any of its drafts was ever officially transmitted to the
House as an initiating bill which, as already pointed out, is what the
Constitution forbids; it was HB 11197 that was first sent to the Senate,
underwent first reading, was referred to Committee on Ways and Means and there
discussed in relation to and in comparison with the counterpart Senate version
or versions -- the mere formulation of which was, as also already discussed,
not prohibited to it -- and afterwards considered by the Senate itself, also in
connection with SB 1630, on second and third readings.  HB 11197 was in the truest sense, the
originating bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">An issue has also arisen respecting the so-called "enrolled
bill doctrine" which, it is said, whatever sacrosanct status it might
originally have enjoyed, is now in bad odor with modern scholars on account of
its imputed rigidity and unrealism; it being also submitted that the ruling in <i>Mabanag
v. Lopez Vito </i>(78 Phil. 1) and the cases reaffirming it, is no longer good
law, it being based on a provision of the Code of Civil Procedure<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
long since stricken from the statute books.</p>

<p class="BODY">I would myself consider the "enrolled bill" theory as
laying down a presumption of so strong a character as to be well nigh absolute
or conclusive, fully in accord with the familiar and fundamental philosophy of
separation of powers.  The result, as
far as I am concerned, is to make discussion of the enrolled bill principle
purely academic:  for as already pointed
out, there is no proof worthy of the name of any facts to justify its
reexamination and, possibly, disregard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other question is, what is the nature of the power given to a
bicameral conference committee of reconciling differences between, or
"disagreeing provisions" in, a bill originating from the House in
relation to amendments proposed by the Senate -- whether as regards some or all
of its provisions?  Is the mode of
reconciliation, subject to fixed procedure and guidelines?  What exactly can the committee do, or not
do?   Can it only clarify or revise
provisions found in either Senate or House bill?  Is it forbidden to propose additional or new provisions, even on
matters necessarily or reasonably connected with or germane to items in the
bills being reconciled?</p>

<p class="BODY">In answer, it is postulated that the reconciliation function is
quite limited.  In these cases, the
conference committee should have confined itself to reconciliation of
differences or inconsistencies only by (a) restoring provisions of HB 11197
aliminated by SB 1630, or (b) sustaining wholly or partly the Senate
amendments, or (c) as a compromise, agreeing that neither provisions nor
amendments be carried into the final form of HB 11197 for submission to both
chambers of the legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trouble is, it is theorized, the committee incorporated
activities or transactions which were not within the contemplation of both
bills; it made additions and deletions which did not enjoy the enlightenment of
initial committee studies; it exercised what is known as an <i><span style="">"ex post</span></i> veto power"
granted to it by no law, rule or regulation, a power that in truth is denied to
it by the rules of both the Senate and the House.  In substantiation, the Senate rule is cited, similar to that of
the House, providing that "differences shall be settled by a conference
committee" whose report shall contain "detailed and sufficiently
explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the subject measure, **
(to be) signed by the conferees;" as well as the "Jefferson's Manual,"
adopted by the Senate as supplement to its own rules, directing that the
managers of the conference must confine themselves to differences submitted to
them; they may not include subjects not within the disagreements even though
germane to a question in issue."</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant that the limiting proviso in the relevant rules
has been construed and applied as directory, not mandatory.  During the oral argument, counsel for
petitioners admitted that the practice for decades has been for bicameral
conference committees to include such provisions in the reconciled bill as they
believed to be germane or necessary and acceptable to both chambers, even if
not within any of the "disagreeing provisions," and the reconciled
bills, containing such provisions had invariably been approved and adopted by
both houses of Congress.  It is a
practice, they say, that should be stopped.  But it is a practice that establishes in no uncertain manner the
prevailing concept in both houses of Congress of the permissible and acceptable
modes of reconciliation that their conference committees may adopt, one whose
undesirability is not all that patent if not, indeed, incapable of
unquestionable demonstration.  The fact
is that conference committees only take up bills which have already been freely
and fully discussed in both chambers of the legislature, but as to which there
is need of reconciliation in view of "disagreeing provisions" between
them; and both chambers entrust the function of reconciling the bills to their
delegates at a conference committee with full awareness, and tacit consent,
that conformably with established practice unquestioningly observed over many
years, new provisions may be included even if not within the "disagreeing
provisions" but of which, together with other changes, they will be given
detailed and sufficiently explicit information prior to voting on the
conference committee version.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, a fairly recent decision written for the Court by
Senior Associate Justice Isagani A. Cruz, promulgated on November 11, 1993
(G.R. No. 105371, <i>The Philippine Judges Association, etc., et al. v. Hon.
Pete Prado, etc., et al.</i>), should leave no doubt of the continuing vitality
of the enrolled bill doctrine and give an insight into the nature of the
reconciling function of bicameral conference committees.  In that case, a bilateral conference
committee was constituted and met to reconcile Senate Billl No. 720 and House
Bill No. 4200.  It adopted a
"reconciled" measure that was submitted to and approved by both
chambers of Congress and ultimately signed into law by the President, as R.A.
No. 7354.  A provision in this statute
(removing the franking privilege from the courts, among others) was assailed as
being an invalid amendment because it was not included in the original version
of either the senate or the house bill and hence had generated no disagreement
between them which had to be reconciled.  The Court held:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"While it is true that a conference committee is the mechanism
for compromising differences between the Senate and the House, it is not
limited in its jurisdiction to this question.  Its broader function is described thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">A conference committee may deal generally with the subject matter
or it may be limited to resolving the precise differences between the two
houses.  Even where the conference
committee is not by rule limited in its jurisdiction, legislative custom
severely limits the freedom with which new subject matter can be inserted into
the conference bill.  But occasionally a
conference committee produces unexpected results, results beyond its
mandate.  These excursions occur even
where the rules impose strict limitations on conference committee
jurisdiction.  This is symptomatic of
the authoritarian power of conference committee (Davies, Legislative Law and
Process:  In A Nutshell, 1987 Ed., p.
81).</p>

<blockquote>It is a matter of record that the Conference Committee Report on
the bull in question was returned to and duly approved by both the Senate and
the House of Representatives. Thereafter, the bill was enrolled with its
certification by Senate President Neptali A. Gonzales and Speaker Ramon V.
Mitra of the House of Representatives as having been duly passed by both Houses
of Congress.  It was then presented to
and approved by President Corazon C. Aquino on April 3, 1992.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Court may not
inquire beyond the certification of the approval of a bill from the presiding
officers of Congress.  Casco Philippime
Chemical Co. v. Gimenez (7 SCRA 347) laid down the rule that the enrolled bill
is conclusive upon the Judiciary (except in matters that have to be entered in
the journals like the <i>yeas </i>and <i>nays </i>on the final reading of the
bill) (Mabanag v. Lopez Vito, 78 Phil. 1).  The Journals are themselves also binding on the Supreme Court, as we
held in the old (but still valid) case of U.S. v. Pons (34 Phil. 729), where we
explained the reason thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">To inquire into the veracity <span style="">of
</span>the journals of the Philippine legislature when they are, as we have
said, clear and explicit, would be to violate both the letter and spirit of the
organic laws by which the Philippine Government was brought into existence, to
invade a coordinate and independent department of the Government, and to
interfere with the legitimate powers and functions of the Legislature.  Applying these principles, we shall decline
to look into the petitioners' charges that an amendment was made upon the last
reading of the bill that eventually R.A. No. 7354 and that copies thereof in
its final form were not distributed among the members of each House.  Both the enrolled bill and the legislative
journals certify that the measure was duly enacted i.e., in accordance with
Article VI, Sec. 26 (2) of the Constitution.  We are bound by such official assurances from a coordinate department of
the government, to which we owe, at the very least, a becoming courtesy."</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, an analysis of the changes made by the conference
committee in HB 11197 and SB 1630 by way of reconciling their "disagreeing
provisions," -- assailed by petitioners as unauthorized or <span style="">incongrouous -- </span>reveals that many of
the changes related to actual "disagreeing provisions," and that
those that might perhaps be considered as entirely new are nevertheless
necessarily or logically connected with or germane to particular matters in the
bills being reconciled.</p>

<p class="BODY">For instance, the change made by the bicameral conference
committee (BCC) concerning amendments to Section 99 of the National Internal
Revenue Code (NIRC) -- the addition of <i>"lessors of goods or properties
and importers of goods"</i> -- is really a reconciliation of disagreeing
provisions, for while HB 11197, mentions as among those subject to tax,
"one who sells, barters, or exchanges goods or properties and <i>any
person who leases personal properties," </i>SB 1630 does not.  The change also merely clarifies the
provision by providing that the contemplated taxpayers includes
"importers." The revision as regards the amendment to Section 100,
NIRC, is also simple reconciliation, being nothing more than the adoption by <span style="">the </span>BCC of the provision in HB 11197
governing the sale of gold to Bangko Sentral, in contrast to SB 1630 containing
no such provision.  Similarly, only
simple reconciliation was involved as regards approval by the BCC of a
provision declaring as not exempt, the sale of real properties primarily held
for sale to customers or held for lease in the ordinary course of trade or
business, which provision is found in HB 11197 but not in SB 1630; as regards
the adoption by the BCC of a provision on life insurance business, contained in
SB 1630 but not found in HB 11197; as regards adoption by the BCC of the
provision in SB 1630 for deferment of tax on certain goods and services for no
longer than 3 years, as to which there was no counterpart provision in SB
11197; and as regards the fixing of a period for the adoption of implementing
rules, a period being prescribed in SB 1630 and none in HB 11197.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of other revisions, it would seem that questions
logically arose in the course of the discussion of specific "disagreeing
provisions" to which answers were given which, because believed acceptable
to both houses of Congress, were placed in the BCC draft.  For example, during consideration of <i>radio
and television time </i>(Sec. 100, NIRC) dealt with in both House and Senate
bills, the question apparently came up, the relevance of which is apparent on
its face, relative to <i>satellite transmission and cable television time.  </i>Hence, a provision in the BCC bill on
the matter.  Again, while deliberating
on the definition of goods or properties in relation to the provision
subjecting sales thereof to tax, a question apparently arose, logically
relevant, about real properties intended to be sold by a person in economic
difficulties, or because he wishes to buy a car, i.e., not as part of a
business, the BCC evidently resolved to clarify the matter by excluding from
the tax, <i>"real properties held primarily for sale to customers or held
for lease in the ordinary course of business." </i>And in the course of
consideration of the term, <i>sale or exhange of services </i>(Sec 102, NIRC),
the inquiry most probably was posed as to whether the term should be understood
as including other services:  e.g.,
services of lessors of property whether real or personal, of warehousemen, of
keepers of resthouses, pension houses, inns, resorts, or of, common carriers,
etc., and presumably the BCC resolved to clarify the matter by including the
services just mentioned.  Surely,
changes of this nature are obviously to be expected in proceedings before
bicameral conference committees and may even be considered grist for their
mill, given the history of such BCCs and their general practice here and abroad</p>

<p class="BODY">In any case, all the changes and revisions, and deletions, <span style="">made </span>by the conference committee were
all subsequently considered by and approved by both the Senate and the House,
meeting and voting separately.  It is an
unacceptable theorization, to repeat, that when the BCC report and its proposed
bill were submitted to the Senate and the House, the members thereof did not
bother to read, or what is worse, having read did not understand, what was
before them, or did not realize that there were new provisions in the
reconciled version unrelated to any "disagreeing provisions," or that
said new provisions or revisions were effectively concealed from them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it certainly was entirely within the power and
prerogative of either legislative chamber to reject the BCC bill and require
the organization of a new bicameral conference committee. That this option was
not exercised by either house only proves that the BCC measure was found to be
acceptable as in fact it was approved and adapted by both chambers.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote to DISMISS the petitions for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The original VAT law and the expanded VAT
law</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Kapatiran v. Tan,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><i>
where </i>the <i>ponente </i>was the writer of this Separate Opinion, a <u>unanimous</u>
Supreme Court <i>en banc </i>upheld the validity of the original VAT law
(Executive Order No. 273, approved on 25 July 1987).  It will, in my view, be pointless at this time to re-open
arguments advanced in said case as to why said VAT law was invalid, and it will
be equally redundant to re-state the principles laid down by the Court in the
same case affirming the validity of the VAT law as a tax measure.  And yet, the same arguments are, in effect,
marshalled against the merits and substance of the expanded VAT law (Rep. Act
No. 7716, approved on 5 May 1994).  The
same Supreme Court decision should therefore dispose, in the main, of such
arguments, for the expanded VAT law is predicated basically on the same
principles as the original VAT law, except that now the tax base of the VAT
imposition has been expanded or broadened.</p>

<p class="BODY">It only needs to be stated - what actually should be obvious -
that a tax measure, like the expanded VAT law (Republic Act. No. 7716), is
enacted by Congress and approved by the President in the exercise of the
State's power to tax, which is an attribute of sovereignty.  And while the power to tax, if exercised
without limit, is a power to destroy, and should, therefore, not be allowed in
such form, it has to be equally recognized that the power to tax is an
essential right of government.  Without
taxes, basic services to the people can come to a halt; economic progress will
be stunted, and, in the long run, the people will suffer the pains of
stagnation and retrogression.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, upon careful deliberation, I have no difficulty in
reaching the conclusion that the expanded VAT law comes within the <u>legitimate</u>
<u>power</u> of the state to tax.  And
as I had occasion' to previously state:</p>

<blockquote>"Constitutional Law, to begin with, is concerned with power
not political convenience, wisdom, exigency, or even necessity.  Neither the Executive nor the Legislative
(Commission on Appointments) can create power where the Constitution confers
none."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, in the first VAT case, I said:</p>

<blockquote>"In any event, if petitioners seriously believe that the
adoption and continued application of the VAT are prejudicial to the general
welfare or the interests of the majority of the people, they should seek
recourse and relief from the political branches of the government.  The Court, following the time-honored doctrine
of separation of powers, cannot substitute its judgment for that of the
President (and Congress) as to the wisdom, justice and advisability of the
adoption of the VAT."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court should not, as a rule, concern itself with questions
of policy, much less, economic policy.  That is better left to the two (2) political branches of
government.  That the expanded VAT law
is unwise, unpopular and even anti-poor, among other things said against it,
are arguments and considerations within the realm of policy-debate, which only
Congress and the Executive have the authority to decisively confront,
alleviate, remedy and resolve.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The procedure followed in the approval of
Rep. Act No. 7716.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners however posit that the present case raises a,
far-reaching constitutional question which the Court is duty-bound to decide
under its expanded jurisdiction in the 1987 Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>.  Petitioners more specifically question and
impugn the <u>manner</u> by which the expanded VAT law (Rep. Act. No. 7716) was
approved by Congress.  They contend that
it was approved in violation of the Constitution from which fact it follows, as
a consequence, that the law is null and void.  Main reliance of the petitioners in their assault is Section 24, Art. VI
of the Constitution which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 24.  All
appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing increase of the
public debt, bill of local application, and private bills shall originate
exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may propose or
concur with amendments. "</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While it should be admitted at the outset that there was no
rigorous and strict adherence to the literal command of the above provision, it
may however be said, after careful reflection, that there was <u>substantial</u>
<u>compliance</u> with the provision.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that House Bill No.11197 expanding the VAT
law originated from the House of Representatives.  It is undeniably a House measure.  On the other hand, Senate Bill No. 1129, also expanding the VAT
law, originated from the Senate.  It is
undeniably a Senate measure which, <u>in</u> <u>point</u> <u>of</u> <u>time</u>,
actually antedated House Bill No. 11197.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it is of record that when House Bill No. 11197 was, after
approval by the House, sent to the Senate, it was referred to, and considered
by the Senate Committee on Ways and Means (after first reading) together with
Senate Bill No. 1129, and the Committee came out with Senate Bill No. 1630 in
substitution of Senate Bill No. 1129 but after expressly taking into
consideration House Bill No. 11197.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the Senate is, under the above-quoted constitutional provision,
empowered to concur with a revenue measure exclusively originating from the
House, or to propose amendments thereto, to the extent of proposing amendments
by SUBSTITUTION to the House measure, the approval by the Senate of Senate Bill
No. 1630, after it had considered House Bill No. 11197, may be taken, in my
view, as an AMENDMENT BY SUBSTITUTION by the Senate not only of Senate Bill No.
1129 but of House Bill No. 11197 as well which, it must be remembered,
originated exclusively from the House.</p>

<p class="BODY">But then, in recognition of the fact that House Bill No. 11197
which originated exclusively from the House and Senate Bill No. 1630 contained
conflicting provisions, both bills (House Bill No. 11197 and Senate Bill No.
1630) were referred to the Bicameral Conference Committee for joint
consideration with a view to reconciling their conflicting provisions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Conference Committee came out eventually with a Conference
Committee Bill which was submitted to both chambers of Congress (the Senate and
the House).  The Conference Committee
reported out a bill consolidating provisions in House Bill No. 11197 and Senate
Bill No. 1630.  What transpired in both
chambers after the Conference Committee Report was submitted to them is not
clear from the records in this case.  What is clear however is that both chambers voted separately on the bill
reported out by<i> </i>the Conference Committee and both chambers approved the
bill of the Conference Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">To me then, what should really be important is that both chambers
of Congress approved the bill reported out by the Conference Committee.  In my considered view, the act of both
chambers of Congress in approving the Conference Committee bill, should put an
end to any inquiry by this Court as to how the bill came about.  What is more, such separate approvals CURED
whatever constitutional infirmities may have arisen in the procedures leading
to such approvals.  For, if such
infirmities were serious enough to impugn the very validity of the measure
itself, there would have been an objection or objections from members of both
chambers to the approval.  The Court has
been shown no such objection on record in both chambers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that there were violations of Sec. 26
paragraph 2, Article VI of the Constitution which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 26.  x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No bill passed by
either House shall become a law unless it has passed three readings on separate
days, and printed copies thereof in its final form have been distributed to its
Members three days before its passage, except when the President certifies to
the necessity of its immediate enactment to meet a public calamity or
emergency.  Upon the last reading of a
bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed, and the vote thereon shall be
taken immediately thereafter, and the yeas and nays entered in the Journal.
"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">in that, when Senate Bill No. 1630 (the
Senate counterpart of House Bill No. 11197) was approved by the Senate, after
it had been reported out by the Senate Committee on Ways and Means, the bill
went through second and third readings on the same day (not separate days) and
printed copies thereof in its final form were not distributed to the members of
the Senate at least three (3) days before its passage by the Senate.  But we are told by the respondents that the
reason for this "short cut" was that the President had certified to
the necessity of the bill's immediate enactment to meet an emergency - a
certification that, by leave of the same constitutional provision, dispensed
with the second and third readings on separate days and the printed form at
least three (3) days before its passage.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have here then a situation where the President did certify to
the necessity of Senate Bill No. 1630's immediate enactment to meet an
emergency and the Senate responded accordingly.  While I would be the last to say that this Court cannot review
the exercise of such power by the President in appropriate cases ripe for
judicial review, I am not prepared however to say that the President gravely
abused his discretion in the exercise of such power as to require that this
Court overturn his action.  We have been
shown no fact or circumstance which would impugn the judgment of the President,
concurred in by the Senate, that there was an emergency that required the
immediate enactment of Senate Bill No. 1630. On the other hand, a becoming
respect for a co-equal and coordinate department of government points that
weight and credibility be given to such Presidential judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The authority or power of the Conference Committee to make
insertions in and deletions from the bills referred to it, namely, House Bill
No. 11197 and Senate Bill No. 1630 is likewise assailed by petitioners.  Again, what appears important here is that
both chambers approved and ratified the bill as reported out by the Conference Committee
(with the reported insertions and deletions).  This is perhaps attributable to the known legislative practice of
allowing a Conference Committee to make insertions in and deletions from bills
referred to it for consideration, as long as they are germane to the subject
matter of the bills under consideration.  Besides, when the Conference Committee made the insertions and deletions
complained of by petitioners, was it not actually performing the task assigned
to it of reconciling conflicting provisions in House Bill No. 11197 and Senate
Bill No. 1630?</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court impliedly if not expressly recognized the fact of such
legislative practice in <i>Philippine Judges Association, etc., vs. Hon. Peter
Prado, etc.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>in said case, we stated thus:</p>

<blockquote>“The petitioners also invoke Sec. 74 of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, requiring that amendment to any bill when the House and the
Senate shall have differences thereon may be settled by a conference committee
of both chambers.  They stress that Sec.
35 was never a subject of any disagreement between both Houses and so the
second paragraph could not have been validly added as an amendment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>These arguments are unacceptable.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it is true that a conference committee is the mechanism for
compromising differences between the Senate and the House, <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>not</u>
<u>limited</u> <u>in</u> <u>its</u> <u>jurisdiction</u> <u>to</u> <u>this</u> <u>question.</u>  <u>Its</u> <u>broader</u> <u>function</u> is
described thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'A conference committee may deal generally with the subject matter
or it may be limited to resolving the precise differences between the two
houses.  Even where the conference
committee is not by rule limited in its jurisdiction, legislative custom
severely limits the freedom with which new subject matter can be inserted into
the conference bill.  But occasionally a
conference committee produces unexpected results, results beyond its
mandate.  These excursions occur even
where the rules impose strict limitations on conference committee jurisdiction.  This is symptomatic of the authoritarian
power of conference committee (<i>Davies, Legislative Law and Process:  In A Nutshell, 1986 Ed., p. 81).'<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<blockquote>It is a matter of record that the Conference Committee Report on
the bill in question was returned to and duly approved by both the Senate and
the House of Representatives.  Thereafter,
the bill was enrolled with its certification by Senate President Neptali A.
Gonzales and Speaker Ramon V. Mitra of the House of Representatives as having
been duly passed by both Houses of Congress.  It was then presented to and approved by President Corazon C. Aquino On
April 3, 1992.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It would seem that if corrective measures
are in order to <u>clip</u> the powers of the Conference Committee, the remedy
should come from either or both chambers of Congress, not from this Court,
under the time-honored doctrine of separation of powers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, as certified by the Secretary of the Senate and the
Secretary General of the House of Representatives -</p>

<blockquote>“This Act (Rep. Act No. 7716) is a consolidation of House Bill No.
11197 and Senate Bill No. 1630 (w)as finally passed by the House of
Representatives and the Senate on April 27, 1994 and May 2, 1994 respectively.
"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: white;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the long-accepted doctrine of the "enrolled
bill," the Court in deference to a co-equal and coordinate branch of
government is held to a recognition of Rep. Act No. 7716 as a law validly
enacted by Congress and, thereafter, approved by the President on 5 May
1994.  Again, we quote from our recent
decision in <i>Philippine Judges Association</i><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: white;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><i>,
</i>supra:</p>

<blockquote>"Under the doctrine of separation of powers, the Court may not
inquire beyond the certification of the approval of a bill from the presiding
officers of Congress.  <i>Casco
Philippine Chemical Co. v. Gimenez </i>laid down the rule that the enrolled
bill is conclusive upon the Judiciary (except in matters that have to be
entered in the journals like the <i>yeas </i>and nays on the final reading of
the bill).  The journals are themselves
also binding on the Supreme Court, as we held in the old (but still valid) case
of <i>U.S. vs. Pons,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
where we explained the reason thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'To inquire into the veracity of the journals of the Philippine
legislature when they are, as we have said, clear and explicit, would be to
violate both the letter and spirit of the organic laws by which the
Philippine  Government was brought into
existence, to invade a coordinate and independent department of the Government,
and to interfere with the legitimate powers and functions of the Legislature.'</p>

<blockquote>Applying these principles, we shall decline to look into the
petitioners' charges that an amendment was made upon the last reading of the
bill that eventually became R.A. No. 7354 and that copies thereof in its final
form were not distributed among the members of each House.  Both the enrolled bill and the legislative journals
certify that the measure was duly enacted i.e., in accordance with Article VI,
Sec. 26(2) of the Constitution.  We are
bound by such official assurances from a coordinate department of the
government, to which we owe, at the very least, a becoming courtesy."</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Press Freedom and Religious Freedom and
Rep. Act No. 7716</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of the passage of Rep. Act No. 7716 notwithstanding,
certain provisions of the law have to be examined separately and carefully.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rep. Act. No. 7716 in imposing a value-added tax on circulation
income of newspapers and similar publications and on income derived from
publishing advertisements in newspapers<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>,
to my mind, violates Sec. 4, Art. III of the Constitution.  Indeed, even the Executive Department has
tried to cure this defect by the issuance of BIR Regulation No. <u>11-94</u>
precluding implementation of the tax in this area.  It should be clear, however, that the BIR regulation cannot amend
the law (Rep. Act No. 7716).  Only
legislation (as distinguished from administration regulation) can amend an
existing law.</p>

<p class="BODY">Freedom of the press was virtually unknown in the Philippines
before 1900.  In fact, a prime cause of
the revolution against Spain at the turn of the 19th century was the repression
of the freedom of speech and expression and of the press.  No less than our national hero, Dr. Jose P.
Rizal, in <i>"Filipinas Despues de Cien Anos" </i>(The Philippines a
Century Hence) describing the reforms <i>sine quibus non </i>which the
Filipinos were insisting upon, stated:  "The minister x x x who wants his reforms to be reforms, must begin
by declaring the press in the Philippines free x x x".<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Press freedom in the Philippines has met repressions, most
notable of which was the closure of almost all forms of existing mass media
upon the imposition of martial law on 21 September 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 4, Art. III of the Constitution maybe traced to the
United States Federal Constitution.  The
guarantee of freedom of expression was planted in the Philippines by President
McKinley in the Magna Carta of Philippine Liberty, Instructions to the Second
Philippine Commission on 7 April 1900.</p>

<p class="BODY">The present constitutional provision which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 4 No law shall be passed abridging the freedom of
speech, of expression, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to
assemble and petition the government for redress of grievances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">is essentially the same as that
guaranteed in the U.S. Federal Constitution, for which reason, American case
law giving judicial expression as to its meaning is highly persuasive in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plain words of the provision reveal the clear intention that <u>no</u>
<u>prior</u> <u>restraint</u> can be imposed on the exercise of free speech and
expression if they are to remain effective and meaningful.</p>

<p class="BODY">The U.S. Supreme Court in the leading case of <i>Grosjean v.
American Press Co., Inc.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
declared a statute imposing a gross receipts license tax of 2% on circulation
and advertising income of newspaper publishers as constituting a prior
restraint which is contrary to the guarantee of freedom of the press.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <i>Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan</i><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><i>,
</i>the U.S. Supreme Court stated:  "Any system of prior restraint of expression comes to this Court
bearing a heavy presumption against its constitutionality."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, prior restraint on the exercise of free
expression can be justified only on the ground that there is a clear and
present danger of a substantive evil which the State has the right to prevent<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the present case, the tax imposed on circulation and
advertising income of newspaper publishers is in the nature of a <u>prior</u> <u>restraint</u>
on circulation and free expression and, absent a clear showing that the
requisite for prior restraint is present, the constitutional flaw in the law is
at once apparent and should not be allowed to proliferate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the imposition of the VAT on the sale and distribution
of religious articles must be struck down for being contrary to Sec. 5, Art.
III of the Constitution which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 5.  No law shall
be made respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free
exercise thereof.  The free exercise and
enjoyment of religious profession and worship, without discrimination or
preference, shall forever be allowed.  No religious test shall be required for the exercise of civil or
political rights."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That such a tax on the sale and distribution of religious
articles is unconstitutional, has been long settled in American Bible Society,
supra.</p>

<p class="BODY">Insofar, therefore, as Rep. Act No. 7716 imposes a value-added
tax on the exercise of the above-discussed two (2) basic constitutional rights,
Rep. Act No. 7716 should be declared unconstitutional and of no legal force and
effect.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitions of CREBA and PAL and Rep. Act
No. 7716</p>

<p class="BODY">The Chamber of Real Estate and Builder's Association, Inc.
(CREBA) filed its own petition (GR No. 11574) arguing that the provisions of
Rep. Act No. 7716 imposing a 10% value-added tax on the gross selling price or
gross value in money of every sale, barter or exchange of goods or properties
(Section 2) and a 10% value-added tax on gross receipts derived from the sale
or exchange of services, including the use or lease of properties (Section 3),
violate the equal protection, due process and non-impairment provisions of the
Constitution as well as the rule that taxation should be uniform, equitable and
progressive.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue of whether or not the value-added tax is uniform,
equitable and progressive has been settled in <i>Kapatiran.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">CREBA which specifically assails the 10% value-added tax on the
gross selling price of real properties, fails to distinguish between a sale of
real properties primarily held for sale to customers or held for lease in the
ordinary course of trade or business and isolated sales by individual real
property owners (Sec. 103[s]).  That
those engaged in the business of real estate development realize great profits
is of common knowledge and need not be discussed at length here.  The qualification in the law that the 10%
VAT covers only sales of real property primarily held for sale to customers,
i.e. for trade or business thus takes into consideration a taxpayer's capacity
to pay.  There is no showing that the
consequent distinction in real estate sales is arbitrary and in violation of
the equal protection clause of the Constitution.  The inherent power to tax of the State, which is vested in the
legislature, includes the power to determine whom or what to tax, as well as
how much to tax.  In the absence of a
clear showing that the tax violates the due process and equal protection
clauses of the Constitution, this Court, in keeping with the doctrine of
separation of powers, has to defer to the discretion and judgment of Congress
on this point.</p>

<p class="BODY">Philippine Airlines (PAL) in a separate petition (G.R. No.
115852) claims that its franchise under PD No. 1590 which makes it liable for a
franchise tax of only 2% of gross revenues "in lieu of all the other fees
and charges of any kind, nature or description, imposed, levied, established,
assessed or collected by any municipal, city, provincial, or national authority
or government agency, now or in the future," cannot be amended by Rep. Act
No. 7716 as to make it (PAL) liable for a 10% value-added tax on revenues,
because Sec. 24 of PD No. 1590 provides that PAL's franchise can only be amended,
modified or repealed by a special law specifically for that purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The validity of PAL's above argument can be tested by
ascertaining the true intention of Congress in enacting Rep. Act No. 7716.  Sec. 4 thereof dealing with Exempt
Transactions states:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 103.  Exempt
Transactions. - The following shall be exempt from the value-added tax:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>(q) Transactions which are exempt under special laws, <u>except</u>
<u>those</u> <u>granted</u> <u>under</u> <u>Presidential</u> <u>Decrees</u> No.
66, 529, 972, 1491, <u>1590</u>, x x x" (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The repealing clause of Rep. Act No. 7716 further reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 20.  Repealing
clauses. - <u>The</u> <u>provisions</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u> <u>special</u> <u>law</u>
<u>relative</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>rate</u> <u>of</u> <u>franchise</u> <u>taxes</u>
<u>are</u> <u>hereby</u> <u>expressly</u> <u>repealed</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>All other laws, orders, issuances, rules and regulations or parts
thereof inconsistent with this Act are hereby repealed, amended or modified
accordingly" (emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There can be no dispute, in my mind, that the clear intent of
Congress was to modify PAL'S franchise with respect to the taxes it has to
pay.  To this extent, Rep. Act No. 7716
can be considered as a <u>special</u> <u>law</u> amending PAL's franchise and
its tax liability thereunder.  That Rep.
Act, No. 7716 imposes the value-added taxes on other subjects does not make it
a general law which cannot amend PD No. 1590.</p>

<p class="BODY">To sum up:  it is my
considered view that Rep. Act No. 7716 (the expanded value-added tax) is a
valid law, viewed from both substantive and procedural standards, except only
insofar as it violates Secs. 4 and 5, Art. III of the Constitution (the
guarantees of freedom of expression and the free exercise of religion).  To that extent, it is, in its present form,
unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">I, therefore, vote to DISMISS the petitions, subject to the above
qualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners plead that we affirm the self-evident proposition
that they who make law should not break the law.  There are many evils whose elimination can be trusted to
time.  The evil of lawlessness in
lawmaking <span style="">cannot.  </span>It must be slain on sight for it
subverts the sovereignty of the people.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, a fast snapshot of the facts.  On November 17, 1993, the House of Representatives passed on
third reading House Bill (H.B.) No. 11197 entitled "An Act Restructuring
the Value Added Tax (VAT) System to Widen its Tax Base and Enhance its
Administration, Amending for These Purposes Sections 99, 100, 102 to 108 and
110 Title V and 236, 237 and 238 of Title IX, and Repealing Sections 113 and
114 of Title V, all of the National Internal Revenue Code as Amended." The
vote was 114 Yeas and 12 Nays.  The next
day, November 18, 1993, H.B. No. 11197 was transmitted to the Senate for its
concurrence by the Hon. Camilo L. Sabio, Secretary General of the House of
Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 7, 1994, the Senate Committee on Ways and Means
submitted Senate Bill (S.B.) No. 1630, recommending its approval "in
substitution of Senate <span style="">Bill </span>No.
1129 taking into consideration P.S. Res. No. 734 and House <span style="">Bill </span>No. 11197." On March 24,
1994, S.B. No. 1630 was approved on second and third readings.  On the same day, the Senate, thru Secretary
Edgardo E. Tumangan, requested the House for a conference “in view of the
disagreeing provisions of S.B. 1630 and H.B. No. 11197.” It designated the
following as members of <span style="">its Comm</span>ittee:  Senators Ernesto F. Herrera, Leticia R.
Shahani, Alberto S. Romulo, John H. Osmeña, Ernesto M. Maceda, Blas F. Ople,
Francisco S. Tatad, Rodolfo G<span style="">. </span>Biazon,
and Wigberto S. Tañada.  On the part of
the House, the members of the Commitee were:  Congressmen Exequiel B. Javier, James L. Chiongbian, Renato V. Diaz,
Arnulfo P. Fuentebella, Mariano M. Tajon, Gregorio<span style=""> </span>Andolong, Thelma Almario, and Catalino Figueroa.

<p class="BODY">The charge that the Bicameral <span style="">Conference Committee added </span>new provisions in the bills of the
two <span style="">chambers </span>is hardly disputed
by respondents.  Instead, respondents
justify them.  According to
respondents:  (1) the Bicameral
Conference Committee has an <i><span style="">ex post</span></i><span style=""> veto power</span> or a veto after the fact of
approval of the bill by both Houses; (2) the bill prepared by the Bicameral
Conference Committee, with its additions and deletions, was anyway approved by
both Houses; (3) it was the practice in past Congresses for conference
committees to insert in bills approved by the two Houses new provisions that
were not originally contemplated by them; and (4) the enrolled bill doctrine
precludes inquiry into the regularity of the proceedings that led to the
enactment of R.A. 7716.</p>

<p class="BODY">With due respect, I reject these contentions which will cave in
on closer examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">First.  There is
absolutely no legal warrant for the bold submission that a Bicameral Conference
Committee possesses the power to add/delete provisions in bills already approved
on third reading by both Houses or an <i>ex</i><i><span style=""> </span></i><i><span style="">post </span></i>veto
power.  <span style="">To </span>support this postulate that can enfeeble Congress itself,
respondents cite no constitutional provision, no<span style=""> </span>law, not even any rule or regulation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Worse, their stance <span style="">is </span>categorically
repudiated by the rules of both the Senate and the House of Representatives
which define with precision the <u><span style="">parameters
of </span></u><u><span style="">power</span></u><span style=""> </span>of a Bicameral Conference Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Thus,
Section 209, Rule XII of the Rules of the Senate provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“In the event that the Senate does not <span style="">agree </span>with the House of Representatives on the <span style="">provision of any bill or </span>joint
resolution, <u>the </u><u><span style="">differences
shall be settled by a conference </span>committee of both Houses</u> <span style="">which shall meet </span>within ten days after
<span style="">their </span>composition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Each Conference Committee Report shall contain a detailed and
sufficiently explicit <span style="">statement </span>of
<span style="">the changes in or amendments to </span>the
subject measure, and shall be signed by the conferees.” (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The counterpart rule of the House of
Representatives is cast in near identical language.  Section 85 of the Rules of the House of Representatives
pertinently provides:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>In the event that the House does not agree with the Senate
on the amendments to any bill or joint resolution, the differences may be
settled by a conference committee of </u><u><span style="">both </span></u><u><span style="">chambers</span></u><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span style="">x x.<span style=""> </span> </span>Each report shall contain <span style="">a </span>detailed, sufficiently explicit
statement <span style="">of </span>the changes in or
amendments to the subject measure." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">The
Jefferson's Manual has been adopted</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as a supplement to our </span>parliamentary
rules and practice.  <span style="">Section 456 of </span>Jefferson's Manual
similarly confines the powers of a conference committee, <i><span style="">viz:</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The managers of a conference must confine themselves to the
differences committed to them … and may not include subjects not within the
disagreements, even though germane to a question in issue."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">This rule of antiquity has been honed and
honored in practice by the Congress of the United States.  Thus, it is chronicled by Floyd Biddick,
Parliamentarian Emeritus of the United States Senate, <i>viz:</i><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Committees of conference are appointed for the <u>sole
purpose of compromising and adjusting the differing and conflicting opinions of
the two Houses</u> and the committees of conference alone can grant compromises
and modify propositions of either Houses within the limits of the
disagreement.  Conferees are limited to
the consideration of differences between the two Houses.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Conferees shall not insert in their report matters not committed
to them by either House, nor shall they strike from the bill matters agreed to
by both Houses</u>.  No matter on which
there is nothing in either the Senate or House passed versions of a bill may be
included in the conference report and actions to the contrary would subject the
report to a point of order." (Emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In fine, there is neither a sound nor a
syllable in the Rules of the Senate and the House of Representative to support
the thesis of the respondents that a bicameral conference committee is clothed
with an <i><span style="">ex post </span></i>veto
power.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the thesis that a Bicameral Conference Committee can wield <i><span style="">ex post </span></i>veto power does not only
contravene the rules of both the Senate and the House.  It wages war against our settled ideals of
representative democracy.  For the
inevitable, catastrophic effect of the thesis is to install a Bicameral
Conference Committee as the Third Chamber of our Congress, <u>similarly</u>
vested with the power <span style="">to </span>make
laws but with the <u>dissimilarity</u> that its laws are not the subject of a
free and full discussion of both Houses o<span style="">f
</span>Congress.  With such a vagrant
power, a Bicameral <span style="">Conference Committee
acting </span>as a Third Chamber will be a <span style="">constitutional monstrosity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It needs no omniscience to perceive that our Constitution did not
provide for a Congress composed of three chambers.   On the contrary, section 1, Article VI of the Constitution
provides in clear and certain language:  "The legislative power <u>shall</u> be vested in the Congress of
the Philippines which <u>shall</u><span style=""> </span>consist
of <span style="">a </span>Senate and a House of
Representatives... ." Note that in vesting legislative power exclusively
to the Senate and the House, <span style="">the </span>Constitution
used the word “shall.” Its command for a Congress of two houses is
mandatory.  It <span style="">is </span>not mandatory sometimes.</p>

<p class="BODY">In vesting legislative power to the Senate, the Constitution means
the Senate "... composed of twenty-four Senators x x x elected at large by
the qualified voters of the Philippines… ."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, when the Constitution vested the legislative power <span style="">to the House, i</span>t means the House “…
composed of not more than two hundred and fifty members x x x who shall <span style="">be </span>elected from legislative districts
x x x and those who x x x shall be elected through a party-list system of
registered national, regional, and sectoral parties or organizations."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The Constitution thus, did not vest on a Bicameral Conference Committee with an
<i><span style="">ad hoc </span></i>membership the
power to legislate for it exclusively <span style="">vested
</span>legislative power to the Senate and the House as co-equal bodies.  To be sure, <span style="">the </span>Constitution <span style="">does </span>not
mention the Bicameral Conference Committees of Congress.  No constitutional status is accorded to
them.  They are not even statutory
creations.  They owe their existence from
the internal rules of the two Houses of Congress.  Yet, respondents peddle the disconcerting idea that they should
be recognized as a Third Chamber of Congress and with <i><span style="">ex post </span></i>veto power at that.</p>

<p class="BODY">The thesis that a Bicameral Conference Committee can exercise law
making power with <i><span style="">ex post </span></i>veto
power is freighted with mischief.  Law
making is a power that can be used for good or for ill, hence, <span style="">our </span>Constitution carefully laid out a
plan and a procedure for its exercise.  Firstly, it vouchsafed that the power to make laws should be exercised
by no other body except the Senate and the House.  It ought to be indubitable that what <span style="">is </span>contemplated <span style="">is </span>the
Senate acting as a full Senate and the House acting as a full House.  It is only when the Senate and the House act
as whole bodies that they truly represent the people.  And it is only when they represent the people that they can
legitimately <span style="">pass laws.  Laws that are not enacted by the people's
rightful representatives subvert the people's </span>sovereignty.  Bicameral Conference Committees, with their <i>ad
hoc </i>character and limited membership, cannot pass laws for they do not
represent the people.  The Constitution
does not allow the tyranny of the majority.  Yet, the respondents will impose the worst kind of tyranny - the tyranny
of the minority over the majority.  Secondly, the Constitution delineated in deft strokes the steps to be followed
in making laws.  The overriding <span style="">purpose </span>of these procedural rules <span style="">is </span>to assure that only bills that
successfully survive <span style="">the searching </span>scrutiny
of the proper committees of Congress and the full and unfettered deliberations
of both Houses can become laws.  For
this reason, a bill has to undergo three (3) mandatory separate readings in
each House.  In the case <span style="">at </span>bench, the additions and deletions
made by the Bicameral Conference Committee did not enjoy the enlightened
studies of appropriate committees.  It
is meet to note that the complexities of modern day legislations have made our
committee system a significant part of the legislative process.  Thomas Reed called the committee system as
"the eye, the ear, <span style="">the hand, and
very often the brain </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the house." </span>President Woodrow
Wilson of the United States once referred to the government of the United
States as "a government by the Chairmen of the Standing Committees of
Congress... ."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither did these additions <span style="">and </span>deletions
of the Bicameral Conference Committee pass through the coils of collective
deliberation of the members of the two Houses acting separately.  Due <span style="">to
</span>this shortcircuiting of the constitutional procedure of making laws,
confusion shrouds the enactment of R.A. No. 7716.  Who inserted the additions and deletions remains a mystery.  Why they were inserted is a riddle.  To use a Churchillian phrase, lawmaking
should not be a riddle wrapped in an enigma.  It cannot be, for Article II, section 28 of the Constitution mandates
the State to adopt and implement a "policy of full public disclosure of
all its transactions involving public interest." The Constitution could
not have contemplated a Congress of invisible and unaccountable John and Mary
Does.  A law whose rationale is a riddle
and whose authorship is obscure cannot bind the people.</p>

<p class="BODY">All these notwithstanding, <span style="">respondents
</span>resort to the legal cosmetology that these additions and deletions
should govern the people as laws because the Bicameral Conference Committee <span style="">Report </span>was anyway submitted to and
approved by the Senate and the House of Representatives.  The submission may have some merit with
respect to provisions agreed upon by the Committee in the process of
reconciling conflicts <span style="">between S.B. No.
1630 and H.B. </span>No. 11197.  In
these instances, the conflicting provisions had been previously screened by the
proper committees, deliberated upon by both Houses and approved by them.  It is, however, a different matter with
respect to additions and deletions which were entirely new and which were made
not to reconcile inconsistencies between S.B. No. 1630 and H.B. No. 11197.  The members of <span style="">the </span>Bicameral Conference Committee did not have any authority to
add new provisions or delete provisions already approved by <span style="">both </span>Houses as it was not necessary to
discharge their limited task of reconciling differences in bills.  At that <span style="">late </span>stage of law making, the Conference Committee cannot
add/delete provisions which can become laws without undergoing the study and
deliberation of both chambers given to bills on 1st, 2nd, and 3rd
readings.  Even the Senate and the House
cannot <span style="">enact a law which will not </span>undergo
these mandatory three (3) readings <span style="">required
</span>by the Constitution.  If the
Senate and the House cannot enact such a law, neither can the lesser Bicameral
Conference Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the so-<span style="">called </span>choice
given to the members of both Houses to either approve or disapprove the said
additions <span style="">and </span>deletions is more
of an optical illusion.  These additions
and deletions are not submitted separately for approval.  They are tucked to the entire bill.  The vote is on the bill as a package, <i>i.e.,</i>
together with the insertions and deletions.  And <span style="">the vote </span>is either
"aye" or “nay,” without any further debate and deliberation.  Quite often, <span style="">legislators vote “yes” </span>because they approve of the bill as <span style="">a </span>whole although they may object <span style="">to </span>its <span style="">amendments </span>by the <span style="">Conference
Committee.  This lack of real choice is
well </span>observed by Robert Luce:<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>“Their power lies chiefly in the fact that reports of conference
committees must be accepted without amendment or else rejected <i>in toto</i>.  The impulse is to get done with the matter
and so the motion to accept has undue <span style="">advantage,
for some members are sure </span>to <span style="">prefer
swallowing unpalatable provisions rather than </span>prolong controversy.  This is the more likely if the report comes
in the rush of business toward the end of a session, when to seek further
conference might result in the loss <span style="">of </span>the
measure altogether.  At any time in the
session there is some risk of such a result following the rejection of a
conference report, for it may not be possible <span style="">to </span>secure a second conference, or delay may give opposition to
the main proposal chance to develo<span style="">p</span>
more strength.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In a similar vein, Prof. Jack Davies
commented that "conference reports are returned to assembly and Senate on
a take-it or leave-it-basis, and the bodies are generally placed in the
position that to leave-it <span style="">is </span>a
practical impossibility."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

<blockquote><span style="">"x </span>x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Where the failure of

from the face of the </span><span style="">act itself </span>but
may be demonstrated by recourse to the legislative journals, debates, committee
reports or papers of the governor, courts have used several conflicting
theories with which to dispose of the issue.  They have held:  (1) that the
enrolled bill is conclusive and like the sheriff's return cannot be attacked;
(2) that the enrolled bill <span style="">is <i>prima
facie </i></span>correct and only in case the legislative journal <span style="">shows </span>affirmative contradiction of the
constitutional requirement will the bill be held invalid, (3) that although the
enrolled bill is <i>prima </i><i><span style="">facie</span></i><span style=""> </span>correct, evidence from the journals,
or other extrinsic sources is admissible to strike the bill down; (4) that the
legislative journal is conclusive and the enrolled bill <span style="">is </span>valid only if it accords with the recital in the journal and
the constitutional procedure.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Various jurisdictions have adopted these
alternative approaches in view of strong dissent and dissatisfaction against
the philosophical underpinnings of the conclusiveness of an enrolled bill.  Prof. Sutherland further observed:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span style="">x x </span>Numerous
reasons have been given for this rule.  Traditionally, an enrolled bill <span style="">was
</span>'a record' and as such was not subject to attack at common law.  Likewise, the rule of conclusiveness <span style="">was similar </span>to the common law rule of
the inviolability of the sheriff's return.  Indeed, they had the same origin, that <span style="">is, </span>the sheriff <span style="">was an </span>officer
of the king and likewise the parliamentary act was a regal act and no official
might dispute the king's word.  Transposed to our democratic sy<span style="">stem
</span>of government, courts held that as the legislature was an official
branch of government the court must indulge every presumption that the
legislative act was<span style=""> </span>valid.  The doctrine of separation of powers <span style="">was a</span>dvanced as a strong reason why
the court should treat the acts of a co-ordinate branch of government with the
same respect as it treats the action of its own officers; indeed, it was
thought that it was entitled <span style="">to </span>even
greater respect, else the court might be in the position of reviewing the work
of a supposedly equal branch of government.  When these arguments failed, as they frequently did, the doctrine of
convenience was advanced, that is, that it was not only an undue burden <span style="">upon </span>the legislature to preserve its records
to meet the attack of persons not affected by the procedure of enactment, but
also that it unnecessarily complicated litigation <span style="">and </span>confused the trial of substantive issues.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although <span style="">man</span>y<span style=""> </span>of these arguments are persuasive and
are indeed the basis for the rule in <span style="">many
</span>states today, they are not invulnerable <span style="">to </span>attack.  The rule most
relied on - the sheriff's return or sworn official <span style="">rule - </span>did not in civil litigation deprive the injured party of <span style="">an </span>action, for always he <span style="">could sue the </span>sheriff upon his
official bond.  Likewise, although
collateral attack was not permitted, direct attack permitted raising the issue
of fraud, and at a later date attack in <span style="">equity
</span>was also available; and that the evidence of the sheriff was not of
unusual weight was demonstrated <span style="">by </span>the
fact that in an action against the sheriff no presumption of its authenticity
prevailed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The argument that the enrolled bill <span style="">is </span>a 'record' and therefore unimpeachable is likewise
misleading, for the correction <span style="">of </span>records
is a matter of established judicial procedure.  Apparently, the justification is either the historical one that the
king's word <span style="">could </span>not be
questioned or the separation of powers principle that one branch of the
government must treat as valid the acts of another.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>P</u><u><span style="">e</span>rsuasive
as these arguments are, the tendency today is to avoid </u><u><span style="">  </span>reaching
results by artificial presumptions and thus it would seem desirable to insist
that the enrolled bill </u><u><span style="">stand </span>or
fall on the basis of the relevant </u><u><span style="">evidence  which may be submitted for or against </span>it</u>.”
(Emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, as far back as the 1940's, Prof.
Sutherland confirmed that “x x x the tendency seems to be toward the
abandonment of the conclusive presumption rule and the adoption of the third
rule leaving only a <i>prima facie</i> presumption of validity which <span style="">may </span>be attacked by any authoritative
source of information."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I am not unaware that this Court has subscribed to the

<blockquote>If for no other reason than that it conforms to the expressed

Legislature, when there is an existence of a copy signed by the presiding
officers and secretaries of said bodies, it shall be <span style="">conclusive </span>proof of the provisions of such Acts and of the due
enactment thereof.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Suffice to state that section 313 of the
Old Code of Civil Procedure as amended by Act No. 2210 is no longer in our
statute books.  It has long been
repealed by the Rules of Court.  <i>Mabanag
</i>also relied on jurisprudence and authorities in the United States which are
under severe criticisms by modern scholars.  Hence, even in the United States the conclusiveness of an enrolled bill
has been junked by most of the States.  It is also true that as late as last year, in the case of <i>Philippine
Judges Association v. Prado, op. cit</i>., this Court still relied on the
conclusiveness of an enrolled bill as it refused to invalidate a provision of
law on the ground that it was merely inserted by the bicameral conference
committee of both Houses.  <i>Prado, </i>however,
is distinguishable.  In <i>Prado, </i>the
alleged insertion of the second paragraph of section 35 of R.A. No. 7354
repealing the franking privilege of the judiciary does not appear to be an
uncontested fact.  In the case at bench,
the numerous additions/deletions made by the <span style="">Bicameral Conference Committee as detailed by petitioners Tolentino and
Salonga are not disputed by the </span><span style="">respondents.  In <i>Prado, </i></span><span style="">the </span>Court <span style="">was not also </span>confronted with the argument that it can no longer
rely on the conclusiveness of an enrolled bill in light of the new provision in
the Constitution defining judicial power.  More specifically, section 1 of Article VIII now provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1.  The
judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and in such lower courts as
may be established by law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Judicial power includes the <u>duty</u> of the courts of justice to

enforceable, and <u>to determine whether</u><u><span style=""> </span>o</u><u><span style="">r not there has </span></u><u><span style="">been a grave abuse of discretion amounting to

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Former Chief Justice Roberto R.
Concepcion, the sponsor of this provision in the Constitutional Commission
explained the sense and the reach of judicial power as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Constitution cannot be any
clearer.  What it granted to this Court
is not a mere <i>power</i> which it can decline to exercise.  Precisely to deter this disinclination, the

of a branch or instrumentality of government or any of its officials done with
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.  Rightly or wrongly, the Constitution has

<p class="BODY">The provision defining judicial power as including the “duty of
the courts of justice… to determine whether or not there has been a grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any
branch or instrumentality of the Government” constitutes the capstone of the
efforts of the Constitutional Commission to upgrade the powers of this Court <i>vis-a-vis</i>
the other branches of government.  This
provision was dictated by our experience under martial law which taught us that
a stronger and more independent judiciary is needed to abort abuses in
government.  As sharply stressed by
petitioner Salonga, this provision is distinctly Filipino and its
interpretation should not be depreciated by undue reliance on inapplicable
foreign jurisprudence.  It is thus
crystal clear that unlike other Supreme Courts, this Court has been mandated by
our new Constitution to be a more active agent in annulling acts of grave abuse
of discretion committed by a branch of government or any of its officials.  This new role, however, will not compel the
Court, appropriately defined by Prof. A. Bickel as the least dangerous branch
of government, to assume imperial powers and run roughshod over the principle
of separation of power for that is judicial tyranny by any language.  But while respecting the essentials of the
principle of separation of power, the Court is not to be restricted by its
non-essentials.  Applied to the case at
bench, by voiding R.A. No. 7716 on the ground that its enactment violated the
procedure imposed by the Constitution in lawmaking, the Court is not by any
means wrecking the wall separating the powers between <span style="">the legislature and the judiciary.  For in so doing, the Court is not engaging in lawmaking which is </span>the
essence of legislative power.  But the
Court's Interposition of power should not be defeated by the conclusiveness of
the enrolled bill.  A resort to this <span style="">fiction will result in the enactment of laws
not properly deliberated upon and passed by Congress.  Certainly, the enrolled bill theory was not conceived to cover up
violations of the constitutional procedure in law making, a procedure intended
to assure the </span><span style="">passage </span><span style="">of good laws.  The conclusiveness of the enrolled bill can, therefore, be
disregarded for it is not necessary to preserve the principle of separation of
powers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In sum, I submit that in
imposing to this Court the </span><span style="">duty </span><span style="">to annul acts of government committed with
grave </span>abuse of discretion, the new Constitution transformed this Court
from passivity to activism.  This
transformation, dictated by our distinct experience as a <span style="">nation, </span>is <span style="">not </span>merely evolutionary but revolutionary.  <span style="">Under
the 1935 </span>and 1973 Constitutions, this Court approached constitutional
violations by initially determining what it cannot do; under the 1987
Constitution, there is a shift in stress - this Court is <span style="">mandated to </span>approach constitutional
violations not by finding out <span style="">what </span>it
should not do but what it must do.  The
Court <span style="">must </span>discharge this solemn
duty by not resuscitating <span style="">a </span>past
that petrifies the present.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">REGALADO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">It would seem like an inconceivable irony that Republic Act No.
7716 which, so respondents claim, was conceived by the collective wisdom of a
bicameral Congress and crafted with sedulous care by two branches of government
should now be embroiled in challenges to its validity for having been enacted
in disregard of mandatory prescriptions of the Constitution itself.  Indeed, such impugnment by petitioners goes
beyond merely the procedural flaws in the parturition <span style="">of </span>the law.  Creating and
regulating as it does definite rights to property, but with its own passage
having been violative of explicit provisions of the organic law, even without
going into the intrinsic merits of the provisions of Republic Act No. 7716 its
substantive invalidity is <i>pro facto </i>necessarily entailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">How it was legislated into its present statutory existence is not
in serious dispute and need not detain us except for a recital of some salient
and relevant facts.  The House of
Representatives passed House Bill No. 11197<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> on
third reading on November 17, 1993 and, the following day, it transmitted the
same to the Senate for concurrence.  On
its part, the Senate approved Senate Bill No. 1630 on second and third readings
on March 24, 1994.  It is important to
note in this regard that on March 22, 1994, said S.B. No. 1630 had been
certified by President Fidel V. Ramos for immediate enactment to meet a public
emergency, that is, a growing budgetary deficit.  <b><i>There was no such</i></b><i> <b>certification for H.B. No.
11197 although it was the initiating revenue</b></i><b><i><span style=""> bill.</span></i></b><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">It is, therefore, not only a curious fact but, more importantly,
an <b><i>invalid procedure </i></b>since that Presidential certification was
erroneously made for and confined to S.B. No. 1630 which was indisputably a tax
bill and, under the Constitution, could not validly originate in the
Senate.  Whatever is claimed in favor of
S.B. No. 1630 under the blessings of that certification, such as its alleged
exemption from the three separate readings requirement, is accordingly negated
and rendered inutile by the <b><i>inefficacious </i></b>nature of said
certification as it could lawfully have been issued only for a revenue measure
originating <b><i>exclusively </i></b>from the lower House.  To hold otherwise would be to validate a
Presidential certification of a bill initiated in the Senate despite the
Constitutional prohibition against its originating therefrom.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally of serious significance is the fact that S.B. No. 1630
was reported out in Committee Report No. 349 submitted to the Senate on
February 7, 1994 and approved by that body <b><i>"in substitution of S.B.
No. 1129," </i></b>while merely "taking into consideration P.S. No.
734 and H.B. No. 11197."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> S.B.
No. 1630, therefore, was never filed in substitution of either P.S. No. 734 or,
more emphatically, of H.B. No. 11197 as these two legislative issuances were
merely taken account of, at the most, as referential bases or materials.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is not a play on misdirection for, in the first instance,
the respondents assure us that H.B. No. 11197 was actually the sole source of
and started the whole legislative process which culminated in Republic Act No.
7716.  The participation of the Senate
in enacting S.B. No. 1630 was, it is claimed, justified as it was merely in
pursuance of its power to concur in or propose amendments to H.B. No.
11197.  Citing the 83-year old case of <i>Flint
vs. Stone Tracy Co.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><i> </i>it
is blithely announced that such power to amend includes an amendment by
substitution, that is; even to the extent of substituting the entire H.B. No.
11197 by an altogether completely new measure of Senate provenance.  Ergo, so the justification goes, the Senate
acted perfectly in accordance with its amending power under Section 24, Article
VI of the Constitution since it merely proposed amendments through a bill
allegedly prepared in advance.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is a mode of argumentation which, by reason of factual
inaccuracy and logical implausibility, both astounds and confounds.  For, it is of official record that S.B. No.
1630 was filed, certified and enacted in substitution of <b><i><span style="">S.B. No. 1129 </span></i></b>which in itself
was likewise in derogation of the Constitutional prohibition against such
initiation of a tax bill in the Senate.  In any event, S.B. No. 1630 was neither intended as a bill to be adopted
by the Senate nor to be referred to the bicameral conference committee as a
substitute for <b><i><span style="">H.B. No.
11197.  </span></i></b>These indelible
facts appearing in official documents cannot be erased by any amount of
strained convolutions or incredible pretensions that S.B. No. 1630 was
supposedly enacted in anticipation of H.B. No. 11197.</p>

<p class="BODY">On that score alone, the invocation by the Solicitor General of
the hoary concept of amendment by substitution falls flat on its face.  Worse, his concomitant citation of <i><span style="">Flint </span></i>to recover from that prone
position only succeeded in turning the same postulation over, this time
supinely flat on its back.  As elsewhere
noted by some colleagues, which I will just refer to briefly to avoid
duplication, respondents initially sought sanctuary in that doctrine supposedly
laid down in <i>Flint</i>, thus:  "It has, in fact, been held that the <b><i><span style="">substitution of an entirely new measure</span></i></b><b><span style=""> </span></b>for the one originally proposed
can be supported as a valid amendment."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis supplied.)  During the
interpellation by the writer at the oral argument held in these cases, the
attention of the Solicitor General was called to the fact that the amendment in
<i><span style="">Flint </span></i>consisted only of <span style="">a<i> single item,<b> </b></i></span>that is,
the substitution of a corporate tax for an <span style="">inheritance tax proposed in a general revenue bill; and that the text
of the decision therein nowhere contained the supposed doctrines he quoted and
ascribed to the court, as those were merely summations of arguments of counsel
therein.  It is indeed a source of
disappointment for us, but an admission of desperation on his part, that, instead
of making a clarification or a defense of his contention, the Solicitor General
merely reproduced all over again</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the same quotations as they appeared in his
original consolidated comment, without venturing any explanation or
justification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The aforestated dissemblance, thus unmasked, has further
undesirable implications on the contentions advanced by respondents in their
defense.  For, even indulging
respondents <i>ex gratia argumenti </i>in their pretension that S.B. No. 1630
substituted or replaced H.B. No. 11197, aside from muddling the issue of the
true origination of the disputed law, this would further enmesh respondents in
a hopeless contradiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a publication authorized by the Senate and from which the
Solicitor General has liberally quoted, it is reported as an accepted rule
therein that "(a)n amendment by substitution when approved takes the place
of the principal bill.  C.R. March 19,
1963, p. 943."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Stated elsewise, the principal bill is supplanted and goes out of
actuality.  Applied to the present
situation, and following respondents' submission that H.B. No. 11197 had been
substituted or replaced in its entirety, then in law it had no further
existence for purposes of the subsequent stages of legislation except,
possibly, for referential data.</p>

<p class="BODY">Now, the enrolled bill thereafter submitted to the President of
the Philippines, signed by the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the
House of Representatives, carried this solemn certification over the signatures
of the respective secretaries of both chambers:  "This Act which is a <b><i>consolidation of House Bill No.
11197 </i></b>and Senate Bill No. 1630 was finally passed by the House of
Representatives and the Senate on April 27, 1994, and May 2, 1994."
(Italics mine.)  In reliance thereon,
the Chief Executive signed the same into law as Republic Act No. 7716.</p>

<p class="BODY">The confusion to which the writer has already confessed is now
compounded by that official text of the aforequoted certification which speaks,
and this cannot be a mere <i>lapsus calami, </i>of two <b><i>independent </i></b>and
<b><i>existing </i></b>bills (one of them being H.B. No. 11197) which were
consolidated to produce the enrolled bill.  In parliamentary usage, to consolidate two bills, is to unite them into
one<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and which, in the case at <span style="">bar,
necessarily assumes that H.B. No. 11197 never became </span>legally
inexistent.  But did not the Solicitor
General, under the theory of amendment by substitution of the entire H.B. No.
11197 by S.B. No. 1630, thereby premise the same upon the replacement, hence
the total elimination from the legislative process, of H.B. 11197?</p>

<p class="BODY">It results, therefore, that to prove compliance with the
requirement for the <b><i>exclusive </i></b>origination of H.B. No. 11197, two
alternative but inconsistent theories had to be espoused and defended by
respondents' counsel.  To justify the
introduction and passage of <span style="">S.B. No. </span>1630
in the Senate, it was supposedly enacted only as an amendment by substitution,
hence on that theory <span style="">H.B. No. </span>11197
had to be considered as displaced and terminated from its role or
existence.  Yet, likewise for the same
purpose but this time on the theory of origination by consolidation, <span style="">H.B. </span>No. 11197 had to be resuscitated
so it could be united or merged with S.B. <span style="">No.
</span>1630.  This latter alternative
theory, unfortunately, also exacerbates the constitutional defect for then it
is an admission of a <b><i><span style="">dual </span></i></b>origination
of the two tax bills, each respectively initiated in and coming from the lower
and upper chambers of Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, it was also this writer who pointedly brought
this baffling situation to the attention of the Solicitor General during the
aforesaid oral argument, to the extent of reading aloud the certification in
full.  We had hoped thereby to be clarified
on these vital issue in respondents' projected memorandum, but we have not been
favored with an explanation unraveling this dilemma.  Verily, by passing <i><span style="">sub
silentio </span></i>on these intriguing submissions, respondents have wreaked
havoc on both logic and law just to gloss over their non-compliance with the
Constitutional mandate for exclusive origination of a revenue bill.  The procedure required therefor, we
emphatically add, can be satisfied only by complete and strict compliance since
this is laid down by the Constitution itself and not by a mere statute.</p>

<p class="BODY">This writer consequently agrees with the clearly tenable
proposition of petitioners that when the Senate passed and approved S.B. No.
1630, had it certified by the Chief Executive, and thereafter caused its
consideration by the bicameral conference committee in total substitution of
H.B. No. 11197, it clearly and deliberately violated the requirements of the
Constitution not only in the origination of the bill but in the very enactment
of Republic Act No. 7716.  Contrarily,
the shifting sands of inconsistency in the arguments adduced for respondents
betray such lack of intellectual rectitude as to give the impression of being
mere rhetorics in defense of the indefensible.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are told, however, that by our discoursing on the foregoing
issues we are intruding into non-justiciable areas long declared <i>verboten </i>by
such time-honored doctrines as those on political questions, the enrolled bill
theory and the respect due to two co-equal and coordinate branches of
Government, all derived from the separation of powers inherent in
republicanism.  We appreciate the
lectures, but we are not exactly unaware of the teachings in <i>U.S. vs. Pons,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><i>

the other, to know which would be applicable to the present controversy and
which should be rejected.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, first, a positional <i>exordium.  </i>The writer of this opinion would be among the first to
acknowledge and enjoin not only courtesy to, but respect for, the official acts
of the Executive and Legislative departments, but only so long as the same are
in accordance with or are defensible under the fundamental charter and the
statutory law.  He would readily be
numbered in the ranks of those who would preach a reasoned sermon on the
separation of powers, but with the qualification that the same are not
contained in tripartite compartments separated by impermeable membranes.  He also ascribes to the general validity of
American constitutional doctrines as a matter of historical and legal
necessity, but not to the extent of being oblivious to political changes or
unmindful of the fallacy of undue generalization arising from myopic disregard
of the factual setting of each particular case.</p>

<p class="BODY">These ruminations have likewise been articulated and dissected by
my colleagues, hence it is felt that the only issue which must be set aright in
this dissenting opinion is the so-called enrolled bill doctrine to which we are
urged to cling with reptilian tenacity.  It will be preliminarily noted that the official certification appearing
right on the face of Republic Act No. 7716 would even render unnecessary any
further judicial inquiry into the proceedings which transpired in the two
legislative chambers and, on a parody of tricameralism, in the bicameral
conference committee.  Moreover, we have
the excellent dissertations of some of my colleagues on these matters, but
respondents insist <i>en</i> <i>contra </i>that the congressional proceedings
cannot properly be inquired into by this Court.  Such objection confirms a suppressive pattern aimed at
sacrificing the rule of law to the fiat of expediency.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents thus emplaced on their battlements the pronouncement
of this Court in the aforecited case of <i>Philippine J</i><i><span style="">udges </span>Association vs. Prado.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>Their reliance thereon falls into the same error committed by their seeking
refuge in the <i>Flint </i>case, <i>ante. </i>which, as has earlier been
demonstrated (aside from the quotational misrepresentation), could not be on
par with the factual situation in the present case.  <i>Flint, </i>to repeat, involved a mere amendment on a single
legislative item, that is, substituting the proposal therein of an inheritance
tax by one on corporate tax.  Now, in
their submission based on <i>Philippine </i><i><span style="">Judges </span>Association, </i>respondents studiously avoid mention of
the fact that the questioned insertion referred likewise to <span style="">a </span>single item, that is, the repeal of
the franking privilege theretofore granted to the judiciary.  That both cases cannot be equated with those
at bar, considering the multitude of items challenged and the plethora of
constitutional violations involved, is too obvious to belabor.  Legal advocacy and judicial adjudication
must have a becoming sense of qualitative proportion, instead of lapsing into
the discredited and maligned practice of yielding blind adherence to
precedents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The writer unqualifiedly affirms his respect for valid official
acts of the two branches of government and eschews any unnecessary intrusion
into their operational management and internal affairs.  These, without doubt, are matters traditionally
protected by the republican principle of separation of powers.  Where, however, there is an overriding
necessity for judicial intervention in light of the pervasive magnitude of the
problems presented and the gravity of the constitutional violations alleged,
but this Court cannot perform is constitutional duty expressed in Section 1,
Article VIII of the Constitution unless it makes the inescapable inquiry, then
the confluence of such factors should compel an exception to the rule as an
ultimate recourse.  The cases now before
us present both the inevitable challenge and the inescapable exigency for
judicial review.  For the Court to now
shirk its bounden duty would not only project it as a citadel of the timorous
and the slothful, but could even undermine its <i><span style="">raison d'etre </span></i>as the highest and ultimate tribunal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this dissenting opinion has touched on events behind and
which transpired prior to the presentation of the enrolled bill for approval
into law.  The details of that law which
resulted from the legislative action followed by both houses of Congress, the
substantive validity of whose provisions and the procedural validity of which
legislative process are here challenged as unconstitutional, have been
graphically presented by petitioners and admirably explained in the respective
opinions of my brethren.  The writer
concurs in the conclusions drawn therefrom and rejects the contention that we
have unjustifiably breached the dike of the enrolled bill doctrine.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even in the land of its source, the so-called conclusive
presumption of validity originally attributed to that doctrine has long been
revisited and qualified, if not altogether rejected.  On the competency of judicial inquiry, it has been held that "(u)nder
the 'enrolled bill rule' by which an enrolled bill is sole expository of its
contents and conclusive evidence of its existence and valid enactment, it is
nevertheless competent for courts to inquire as to what prerequisites are fixed
by the Constitution of which journals of respective houses of Legislature are
required to furnish the evidence."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, in <i>Gwynn vs. Hardee, </i><i><span style="">etc., et </span>al.,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> the
Supreme Court of Florida declared:</p>

<blockquote>"(1)  While the
presumption is that the enrolled bill, as signed by the legislative officers
and filed with the secretary of state, is the bill as it passed, yet this
presumption is not conclusive, and when it is shown from the legislative
journals that a bill though engrossed and enrolled, and signed by the
legislative officers, contains provisions that have not passed both houses,
such provisions will be held spurious and not a part of the law.  As was said by Mr. Justice Cockrell in the
case of Wade vs. Atlantic Lumber Co., 51 Fla. 628, text 633, 41 So. 72, 73:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">`This Court is firmly committed to the holding that when the
journals speak they control, and against such proof the enrolled bill is not

which discouraged requiring the legislature to preserve its records and
anticipated considerable complex litigation if the court ruled of

An enrolled bill was a 'record' and, as such, was not subject to attack at

is one of the three branches of government, the courts, being coequal, must
indulge in every presumption that legislative acts are valid.  (3) When the rule was originally formulated,
record-keeping of the legislatures was so inadequate that a balancing of

efficacy.  (4) There were theories of

provisions.  (3) The rule is conducive
to fraud, forgery, corruption and other wrongdoings.  (4) Modern automatic and electronic record-keeping devices now

<blockquote>“[2] This court is not unmindful of the admonition of the doctrine

of the principle that has been followed will be more injurious than can
possibly result from a change. </p>

<blockquote>Certainly, <b><i>when </i></b><b><i><span style="">a </span>theory supporting a rule of law is
not grounded on facts, or upon sound logic, or is unjust, or has been
discredited by actual experience, it should be discarded</i>,</b> and with it
the rule it supports.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“[3]  It is clear to us that
the major premise of the Lafferty decision, the poor record-keeping of the
legislature, has disappeared.  <b><i>Modern
equipment and technology are the </i></b><b><i><span style="">rule </span></i></b><b><i><span style="">in </span>record-keeping
</i></b>by our General Assembly.  Tape
recorders, electric typewriters, duplicating machines, recording equipment,
printing presses, computers, electronic voting machines, and the like remove
all doubts and fears as to the ability of the General Assembly to keep accurate
and readily accessible records.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is also apparent that the 'convenience' rule is not
appropriate in today's modern and developing judicial philosophy.  The fact that the number and complexity of
lawsuits may increase is not persuasive if one is mindful that <i>the <b>overriding
purpose of our judicial system is to discover the truth and see that justice is
done</b></i><b>.  </b>The existence of
difficulties and complexities should not deter this pursuit and we reject any
doctrine or presumption that so provides.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lastly, we address the premise that the equality of the
various branches’ of government requires that we shut our eyes to constitutional
failings and other errors of our coparceners in government.  We simply do not agree.  Section 26 of the Kentucky Constitution
provides that any law contrary to the constitution is 'void.' <b><i>The proper
exercise of judicial authority requires us to recognize any law which is
unconstitutional and to declare it void</i>.  </b>Without belaboring the point, we believe that under section 228 of
the Kentucky Constitution it is our obligation to ‘support . . . the
Constitution of the commonwealth.’ We are sworn to see that violations of the
constitution – by any person, corporation, state agency or branch of government
– are brought to light and corrected.  <b><i>To
countenance an artificial rule of law that silences our voices when confronted
with violations of our constitution is not </i></b><b><i><span style="">acceptable </span>to this court</i>.</b></blockquote>

<blockquote>"We believe that a more reasonable rule is the one which
Professor Sutherland describes as the 'extrinsic evidence' rule.  x x x.  Under this approach there is a <i>prima facie</i> presumption that an
enrolled bill is valid, but <b><i>such presumption may be overcome by clear,
satisfactory and convincing evidence establishing that constitutional
requirements have not been met.</i></b></blockquote>

<blockquote>  <span style="">"We </span>therefore overrule <i>Lafferty v. Huffman</i> and all
other cases following the so-called enrolled bill doctrine, to the extent that
there is no longer a conclusive presumption that an enrolled bill is
valid.  x x x" (Emphases mine.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Undeniably, the value-added tax system may have its own merits to
commend its continued adoption, and the proposed widening of its base could
achieve laudable governmental objectives if properly formulated and
conscientiously implemented.  We would
like to believe, however, that ours is not only an enlightened democracy
nurtured by a policy of transparency but one where the edicts of the
fundamental law are sacrosanct for all, barring none.  While the realization of the lofty ends of this administration
should indeed be the devout wish of all, likewise barring none, it can never be
justified by methods which, even, if unintended, are suggestive of
Machiavellism.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, I vote to grant the instant petitions and to
invalidate Republic Act No. 7716 for having been enacted in violation of
Section 24, Article VI of the Constitution.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">ROMERO, <i>J.</i>:<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Few issues brought before this Court for resolution have roiled
the citizenry as much as the instant case brought by nine petitioners which
challenges the constitutionality of Republic Act No. 7716 (to be referred to herein
as the "Expanded Value Added Tax" or EVAT law to distinguish it from
Executive Order No. 273 which is the VAT law proper) that was enacted on May 5,
1994.  A visceral issue, it has
galvanized the populace into mass action and <span style="">strident protest even as the EVAT </span>proponents have taken to podia
and media <span style="">in a <u>post facto</u>
information campaign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is confronted here with an atypical case.  <span style="">Not
only is it a vatful </span>of seething controversy but some unlikely
petitioners invoke unorthodox remedies.  <span style="">Three </span>Senator-petitioners
would nullify a statute that bore the indispensable stamp of approval of their
own Chamber with two of them publicly repudiating <span style="">what they had earlier </span>endorsed.  With two former colleagues, one of them an erstwhile Senate President,
making common cause with them, they would stay the implementation <span style="">by the </span>Executive Department of a law
which <span style="">they themselves </span>have
initiated.  <span style="">They address a </span>prayer to a co-equal Department to probe their
official acts for any procedural irregularities they have themselves committed
lest the effects of these aberrations inflict such damage or irreparable loss
as would bring down the <span style="">wrath of the
people on their </span>heads.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the extent that they perceive that a vital cog in the internal
machinery of the Legislature has malfunctioned from having operated in blatant
violation of the enabling Rules they have themselves laid down, they would now
plead that this other Branch of Government step in, invoking the exercise of
what is at once a delicate and awesome power.  Undoubtedly, the case at bench is as much a test for the Legislature as
it is for the Judiciary.</p>

<p class="BODY">A backward glance on the Value Added Tax (VAT) is in order at
this point.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first codification of <span style="">the
country's internal revenue </span>laws was effected with the enactment of
Commonwealth Act No. 466, commonly known as the 'National Internal Revenue
Code' which was approved an June 15, <span style="">1939
</span>and took effect on July 1, 1939, although the provisions on the income
tax <span style="">were made retroactive </span>to
January 1, 1939.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Since <span style="">1939 </span>when
the turnover tax was replaced by the manufacturer's sales tax, the Tax Code had
provided for a single-stage value-added <span style="">tax
on original sales by manufacturers, producers and importers computed on the
'cost deduction method' and later, </span>on the basis of the 'tax credit
method.' The turnover tax was re-introduced <span style="">in </span>1985 by Presidential Decree No. 1991 (as amended by
Presidential Decree No. 2006)."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1986, a tax reform package was approved by the Aquino
Cabinet.  It contained twenty-nine
measures, one of which proposed the adoption of the VAT, as well as the
simplification of the sales tax structure and the abolition of the turnover
tax.</p>

<p class="BODY">“Up until 1987, the system of taxing goods consisted of (a) an
excise tax on certain selected articles (b) fixed and percentage taxes on
original and subsequent sales, on importations and on milled articles and (c)
mining taxes on mineral products.  Services were subjected to percentage taxes based mainly on gross
receipts.”<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 25, 1987, President Corazon C. Aquino signed into law
Executive Order No 273 which adopted the VAT.  From the former single-stage value-added tax, it introduced the
multi-stage VAT system where "the value-added tax is imposed on the sale
of and distribution process culminating in sale, to the final consumer.  Generally described, the taxpayer (the
seller) determines his tax liability by computing the tax on the gross selling
price or gross receipt ("output tax") and subtracting or crediting
the earlier VAT on the purchase or importation of goods or on the sale of
service ("input tax") against the tax due on his own sale."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 1, 1988, implementing rules and regulations for the
VAT were promulgated.  President Aquino
then issued Proclamation No. 219 on February 12, 1988 urging the public and
private sectors to join the nationwide consumers' education campaign for VAT.</p>

<p class="BODY">Soon after the implementation of Executive Order No. 273, its
constitutionality was assailed before this Court in the case of <i>Kapatiran ng
mga Naglilingkod sa Pamahalaan ng Pilipinas, Inc., et al. v. Tan.</i><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>The four petitioners sought to nullify the VAT law "for being
unconstitutional in that its enactment is not allegedly within the powers of
the President; that the VAT is oppressive, discriminatory, regressive, and
violates the due process and equal protection clauses and other provisions of
the 1987 Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> In
dismissing the consolidated petitions, this Court stated:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court, following the time-honored doctrine of separation
of powers cannot substitute its judgment for that of the President as to the
wisdom, justice and advisability of the VAT The Court can only look into and
determine whether or not Executive Order No. 273 was enacted and made effective
as law, in the manner required by and consistent with, the Constitution, and to
make sure that it was not issued in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack
or excess of jurisdiction; and, in this regard, the Court finds no reason to
impede its application or continued implementation."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-bottom: 15pt;">Although declared constitutional,
the VAT law was sought to be amended from 1992 on by a series of bills filed in
both Houses of Congress.  In
chronological <span style="">sequence these were:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the unedifying experience of the past where the
Court had the propensity to steer clear of questions. it perceived to be
"political" in nature, the present Constitution, in contrast, has
explicitly expanded judicial power to include the duty of the courts,
especially the Supreme Court, "to determine whether or not there has been
a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the
part of any branch or instrumentality of the Government."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
I submit that under this explicit mandate, the Court is empowered to rule upon
acts of other Government entities for the purpose of determining whether there
may have been, in fact, irregularities committed tantamount to violation of the
Constitution, which case would clearly constitute a grave abuse of discretion
on their part.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the words of the sponsor of the above-quoted Article of the
Constitution on the Judiciary, the former Chief Justice Roberto R. Concepcion,
"the judiciary is the final arbiter on the question of whether or not a
branch of government or any of its officials has acted without jurisdiction or
in excess of jurisdiction, or so capriciously as to constitute an abuse of
discretion amounting to excess of jurisdiction or lack of jurisdiction.  This is not only a judicial power but a duty
to pass judgment on matters of this nature.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the background of paragraph 2 of Section 1, which means
that the courts cannot hereafter exhibit its wonted reticence <span style="">by claiming that such matters </span>constitute
a political question<span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant petitions, this Court is called upon, not so much
to exercise its traditional power of judicial review as to determine whether or
not there has indeed been a grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
Legislature amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where there are grounds to resolve a case without touching on its
constitutionality, the Court will do so with utmost alacrity in due deference
to the doctrine of separation of powers anchored on the respect that must be
accorded to the other branches of government which are coordinate, coequal and,
as far as practicable, independent of one another.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once it is palpable that the constitutional issue is unavoidable,
then it is time to assume jurisdiction, provided that the following requisites
for a judicial inquiry are met:  that
there must be an actual and appropriate case; a personal and substantial
interest of the party raising the constitutional question; the constitutional
question must be raised at the earliest possible opportunity and the decision
of the constitutional question must be necessary to the determination of the
case itself; the same being the <i><span style="">lis
mota </span></i>of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having assured ourselves that the above-cited requisites are
present in the instant petitions, we proceed to take them up.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">ARTICLE VI, SECTION 24</p>

<p class="BODY">Some petitioners assail the constitutionality of Republic Act No.
7716 as being in violation of Article VI, Section 24 of the Constitution which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>“All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing
increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills,
shall originate exclusively in the House of Representatives, but the Senate may
propose or concur with amendments.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. Nos. 115455 and 115781, petitioners argue:</p>

<p class="BODY">(a)  The bill which became
Republic Act No. 7716 did not originate exclusively in the House of
Representatives.  The Senate, after
receiving H.B. No. 11197, submitted its own bill, S.B. No. 1630, and proceeded
to vote and approve the same after second and third readings.</p>

<p class="BODY">(b)  The Senate exceeded
its authority to "propose or concur with amendments" when it
submitted its own bill, S.B. No. 1630, recommending its approval "in
substitution of S.B. No. 1129, taking into consideration P.S. Res. No. 734 and
H.B. No. 11197."</p>

<p class="BODY">(c)  H. B. No. 11197 was
not deliberated upon by the Senate.  Neither was it voted upon by the Senate on second and third readings, as
what was voted upon was S.B. No 1630.</p>

<p class="BODY">Article VI, Section 24 is taken word for word from Article VI,
Section 18 of the 1935 Constitution which was, in turn, patterned after Article
I, Section 7 (1) of the Constitution of the United States, which states:</p>

<p class="BODY">“All bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House of
Representatives, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments as on
other bills."</p>

<p class="BODY">The historical precedent for requiring revenue bills to originate
in Congress is explained in the U.S. case of <i><span style="">Morgan v. Murray</span></i><span style="">:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<blockquote>"The constitutional requirement that all bills for raising
revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives stemmed from a remedial
outgrowth of the historic conflict between Parliament (i.e., Commons) and the
Crown, whose ability to dominate the monarchially appointive and hereditary
Lords was patent.  See 1 Story,
Constitution, S 875 et seq., 5th Ed.; 1 Cooley, Constitutional Limitations, pp.
267, 268, 8th Ed., 1 Sutherland, Statutory Construction, S 806, 3d Ed.  There was a measure of like justification
for the insertion of the provision of article I, S 7, cl. 1, of the Federal
Constitution.  At that time (1787) and
thereafter until the adoption (in 1913) of the Seventeenth Amendment providing
for the direct election of senators, the members of the United States Senate
were elected for each state by the joint vote of both houses of the Legislature
of the respective states, and hence, were removed from the people.  x x x"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The legislative authority under the 1935 Constitution being
unicameral, in the form of the National Assembly, it served no purpose to
include the subject provision in the draft submitted by the 1934 Constitutional
Convention to the Filipino people for ratification.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1940, however, the Constitution was amended to establish a
bicameral Congress of the Philippines composed of a House of Representatives
and a Senate. </p>

<p class="BODY">In the wake of the creation of a new legislative machinery, new
provisions were enacted regarding the law-making power of Congress.  The National Assembly explained how the
final formulation of the subject provision came about:</p>

<blockquote>"The concurrence of both houses would be necessary to the
enactment of a law.  However, all
appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing an increase of the
public debt, bills of local application, and private bills, <u>should originate
exclusively in the House of Representatives, although the Senate could propose
or concur with amendments</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>In one of the first drafts of the amendments, it was proposed to
give both houses equal powers in lawmaking.  There was, however, much opposition on the part of several members of
the Assembly.  In another draft, the
following provision, more restrictive than the present provision in the amendment,
was proposed and for sometime was seriously considered:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'All bills appropriating public funds, revenue or tariff bills,
bills of local application, and private bills shall originate exclusively in
the Assembly, but the Senate may propose or concur with amendments.  In case of disapproval by the Senate of any
such bills, the Assembly may repass the same by a two-thirds vote of all its
members, and thereupon, the bill so repassed shall be deemed enacted and may be
submitted to the President for corresponding action.  In the event that the Senate should fail to finally act on any
such bills, the Assembly may, after thirty days from the opening of the next
regular sessions of the same legislative term, reapprove the same with a vote
of two-thirds of all the members of the Assembly.  And upon such reapproval, the bill shall be deemed enacted and
may be submitted to the president for corresponding action.'</p>

<blockquote>However, the special committee voted finally to report the present
amending provision as it is now worded; and in that form it was approved by the
National Assembly with the approval of Resolution No. 38 and later of
Resolution No. 73.”<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)  </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus: the present Constitution is identically worded as its 1935
precursor. "All appropriation, revenue or tariff bills, bills authorizing
increase of the public debt, bills of local application, and private bills,
shall <u>originate </u><u><span style="">exclusively</span></u><span style=""> in the </span>House of Representatives, but
the Senate may propose or concur with amendments." (Underscoring supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">That all revenue bills, such as Republic Act No. 7716, should
"originate exclusively in the House of Representatives" logically
flows from the more representative and broadly-based character of this Chamber.</p>

<p class="BODY">“It is said that the House of Representatives being the more
popular branch of the legislature, being closer to the people, and having more
frequent contacts with them than the Senate, should have the privilege of
taking the initiative in the proposals of revenue and tax projects, the
disposal of the people's money, and the contracting of public indebtedness.</p>

<p class="BODY">These powers of initiative in the raising and spending of public
funds enable the House of Representatives not only to implement but even to
determine the fiscal policies of the government.  They place on its shoulders much of the responsibility of solving
the financial problems of the government, which are so closely related to the
economic life of the country, and of deciding on the proper distribution of
revenues for such uses as may best advance public interests.”<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The popular nature of the Lower House has been more pronounced
with the inclusion of Presidentially-appointed sectoral representatives, as
provided in Article VI, Section 5 (2), of the Constitution, thus:  "The party-list representatives shall
constitute twenty <i><span style="">per centum </span></i>of
the total number of representatives including those under the party list.  For three consecutive terms after the
ratification of this Constitution, <u>one-half of the seats allocated to party-
list representatives shall be filled, as provided by law, by selection or
election from the labor, peasant, urban poor, indigenous cultural communities,
women, youth, and such other sectors as may be provided by law, except the
religious sector</u>." (Underscoring supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">This novel provision which was implemented in the Batasang
Pambansa during the martial law regime<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> was
eventually incorporated in the present Constitution in order to give those from
the marginalized and often deprived sector, an opportunity to have their voices
heard in the halls of the Legislature, thus giving substance and meaning to the
concept of "people empowerment."</p>

<p class="BODY">That the Congressmen indeed have access to, and consult their
constituencies has been demonstrated often enough by the fact that even after a
House bill has been transmitted to the Senate for concurrence, some Congressmen
have been known to express their desire to change their earlier official
position or reverse themselves after having heard their constituents' adverse
reactions to their representations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In trying to determine whether the mandate of the Constitution
with regard <span style="">to </span>the initiation of
revenue bills has been preserved inviolate, we have recourse to the tried and
tested method of definition of terms.  The term "originate" is defined by Webster's New International
Dictionary (3rd Edition, 1986) as follows:  "<i>v.i.,</i> to come into being, begin; to start."</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the word "exclusively" is defined by
the same Webster's Dictionary as "in an exclusive manner; to the exclusion
of all others; only;  as, it is his,
exclusively." Black's Law Dictionary has this definition:  "apart from all others; only; solely,
substantially all or for the greater part.  To the exclusion of all others; without admission of others to
participation; in a manner to exclude.  Standard Oil Co. of Texas v. State, Tex Civ. App. 142 S. W. 2d 519, 521,
522, 523. "</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court had occasion to define the term "exclusive"
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“. . . In its usual and generally accepted sense, the term means
possessed to the exclusion of others; appertaining to the subject alone; not
including, admitting or pertaining to another or others; undivided, sole."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When this writer, during the oral argument of July 7, 1994, asked
the petitioner in G.R. No. 115455 whether he considers the word
"exclusively” to be synonymous with "solely," he replied in the
affirmative.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A careful examination of the legislative history traced earlier
in this decision shows that the original VAT law, Executive Order No. 273, was
sought to be amended by ten House bills which finally culminated in House Bill
No. 11197, as well as two Senate bills.  It is to be noted that the first House Bill No. 253 was filed on July
22, 1992, and two other House bills followed in quick succession on August 10
and September 9, 1992 before a Senate Resolution, namely, Senate Res. No. 734,
was filed on September 10, 1992 and much later, a Senate Bill proper, viz.,
Senate Bill No. 1129 on March 1, 1993.  Undoubtedly, therefore, these bills originated or had their start in the
House and before any Senate bill amending the VAT law was filed.  In point of time and venue, the conclusion
is ineluctable that Republic Act No. 7716, which is indisputably a revenue
measure, originated in the House of Representatives in the form of House Bill
No. 253, the first EVAT bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the content and substance of the ten amendatory
House Bills filed over the roughly one-year period from July 1992 to August
1993 reenforce the position that these revenue bills, pertaining as they do, to
Executive Order No. 273, the prevailing VAT law, originated in the Lower House.</p>

<p class="BODY">House Bill Nos. 253, 771, 2450, 7033, 8086, 9030, 9210, 9297,
10012 and 10100 were intended to restructure the VAT system by exempting or
imposing the tax on certain items or otherwise introducing reforms in the
mechanics of implementation.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a> Of
these, House Bill No. 9210 was favored with a Presidential certification on the
need for its immediate enactment to meet a public emergency.  Easily the most comprehensive, it noted that
the revenue performance of the VAT, being far from satisfactory since the
collections have always fallen short of projections, "the system is
rendered inefficient, inequitable and less comprehensive." Hence, the Bill
proposed several amendments designed to widen the tax base of the VAT and
enhance its administration.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">That House Bill No. 11197 being a revenue bill, originated from
the Lower House was acknowledged, in fact was virtually taken for granted, by
the Chairmen of the Committee on Ways and Means of both the House of
Representatives and the Senate.  Consequently, at the April 19, 1994 meeting of the Bicameral Conference
Committee, the Members agreed to make the House Bill as the "frame of
reference" or "base" of the discussions of the Bicameral Conference
Committee with the "amendments" or "insertions to emanate from
the Senate."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to whether the bills originated <u>exclusively</u> in the
Lower House is altogether a different matter.  Obviously, bills amendatory of VAT did not originate solely in the House
to the exclusion of all others for there were P.S. Res. No. 734 filed in the
Senate on September 10, 1992 followed by Senate Bill No. 1129 which was filed
on March 1, 1993.  About a year later,
this was substituted by Senate Bill No. 1630 that eventually became the EVAT
law, namely, Republic Act No. 7716.</p>

<p class="BODY">Adverting to the passage of the amendatory VAT bills in the Lower
House, it is to be noted that House Bill No. 11197 which substituted all the
prior bills introduced in said House complied with the required readings, that
is, the first reading consisting of the reading of the title and referral to
the appropriate Committee, approval on second reading on November 11, 1993 and
on third reading on November 17, 1993 before being finally transmitted to the
Senate.  In the Senate, its identity was
preserved and its provisions were taken into consideration when the Senate
Committee on Ways and Means submitted Com. Report No. 349 which recommended for
approval "S.B. No. 1630 in substitution of S.B. No. 1129, taking into
consideration P.S. Res. No. 734 and H B No 11197." At this stage, the
subject bill may be considered to have passed first reading in the Senate with
the submission of said Committee Report No. 349 by the Senate Committee on Ways
and Means to which it had been referred earlier.  What remained, therefore, was no longer House Bill No. 11197 but
Senate Bill No. 1630.  Thence, the
Senate, instead of transmitting the bill to the Lower House for its concurrence
and amendments, if any, took a "shortcut," bypassed the Lower House
and instead, approved Senate Bill No. 1630 on both second and third readings on
the same day, March 24, 1994.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first irregularity, that is, the failure to return Senate
Bill No. 1630 to the Lower House for its approval is fatal inasmuch as the
other chamber of legislature was not afforded the opportunity to deliberate and
make known its views.  It is no idle
dictum that no less than the Constitution ordains: "The legislative power
shall be vested in the Congress of the Philippines which shall consist of a <u>Senate
and a House of Representatives</u>. . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is to be pointed out too, that inasmuch as Senate Bill No.
1630 which had "taken into consideration" House Bill No. 11197 was
not returned to the Lower House for deliberation, the latter Chamber had no
opportunity at all to express its views thereon or to introduce any
amendment.  The customary practice is,
after the Senate has considered the Lower House Bill, it returns the same to
the House of origin with its amendments.  In the event that there may be any differences between the two, the same
shall then be referred to a Conference Committee composed of members from both
Chambers which shall then proceed to reconcile said differences.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the Senate transmitted to the Lower House on
March 24, 1994, a letter informing the latter that it had "passed S. No.
1630 entitled . . . (and) in view of the disagreeing provisions of said bill
and House Bill No. 11197, entitled . . . the Senate requests a conference . .
." This, in spite of the fact that Com. Report No. 349 of the Senate
Committee on Ways and Means had already recommended for approval on February 7,
1994 "S.B. No. 1630 . . . taking into consideration H.B. No. 11197."
Clearly, the Conference Committee could only have acted upon Senate Bill No.

<p class="BODY">Its legislative journey ended, Republic Act No. 7716 attained the
status of an enrolled bill which is defined as one "which has been duly
introduced, finally passed by both houses, signed by the proper officers of
each, approved by the governor (or president) and filed by the secretary of

in due form, the sanction of the legislative branch of the government, and that
it is delivered to him in obedience to the constitutional requirement that all
bills which pass Congress shall be presented to him.  And when a bill, thus attested, receives his approval, and is
deposited in the public archives, its authentication as a bill that has passed
Congress should be deemed complete and unimpeachable.  As the President has no authority to approve a bill not passed by
Congress, an enrolled Act in the custody of the Secretary of State, and having
the official attestations of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, of
the President of the Senate, and of the President of the United States,
carries, on its face, a solemn assurance by the legislative and executive
departments of the government, charged, respectively, with the duty of enacting
and executing the laws, that it was passed by Congress.  The respect due to coequal and independent
departments requires the judicial department to act upon that assurance, and to
accept, as having passed Congress, all bills authenticated in the manner
stated; leaving the courts to determine, when the question properly arises,
whether the Act, so authenticated, is in conformity with the
Constitution."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The enrolled bill assumes importance when there is some variance
between what actually transpired in the halls of Congress, as reflected in its
journals, and as shown in the text of the law as finally enacted.  But suppose the journals of either or both
Houses fail to<span style=""> </span>disclose that the
law was passed in accordance with what was certified to by their respective
presiding officers and the President.  Or that certain constitutional requirements regarding its passage were
not observed, as in the instant <span style="">case.  </span>Which shall prevail:  the journal or the enrolled bill?</p>

<p class="BODY">A word on the journal.</p>

<p class="BODY">"The journal is the official record of the acts of a
legislative body.  It should be a true
record of the proceedings arranged in chronological order.  It should be a record of <span style="">what </span>is done rather than what is
said.  The journal should be a clear,
concise, unembellished statement of all proposals made and all actions taken
complying with all requirements of constitutions, statutes, charters or rules
concerning what is to be recorded and how it is to be recorded.”<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article VI, Section 16 (4) of the Constitution ordains:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Each house shall keep a Journal of its proceedings, and
from time to time publish the same</u>, excepting such parts as may, in its
judgment, affect national security; and the <i>yeas</i> and <i>nays </i>on any
question shall, at the request of one-fifth of the Members present, be entered
in the Journal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Each House shall also keep a Record of its proceedings.”
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The rationale behind the above provision and of the "journal
entry rule" is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is apparent that the object of this provision is to make
the legislature show what it has done, leaving nothing whatever to
implication.  And, when the legislature
says what it has done, with regard to the<i> </i>passage of any bill, it
negatives the idea that it has done anything else in regard thereto.  Silence proves nothing where one is
commanded to speak. . . .  Our
constitution commands certain things to be done in regard to the passage of a
bill, and says that no bill shall become a law unless these things are
done.  It seems a travesty upon our
supreme law to say that it guaranties to the people the right to have their
laws made in this manner only, and that there is no way of enforcing this
right, or for the court to say that this is law when the constitution says it
is not law.  There is one safe course
which is in harmony with the constitution, and that is to adhere to the rule
that the legislature must show, as commanded by the constitution, that it has
done everything required by the constitution to be done in the serious and
important matter of making laws.  This
is the rule of evidence provided by the <span style="">constitution.  It is not presumptuous in the courts, nor
disrespectful to the legislature, to judge the acts of the legislature by its
own evidence.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Confronted with a discrepancy between the journal proceedings and
the law as duly enacted, courts have indulged in different theories.  The "enrolled bill" and
"journal entry" rules, being rooted deep in the Parliamentary
practices of England where there is no written constitution, and then transplanted
to the United States, it may be instructive to examine which rule prevails in
the latter country through which, by a process of legislative osmosis, we
adopted them in turn.</p>

<blockquote>"There seems to be three distinct and different rules as
applicable to the enrolled bill recognized by the various courts of this country.  The first of these rules appears to be that
the enrolled bill is the ultimate proof and exclusive and conclusive evidence
that the bill passed the legislature in accordance with the provisions of the
Constitution.  Such has been the holding
in California, Georgia, Kentucky, Texas, Washington, New Mexico, Mississippi,
Indiana, South Dakota, and may be some others.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The second of the rules seems to be that the enrolled bill is a
verity and resort cannot be had to the journals of the Legislature to show that
the constitutional mandates were not complied with by the Legislature, except
as to those provisions of the Constitution, compliance with which is expressly
required to be shown on the journal.  This rule has been adopted in South Carolina, Montana, Oklahoma, Utah,
Ohio, New Jersey, United States Supreme Court, and others.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The third of the rules seems to be that the enrolled bill raises
only a prima facie presumption that the mandatory provisions of the
Constitution have been complied with and that resort may be had to the journals
to refute that presumption, and if the constitutional provision is one,
compliance with which is expressly required by the Constitution to be shown on
the journals, then the mere silence of the journals to show a compliance therewith
will refute the presumption.  This rule
has been adopted in Illinois, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Tennessee, Arkansas,
Idaho, Minnesota, Nebraska, Arizona, Oregon, New Jersey, Colorado, and
others."<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">In the 1980 case of <i>D &amp; W Auto
Supply v. Department of Revenue, </i>the Supreme Court of Kentucky which had
subscribed in the past to the first of the three theories, made the
pronouncement that it had shifted its stand and would henceforth adopt the
third.  It justified its changed stance,
thus: </p>

<blockquote>"We believe that a more reasonable rule is the one which
Professor Sutherland describes as the 'extrinsic evidence' rule . . . . Under
this approach there is a <u>prima facie</u> presumption that an enrolled bill
is valid, but such presumption may be overcome by clear satisfactory and
convincing evidence establishing that constitutional requirements have not been
met."<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What rule, if any, has been adopted in this jurisdiction?</p>

February 28, 1914 which is what appears in the Journal, or on March 1, 1914
which was closer to the truth.  The
confusion was caused by the adjournment <i><span style="">sine die </span></i>at midnight of February 28, 1914 of the Philippine
Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">A close examination of the decision reveals that the Court did
not apply the “journal entry rule" vis-a-vis the "enrolled bill
rule" but the former as against what are "behind the legislative
journals."</p>

<blockquote>"Passing over the question of whether the printed Act (No.
2381), published by authority of law, is conclusive evidence as to the date
when it was passed, we will inquire whether the courts may go behind the
legislative journals for the purpose of determining the date of adjournment
when such journals are clear and explicit.”<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is to be noted from the above that the Court "passed
over" the probative value to be accorded to the enrolled bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">Opting for the journals, the Court proceeded to explain:</p>

<blockquote>"From their very nature and object, the records of the
Legislature are as important as those of the judiciary, and to inquire into the
veracity of the journals of the Philippine Legislature, when they are, as we
have said clear and explicit, would be to violate both the letter and the
spirit of the organic laws by which the Philippine Government was brought into
existence, to invade a coordinate and independent department of the Government,
and to interfere with the legitimate powers and functions of the Legislature.”<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Following the courts in the United States since the Constitution
of the Philippine Government is modeled after that of the Federal Government,
the Court did not hesitate to follow the courts in said country, i.e., to
consider the journals decisive of the <span style="">point
</span>at issue.  Thus:  "The journals say that the Legislature
adjourned at 12 midnight on February 28, 1914.  This settles the question and the court did not err in declining to go
behind these journals."<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court made a categorical stand for the “enrolled bill
rule" for the first time in the 1947 case of <i>Mabanag v.</i> <i>Lopez
Vito</i><a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
where it held that an enrolled bill imports absolute verity and is binding on
the courts.  This Court held itself
bound by an authenticated resolution, despite the fact that the vote of
three-fourths of the Members of the Congress (as required by the Constitution
to approve proposals for constitutional amendments) was not actually obtained
on account of the suspension of some members of the House of Representatives
and the Senate.  In this connection, the
Court invoked the "enrolled bill rule" in this wise:  "if a political question conclusively
binds the judges out of respect to the political departments, a duly certified
law or resolution also binds the judges under the 'enrolled bill rule' born of
that respect."<a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Mindful that the U.S. Supreme Court is on the side of those who
favor the rule and for no other reason than that it conforms to the expressed
policy of our law making body (i.e., Sec. 313 of the old Code of Civil
Procedure, as amended by Act No. 2210), the Court said that "duly
certified copies shall be conclusive proof of the provisions of such Acts and
of the due enactment thereof." Without pulling the legal underpinnings
from <i>U. S. v. Pons, </i>it justified its position by saying that if the
Court at the time looked into the journals, "in all probability, those
were the documents offered in evidence" and that "even if both the
journals and authenticated copy of the Act had been presented, the disposal of
the issue by the Court on the basis of the journals does not imply rejection of
the enrolled theory; for as already stated, the due enactment of a law may be
proved in either of the two ways specified in Section 313 of Act No. 190 as
amended."<a style="" href="#_ftn48" name="_ftnref48" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup></span></span></a>
Three Justices voiced their dissent from the majority decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the Court made its position plain in the 1963 case of <i>Casco
Philippine Chemical </i>Co., <i>Inc. v. Gimenez</i><a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>when a unanimous Court ruled that:  "The enrolled bill is conclusive upon the courts <u>as regards the
tenor of the measure passed by Congress and approved by the President</u>.  If there has been any mistake in the
printing of a bill before it was certified by the officers of Congress and
approved by the Executive, the remedy is by amendment or curative legislation
not by judicial decree." According to Webster's New 20th Century
Dictionary, 2nd ed., 1983, the word "tenor" means, among others,
"the general drift of something spoken or written; intent, purport,
substance."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Court upheld the respondent Auditor General's
interpretation that Republic Act No. 2609 really exempted from the margin fee
on foreign exchange transactions <i>"urea formaldehyde" </i>as found
in the law and not <i>"urea and formaldehyde" </i>which petitioner insisted
were the words contained in the bill and were so intended by Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1969, the Court similarly placed the weight of its authority
behind the conclusiveness of the enrolled bill.  In denying the motion for reconsideration, the Court ruled in <i>Morales
v. Subido </i>that "the enrolled Act in the office of the legislative
secretary of the President of the Philippines shows that Section 10 is exactly
as it is in the statute as officially published in slip form by the Bureau of
Printing.  x x x Expressed elsewise,
this is a matter worthy of the attention not of an Oliver Wendell Holmes but of
a Sherlock Holmes."<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a> The
alleged omission of a phrase in the final Act was made, not at any stage of the
legislative proceedings, but only in the course of the engrossment of the bill,
more specifically in the proofreading thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the Court did include a caveat that qualified the
absoluteness of the “enrolled bill" rule stating:</p>

<blockquote>"By what we have essayed above we are not of course to be
understood as holding that in all cases the journals must yield to the enrolled
bill.  To be sure there are certain
matters which the Constitution (Art. VI, secs. 10 [<span style="">4], </span>20 [1], and 21 [1]) expressly requires must be entered on the
journal of each house.  To what extent
the validity of a legislative act may be affected by a failure to have such
matters entered on the journal, is a question which we do not now decide (Cf.
e.g., Wilkes Country Comm'rs. v. Coler, 180 U.S. 506 [1900]).  All we hold is that with respect to matters
not expressly required to be entered on the journal, the enrolled bill prevails
in the event of any discrepancy.” <a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">More recently, in the 1993 case of <i><span style="">Philippine Judges Association v. Prado,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""> </span></i>this Court, in <span style="">ruling on </span>the unconstitutionality of
Section 35 of Republic Act No. 7354 withdrawing the franking privilege from the
entire hierarchy of courts, did not so much adhere to the enrolled bill rule
alone as to both "enrolled bill and legislative journals." Through
Mr. Justice Isagani A. Cruz, we stated:  "Both the enrolled bill and the legislative journals certify that
the measure was duly enacted, i.e., in accordance with Article VI, Sec. 26 (2)
of the Constitution.  We are bound by
such official assurances from a coordinate department of the government, to
which we owe, at the very least, a becoming courtesy."</p>

<p class="BODY">Aware of the shifting sands on which the validity and continuing
relevance of the "enrolled bill" theory rests, I have taken pains to
trace the history of its applicability in this jurisdiction, as influenced in
varying degrees by different Federal rulings.</p>

<p class="BODY">As applied to the instant petition, the issue posed is whether or
not the procedural irregularities that attended the passage of House Bill No.
11197 and Senate Bill No. 1630, outside of the reading and printing
requirements which were exempted by the Presidential certification, may no
longer be impugned, having been "saved" by the conclusiveness on us
of the enrolled bill.  I see no cogent
reason why we cannot continue to place reliance on the enrolled bill, but only
with respect to matters pertaining to the procedure followed in the enactment
of bills in Congress and their subsequent engrossment, printing errors,
omission of words and phrases and similar relatively minor matters relating
more to form and factual issues which do not materially alter the essence and
substance of the law itself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, “courts cannot claim greater ability to judge
procedural legitimacy, since constitutional rules on legislative procedure are
easily mastered.  Procedural disputes
are over facts - whether or not the bill had enough votes, or three readings,
or whatever - not over the meaning of the constitution.  Legislators, as eyewitnesses, are in a
better position than a court to rule on the facts.  The argument is also made that legislatures would be offended if
courts examined legislative procedure.<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Such a rationale, however, cannot conceivably apply to

altering the same beyond recognition even <span style="">by

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><u>Legislative
Procedure</u>, Robert Luce gives a graphic description of the milieu and the
circumstances which have conspired to transform an initially innocuous
mechanism designed to facilitate legislative action into an all-powerful
Frankenstein that brooks no challenge to its authority even from its own
members.</p>

<blockquote>"Their power lies chiefly in the fact that reports of
conference committees must be <span style="">accepted </span>without
amendment or else rejected <u>in toto</u>.  The impulse is to get done with the matters and so the motion to accept
has undue advantage, for some members are sure to prefer swallowing unpalatable
provisions rather than prolong controversy.  This is the more likely if the report comes in the rush of business
toward the end of a session, when to seek further conference might result in
the loss of the measure altogether.  At
any time in the session there is some risk of such a result following the rejection
of a conference report, for it may not be possible to secure a second
conference, or delay may give opposition to the main proposal chance to develop
more strength.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bench, petitioners insist that the Conference
Committee to which Senate Bill No. 1630 and House Bill No. 11197 were referred
for the purpose of harmonizing their differences, overreached themselves in not
confining their “reconciliation" function to those areas of disagreement
in the two bills but actually making "surreptitious insertions" <span style="">and deletions which amounted to a grave </span>abuse
of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it becomes imperative to focus on the errant
provisions which found their way into Republic Act No. 7716.  Below is a breakdown to facilitate
understanding the grounds for petitioners' objections:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">INSERTIONS MADE BY BICAMERAL CONFERENCE COMMITTEE (BICAM)
TO SENATE BILL (SB) NO. 1630 AND HOUSE BILL (HB) NO. 11197</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">1.  Sec. 99 of the National Internal Revenue Code (NIRC)</p>

<p class="BODY">(1)  Under the HB, this
section includes any person who, in the course of trade or business, sells,
barters or exchanges goods OR PROPERTIES and any person who LEASES PERSONAL
PROPERTIES.</p>

<p class="BODY">(2)  The SB completely
changed the said section and defined a number of words and phrases.  Also, Section 99-A was added which included
one who sells, exchanges, barters PROPERTIES and one who imports PROPERTIES.</p>

<p class="BODY">(3)  The BICAM version
makes LESSORS of goods OR PROPERTIES and importers of goods LIABLE to VAT
(subject of petition in G.R. No. 115754). </p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">2.  Section 100 (VAT on Sale of Goods)</p>

<p class="BODY">The term "goods" or "properties" includes the
following, which were not found in either the HB or the SB:</p>

<blockquote>-  In addition to radio and television time;
SATTELITE TRANSMISSION AND CABLE TELEVISION TIME.</blockquote>

<blockquote>-  The term "Other similar properties” was
deleted, which was present in the HB and the SB</blockquote>

<blockquote>-  Real properties held primarily for sale to customers
or held for lease in the ordinary course or business were included, which was
neither in the HB nor the SB (subject of petition in G.R. No. 115754).</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">3.  Section 102</p>

<p class="BODY">On what are included in the term "sale or exchange of
services," as to make them subject to VAT, the BICAM included/inserted the
following (not found in either House or Senate Bills):</p>

<blockquote>1.  Services of lessors of property, whether
personal or real (subject of petition in G.R. No. 115754);</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Warehousing services;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3. <span style=""> </span>Keepers of resthouses, pension houses, inns,
resorts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  Common carriers by land,
air and sea;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.  Services of franchise grantees of telephone
and telegraph;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.  Radio and television
broadcasting;</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.  All other franchise grantees except those
under Section 117 of this Code (subject of petition in G.R. No. 115852);</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.  Services of surety, fidelity, indemnity, and
bonding companies;</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.  Also inserted by the BICAM (on page 8
thereof) is the lease or use of or the right to use of satellite transmission
and cable television time.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">4.  Section 103 (Exempt Transactions)</p>

<p class="BODY">The BICAM deleted subsection (f) in its entirety, despite its
inclusion in both the House and Senate Bills.  Therefore, under Republic Act No. 7716, the "printing, publication,
importation or sale of books and any newspaper, magazine, review, or bulletin
which appears at regular intervals with fixed prices for subscription and sale <span style="">and </span>which is not devoted principally to
the publication of advertisements" is subject to VAT (subject of petition
in G.R. No. 115931 and G.R. No. 115544).</p>

<p class="BODY">The HB and SB did not touch Subsection (g) but it was amended by
the BICAM by changing the word TEN to FIVE.  Thus, importation of vessels with tonnage of more than five thousand
tons is VAT exempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">  Subsection L, which was
identical in the HB and the SB that stated that medical, dental, hospital and
veterinary services were exempted from the VAT was amended by the BICAM <span style="">by </span>adding the qualifying phrase:  EXCEPT THOSE RENDERED BY PROFESSIONALS, thus
subjecting doctors, dentists and veterinarians to the VAT. </p>

<p class="BODY">Subsection U which exempts from VAT "transactions which are
exempt under special laws," was amended by the BICAM by adding the
phrase:  EXCEPT THOSE GRANTED UNDER PD
Nos. 66, 529, 972, 1491, AND 1590, AND NON-ELECTRIC COOPERATIVES UNDER RA 6938
(subject of petition in G.R. No. 115873), not found in either the HB or the SB,
resulting in the inclusion of all cooperatives to the VAT, except non-electric
cooperatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sale of real properties was included in the exempt
transactions under the House Bill, but the BICAM qualified this with the
provision:</p>

<blockquote>"(S) SALE OF REAL PROPERTIES NOT PRIMARILY HELD FOR SALE TO
CUSTOMERS OR HELD FOR LEASE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF TRADE OR BUSINESS OR REAL
PROPERTY UTILIZED FOR LOW-COST AND SOCIALIZED HOUSING AS DEFINED <span style="">BY </span>RA NO. 7279 OTHERWISE KNOWN AS THE
URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND HOUSING ACT OF 1992 AND OTHER RELATED LAWS." <span style="">(subject of petition in </span>G.R. No.
115754)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The BICAM also exempted the sale of properties, the receipts of
which are not less than P480,000.00 or more than P720,000.00.  Under the SB, no amount was given, but in
the HB it was stated that receipts from the sale of properties not less than
P350,000.00 nor more than P600,000.00 were exempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">It did not include, as VAT exempt, the sale or transfer of
securities, as defined in the Revised Securities Act (BP 178) which was
contained in both Senate and House Bills.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">5.  Section 104</p>

<p class="BODY">Not included in the HB or the SB is the phrase "INCLUDING
PACKAGING MATERIALS" which was inserted by the BICAM in Section 104 (A)
(1) (B), thus excluding from creditable input tax packaging materials and the
phrase "ON WHICH A VALUE-ADDED TAX HAS BEEN ACTUALLY PAID” in Section 104
(A) (2).</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">6.  Section 107</p>

<p class="BODY">Both House and Senate Bills provide for the payment of P500.00 VAT
registration fee but this was increased by BICAM to P1,000.00.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">7.  Section 112</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding a person whose sales or receipts are exempt under
Section 103 (w), the BICAM inserted the phrase:  "THREE PERCENT UPON THE EFFECTIVITY OF THIS ACT AND FOUR
PERCENT (4%) TWO YEARS THEREAFTER," although the SB and the HB provide
only "three percent of his gross quarterly sales."</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">8.  Section 115</p>

<p class="BODY">The BICAM adopted the HB version which subjects common carriers
by land, air or water for the transport of passengers to 3% of their gross
quarterly sales, which is not found in the SB.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">9.  Section 117</p>

<p class="BODY">The BICAM amended this section by subjecting franchises on
electric, gas and water utilities to a tax of two percent (2%) on gross
receipts derived x x x, although neither the HB nor the SB has a similar
provision.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">10.  Section 17 (d)</p>

<p class="BODY">(a)  The BICAM defers for
only 2 years the VAT on services of actors and actresses although the SB defers
it for 3 years.</p>

<p class="BODY">(b) The BICAM uses the word "EXCLUDE" in the section on
deferment of VAT collection on certain goods and <span style="">services.  </span>The HB does not
contain any counterpart provision and SB only allows deferment for no longer
than 3 years.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">11. Section 18 <span style="font-weight: normal;">on the Tax Administration Development Fund is an
entirely new provision not contained in the House/Senate Bills.  This fund is supposed to ensure effective
implementation of Republic Act No. 7716.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align: justify;">12.  Section 19</p>

<p class="BODY">No period within which to promulgate the implementing rules and
regulations is found in the HB or the SB but BICAM provided “within 90 days"
which found its way in Republic Act No. 7716.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even a cursory perusal of the above outline will convince one
that, indeed, the Bicameral Conference Committee (henceforth to be referred to
as <span style="">BICAM) </span>exceeded the power and
authority granted in the Rules of its creation.  Both Senate and House Rules limit the task of the Conference
Committee in almost identical language to the settlement of differences in the
provisions or amendments to any bill or joint resolution.  <span style="">If </span>it
means anything at all, it is that there are provisions in subject bill, to
start with, which differ and, therefore, need reconciliation.  Nowhere in the Rules is it authorized to
initiate or propose completely new matter.  Although under certain rules on legislative procedure, like those in <u>Jefferson's
Manual</u>, a conference committee may introduce <u>germane</u> matters in a
particular bill, such matters should be circumscribed by the committee's sole
authority and function to reconcile differences.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, in the Senate and in the House, a matter is
"germane" to a particular bill if there is a common tie between said
matter and the provisions which tend to promote the object and purpose of the
bill it seeks to amend.  If it
introduces a new subject matter not within the purview of the bill, then it is
not "germane" to the bill.<a style="" href="#_ftn65" name="_ftnref65" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[65]</sup></span></span></a> The
test is whether or not the change represented an amendment or extension of the
basic purpose of the original, or the introduction of an entirely new and
different subject matter.<a style="" href="#_ftn66" name="_ftnref66" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[66]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the BICAM, however, the germane subject matter must be within
the ambit of the disagreement between the two Houses.  If the "germane" subject is not covered by the
disagreement but it is reflected in the final version of the bill as reported
by the Conference Committee or, if what appears to be a "germane"
matter in the sense that it is "relevant or closely allied"<a style="" href="#_ftn67" name="_ftnref67" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[67]</sup></span></span></a>
with the purpose of the bill, was not the subject of a disagreement between the
Senate and the House, it should be deemed an extraneous matter or even a
"rider" which should never be considered legally passed for not
having undergone the three-day reading requirement.  Insertion of new matter on the part of the BICAM is, therefore,
an <i><span style="">ultra vires </span></i><span style="">act<i> </i></span>which makes the same void.</p>

<p class="BODY">The determination of what is "germane" and what is not
may appear to be a difficult task but the Congress, having been confronted with
the problem before, resolved it in accordance with the rules.  In that case, the Congress approved a
Conference Committee's insertion of new provisions that were not contemplated
in any of the provisions in question between the Houses simply because of the
provision in <u>Jefferson's Manual</u> that conferees may report matters
"which are <u>germane modifications of subjects in disagreement</u>
between the Houses and the committee.<a style="" href="#_ftn68" name="_ftnref68" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[68]</sup></span></span></a> In
other words, the matter was germane to the points of disagreement between the
House and the Senate.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards <u>inserted amendments</u> in the BICAM, therefore,
the task of determining what is germane to a bill is simplified, thus:  If the amendments are not circumscribed by
the subjects of disagreement between the two Houses, then they are <u>not
germane</u> to the purpose of the bill.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case before us, the insertions and deletions made
do not merely spell an effort at settling conflicting provisions but have
materially altered the bill, thus giving rise to the instant petitions on the
part of those who were caught unawares by the legislative legerdemain that took
place.  Going by the definition of the
word "amendment" in Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., 1979, which
means "to change or modify for the better; to alter by modification,
deletion, or addition," said insertions and deletions constitute
amendments.  Consequently, these
violated Article VI, Section 26 (2) which provides <i><span style="">inter alia</span></i><span style="">:<i> </i></span>"Upon
the last reading of a bill, no amendment thereto shall be allowed . . ."
This proscription is intended to subject all bills and their amendments to
intensive deliberation by the legislators and the ample ventilation of issues
to afford the public an opportunity to express their opinions or objections <span style="">issues </span>to afford the public an
opportunity to express their opinions or objections thereon.  The same rationale underlies the
three-reading requirement to the end that no surprises may be sprung on an
unsuspecting citizenry.</p>

<p class="BODY">Provisions of the "now you see it, now you don't"
variety, meaning those which were either in the House and/or Senate versions
but simply disappeared or were "bracketed out" of existence in the
BICAM Report, were eventually incorporated in Republic Act No. 7716.  Worse, some goods, properties or services
which were not covered by the two versions and, therefore, were never intended
to be so covered, suddenly found their way into the same Report.  No advance notice of such insertions
prepared the rest of the legislators, much less the public who could be
adversely affected, so that they could be given the opportunity to express
their views thereon.  Well has the final
BICAM report been described, therefore, as an instance of "taxation
without representation."</p>

<p class="BODY">That the conferees or delegates in the BICAM representing the two
Chambers could not possibly be charged with bad faith or sinister motives or,
at the very least, unseemly behavior, is of no moment.  The stark fact is that items not previously
subjected to the VAT now fell under its coverage without interested sectors or
parties having been afforded the opportunity to be heard thereon.  This is not to say that the Conference
Committee Report should have undergone the three readings required in Article
VI, Section 26 (2), for this clearly refers only to bills which, after having
been initially filed in either House, negotiated the labyrinthine passage
therein until its approval.  The
composition of the BICAM including as it usually does, the Chairman of the
appropriate Committee, the sponsor of the bill and other interested <span style="">members ensures an </span>informed discussion,
at least with respect to the disagreeing provisions.  The same does not obtain as regards completely new matter which
suddenly spring on the legislative horizon.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been pointed out that such extraneous matters
notwithstanding, all Congressmen and Senators were given the opportunity to
approve or turn down the Committee Report <i>in toto, </i>thus
"curing" whatever defect or irregularity it bore.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier in this opinion, I explained that the source of the
acknowledged power of this <i>ad hoc</i> committee stems from the precise fact
that, the meetings, being scheduled "take it or leave it" basis.  It has not been uncommon for legislators
who, for one reason or another have been frustrated in their attempt to pass a
pet bill in their own chamber, to work for its passage in the BICAM where it
may enjoy a more hospitable reception and faster approval.  In the instant case, had there been full,
open and unfettered discussion on the bills during the Committee sessions,
there would not have been as much vociferous objections on this score.  Unfortunately, however, the Committee held
two of the five sessions behind closed doors, <i>sans </i>stenographers,
record-takers and interested observers.  To that extent, the proceedings were shrouded in mystery and the
public's right to information on matters of public concern as enshrined in
Article Ill, Section 7<a style="" href="#_ftn69" name="_ftnref69" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[69]</sup></span></span></a> and
the government's policy of transparency in transactions involving public
interest in Article II, Section 28 of the Constitution<a style="" href="#_ftn70" name="_ftnref70" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[70]</sup></span></span></a>
are undermined.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, that which is <i>void</i> <i>ab initio </i>such as the
objectionable provisions in the Conference Committee Report, cannot be
"cured" or ratified.  For all
intents and purposes, these never existed.  <i>Quae ab initio non valent, ex post facto convalescere non
possunt.  </i>Things that are invalid
from the beginning are not made valid by a subsequent act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Should this argument be unacceptable, the "enrolled
bill" doctrine, in turn, is invoked to support the proposition that the
certification by the presiding officers of Congress, together with the
signature of the President, bars further judicial inquiry into the validity of
the law.  I reiterate my submission that
the "enrolled bill ruling" may be applicable but only with respect to
questions pertaining to the procedural enactment, engrossment, printing, the
insertion or deletion of a word or phrase here and there, but would draw a
dividing line with respect to substantial substantive changes, such as those
introduced by the BICAM herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have before us then the spectacle of a body created by the two
Houses of Congress for the very limited purpose of settling disagreements in
provisions between bills emanating therefrom, exercising the plenary
legislative powers of the parent chambers but holding itself exempt from the
mandatory constitutional requirements that are the hallmarks of legislation
under the aegis of a democratic political system.  From the initial filing, through the three readings which entail
detailed debates and discussions in Committee and plenary sessions, and on to
the transmittal to the other House in a repetition of the entire process to
ensure exhaustive deliberations - all these have been skipped over.  In the proverbial twinkling of an eye,
provisions that probably may not have seen the light of day had they but run
their full course through the legislative mill, sprang into existence and
emerged full-blown laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">Yet our Constitution vests the legislative power in "the
Congress of the Philippines which shall consist of a Senate and a House of
Representatives. . . ."<a style="" href="#_ftn71" name="_ftnref71" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[71]</sup></span></span></a> and
not in any special, standing or super committee of its own creation, no matter
that these have been described, accurately enough, as "the eye, the ear,
the hand, and very often the brain of the house."</p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, that usage or custom has sanctioned this abbreviated, if
questionable, procedure does not warrant its being legitimized and perpetuated
any longer.  <i>Consuetudo, contra
rationem introducta, potius usurpatio quam consuetudo appellari debet.  </i>A custom against reason is rather an
usurpation.  In the hierarchy of sources
of legislative procedure, constitutional rules, statutory provisions and
adopted rules (as for example, the Senate and House Rules), rank highest,
certainly much ahead of customs and usages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, is this Court to assume the role of passive spectator
or indulgent third party, timorous about exercising its power or more importantly,
performing its duty, of making a judicial determination on the issue of whether
there has been grave abuse of discretion by the other branches or
instrumentalities of government, where the same is properly invoked?  The time is past when the Court was not
loathe to raise the bogeyman of the political question to avert a head-on
collision with either the Executive or Legislative Departments.  Even the separation of powers doctrine was
burnished to a bright sheen as often as it was invoked to keep the judiciary
within bounds.  No longer does this
condition obtain.  Article VIII, Section
2 of the Constitution partly quoted in this paragraph has broadened the scope
of judicial inquiry.  This Court can now
safely fulfill its mandate of delimiting the powers <span style="">o</span>f co-equal departments like the Congress, its officers or its
committees which may have no compunctions about exercising legislative powers
in full.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, dare we close our eyes to the presumptuous assumption by
a runaway committee of its progenitor’s legislative powers in derogation of the
rights of the people, in the process, subverting the democratic principles we
all are sworn to uphold, when a proper case is made out for our
intervention?  The answers to the above
queries are self-evident.</p>

<p class="BODY">I <span style="">call </span>to mind this
exhortation:  "We are sworn to see
that violations of the constitution - by any person corporation, state agency
or branch of government - are brought to light and corrected.  To countenance an artificial rule of law
that silences our voices when confronted with violations of our Constitution is
not acceptable to this Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn72" name="_ftnref72" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[72]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">I am not unaware that a rather recent decision of ours brushed
aside an argument that a provision in subject law regarding the withdrawal of
the franking privilege from the petitioners and this Court itself, not having
been included in the original version of Senate Bill No. 720 or of House Bill
No. 4200 but only in the Conference Committee Report, was violative of Article
VI, Section 26 (2) of the Constitution.  Likewise, that said Section 35, never having been a subject of
disagreement between both Houses, could not have been validly added as an
amendment before the Conference Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The majority opinion in said case explained:</p>

<p class="BODY">"While it is true that a conference committee is the
mechanism for compromising differences between the Senate and the House, it is
not limited in its jurisdiction to this question.  Its broader function is described thus:</p>

<blockquote>‘A conference committee may deal generally with the subject matter
or it may be limited to resolving the precise differences between the two
houses.  Even where the conference
committee is not by rule limited in its jurisdiction, <u>legislative custom
severely limits the freedom with which new subject matter can be inserted into
the conference bill</u>.  <span style="">But occasionally a conference committee
produces unexpected results, results beyond its mandate.  These excursions occur even where the rules
impose strict limitations on conference committee jurisdiction.  This is symptomatic of the authoritarian
power of conference committee (Davies, Legislative Law and Process:  In a Nutshell, 1986 Ed., p. </span>81).’"<a style="" href="#_ftn73" name="_ftnref73" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[73]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the risk of being repetitious, I wish to point out that the
general rule, as quoted above, is:  "Even where the conference committee is not by rule limited in its
jurisdiction, <u>leqislative custom severely limits the freedom with which new
subject matter can be inserted into the conference bill</u>." What
follows, that is, "occasionally a conference committee produces unexpected
results, results beyond its mandate. . ." is the exception.  Then it concludes with a declaration that:
"This is symptomatic of the authoritarian power of conference
committee." Are we about to reinstall another institution that smacks of
authoritarianism which, after our past experience, has become anathema to the
Filipino people?</p>

<p class="BODY">The ruling above can hardly be cited in support of the
proposition that a provision in a BICAM report which was not the subject of
differences between the House and Senate versions of a bill cannot be
nullified.  It submit that such is not
authorized in our Basic Law.  Moreover,
this decision concerns merely one provision whereas the BICAM Report that
culminated in the EVAT law has a wider scope as it, in fact, expanded the base
of the original VAT law by imposing the tax on several items which were not so
covered prior to the EVAT.</p>

<p class="BODY">One other flaw in most BICAM Reports, not excluding this one
under scrutiny, is that, hastily drawn up, it often fails to conform to the
Senate and House Rules requiring no less than a "detailed" and
"sufficiently explicit statement of the changes in or amendments to the
subject measure." The Report of the committee, as may be gleaned from the
preceding pages, was no more than the final version of the bill as
"passed" by the BICAM.  The
amendments or subjects of dissension, as well as the reconciliation made by the
committee, are not even pointed out, much less explained therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be argued that legislative rules<span style=""> </span>of procedure may properly be suspended, modified, revoked or
waived at will by the legislators themselves.<a style="" href="#_ftn74" name="_ftnref74" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[74]</sup></span></span></a> This
principle, however, does not come into play in interpreting what the record of
the proceedings shows was, or was not, done.  It is rather designed to test the validity of legislative action where
the record shows a final action in violation or disregard of legislative rules.<a style="" href="#_ftn75" name="_ftnref75" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[75]</sup></span></span></a>
Utilizing the Senate and the House Rules as both guidelines and yardstick, the
BICAM here obviously did not adhere to the rule on what the Report should
contain.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given all these irregularities that have apparently been
engrafted into the BICAM system, and which have been tolerated, if not accorded
outright acceptance by everyone involved in or conversant with, the
institution, it may be asked:  Why not
leave well enough alone?</p>

<p class="BODY">That these practices have remained unchallenged in the past does
not justify our closing our eyes and turning a deaf ear to them.  Writ large is the spectacle of a mechanism
ensconced in the very heart of the people's legislative halls, that now stands
indicted with the charge of arrogating legislative powers unto itself through
the use of dubious "shortcuts." Here, for the people to judge, is the
"mother of all shortcuts."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the petitions at bench, we are confronted with the enactment
of a tax law which was designed to broaden the tax base.  It is rote learning for any law student that
as an attribute of sovereignty, the power to tax is "the strongest of all
the powers of government."<a style="" href="#_ftn76" name="_ftnref76" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[76]</sup></span></span></a>
Admittedly, "for all its plenitude, the power to tax is not
unconfined.  There are
restrictions."<a style="" href="#_ftn77" name="_ftnref77" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[77]</sup></span></span></a> Were
there none, then the oft-quoted 1803 dictum of Chief Justice Marshall that

would be a truism.  Happily, we can
concur with, and the people can find comfort in, the reassuring words of Mr.
Justice Holmes:<span style="">  </span>"The power to tax is not the
power to destroy <u>while this Court sits</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn79" name="_ftnref79" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[79]</sup></span></span></a></p>

nararapat, kanais-nais o magagampanan; kung kaya’t hindi kami nararapat na
maghatol o magpapasiya sa mga bagay na iyan.  Ang makapapataw ng angkop na Iunas sa larangan na iyan ay ang mismong

<p class="BODY">Faced with this challenge of protecting the rights of the people
by striking down a law that I submit is unconstitutional and in the process,
checking the wonted excesses of the Bicameral Conference Committee system, I
see in this case a suitable vehicle to discharge the Court's Constitutional
mandate and duty of declaring that there has indeed been a grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of the
Legislature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Republic Act No. 7716, being unconstitutional and void, I find no
necessity to rule on the substantive issues as dealt with in the majority
opinion as they have been rendered <b>moot </b>and <b>academic.</b>  These issues pertain to the intrinsic merits
of the law.  It is axiomatic that the
wisdom, desirability and advisability of enacting certain laws lie, not within
the province of the Judiciary but that of the political departments, the
Executive and the Legislative.  The
relief sought by petitioners from what they perceive to be the harsh and
onerous effect of the EVAT on the people is within their reach.  For Congress, of which Senator-petitioners
are a part, can furnish the solution by either repealing or amending the
subject law.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the foregoing reasons, I VOTE to GRANT the petition.</p>

of Commissioner Eulogio Lerum:  "At
a time when we did not have a lawmaking body after martial law was declared,
there were tripartite conferences called by the President for the purpose of
acting as a recommendatory body regarding settlement of labor and management
disputes.  During the said conferences,
labor had shown that it can act with maturity.  As a result, in 1976, an amendment was introduced in the Constitution
providing for sectoral representation.  In the Constitution that was approved, the number of sectors was not
indicated.  However, in the Election
Code of 1978, it provided for three sectors; namely, industrial labor,
agricultural labor and the youth.  The
agricultural labor was given four seats; two for Luzon, one for the Visayas and
one for Mindanao.  The same is true with
the industrial labor sector.  As far as
the youth are concerned, they were also given four seats:  two for Luzon, one for Mindanao and one for
the Visayas, with the condition that there will be an additional two at
large.  And so, the youth had six
representatives plus four from the agricultural labor sector and four from the
industrial labor sector - we had 14 seats.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 13.05pt; text-indent: 22.95pt;">In 1981, the
Constitution was again amended.  In the
course of the amendment, the labor representatives in the Batasang Pambansa
proposed that sectoral representation be included as a permanent addition to
the lawmaking body.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 13.05pt; text-indent: 22.95pt;">Again, in
that Constitution which was approved in 1981, the number and the name of the
sectors were not indicated.  However, in
the Election Code that was approved before the 1984 election, there was really
a definition of who will constitute the sectors and how they will be appointed.  Let me quote from that law that was passed
in 1984.  Under Section 27 of Batas
Pambansa <span style="">Blg. </span>881, the scope of
the sectors has been defined as follows:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-right: 26.1pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The
agricultural labor sector covers all persons who personally and physically till
the land as their principal occupation.  It includes agricultural tenants and lessees, rural workers and farm
employees, owner-cultivators, settlers and small fishermen.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-right: 26.1pt; text-indent: 0.5in;">The industrial
labor sector includes all nonagricultural workers and employees.</p>

Excerpts from the April 19, 1994 meeting of the Bicameral Conference
Committee:  "CHAIRMAN Javier.  First of all, what would be the basis, no,
or framework para huwag naman mawala yung personality namin dito sa bicameral,
no, because the bill originates from the House because this is a revenue bill,
so we would just want to ask, <u>we make the House Bill as the frame of
reference</u>, and then everything will just be inserted?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: 0.25in;">"HON.
MACEDA.  Yes, That's true for every
revenue measure.  There's no other
way.  <u>The House Bill has got to be
the base</u>.  Of course, for the
record, we know that this is an administration bill; this is certified by the
president and I was about to put into the records as I am saying now that your
problem about the impact on prices on the people was already decided when the
President and the administration sent this to us and certified it.  They have already gotten over that political
implication of this bill and the economic impact on prices.</p>

pp. 45-46:</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 130.5pt; text-indent: -112.5pt;">"Justice Romero:  Q:  Mr. Counsel, is it not a fact that in
the Bicameral Conference Committee, you presented a Motion to return the Bill
as it was to the Lower House with also your proposal that this be referred to a
Referendum for the entire nation to vote upon, then Senator Wigberto Tañada
amended your Motion and convinced you to drop that portion about referral to a
Referendum and you agreed.  </p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 130.5pt; text-indent: 0in;">So,
that Motion of yours to return to the House was the one voted upon by the
Bicameral Conference Committee and it lost.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 130.5pt; text-indent: 0in;">What
can you say to that?</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 130.5pt; text-indent: -112.5pt;">Senator Tolentino:  A:  No, no, if Your Honor please.  My Motion was voted upon by the Senate
itself because I presented that said Motion in order to recall the Bill from
the Bicameral Conference Committee so that the Senate could go back to the
period of amendment and see if we could amend the House Bill itself, but that
was defeated.  So, it became
academic.  Thus, what we did we
proceeded with the procedure already being followed by the Senate.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 130.5pt; text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">I thought, as a matter of fact, that was the
one way of correcting this procedural error, but I was only one (1), or two
(2), or three (3) of us only, then we were defeated in the voting, if Your
Honor please.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 130.5pt; text-indent: -112.5pt;"><span style="">Justice Romero:  Q:  <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You mean you were outvoted?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Your Honor; we were actually slaughtered in the voting, so to speak, if Your
Honor please.”</span></p>

ln Osmeña. Jr.<i> v.</i> Pendatun (109 Phil. 863 [1960]), the Court held that
parliamentary rules are merely procedural and they may be waived or disregarded
by the legislative body.  Hence, mere
failure to conform to parliamentary usage will not invalidate the action taken
by a deliberative body when the requisite number of members have agreed to a
particular measure.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE <span style="">O</span>P<span style="">INION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VITUG, <i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">Lest we be lost by a quagmire <span style="">of </span>trifles, the real threshold and prejudicial issue, to my
mind, is whether or not this Court is ready to assume and to take upon itself
with an overriding authority the awesome responsibility of overseeing the
entire bureaucracy.  Far from it, ours
is merely to construe and to apply the law regardless of its wisdom and
salutariness, and to strike it down only when it clearly disregards
constitutional proscriptions.  It is
what the fundamental law mandates, and it is what the Court must do.</p>

<p class="BODY">I cannot yet concede to the novel theory, so challengingly
provocative as it might be, that under the 1987 Constitution the Court may now
at good liberty intrude, in the guise of <span style="">the
</span>people's imprimatur, into every affair of government.  What significance can still then remain, I
ask, of the time honored and widely acclaimed principle of separation of
powers, if at every turn the Court allows itself to pass upon, at will, the
disposition of a co-equal, independent and coordinate branch in our system of
government.  I dread to think of the so
varied uncertainties that such an <span style="">undue
</span>interference can lead to.  The
respect for long standing doctrines in our jurisprudence, nourished through
time, is one of maturity not timidity, of stability rather than quiescence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has never occurred to me, and neither do I believe it has been
intended, that judicial tyranny is envisioned, let alone institutionalized, by
our people in the 1987 Constitution.  The test of tyranny is not solely on how it is wielded but on how, in
the first place, it can be capable of being exercised.  It is time that any such perception of
judicial omnipotence is <span style="">corrected.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Against all that has been said, I see, in actuality in these
cases at bench, neither a constitutional infringement of substance, judging
from precedents already laid down by this Court in previous cases, nor a
justiciability even now of the issues raised, more than an attempt to sadly
highlight the perceived shortcomings in the procedural enactment of laws, a
matter which is internal to Congress and an area that is best left to its own
basic concern.  The fact of the matter
is that the legislative enactment, in its final form, has received the ultimate
approval of both houses of Congress.  The finest rhetoric, indeed fashionable in the early part of this
closing century, would still be a poor substitute for tangibility.  I join, nonetheless, some of my colleagues
in respectfully inviting the kind attention of the honorable members of our
Congress in the suggested circumspect observance of their own rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">A final remark.  I should
like to make it clear that this opinion does not necessarily foreclose the
right, peculiar to any taxpayer adversely affected, to pursue at the proper
time, in appropriate proceedings, and in proper <u>fora</u>, the specific remedies
prescribed therefor by the National Internal Revenue Code, Republic Act 1125,
and other laws, as well as rules of procedure, such as may be pertinent.  Some petitions filed with this Court are, in
essence, although styled differently, in the nature of declaratory relief over
which this Court is bereft of original jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">All considered, I, therefore, join my colleagues who are voting
for the dismissal of the petitions.</p>
