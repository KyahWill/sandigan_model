				<H3>THE CONSOLIDATED BANK AND TRUST CORPORATION (SOLIDBANK), PETITIONER, VS. HON. INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT, PHILIPPINE KNITTING MILLS, INC., SPOUSES LUIS CHENG, SPOUSES TOMAS CHENG, SPOUSES CARLOS CRUZ & CHENG KIEM HUEN CRUZ, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner is questioning the resolution of the respondent
court dated <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1986</st1:date>,
setting aside a decision promulgated by one of its divisions after the death of
the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> was the late Justice
Simeon M. <span class="SpellE">Gopengco</span>, who passed away on <st1:date year="1985" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision was signed by him, with Justices
<span class="SpellE">Lino</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Patajo</span>, Jose F. <span class="SpellE">Racela</span>, Jr., and Fidel P. <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
concurring.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first page of the
decision indicated that it had been promulgated on <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1985</st1:date>, the day before Justice <span class="SpellE">Gopengco's</span> death.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, the other records of the respondent court show otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> that the decision
was actually promulgated on <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="7">July 23,
 1985</st1:date>, three days after the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente's</u></span><u>
</u>death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The log book in his office
carried an entry, that the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span> was
delivered to the office of the Division Clerk of Court only on that date.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It was promulgated on that same date by the said official in accordance with
the internal rules of the respondent court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This fact was affirmed by her in a certification reading <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-indent: 0.3in;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">CERTIFICATION<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>This is to certify that the Office of the undersigned Division
Clerk of Court received on July 23, 1985 from the Office of the late Justice
SIMEON <span style="">M. </span>GOPENGCO the original

Spouses Carlos C. Cruz, et al. and Philippine Knitting Mills, Inc., et al. v.
Hon. Antonio Martinez, etc., et al. and that said copies of decision addressed
to the parties and/or counsel, were sent to the Mailing Section of this Court
on July 23, 1985 at 3:40 p.m., as appearing in our book.</blockquote>

<blockquote>This certification is issued upon the request of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nardo</span> M. de Guzman, Sr.</blockquote>

<blockquote><st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1985</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Division Clerk of
Court</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The promulgation was made in accordance with Article V. Section
E, Rules of Internal Operating Procedures of the respondent court, reading <span style="">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote>E. Promulgation of Decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>– The promulgation of judgments or resolutions, including resolutions of
motions, shall be the direct responsibility of the division clerk of
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The promulgation must be done not
later than the next working day after a decision or resolution shall have been
signed and filed by all the Justices concerned.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The date of promulgation must be annotated on the first page of the
decision or resolution and signed or initialed by the division clerk.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the same date that the decision or resolution shall be promulgated,
notice of the same shall be prepared and sent to the Mailing Section for
immediate service on the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
notice and the copy of the decision or resolution must be contained in a sealed
envelope before being sent to the Mailing <span style="">Section
for service on the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After </span>service
on all the parties have been done, the original copy of the decision or
resolution shall be filed with the Reporter's Division.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>rollo</u></span>
shall remain with the Office of the Division Clerk while the record of the case
shall be sent to the records custodian (Archives Section) until remanded to the
court of origin, archived, or forwarded to the Supreme Court in the proper
cases.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There is evidence showing that the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span>
was sent by the office of Justice <span class="SpellE">Gopengco</span> to the
office of Justice <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> on <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1985</st1:date>, and was returned by the latter on <st1:date year="1985" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1985</st1:date>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It cannot be determined exactly when Justice <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>
signed the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span> during the period when it
was in his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dates when
Justices <span class="SpellE">Patajo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Racela</span>
affixed their signatures to the decision are not shown either.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is definite is that when the decision was actually
promulgated on <st1:date year="1985" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1985</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> was already deceased.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the questioned resolution, the same division of the respondent
court declared the decision void because it had been tardily promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reference was made to <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>
v. Cruz,<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>The judge who wrote the questioned decision has died.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot now be promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It is well-settled that, to be binding,
a judgment must be duly signed and promulgated during the incumbency of the
judge whose signature appears thereon." (People v. So, <span style="">July 30, 1957, No. L-8732, citing <span class="SpellE">Lino</span> Luna v. Rodriguez, 37 Phil. 186; <span class="SpellE">Garchitorena</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Crescini</span>, 37 Phil. 675; <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span>
v. The Commission on Elections, 45 Off. <span class="SpellE">Gaz</span>. 4457;
People v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. L-9111-91113).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, petitioner's case has to be
declared by another judge.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is noteworthy that the resolution was signed by Justices <span class="SpellE">Racela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span>, who were <span style="">in </span>the original division, and Justice <st1:city><st1:place>Carolina</st1:place></st1:city>
<span class="SpellE">Griño-Aquino</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that the cited decisions involved single
courts only and do not apply to collegiate courts where decisions are made not
by one judge alone but by a majority or all of the members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even with Justice <span class="SpellE">Gopengco's</span>
death, the decision still had the support of the three other members, who
constituted the rest of the division.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span> was after all not the
decision of the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> alone but of the
entire division.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that in single courts like the regional trial
courts and the municipal trial courts, <span style="">a </span>decision may no longer be promulgated
after the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> <span style="">has</span> vacated his office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The question is whether this rule is also
applicable to collegiate courts, as in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has deliberated on this question and finds there is no
reason why <span style="">a </span>different rule
should be adopted for collegiate courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">A decision becomes binding only after it is validly promulgated
and not before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said only recently
in <span class="SpellE">In</span> re <span class="SpellE">Emiliano</span> <span class="SpellE">Jurado</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
"a decision or resolution of the Court becomes such, for all legal intents
and purposes, only from the moment of its promulgation." According to
Chief Justice Moran in the landmark case of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>:<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>Accordingly, one who is no longer a member of this Court at the
time <span style="">a </span>decision is signed and
promulgated, cannot validly take part in that decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As above indicated, the true decision of the
Court is the decision signed by the Justices and duly promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before that decision is so signed and
promulgated, there is no decision of the Court to speak of.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vote cast by <span style="">a </span>member of the Court after deliberation is always understood to
be subject to confirmation at the time he has to sign the decision that is to
be promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That vote is of no value
if it is not thus confirmed by the Justice casting it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
purpose of this practice is apparent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Members of this Court, even after they have cast their votes, wish to
preserve their freedom of action till the last moment when they have to sign
the decision, so that they may take full advantage of what they may believe to
be the best fruit of their most </span>mature reflection and deliberation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In consonance with this practice, before <span style="">a </span>decision
is signed and promulgated, all <span style="">opinions
and conclusions stated during and after the deliberation of the Court, remain
in the breasts of the Justices, binding upon no </span>one, not even upon the
Justice themselves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, they may
serve for determining what the opinion of the majority provisionally is and for
designating <span style="">a </span>member to prepare
the decision of the Court, but in no way is that decision binding unless and
until duly signed and promulgated.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We add that at any time before promulgation, the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ponencia</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>may be changed by the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ponente</span></u></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
if any member of the court who may have already signed it so desires, he may
still withdraw his concurrence and register a qualification or dissent as long
as the decision has not yet been promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A promulgation signifies that on the date it was made the judge or
judges who signed the decision continued to support it.</p>

<p class="BODY">If at the time of the promulgation, a judge or <span style="">a </span>member of
a collegiate court has already vacated his office, his vote is automatically
withdrawn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was what happened in the
<span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> case, where Justice Gregorio Perfecto's
signature on the original decision was disregarded when he died before it could
be promulgated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision remained
valid, however, because it was still supported by a majority of the Supreme Court
then, and, no less importantly, Justice Perfecto was not the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ponente</span></u></span><span style="">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ponente</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>in a collegiate court should remain <span style="">a </span>member
thereof at the time his <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">ponencia</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>is
promulgated because, at any time before that, he has the privilege of changing
his opinion for the consideration of his colleagues.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a rule, his recommendations are accepted
in recognition of the special study he is supposed to have made of the case
after his designation as its <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is important that he be incumbent at the
time the decision is promulgated, in the event he may want to make last-minute
changes therein with the approval of the other members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, he cannot exercise this privilege
if he is no longer in office.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is on this justification that, as <span style="">a </span>matter of practice (and of
courtesy), this Court defers promulgation of <span style="">a </span>decision written by a member on
official leave until his return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
author is afforded an opportunity to suggest to the rest of the Court any
change he may want to make in his <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span><u> </u>before
it is officially pronounced.</p>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above rules, we hold that the questioned <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span> died with the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>
and consequently could not be promulgated thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="">,<span style=""> </span></span>the
petition is <span style="">DENIED, </span>with costs
against the petitioner.</p>
