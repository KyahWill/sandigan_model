Motion for Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1952" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1952</st1:date>,
the government granted the <span class="SpellE">Bislig</span> Bay Lumber Company,
Inc. (now petitioner PICOP) Timber License Agreement (TLA) No. 43 covering
parcels of forest lands in <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The license
was amended on <st1:date year="1953" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1953</st1:date>
(TLA No. 43-1) and on <st1:date year="1959" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1959</st1:date>
(TLA No. 43-2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears that sometime
in 1960, the Bureau of Forestry headed by <span class="SpellE">Artemio</span> <span class="SpellE">Genio</span> established on the ground the boundary line (known as
"<span class="SpellE">Genio</span>" line) of <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span>
concession area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1963, this line was <span class="SpellE">monumented</span> on the ground by the Land Classification (LC)
Party No. 18 headed by Forester <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Kiocho</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1969</st1:date>, the western boundary
of <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> timber license agreement was amended in
order to conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the western boundary line
established by the Bureau of Forestry as surveyed and <span class="SpellE">monumented</span>
on the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The last amendment was
reflected under <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> TLA No. 43-3.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the request of the Board of Investments, then President
Marcos issued on <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="7">July 29, 1969</st1:date>
a warranty establishing the boundaries of <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> TLA
as described under TLA No. 43, as amended (Annex "E" of Petition, p.
57, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">For its part, respondent <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Mahogany
Products, Incorporated (DMPI) acquired Ordinary Timber License (OTL) No. 2456,
dated <st1:date year="1955" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1955</st1:date> from its
original grantee, <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span> <span class="SpellE">Repaso</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The license was renewed 1960 under OTL No.
1122-60 and subsequently under OTL No. 499-51267.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In 1967, the concession area of DMPI was
consolidated with those of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> Mahogany Producers
Company, Inc., the <span class="SpellE">Umayan</span> Timber Company and the
Sanchez Logging Company under OTL No. 175-’71, in the name of DMPI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="17" month="9">September
 17, 1984</st1:date>, OTL No. 175-’71 was converted to TLA No. 17 (p. 34, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">), </span>covering a public forest area of

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> and <span class="SpellE">DMPI's</span>
concession areas are adjacent up to each, other, with the eastern boundary of
DMPI being common with the western boundary of PICOP.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="12">December
 2, 1983</st1:date>, PICOP complained to the Bureau of Forest Development
against an alleged encroachment by DMPI into the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
concession area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It alleged that its
western boundary is the line established by Forester <span class="SpellE">Genio</span>
and affirmed by LC Party No. 18.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
western boundary of PICOP was allegedly recognized by DMPI in a letter dated <st1:date year="1975" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1975</st1:date> addressed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">PICOP.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>DMPI </span>disputed <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> allegations
claiming that its common boundary with PICOP is the line described under its
OTL No. 1122-’60 and <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> TLA No. 43-1 and not the
latter's TLA No. 43-3.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision rendered on <st1:date year="1985" day="4" month="11">November
 4, 1985</st1:date>, the Ministry of Natural Resources (Ministry), through then
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Secretary
Rodolfo <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario, found that <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span>
TLA </span>No. 43-3 amended the western boundary of <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span>
concession area to conform with the (BFFR) "<span class="SpellE">Genio</span>"
line.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Ministry found this amendment
to be erroneous because it deprived its adjoining concession holder, the DMPI
of an <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">area </span>to which it <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>entitled, without the latter
having been afforded an opportunity to contest the change.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Ministry ruled that the change was
contrary to the standards of due process and existing policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Ministry likewise ruled that DMPI <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was</span> not precluded from questioning the technical description of
the western boundary under <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">TLA No. 43-3 </span>despite <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the </span><span class="SpellE">former's</span>

boundary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

not that described under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">TLA No. </span>43-3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision also ordered the correction and
amendment of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">TLA No. </span>43-3 of
PICOP so as to exclude the area contested from <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span>
license and to include the same area as part of <span class="SpellE">DMPI's</span>
concession.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the
Ministry's decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">PICOP appealed the Ministry's decision to the Office of the President
assigning four (4) errors; 1) the Ministry's finding that there exists a
boundary dispute; 2) the Ministry's failure to uphold the Presidential warranty
on the boundary of PICOP; 3) the Ministry's failure to rule that DMPI was <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> to question its common boundary with PICOP; and 4)
the Ministry's finding that TLA No. 17 was issued subject to the outcome of the
case (p. 36, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

the Office of the President, through then Deputy Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Fulgencio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Factoran</span>, Jr.,
dismissed the appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> Motion for Reconsideration was denied on <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1987</st1:date> by then Deputy

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant <span class="GramE">petition with a prayer for a
temporary restraining order</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 24, 1987, We issued a temporary restraining order
enjoining respondents from enforcing the decision dated November 4, 1985 in MNR
Case No. 6429 (p. 82, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of PICOP that respondent Deputy Executive Secretary
gravely abused his discretion in affirming the findings of then Secretary <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario that the true and correct boundary lines between
the concession areas of PICOP and DMPI are the lines embodied in the technical
descriptions of TLA 43-1 of PICOP and OTL No. 1122-60 of DMPI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also assails the order for the correction
of its TLA No. 43-3 so as to exclude <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the
area contested by DMPI which area shall be included in the concession of DMPI
to form part of the latter's TLA No. 17.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is not meritorious.</p>

the questioned decisions and resolution.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As pointed out by public respondents, the true and correct
boundaries of PICOP and DMPI are the lines embodied in the technical
descriptions of <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> TLA No. 43-1 and not those
embodied in TLA 43-3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The adjustment
contained in TLA 43-3 moved <span class="SpellE">PICOP's</span> boundary 2,160
meters further west of its original boundary into <span class="SpellE">DMPI's</span>
eastern boundary resulting in the diminution of <span class="SpellE">DMPI's</span>
concession area to about 2,058 hectares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This act was <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">accomplished

concession could not have referred to TLA No. 43-3 because the total area
warranted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> referred only to 121,587
hectares of permanent forest lands and 21,580 hectares of alienable and
disposable lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This area <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>the
original area covered by TLA 43, 43-1 and 43-2, and not the area covered under

(p. 6, Decision of the Minister of Natural Resources, p. 29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not correct, as <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">PICOP

filing with the Bureau of Forest Development a complaint against DMPI for
encroachment and illegal </span>logging activities is not entirely
correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is noted, as held by
respondent Executive Secretary, that <span class="SpellE">DMPI's</span> license
before its concession was consolidated with that of three (3) other

those of three (3) others, the government issued OTL No. 175-71 in the name of
DMPI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">DMPI's</span>
OTL No 175-71 was set to expire on <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="9">September

Secretary, "<span class="SpellE">DMPI's</span> timber license did not
terminate upon the expiration of OTL 1122-'60.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">It’s</span> license subsisted until TLA No. 17 was
executed" (p. 36, <span class="SpellE"><u style="text-underline:words">Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This effect is recognized under the

expired and was terminated on <st1:date year="1983" day="30" month="9">September
