<p class="2Q">'Upon proper representation with the Board of Trustees of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> State College, the brother of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>
was allowed to sit during the meeting to clarify points on the side of his
sister, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>,
who was dropped from the service by virtue of Board Resolution No. 4, s. 1976
and who appealed for reconsideration of the decision of the Board of Trustees.</p>

<p class="2Q">Making use of the series of communications and other pertinent
papers he had with him, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> presented point
by point why his sister should not have been dropped from the service <span style="">as Dean of Graduate Studies of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> State College.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">The Chairman answered Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> point
by point and after the lengthy discussion on all sides of the case the Chairman
suggested to bring back to the attention of the Civil Service Commission the
matter inasmuch as it is distinctly governed by its rules which in character
are self-acting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further stated that
if on the other hand the decision made earlier by the Board in Resolution No.
18, s. 1976 is illegal then there is no recourse but for it to be a court
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it is certain, the Chairman
explained, that the Board acted on the basis of the records provided.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it is alleged that there is any record
that shows there was an approval of such extension of leave or detail, it is
rather too late.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may be pointed out that
a recommendation for approval cannot be construed as synonymous with approval.</p>

<p class="2Q">The Chairman asked the Officer-in-Charge of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
State College about the present status of the position of Dean of Graduate
Studies, and the Officer in Charge reported that by virtue of Board Resolution
No. 19, s. 1976, Dr. Norma <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span> was appointed <span style="">to the position vice Dr. <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Chairman thereafter emphasized that the Board cannot rescind its Resolution and
that it sustains its position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, the party concerned will rise to protest since her appoint­ment
has already been effected.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Finally, the Chairman promised Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>
that he will see Chairman Clave and Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Melo</span>
about the matter and advised Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> that he may
pursue his legal thought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> thanked the Board of Trustees for allowing him the

<p class="BODY">The trial court has observed:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Actually, the case hinges on the single issue of whether or not
the petitioner is deemed to have abandoned her position by continuing to work
for the National Manpower and Youth Council after <st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1976</st1:date>, when her one-year leave of absence
expired." We agree and on this issue alone we have to reverse the decision
of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Section 33, Rule XVI of
the Civil Service Rules provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 33.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under no circumstances shall leave without pay
<span class="GramE">be</span> granted for more than one year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If an employee who is on leave without pay
for any reason fails to return to duty at the expiration of one year from the
effective date of such leave, he shall be considered automatically separated
from the service; Provided, that he shall, within a reasonable time before the
expiration of his one year leave of absence without pay, be notified in writing
of the expiration thereof and with a warning that if he fails to report for
duty on said date, he will be dropped from the service."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The one-year leave of absence without pay of <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> expired on <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="1">January 31, 1976</st1:date>, and there is no question that she did
not return to her position within a reasonable time thereafter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that on January 5, 1976 (or 27 days before her
one-year leave expired) she requested an extension of her leave of absence
without pay for another year, but Regional Director Pedro <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span>
took no action thereon and instead said:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Miss INOCENCIA ELEFAÑO, Dean, Graduate Studies, of that school
should have been advised to return to duty on or before February 1, 1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attention is invited to Section 33, Rule XVI
of the Civil Service Law and Rules, which contain, among others, 'No employee
should go on leave for more than one (1) year without pay.'" This was
communicated by Superintendent Cinco to Inocencia Elefaño on <st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="3">March 15, 1976</st1:date>, "for her
information and compliance." Still <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>
failed to return to her position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True
she continued to exert efforts for the extension of her leave of absence
without pay but they were of no avail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 2, 1976, after the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>
Normal School had been converted into the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> State
College, <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> was asked by the Administrative
Assistant of the College "to return to duty imme­diately in accordance
with Civil Service Law and Rules" but <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>
still failed to return claiming that her leave was approved up to January 31,
1977, but there is no proof of such approval.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What appears on record is Exhibit E, <u>supra</u>, wherein Regional
Director <span class="SpellE">Esperat</span> early in April, 1976, merely
recommended approval of <span class="SpellE">Elefaño's</span> leave without pay
for another year while stating that, "Dr. <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>
has been advised to return to duty on or before February 1, 1976, in an <span class="SpellE">indorsement</span> of this office to the Superintendent of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> Normal School, dated February 23, 1976." In
point of fact the recommendation could not have been approved because of the
unqualified prohibition contained in Sec. 33, Rule XVI of the Civil Service
Rules, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Under no
circumstances shall leave without pay <span class="GramE">be</span> granted for
more than one year."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, We are not prepared to state that
the Board of Trustees of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> State College acted
unreasonably and illegally in adopting Resolution No. 18, series of 1976,
"dropping Dr. <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>
from the service of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> State College for
having failed to return to duty after the expiration of her one year leave of
absence." Much less can We sustain the judgment of the lower court
ordering the Board of Trustees of the <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> State
College to nullify the appointment of Norma <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>
and appoint instead <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>;
ordering Norma <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span> to vacate her position and
relinquish it to <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span>;
and ordering the Board of Trustees to appropriate the back salaries of <span class="SpellE">Inocencia</span> <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> because <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> has not shown a clear legal right so as to entitle
her to such orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even if we assume
for the sake of argument that <span class="SpellE">Elefaño</span> had not
abandoned her position she is not entitled to such orders because she has
neither been recommended by the President of the College nor reappointed to the
position of Dean of Graduate Studies by the Board of Trustees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 15 of P. D. No. 944 states:</p>
