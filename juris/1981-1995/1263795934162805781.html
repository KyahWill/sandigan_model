<p class="BODY"><span>Murphy <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and Josephine 
<span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> appeal from the judgment of the then Court of 
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City, Branch 2 in Criminal Case No. 3622<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>, convicting them of rape and sentencing 
them to an indeterminate penalty ranging from <em>reclusion temporal</em> as 
minimum to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> as maximum and to pay an indemnity of 
P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to the victim, Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span> [Records, p. 108].<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that at about three o'clock 
in the afternoon of June 17, 1982, Rosalina <span class="SpellE">Ricafort</span>, 
then a seventeen-year-old cosmetology student residing at Riverside Subdivision, 
<span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City, visited her elder half-sister <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> [<span class="SpellE">Leonida</span> <span class="SpellE">Obenza</span>] at the <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span> of the 
family-owned resort in the university site [<span class="SpellE">Luzonian</span> 
University].<span>&nbsp; </span>They exchanged pleasantries and munched coconut 
meat.<span>&nbsp; </span>After an hour or at around <st1:time hour="16" minute="0">four o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, Rosalina decided to leave 
for home.<span>&nbsp; </span>She took the shortcut route leading to the "<span class="SpellE"><em>burol</em></span>", an uphill road which is the usual stopping 
<span class="GramE">place</span> for <span class="SpellE">jeepneys</span> plying the 
university area.<span>&nbsp; </span>The shortcut is a narrow footpath in the middle 
of tall cogon grasses, thick <span class="SpellE">underbrushes</span>, trees and 
bamboo groves [<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">B; TSN, 39-43, 
92, 177].</span></p>
<p class="BODY">As Rosalina was nearing a turning area, a woman approached her and 
requested that they both look for a boy who had died in that area.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>That woman was the accused-appellant Josephine <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rosalina hesitated but <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> quickly assured her that she would be safe with her 
since they were both girls.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rosalina acquiesced.<span>&nbsp; </span>But 
after taking a few steps, <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> pulled her towards a 
thickly forested <span class="GramE">area,</span> about 10 meters away from the 
path, where the other accused-appellant Murphy <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> emerged from his hiding place and suddenly grabbed 
Rosalina from behind.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then together he and <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> forcibly laid Rosalina down on a grassy 
portion.<span>&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> covered 
Rosalina's mouth with her hands, <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> pinned the 
struggling girl down with his thighs.<span>&nbsp; </span>He threatened to kill her if 
she shouted [TSN, pp. 44-46, 105, 180].</p>
<p class="BODY">Rosalina tried to break free and turned her head from side to side 
but <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> boxed her on the stomach, rendering her 
unconscious.<span>&nbsp; </span>When she came to, <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> 
was on top of her, his private organ inserted in her private part.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>She moaned.<span>&nbsp; </span>Noticing that she was already awake, <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> covered her mouth again.<span>&nbsp; </span>To create 
noise, Rosalina kicked the ground with her feet.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> gave her a heavy blow on her thighs and stomach and 
she fainted for the second time.<span>&nbsp; </span>When she regained consciousness, 
it was almost dark.<span>&nbsp; </span>She noticed that she was almost naked except 
for her bra which was up in her neck and her panties dangling from her right 
leg.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her shirt and pants were missing [TSN, pp. 47-49, 
114-120].</p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> was seated beside her, facing 
the path used for leaving the area.<span>&nbsp; </span>He warned her that he would 
kill her parents if she reported the matter to the police.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then he 
left.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was no sign of the other accused [TSN, pp. 49, 
121-122].</p>
<p class="BODY">Feeling weak and dizzy and clad only in her underwear, Rosalina 
trudged back to the <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span> and called out for her 
sister <span class="SpellE">Nida</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Noticing a piece of 
clothing hanging on a nearby cacao tree belonging to one of their workers, she 
reached for it and wrapped it around her body.<span>&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Nida</span> appeared, Rosalina immediately told her that she had 
been raped.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nida</span> returned to the house, 
took a blanket and placed it around her distraught sister.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then 
she ran to the diversion road where she hailed a passing jeep belonging to the 
National Irrigation Administration and brought Rosalina to the 
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> where the latter was 
examined by the resident physician at <st1:time hour="19" minute="0">seven 
o'clock</st1:time> in the evening of that same day [June 17th].<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Examination of the victim's genitalia showed congestion on the anterior 
<span class="SpellE">fourchette</span> left and posterior left and <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> laceration at the <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00 o'clock</st1:time> position.<span>&nbsp; </span>The vagina which 
admitted one finger with difficulty bore dark blood and traces of sperm 
cells.<span>&nbsp; </span>There was multiple linear <span class="GramE">abrasion</span> 
at the anterior chest [upper torso] which could have been caused by sharp 
instruments or fist blows.<span>&nbsp; </span>The physician also found blood on 
Rosalina's lower cheeks near the lip area.<span>&nbsp; </span>Her findings were 
consistent with the conclusion that coitus with the injured girl was obtained 
through force [<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A; TSN, pp. 8-14, 49-51, 
123-125].</p>
<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and asked Rosalina for a 
description of the rapists.<span>&nbsp; </span>She told them that although she did 
not know their names she could recognize them by their faces.<span>&nbsp; </span>She 
described the woman as of medium height with a high-bridge nose and wearing 
T-shirt with green stripes, <span class="SpellE">maong</span> pants and a pair of 
Adidas shoes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rosalina described the man as quite fat, tall with 
thick curly hair and a protruding stomach [TSN, pp. 52-54, 110-11, 130].</p>
<p class="BODY">Guided by that description, the police apprehended <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span>, and in the 
morning of <st1:date month="6" day="18" year="1982">June 18, 1982</st1:date> 
brought them separately before Rosalina in the hospital ward where she was 
confined.<span>&nbsp; </span>In between sobs, she identified them as the man and 
woman who had sexually abused her [TSN, pp. 54-57, 145, 155-158].</p>
<p class="BODY">At <st1:time hour="15" minute="0">three o'clock</st1:time> in the 
afternoon of <st1:date month="6" day="18" year="1982">June 18, 1982</st1:date>, 
Rosalina was discharged from the hospital.<span>&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time hour="0" minute="0">midnight</st1:time>, she and her foster parents were invited 
to the police headquarters where she again pinpointed the two accused in the 
police lineup as her attackers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rosalina also executed a sworn 
statement narrating the details of the rape [<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B; 
TSN, pp. 58-70, 80-81].</p>
<p class="BODY">A complaint for rape signed by the victim herself and sworn to 
before the city fiscal was filed on June 21, 1982 with the Court of First 
Instance against Murphy <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> as principal by 
direct participation and Josephine <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> as 
principal by indispensable cooperation [Records, pp. 1-2].<span>&nbsp; </span>On 
arraignment, both accused pleaded not guilty [Records, p. 20].<span>&nbsp; 
</span>After hearing, they were found guilty as charged but the mitigating 
circumstance of voluntary surrender was appreciated in their favor [Records, p. 
108].</p>
<p class="BODY">Accused-appellants <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span>, through their counsels <em>de</em> <span class="SpellE"><em>parte</em></span><span>, </span>contend that the trial court 
erred in not giving credence to their defense of alibi and in holding that 
Rosalina's testimony was sufficient to overcome the presumption of innocence 
[<span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>, pp. 170, 240].</p>
<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span>, high school 
graduate, twenty-four years old, married, a public utility <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver and residing in <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City, denied the accusation that he had raped 
Rosalina.<span>&nbsp; </span>He testified that on <st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1982">June 17, 1982</st1:date>, between the hours of four and six in the 
afternoon, he was out plying his <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> 
City-university site route.<span>&nbsp; </span>At about four, he was at the 
marketplace picking up passengers.<span>&nbsp; </span>A friend, Philippine 
Constabulary Sergeant Charlie <span class="SpellE">Tolopia</span>, boarded his 
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the university 
site, his other passengers alighted, leaving only <span class="SpellE">Tolopia</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He brought <span class="SpellE">Tolopia</span> to his residence at <st1:street><st1:address>Madrid 
Street</st1:address></st1:street> where they talked for about fifteen minutes 
while remaining inside the vehicle.<span>&nbsp; </span>At <st1:time hour="17" minute="20">5:20</st1:time> in the afternoon, <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> 
resumed his driving and picked up passengers bound for the public market.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Upon reaching the town proper, a tire started to wobble so he brought the 
jeep over to his parents' house at the university site for repairs.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>After ten minutes or around 5:35 p.m., he decided to call it a day, 
joined a fellow-<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver named Junior in his 
route, and later had drinks with him until 9:30 in the evening in the house of a 
certain <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> Delia, also at the university site [TSN, 
pp. 417-431].</p>
<p class="BODY">The next day, <st1:date month="6" day="18" year="1982">June 18, 
1982</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> drove his <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> till <st1:time hour="12" minute="0">noon</st1:time>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Having heard that the police were 
looking for a tall man [he was about five-foot-eight] in connection with a rape 
that occurred near the resort, he decided to present himself before them to deny 
any involvement.<span>&nbsp; </span>Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Ginauli</span> and 
Corporal <span class="SpellE">Lequin</span> brought him to see Rosalina at the 
hospital.<span>&nbsp; </span>He maintained that she remained silent throughout the 
confrontation and did not respond when the police asked her if <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> was the one who had abused her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Left 
with no other alternative, the police released him and he resumed his 
driving.<span>&nbsp; </span>At around <st1:time hour="0" minute="0">midnight</st1:time>, while he was drinking with friends in the house 
of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> Delia, the police picked him up and took him 
to the police station where he was pinpointed by Rosalina, once inside the 
interrogation room, and again in the police lineup [TSN, pp. 433-441, 
445-447].</p>
<p class="BODY">Josephine <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span>, the other appellant, 
twenty years old, single, <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> conductress and 
residing in Red V, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lucena</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, testified that from nine in the 
morning until <st1:time hour="8" minute="30">8:30</st1:time> in the evening of 
<st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1982">June 17, 1982</st1:date>, she was 
working as a conductress in the red <span class="SpellE">Tamaraw</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driven by Rolando Lopez.<span>&nbsp; </span>They plied 
the same university site route being serviced by <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> which began at the public market and ended at the 
"<span class="SpellE"><em>burol</em></span>" after circling the university 
area.<span>&nbsp; </span>That day she made around twelve complete trips [TSN, pp. 
275, 307, 325].</p>
<p class="BODY">Reportedly a <em>tomboy</em>, <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> 
was the lone female conductress among the <span class="SpellE">PUJs</span> 
operating at the university site.<span>&nbsp; </span>She worked with Lopez 
continuously for six months, except for the two months when she was incarcerated 
in the city jail for several robbery cases [<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">C; TSN, pp. 318-319, 321].</span><span>&nbsp; </span>She declared that 
she never saw Rosalina before in her life.</p>
<p class="BODY">There is no doubt <span>in </span>our mind that Rosalina was 
raped.<span>&nbsp; </span>The medical report confirms this.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
question now remaining is whether appellants <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> have been definitely identi<span>fied 
</span>by the seventeen-year-old rape victim and whether their respective alibis 
<span>are sufficient to </span>exculpate them.</p>
<p class="BODY">To corroborate his story, <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> 
presented <span class="SpellE">Tolopia</span> as his witness.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon 
cross-examination, however, it was elicited from <span class="SpellE">Tolopia</span> that he was a long-time acquaintance of <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and a comrade-in-arms of his father in the 
Philippine Constabulary [TSN, p. 405].<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dialola</span>, for her part, presented Rolando Lopez, her <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver, and <span class="SpellE">Dionisio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span>, her father, to convince the trial court that 
between the hours of four and six in the afternoon of <st1:date month="6" day="17" year="1982">June 17, 1982</st1:date> she was out plying the university 
site route [TSN, pp. 340-346, 236-237].<span>&nbsp; </span>It is readily apparent 
that corroborative testimony as to appellants' being elsewhere at the tine of 
the commission of the offense came from either a relative, a close friend or an 
associate which led the lower court to doubt its veracity considering that the 
appellants could have easily secured the testimonies of so many drivers, 
conductors and passengers using the same route.<span>&nbsp; </span>But independently 
of the suspicion naturally engendered by such biased testimony, this Court is 
convinced that the offended party has positively identified the appellants.</p>
<p class="BODY">To begin with, Rosalina had ample opportunity to recognize and 
remember her two attackers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Prior to the rape, Rosalina used to 
see <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> at the <span class="SpellE">Obar</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Ricemill</span> in Red V whenever complainant went there to 
have <span class="SpellE">palay</span> milled.<span>&nbsp; </span>As for <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span>, Rosalina met him once on board a jeep on her way 
to the resort about a month before she was criminally assaulted.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>She remembered him because they were sitting opposite each other.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>They had a conversation.<span>&nbsp; </span>When Rosalina alighted at the 
"<span class="SpellE"><em>burol</em></span>", the appellant did likewise and 
pointed to her a shortcut to the resort.<span>&nbsp; </span>Rosalina took the 
suggested path, the very place where she would be abused a month later.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>After that, she again saw <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> hanging 
around her neighbor's house which is about twenty meters from the "<span class="SpellE"><em>burol</em></span>" [TSN, pp. 38-39, 195-196, 210, <span class="GramE">468</span>].</p>
<p class="BODY">When Rosalina was raped, it was broad daylight.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> covered her mouth but not her 
eyes.<span>&nbsp; </span>She was <span class="GramE">lying</span> face up when <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> was astride her.<span>&nbsp; </span>Though she fainted 
twice, there were moments when she was awake and aware of what was being done to 
her.</p>
<p class="BODY">Less than 24 hours later, the police brought the two appellants 
separately before her in the hospital ward where she was confined.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>To demonstrate how meticulous the police were in ascertaining the 
identity of the offenders, they showed another tomboy to complainant to test the 
latter's recollection.<span>&nbsp; </span>They also told the appellants to enter the 
room twice to ensure that there would be no mistake on Rosalina's part.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Afterwards at the police station, the law enforcers once again required 
Rosalina to <span>iden</span>tify <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> in a police lineup.<span>&nbsp; </span>All throughout, 
she remained unwavering [TSN, pp. <span>54?57, 60-61].<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Subsequently, at the witness stand and in a straight-forward 
manner, Rosalina narrated how she was ravished and positively affirmed that it 
was <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> who waylaid her towards a forested area 
into the waiting arms of <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> who then succeeded 
in abusing her in spite of her resistance.</p>
<p class="BODY">In the face of such unequivocal identification by the rape victim 
whose testimony the trial court had given full credence, as well as the 
incontrovertible fact that there was no physical impossibility on appellants' 
part to reach the scene o<span>f </span>the crime which is but a few minutes 
away from their respective routes as public utility <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver and conductress, appellants' defense of alibi 
must necessarily fall and the lower court properly disregarded the same.</p>
<p class="BODY">The minor inconsistencies in Rosalina's testimony are to be 
expected.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">gruelling</span> 
cross?examination of a seventeen-year-old girl, unaccustomed to a public trial, 
would inevitably produce contradictions which nevertheless would not destroy her 
credibility [<em>People vs. Gozum</em>, G.R. No. 66970, <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1985">February 28, 1985</st1:date>, 135 SCRA 295; <em>People vs. 
Garcia</em>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-45280-81, </span><st1:date month="6" day="11" year="1981"><span class="GramE">June 11, 1981</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 105 SCRA 6].</span></p>
<p class="BODY">On matters of credibility this Court has accorded the highest 
degree of respect for the findings of the trial judge because he had the 
opportunity to hear the witnesses testify and observe their demeanor.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Evidently, in the instant case, he found the complaining witness more 
credible.<span>&nbsp; </span>In line with the rule above-stated, <span class="GramE">We</span> affirm.</p>
<p class="BODY">The trial court correctly found <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span>, 
a woman, equally culpable as a principal together with <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> for the crime of rape.<span>&nbsp; </span>Appellants' 
combined actions easily induce the belief that everything had been prearranged 
between them in order that <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> might carry out 
his bestial designs upon the victim.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> cooperated in the perpetration of the rape by <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> by acts without which the crime could not have been 
consummated.<span>&nbsp; </span>She paved the way by luring the unsuspecting victim 
into a secluded wooded area, delivering her to <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and then covering the girl's mouth so that she 
could not summon for help.<span>&nbsp; </span>The criminal responsibility of <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> has been established [<em>People vs. Andal</em>, 
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-39763, </span><st1:date month="3" day="8" year="1976"><span class="GramE">March 8, 1976</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 
70 SCRA 30; <em>US vs. Javier</em>, 31 Phil. 235].</span></p>
<p class="BODY">However, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the lower court 
erred in appreciating the attenuating circumstance of voluntary surrender in 
appellants' favor.<span>&nbsp; </span>In order that voluntary surrender may be taken 
into account, "it is necessary that the same be spontaneous in such manner that 
it shows the intent of the accused to surrender unconditionally to the 
authorities" [<em>People vs. Sakam</em>, 61 Phil. 27, 34; <em>People vs. 
Hanasan</em>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-25989, </span><st1:date month="9" day="30" year="1969"><span class="GramE">September 30, 1969</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 29 SCRA 534].</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The evidence disclosed that 
both accused were <span style="font-style: italic;">picked up </span>by the 
police several hours after they were definitely identified by Rosalina in the 
hospital [TSN, pp. 278, 297, 446-448].<span>&nbsp; </span>Where the record does not 
clearly show that the accused voluntarily surrendered to the authorities, the 
doubt cannot be resolved in their favor [<em>People vs. Lopez</em>, 107 Phil. 
1039].<span>&nbsp; </span>The fact that <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> went willingly with the police does not amount to 
voluntary surrender [<em>People vs. Dimdiman</em>, 106 Phil. 391].</p>
<p class="BODY">Likewise, the trial court erroneously applied the Indeterminate 
Sentence Law after it improperly lowered the penalty of <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em> to <em>reclusion temporal</em> by reason of the extenuating 
circumstance of voluntary surrender.<span>&nbsp; </span>The crime committed in this 
case is rape by two or more persons falling under paragraph 3 of Article 335 of 
the Revised Penal Code.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is punished by <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em> to death which are two principal indivisible penalties.</p>
<p class="BODY">Two vital points must be made clear.<span>&nbsp; </span>Firstly, the 
indeterminate sentence covers only divisible penalties and does not include 
indivisible penalties [<em>People vs. Asturias</em>, G.R. No. 61126, January 31, 
1985, 134 SCRA 405; <em>People vs. Arizola</em>, G.R. No. 59713, March 15, 1982, 
112 SCRA 615; <em>People vs. Roque</em>, G.R. No. 53470, June 26, 1981, 105 SCRA 
117].<span>&nbsp; </span>Secondly, in all cases in which the law prescribes a penalty 
of two indivisible penalties and there are neither mitigating nor aggravating 
circumstances present, as in the case at bar, the proper penalty is the lesser 
penalty or <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>[Revised Penal Code, 
Article 63(2); <em>People vs. Lamberte</em>, G.R. No. 65151, <st1:date month="7" day="11" year="1986">July 11, 1986</st1:date>, 142 SCRA 685].</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction is affirmed but the 
penalty is modified.<span>&nbsp; </span>Accused-appellants Murphy <span class="SpellE">Banzales</span> and Josephine <span class="SpellE">Dialola</span> are
