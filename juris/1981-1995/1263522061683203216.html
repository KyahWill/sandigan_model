An impressive number of cases from Venezuela v. Commission on Elections<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  dictates the outcome of this petition to review a decision of 
respondent Commission on Elections, dismissing a case for the 
disqualification of respondent Conrado Lindo to run as a candidate for 
municipal mayor of Ternate, Cavite in the 1980 Elections.  Petitioner is
 the duly-elected mayor, performing his functions after being 
proclaimed.  His undue insistence on the matter still being adjudged 
manifests a failure to abide by the generally accepted principle that a 
pre-proclamation controversy should be laid to rest, there being the 
remedy of a protest or a quo warranto proceeding that could be utilized.
  The petition must fail.
<p>
The facts that gave rise to this petition for review may be summarized 
thus:  In the January 30, 1980 elections for the position of mayor for 
the municipality of Ternate, Cavite, petitioner Rodolfo de Leon was the 
KBL candidate while respondent Conrado Lindo, also from the KBL, was the
 independent candidate for the same position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  On January 25, 1980, there was a verified letter-petition (PDC No. 
390) filed with respondent Commission by petitioner to disqualify 
respondent Lindo on the ground that he allegedly lacked the six-month 
residence requirement, it being alleged that said respondent was a 
resident of Noveleta, Cavite prior to the filing of his certificate of 
candidacy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  There was, in 
addition a supplemental letter from petitioner filed on January 28, 
1980, with a certification dated January 25, 1980 of one Amado Melo, 
allegedly the barangay captain of San Rafael II, Noveleta, Cavite, that 
"as per record of Census on file in this barangay, Spouses Conrado Lindo
 and Cdrazon Zapanta has (sic) been residents" of said barangay "since 
1969 up to the present."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The election took place on January 30, 1980 without such petition being decided.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  That was followed on February 5, 1980 with petitioner filing three 
separate certifications coming respectively from the Municipal Treasurer
 of Ternate, Cavite, Barangay Captain of the poblacion of Ternate, and 
Election Clerk of same municipality.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>   In the meanwhile, petitioner had been proclaimed the duly-elected mayor of Ternate and had assumed the position.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>
  On February 28, 1980, respondent Commission denied the petition for 
disqualification, the resolution stating that "petitioner failed to 
present sufficient evidence against herein respondent."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>   There was a motion for reconsideration.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup>
  As stated above, it was denied for lack of merit the reason being that
 "petitioner was already proclaimed Mayor of Ternate, Cavite, had 
assumed the position and is now discharging the duties of his office so 
that this pre-proclamation controversy has become moot and academic.  
Also, the certification issued by the Election Registrar of Ternate 
(Exhibit 2) and the list of voters (Exhibits 2-A, 2B and 2b-1) which 
have not been controverted show that Conrado Lindo voted in Voting 
Center No. 3-A Ternate, Cavite during the April 7, 1978 IBP elections 
and January 30, 1980 local elections."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</p><p>
Clearly then, respondent Commission cannot be faulted for deciding the 
way it did.  It did so in accordance with the settled law on the 
subject.  No useful purpose would be served by a petition of this 
character, taking up its time when its dismissal was the most 
appropriate response.  There was no legitimate grievance that petitioner
 could show.  The votes in his favor were counted; he was duly 
proclaimed; he is in actual discharge of his functions as municipal 
mayor.  There is, therefore, no reason for prolonging a pre-proclamation
 controversy.
</p><p>
Petitioner raised the question of the alleged constitutional infirmity 
contending that there was no observance of procedural due process.  This
 argument is devoid of merit.  There was in his original letter dated 
January 25, 1980 to respondent Commission seeking to disqualify 
respondent Lindo no document that would justify his assertion of his 
opponent being a resident of Noveleta.  On January 28, 1980, in his 
supplemental-letter petition, there was attached a certification dated 
January 25, 1980 of the barangay captain of San Rafael II, Noveleta to 
the effect that respondent "has been a resident" of said barangay "since
 1969 up to the present", and on that basis he requested "the immediate 
and favorable attention" of COMELEC.  To bolster his case, there was a 
second supplemental letter petition dated February 1, 1980, petitioner 
with three more certifications to support his claim that respondent 
Lindo was a resident of Noveleta and, with the prayer that respondent 
Commission disqualify respondent Lindo.
</p><p>
As set forth in the Comment of the Office of the Solicitor General: 
"There is nothing in all these three letter-petitions where petitioner 
reserved to present additional evidence.  He did not move for formal 
hearing of the case so that he could present testimonial evidence.  It 
is implicit in these letters that petitioner wanted respondent COMELEC 
to immediately disqualify respondent Lindo on the basis of the documents
 he had attached to his supplemental letters.  When therefore COMELEC 
found on the basis of those documents that there was no sufficient 
factual basis for the charge that respondent Lindo did not meet the 
residence requirement of the law, COMELEC only acted pursuant to the 
obvious prayer of petitioner to resolve the case expeditiously on the 
basis of the evidence presented by him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> 
</p><p>
Petitioner has, therefore, only himself to blame.  He was quite resolute
 in his belief that the documentary evidence was sufficient.  As noted 
in respondent Commission's order denying the motion for reconsideration:
 "Also, the certification issued by the Election Registrar of Ternate, 
(Exhibit 2) and the list of voters (Exhibits 2-A, 2B and 3b1) which have
 not been controverted show that Conrado Lindo voted in Voting Center 
No. 3-A Ternate, Cavite during the April 7, 1978 IBP elections and 
January 30, 1980 local elections."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup>
  It is, likewise, a well-settled principle that the filing of a motion 
for reconsideration cures a defect based on the alleged lack of 
procedural due process.
</p><p>
In the light of the above, it cannot be rationally concluded that there 
was a grave abuse of discretion on the part of respondent Commission 
when it dismissed the petition for the disqualification of respondent 
Lindo.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is dismissed for lack of merit.  No costs.
</p><p>
<em>Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Relova, Gutierrez, Jr.,</em> and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, J.</em>, petitioner’s action for the disqualification of 
his defeated rival has clearly become moot.  Joins Mr. Justice Abad 
Santos’ vote for imposition of treble costs.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar,</em> in the result.
</p><p>
<em>Abad Santos, J.</em>, this is a frivolous petition which he would have summarily dismissed with treble costs against the petitioner.
</p><p>
<em>De Castro and Escolin, JJ.,</em> did not take part.
