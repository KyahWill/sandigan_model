				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal interposed by the defendant, Rodolfo Rizo y
Rabino, from the judgment<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; font-family: Symbol;"><span style="">*</span></span></span></a>
rendered in Criminal Case No. 5083 of the Regional Trial Court at Masbate,
Masbate, the dispositive part of which reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused, Rodolfo Rizo, GUILTY
beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of Rape and hereby sentences said accused
to suffer the penalty of RECLUSION PERPETUA, to pay the victim, Felicidad
Valencia, the amount of P20,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency, to acknow­ledge the offspring named John Paul Valencia as his
legitimate son and to support the child at P200.00 a month until he reaches the
age of majority, and to pay the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that on 28 May 1986, Concepcion Dimen noticed
that the stomach of her 22-year old mentally retarded sister, Felicidad
Valencia, was bigger than usual.  She
was suspicious and obtained a sample of Felicidad's urine which she sent to a
hospital for examination.  The result
showed that Felicidad was pregnant.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon questioning, Felicidad revealed that the herein defendant-appellant,
Rodolfo Rizo, the husband of her "yaya", Ana Rizo, had sexual
intercourse with her in the bodega.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Concepcion Dimen and her brother, Boy Valencia, confronted the accused and the
latter admitted that he had sexual intercourse with Felicidad.   Consequently, the appellant was brought to
the Masbate police station for investigation.  There, with the assistance of CLAO Atty. Osias Tambago, he also admitted
having done the act.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view thereof, Rodolfo Rizo was charged with the crime of Rape
before the Regional Trial Court at Masbate, Masbate.  The case was docketed therein as Criminal Case No. 5083.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 October 1986, Felicidad Valencia delivered a baby at a
Manila Hospital, whom they named John Paul Tiongson Valencia.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, Dr. Emilio Quemi, a medical specialist at the
Masbate Provincial Hospital, declared that he examined Felicidad Valencia on 7
July 1986 and found her to be pregnant.  He then issued a medical certificate relative to his findings.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
He also stated that Felicidad is a mongoloid whose intellectual capacity is
below normal and comparably that of a 5-year old child and could not distin­guish
between what is moral and immoral.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">His observation was confirmed by Camila Ponferada, who conducts a
school for children of pre-school age, and had Felicidad for a pupil in the
summer of 1986.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Felicidad Valencia, the victim, declared that she knows the
accused, Rodolfo Rizo, whose nickname is "Ompoy" and pointed to him
in court.  She related the manner the
accused had sexual intercourse with her.  She said:</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant Rodolfo Rizo, however, did not confirm nor deny the
testimony of Felicidad that he had sexual intercourse with her.  After the prosecution rested its case, the
said accused, instead of presenting evidence in excul­pation, filed a motion to
dismiss (demurrer to evidence) claiming insufficiency of evidence in that there
is no evidence to prove his guilt other than the inadmissible testimony of
Felicidad Valencia who is mentally defective and, therefore, incompetent to
testify, pursuant to the provisions of Rule 130, Sec. 19 of the Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">But the trial court found Felicidad Valencia to be a competent
witness and rendered judgment against the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the present recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused-appellant insists that Felicidad
Valencia is an incompetent witness so that he should be exonerated from the
charge of Rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is without merit.  To begin, with, the accused-appellant, knowing Felicidad Valencia to be
mentally defective or a mental retardate, did not object to her competency as a
witness before she was placed on the witness stand.  Hereunder is what transpired in the court below immediately
preceding her testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>That's all.  Do you have any other witness?</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. BOSA</blockquote>

<blockquote>We have, Your Honor.  But before we will present our next witness,
Your Honor, this is a crime of justity (sic) and because of which we ask for
the exclusion of the persons from the court room not necessary to the attendance
of the Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Exclude including these
practicum.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. BOSA</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another thing, Your Honor,
that we would like to ask from the Honorable Court that because of the
condition of the victim we prayed that we be given the privelege (sic) to ask
her leading questions.  We have
established already ample evidence of her mental capacity by the Doctor, by the
sister taking charge of her and by her teacher.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>No objection, companero?</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. ANTONIO</blockquote>

<blockquote>I object to that
manifestation of the counsel, Your Honor, that he has submitted ample evidence
showing that the offended victim is allegedly retarded.  There was no expert witness that he
presented before this Honorable Court that said witness is allegedly retarded.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT</blockquote>

<blockquote>Objection with the
privelege (sic) of asking ...?</blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY. ANTONIO</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yes, Your Honor, because
our position is that because he is asking this Honorable Court that he be
allowed to profound (sic) leading question on the ground that a victim is not a
normal person.  Our position is that the
victim is a normal person."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The appellant's failure to object to the
competency of Felicidad as a witness operated as a waiver and the trial court
has no power to disregard it.  In an
early recorded case,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"Had the opposing party interposed an objection to this
witness on the ground of incompetency, her testimony could not have been
received.  His omission to object to her
operated as a waiver.  The acceptance of
an incompetent witness to testify in a civil suit, as well as the allowance of
improper questions that may be put to him while on the stand is a matter
resting in the discretion of the litigant.  He may assert his right by timely objection or he may waive it, either
expressly or by silence.  In any case
the option rests with him.  Once admitted,
the testimony is in the case for what it is worth and the judge has no power to
disregard it for the sole reason that it could have been excluded, if it had
been objected to, nor to strike it out on his own motion.  The disqualification of witnesses found in
rules of evidence of this character, is one not founded on public policy but
for the protection and<span style=""> </span>convenience
of<span style=""> </span>litigants, and which
consequently lies within their control."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Besides, the decision as to the competency of a person to testify
rests largely with the trial court, and in this regard, the trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court has observed that when Felicidad Valencia was
called to the witness stand, she was led by her sister.  She is around four (4) feet tall, with
slanting eyes, short small flat head, rounded and broad face, very shy and with
her tongue oftentimes protruding on her side lips of her mouth.  Her hands and feet are short, broad and
stubby.  She had high cheek bones and
small nose with a depressed bridge.  When she was sworn to tell the truth and was asked twice by the
interpreter she did not answer.  However, when the sister asked her to tell the truth, she nodded her
head facing the sister.  She speaks in
stuttering soft monosyllables sometimes accom­panied by gestures and signs of
her hands as well as the movements of her head to indicate affirmative and
negative response to a question.  Questions she does not know, she would not answer.  She does not know her age, nor where she
lives.  She has not gone Grade one nor
beyond.  She does not know the date, the
time, and the number of times she was abused.  During the trial, her actuations and mannerism were too childish and
innocent.  She showed constantly opened
mouth with her tongue protruding on her side lips.  Fely during the trial would untie her shoes on the witness stand
and lean on the shoulders of her sister.  She would shake her head sidewise left to right or nod her head and
point her finger to her vagina (tsn, p. 241, Records).  She would even yawn in the witness stand
resting her head on her two hands.  She
would be scratching her head with her tongue protruding on the side lips of her
mouth (tsn, p. 245, Records).  These
actuations in open court indicate mental abnormality and innocent childish
deficiency which are common forms of mental retardation considering that Fely
is a mongoloid of 22 years old.  Yet,
she is a credible and competent witness."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to the reliability of her testimony, we quote hereunder the
disquisition of the trial court which we find to be in accord with human
conduct and the natural course of events:</p>

<blockquote>"Why should Fely single out and point to the accused to have
led her to the warehouse; that the accused touched her breast and undressed
her; that the accused removed her pants and panty; that the accused made her
lay down and lay on top of her; and that the accused placed his organ inside
her vagina?  The victim is a mongoloid
and mentally retarded who does not even know her age nor where she lives.  How could she fabricate and concoct this
heinous crime if this incident were not true?  It would be incomprehensible to assume that Fely, a mongoloid whose
mental age is compa­rable to a five (5) years old, an innocent and mentally
retarded girl, could invent a crime of rape against the accused.  Neither could her sister do so knowing that
the accused had been their loyal worker for more than six (6) years and the
wife being the yaya of the victim and their laundry woman.  It is against their own personal interest to
concoct a crime against the accused if the crime is not true.  Considering the integrity of the brothers
and sisters who were mostly topnotcher professionals, they would not so easily
advertise to the whole world that their sister Fely had been raped, (sic) it
was not true.  There is nothing to gain
in inventing a rape case if it was not true; but the stigma of a lingering
eternal dishonor of being raped.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As a matter of fact, Fely, the victim was
candid and honest enough to say that those in the jeep to deliver, did not
touch her.  Berto was in the jeep did
not touch her.  Other persons did not
touch her.  She does not have male
friends and that nobody has violated her except the accused (tsn, pp. 235-236,
Records).  So by the simple process of
elimination, the victim has excluded all others not to have touched her nor
abused her except the accused."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It results that the trial court did not commit an error in
finding the defendant-appellant guilty of the crime for which he is charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note, however, that the trial court has ordered the
defendant-appellant to recognize the offspring John Paul Valencia as his
legitimate son despite the fact that said accused is a married man.  The rule is that if the rapist is a married
man, he cannot be compelled to recognize the offspring of the crime, should
there be any, as his child, whether legitimate or illegitimate.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
That portion of the judgment appealed from, ordering the accused to recognize
the child John Paul Valencia as his legitimate son, should, therefore, be
eliminated.</p>
