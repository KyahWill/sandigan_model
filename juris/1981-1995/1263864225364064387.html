of Court to receive the evidence of the petitioner and thereafter to report
back to the court.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the evidence received by the Branch Clerk of Court from the
petitioner, the following facts emerged:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="9" month="5">9 May 1985</st1:date>,
petitioner, a duly accredited private school located at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>

 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, entered into a contract of
services with private respondent Christina <span class="SpellE">Triño</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under that contract, Christina <span class="SpellE">Triño</span> would teach at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">petitioner</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
during the <span class="SpellE">schoolyear</span> 1985-1986, which would commence
in June 1985 and end in March 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
was assigned to take charge of Grade VI, Intermediate Department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract also provided that any party
desiring to terminate the contract before its scheduled expiration, would give
the other party at least one month notice of termination in writing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometime in August 1985, while the contract
was in full force and effect, and during a final examination period, private
respondent suddenly stopped teaching at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">petitioner</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

immediately sought the assistance of the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Captain of <span class="SpellE">Palao</span> and the commencement of conciliation
proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This attempt failed because
private respondent could not be contacted, she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="1">26 January 1986</st1:date>,
the trial court then presided over by Judge <span class="SpellE">Magadapa</span> <span class="SpellE">Rasuman</span> rendered a decision against private respondent, the

<p class="BODY">Four (4) months later, on 15 May 1986, private respondent filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>Petition
for Relief from Judgment with the trial court, alleging that the court had no
jurisdiction to render its decision dated 26 January 1986 for failure of
petitioner to go through the mandatory conciliation procedure prescribed by
Sections 2 and 6 of P.D. No. 1508.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent argued that the certification of the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Barangay</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Captain of <span class="SpellE">Palao</span>

<p class="BODY">Almost a year later, on <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="4">6
 April 1987</st1:date>, the trial court, this time presided over by respondent
Judge <span class="SpellE">Amir</span> <span class="SpellE">Pukunum</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Pundogar</span>, issued an order upholding private respondent's
contentions and setting aside the assailed decision of <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="1">26 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
his order, while Judge <span class="SpellE">Pundogar</span> acknowledged the
impropriety of the Petition for Relief from Judgment, he nonetheless in effect
granted the relief sought, holding that the Regional Trial Court in rendering
the decision dated 26 January 1986, acted without jurisdiction "over the
parties and the subject matter of the action"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> for failure of petitioner to comply with the
requirements of P.D. No. 1508.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A Motion
for Reconsideration by petitioner was denied by the respondent Judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the instant Petition,
it is vigorously contended by petitioner that the trial court had jurisdiction
to render its decision of </span><st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">26 January 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court notes, at the outset, that respondent Judge in fact
granted the Petition for Relief from Judgment not because he found one or more
of the grounds specified in Section 2 of Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court
(fraud, accident, mistake or excusable negligence) but rather <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">because respondent Judge found his
predecessor in the same court to have acted without jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is, however, firmly settled<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
that failure of a plaintiff to comply with the requirements of P.D. No. 1508 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">does not affect the jurisdiction of the court
that tried the action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In e.g., </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Millare</u></span><u> v. Hernando</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the Court stressed that "the conciliation procedure required under
P.D. No. 1508 is not a jurisdictional requirement in the sense that failure to
have prior recourse to such procedure would not deprive a court of its
jurisdiction either over the subject matter </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">over the person of
the defendant."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Failure of a plaintiff to go through the
conciliation procedure established by P.D. No. 1508 merely affects the
sufficiency, or the maturity or ripeness of the plaintiff's cause of action and
the complaint becomes vulnerable to a motion to dismiss, not on the ground of
lack of jurisdiction, but rather for want of cause of action or for <span class="SpellE">prematurity</span>.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Respondent Judge was thus in palpable error
in holding </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">predecessor without jurisdiction to render
the assailed decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge was equally in error when he either disregarded
or misconstrued the Certificate to File Action, dated <st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="9">17 September 1985</st1:date>, which had been issued by the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Palao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge simply said <u>apropos</u> this Certificate to
File Action, that no "confrontation" had taken place between
petitioner and private respondent before the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
authorities and immediately concluded that the requirements of P.D. No. 1508
had been violated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no question
that the "confrontation" or conciliation proceedings did not
materialize here, since private respondent did not appear before the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where,
however, the defendant in an action fails for one reason or another to respond
to a notice to appear before the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span>, the
requirement of P.D. No. 1508 must be regarded as having been satisfied by the
plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A defendant cannot be allowed
to frustrate the requirements of the statute by her own refusal or failure to
appear before the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span> and then later to
assail a judgment rendered in such action by setting up the very ground of
non-compliance with P.D. No. 1508.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
simplest terms, a defendant cannot be allowed to profit by her own default.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, private respondent, as noted earlier, had
stated in her subsequent Petition for Relief from Judgment that she resided not
in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Palao</span> but in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabili</span>, in effect
suggesting that she had not received notice to appear before the <span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span> of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Palao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not
believe that the statement and suggestion of private respondent should be given
much credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, the <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> authorities of <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Palao</span> must be presumed to have performed their official
duties and to have acted regularly in issuing the Certificate to File
Action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They must be presumed to have
sent a notice to Christina <span class="SpellE">Triño</span> to appear before the
<span class="SpellE"><u>Lupon</u></span>; otherwise, they could not reasonably
have stated that Christina "could not be contacted." Secondly, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="GramE">petitioner</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>School</st1:placetype></st1:place>
had already presented evidence during the hearing before the Commissioner
appointed by Judge <span class="SpellE">Rasuman</span> that both petitioner and
private respondent were residents of <span class="SpellE">Palao</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Iligan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, and in any event, the alleged failure on the part of a
plaintiff to comply with the procedural requirement established by P.D. No.
1508 must be raised in a timely manner, that is, at the first available
opportunity, if such alleged failure is to provide legal basis for dismissal of
the complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such failure must be
pleaded, in other <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">words, in a </span>timely
motion to dismiss or in the answer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Failure to so set up that defense produces the effect of waiver of such
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, private
respondent was declared in default and that default order was never set
aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, private respondent
must be held to have waived whatever right she may have had to raise the
defense of failure to comply with the compulsory conciliation procedure under
P.D. No. 1508.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, that was not the
only thing she waived; she also waived the right to appear and to file an <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">answer </span>and there to set up that and
other defenses that she might have had.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is simply too late to demand conciliation under P.D. No. 1508 after a
judgment on the merits (albeit by default) has been rendered and become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the Orders of respondent Judge <span class="SpellE">Amir</span> <span class="SpellE">Pukunum</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Pundogar</span> dated 6 April 1987 and 15 June 1987 in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Civil Case No. 111-577 are hereby REVERSED </span>and
