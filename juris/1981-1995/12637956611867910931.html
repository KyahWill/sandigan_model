<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">G.R. No. 27520 [<em>Globe Wireless Ltd., vs. 
Public Service Commission and Antonio B. Arnaiz</em>].</span><span>&nbsp; </span>â€” 
Challenged in this petition for <i>certiorari</i> is the jurisdiction of the 
defunct Public Service Commission [PSC] under Section 21 of Commonwealth Act No. 
146, as amended, to discipline and impose a fine upon petitioner, Globe 
Wireless, Ltd., a duly-organized Philippine corporation engaged in 
<span>international telecommunication business under a franchise granted by 
Public Acts Nos. 3495, 3692 and 4150, as amended by Republic Act No. 
4630.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">A message addressed to Maria Diaz, Monte <span class="SpellE">Esquina</span> 30, <st1:place><st1:city><span class="GramE">Madrid</span></st1:city>, 
<st1:country-region>Spain</st1:country-region></st1:place>, filed by private 
respondent Antonio B. <span class="SpellE">Arnaiz</span> with the telegraph office 
of the Bureau of Telecommunications in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dumaguete</span></st1:placename> 
<st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> was transmitted to the Bureau of 
Telecommunications in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>It was forwarded to petitioner Globe Wireless Ltd. for transmission to 
<st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner 
sent the message to the American Cable and Radio Corporation in 
<st1:state><st1:place>New York</st1:place></st1:state>, which, in turn, 
transmitted the same to the <span class="SpellE"><em>Empresa</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>Nacional</em></span><em> de Telecomunicaciones in 
<st1:state><st1:place>Madrid</st1:place></st1:state></em>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
latter, however, mislaid said message, resulting in its non-delivery to the 
addressee.</p>
<p class="BODY">After being informed of said fact, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Arnaiz</span> sent to then Public Service Commissioner Enrique 
Medina an unverified letter-complaint relating the incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
complaint was docketed as PSC Case No. 65-39-OC and petitioner was required to 
answer the same.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, in its answer, questioned <span class="SpellE">PSC's</span> jurisdiction over the subject matter of the 
letter-<span>complaint, even as it denied liability for the non-delivery of the 
message to the addressee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Hearing ensued, after which the PSC issued an order finding 
petitioner "responsible for the inadequate and unsatisfactory service complained 
of, in <span>vio</span>lation of the Public Service Act", and ordering it "to 
pay a fine of TWO HUNDRED [P200.00] PESOS under Sec. 21 of Com. Act 146, as 
amended." Petitioner was likewise required to refund the sum of P19.14 to the 
remitter of the undelivered message.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>[Annex "C", 
</span>Petition, p. 23, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>].</p>
<p class="BODY">Its motion for reconsideration having been denied, petitioner 
instituted <span>the </span>instant petition.</p>
<p class="BODY">We find for petitioner.</p>
<p class="BODY">Verily, Section 13 of Commonwealth Act No. 146, as amended, 
otherwise known as the Public Service Act, vested in the Public Service 
Commission jurisdiction, supervision and control over all public services and 
their franchises, equipment and other properties.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, Section 
5 of Republic Act No. 4630, the legislative franchise under which petitioner was 
operating, limited respondent Commission's jurisdiction over petitioner only to 
the rate which petitioner may charge the public.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus,</p>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec.</span><span> </span><span class="GramE">5.<span>&nbsp; </span>The</span> Public Service Commission is hereby 
given jurisdiction over the grantee <span style="font-style: italic;">only</span> 
<em>with respect</em> <em>to the rates which</em> <em>the grantee may charge 
the</em> <span style="font-style: italic;">public</span> <span>subject to 
international commitments made or adhered to by the Republic of the 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span>Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span>." 
(Underscoring supplied.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The act complained of consisted in petitioner having allegedly 
failed to deliver the telegraphic message of private respondent to the addressee 
in <st1:place><st1:city>Madrid</st1:city>, 
<st1:country-region>Spain</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Obviously, such imputed negligence had nothing whatsoever <span>to do 
with the subject matter of the very limited jurisdiction of the Commission over 
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Moreover, under Section 21 of C.A. No. 146, as amended, the 
Commission was empowered to impose an administrative fine in cases of violation 
of or failure by a public service to comply with the terms and conditions of any 
certificate or any orders, decisions or regulations of the Commission.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Petitioner operated under a legislative franchise, so there were <span class="GramE">no terms nor</span> conditions of any certificate issued by the 
Commission to violate.<span>&nbsp; </span>Neither was there any order, decision or 
regulation from the Commission applicable to petitioner that the latter had 
allegedly violated, disobeyed, defied or disregarded.</p>
<p class="BODY">Too basic in administrative law to need citation of jurisprudence 
is the rule that the jurisdiction and powers of administrative agencies, like 
respondent Commission, are limited to those expressly granted or necessarily 
implied from those granted in the legislation creating such body; and any order 
without or beyond such jurisdiction is void and ineffective.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
order under consideration belonged to this category.</p>
<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the instant petition is hereby granted and the 
order of respondent Public Service Commission in PSC Case No. 65-39-OC is set 
aside for being null and void.</p></div></div>
