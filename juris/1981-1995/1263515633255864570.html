				<H3>JUDGE BRAULIO D. YARANON, COMPLAINANT, VS. JONATHAN RULLODA, COURT INTERPRETER III, REGIONAL TRIAL COURT, BRANCH 29, SAN FERNANDO, LA UNION, RESPONDENT.<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>FELICIANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">By a Letter-Report dated 18 February 1994, Executive Judge Braulio D. Yaranon, Regional Trial Court, San Fernando, La Union ("RTC-SFLU"), advised this Court that Mr. Jonathan Rulloda, Court Interpreter III and Evidence Custodian of Branch 29, RTC-SFLU, had "brought home" a .45 cal. pistol which was an exhibit (Exhibit "T") in Criminal Cases Nos. 2783 and 2784 entitled "People v. Darlito Gonzalo, et al." (for Murder and Frustrated Murder), then pending before Branch 29, RTC-SFLU, Judge Roberto T. Cawed presiding.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>On 12 April 1994, after consideration of the Letter-Report, its annexes and update letters, the Court resolved to treat the Letter-Report as an administrative charge filed by Executive Judge Yaranon against Mr. Jonathan Rulloda for grave misconduct, dishonesty, infidelity in the custody of documents and violation of Section 3(e) of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>Respondent Rulloda was placed under preventive suspension on 19 May 1994 and was required to comment upon the administrative complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> On 22 August 1994, the maximum ninety (90)-day period of preventive suspension having lapsed, with the administrative investigation of Rulloda still pending, he was reinstated to his position as Court Interpreter III by Judge Cawed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>In an Answer dated 27 May 1994, respondent Rulloda "qualifiedly admit[ted]" having told Judge Cawed that he (respondent) had brought home the firearm, the production of which had been demanded by the Judge. Respondent stated that he had told a "white lie" to avoid a rebuke from Judge Cawed when respondent realized that the firearm involved could not be found in the exhibits room. Rulloda claimed that the numerous exhibits of various cases contained therein were in a state of disarray, due to a recent transfer of the premises of Branch 29, RTC-SFLU. Respondent also stated that because of the hospitalization of his daughter and aunt, he was in no position to accept a scolding from Judge Cawed at that time. Respondent specifically denied the charges made against him.4<br><br>The Court then referred this case to Vice-Executive Judge Vicente A. Pacquing, RTC-SFLU for investigation, report and recommendation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Accordingly, Judge Pacquing proceeded to set the case for hearing. Hearings were held on 7, 14, 22, 28 and 29 September 1994, as well as on 3 and 4 October 1994. The complaint of Judge Yaranon and the Answer of respondent Rulloda were treated as the parties' respective direct testimonies, without prejudice to the right of each to submit additional evidence which may have become available after submission of the basic pleadings. Both parties were advised that they had the right to be represented by counsel.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>During the hearings, the complainant and his witnesses (e.g., Judge Cawed and Atty. Ruth Dulaycan, Clerk of Court, Branch 29, RTC-SFLU) were presented and additional testimony taken.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Respondent's counsel waived cross-examination of Judge Yaranon but did cross-examine<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>Judge Cawed and Atty. Dulaycan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> An ocular inspection of the exhibit room was conducted by the Investigating Judge.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Respondent's counsel presented his witnesses (e.g., Luciano Trinidad of the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor and Atty. Dulaycan), whose testimony chiefly related to authentication of certain office documents relied upon by respondent.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> Mr. Trinidad was cross-examined by complainant Judge Yaranon.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> Respondent Rulloda did not testify in his own behalf.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Investigating Judge Pacquing submitted to this Court his "Investigation, Report, Recommendation and Compliance," dated 19 October 1994. The basic findings of the Investigating Judge may be summarized in the following terms.<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent Rulloda, although appointed as Court Interpreter III, "was designated likewise" as Evidence Custodian of Branch 29, RTC-SFLU. Judge Cawed had instructed orally (in mid January 1994) and in writing (via a Memorandum dated 9 February 1994) respondent Rulloda to submit the documentary and real exhibits in Criminal Cases Nos. 2783 and 2784 so that the same may be on hand for preparation of the decision in those cases. Respondent did not comply. However, he verbally admitted to Judge Cawed that he (respondent) had brought home Exhibit "T," a .45 cal. pistol. Judge Cawed thereupon issued another Memorandum requiring respondent to explain in writing his behavior. Because respondent again failed to comply, Judge Cawed notified Executive Judge Yaranon of the situation. The latter in turn notified Deputy Court Administrator Bernad, the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor and the National Bureau of Investigation Regional Office-SFLU. Judge Cawed also instructed Branch Clerk of Court Atty. Dulaycan to inventory and collate the exhibits in Criminal Cases Nos. 2783 and 2784. Atty. Dulaycan reported on the 24th of February 1994 that the .45 cal. pistol (Exhibit "T") was missing.13<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent's response to these developments was to absent himself from work on 24-28 and 31 January 1994, and again on 11, 14-18 and 23 February 1994. He submitted applications for leave for these dates to Judge Cawed. On 24 February 1994, respondent tendered his letter of resignation as Court Interpreter III. On 1 March 1994, however, respondent withdrew his letter of resignation. On 3 March 1994, respondent returned the .45 cal. pistol (Exhibit "T") to Clerk of Court Dulaycan.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The exhibits room of Branch 29, RTC-SFLU, was not, at the time the respondent was being required to produce Exhibit "T," in a state of disarray. Atty. Dulaycan testified that the exhibits in Criminal Cases Nos. 2783 and 2784 were deposited in a cabinet located in the stockroom which also served as the exhibits room. During the ocular inspection, the Investigating Judge noted that other exhibits, inside the stockroom but not deposited in the same cabinet, were in a state of disarray; but these exhibits pertained to cases other than Criminal Cases Nos. 2783 and 2784.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Respondent Rulloda was given ample time by Judge Cawed to find Exhibit "T" and respondent should have produced the same within that time if it had really been inside the exhibit room, considering the limited dimensions of the storage/exhibits room.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup><br><br>The Investigating Judge concluded that respondent Rulloda had taken the .45 cal. pistol out of the stockroom/exhibits room and brought the same home, and that respondent's acts and his failure to produce the pistol upon demand by his superiors constituted dishonesty, grave misconduct, infidelity in the custody of the public documents and violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The Investigating Judge recommended that respondent be dismissed from the service.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br><br>After a close review of the record of this administrative case, the Court considers that the factual findings of Investigating Judge Vicente A. Pacquing are supported by substantial evidence. At the same time, however, we do not believe that respondent's acts warrant imposition of the supreme administrative penalty of removal from office.<br><br>As the Investigating Judge found, respondent Rulloda had actually been functioning as Evidence Custodian at Branch 29, RTC-SFLU. This was "an internal arrangement," presumably between the Presiding Judge, the Branch Clerk of Court and respondent Rulloda. This "internal arrangement" had been in place even before Judge Cawed became Presiding Judge of Branch 29. Respondent was so assigned or designated Evidence Custodian when the position of Branch Clerk of Court was vacant and the duties thereof discharged by an Officer-in-Charge, Mr. Jaime Balanon.

Dulaycan assumed office as Branch Clerk of Court of Branch 29. In any case, once she did assume office, neither she nor Presiding Judge Cawed rectified the "internal arrangement" that they found. That arrangement was not good management practice, considering that the functions of an Evidence Custodian require skills very different from the skills actually possessed by respondent Rulloda as Court Interpreter III.<br><br>A Clerk of Court "shall safely keep all records, papers, files, exhibits and public property <span style="font-style: italic;">committed to his charge</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> The Branch Clerk of Court in particular "has control and supervision over all court records, exhibits, documents, properties and supplies x x x within said branch x x x subject to the supervision and control of the Presiding Judge."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> A judge, on the other hand, "should organize and supervise the court personnel to ensure the prompt and efficient dispatch of business, and require at all times the observance of high standards of public service and fidelity."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br><br>Under fact situations similar to those exhibited in this case, the Court has held Branch Clerks of Court as chiefly responsible for the shortcomings of subordinates to whom administrative functions normally pertaining to the Branch Clerk of Court were delegated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> A Clerk of Court "must be assiduous" in performing official duty and in supervising and managing court dockets and records.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup><br><br>Also pertinent is <span style="font-style: italic;">Tan v. Hon. Madayag</span>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> where the Court considered the Presiding Judge as "directly responsible for the proper discharge of [the] official functions [of his court personnel]," including acts of omission of his branch clerk of court to, e.g., promptly send out notices of court orders.<br><br>The Court considers, therefore, that Judge Cawed, Atty. Dulaycan and Mr. Balanon had a duty to anticipate problems that could arise from delegation of administrative functions of the Branch Clerk of Court to several staff-members of the court and to take preventive measures to avoid such problems. To the extent that these judicial officers had failed to rectify, and instead had continued, the inappropriate "internal arrangement" involving respondent Rulloda, they realistically had contributed to the misconduct of the latter. This circumstance may be considered in mitigation of respondent's own responsibility for taking the .45 cal. pistol (Exhibit "T").<br><br>That respondent had returned the .45 cal. pistol only after demand therefor had been made upon him, evinced an intent to take or appropriate that pistol which, at least to his mind, has represented some benefit or profit.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup>That he returned the pistol may, at the same time, be considered in mitigation of his administrative liability,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> along with fact that this appears to be the first administrative charge against him.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>The conclusion we have reached makes it unnecessary to determine something which the Report of the Investigating Judge failed to demonstrate, i.e., whether the same acts of respondent Rulloda which constituted dishonesty and gross misconduct could also be characterized as "infidelity in the custody of documents" and "violation of [Section 3(e) of] the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act."<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">ACCORDINGLY</span>, having regard to the particular circumstances of this case, we find respondent Jonathan Rulloda guilty of dishonesty and gross misconduct in office and is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">FINED </span>in the amount of Seven Thousand Five Hundred Pesos (P7,500.00). The respondent is also <span style="font-weight: bold;">WARNED </span>that repetition of the same or similar acts will be dealt with more severely.<br><br>Judge Roberto T. Cawed is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTED </span>to relieve forthwith respondent Rulloda of his functions as Evidence Custodian, and Branch Clerk of Court Ruth W. Dulaycan is hereby <span style="font-weight: bold;">DIRECTED</span> to assume and carry out custodianship of all evidence and other exhibits in Branch 29, RTC-SFLU. Judge Cawed and Atty.
