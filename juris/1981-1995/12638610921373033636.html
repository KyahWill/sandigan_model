<p class="BODY">Respondent National Irrigation Administration filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="21" month="4">April 21, 1980</st1:date>, its motion for
reconsideration of the aforesaid decision which respondent trial court denied

thus appealed said decision to the Court of Appeals (C.A.-G.R. NO. 67237-R)
where it filed its brief for appellant in support of its position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of filing the required brief in the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
Court of Appeals case, petitioners filed the instant petition with this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue for the resolution of the Court is:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Whether
</span>or not the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">award </span>of moral
damages, exemplary damages and attorney's fees is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">leg</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">ally </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">proper in </span>a complaint for damages
based on quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> which resulted in the death of
the son of herein petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners allege:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The award of moral
damages specifically allowable under paragraph 3 of Article 2206 of the New
Civil Code which provides that the spouse, legitimate and illegitimate descend<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">a</span>nts and ascendants of the deceased
may demand moral damages for mental anguish by reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>the death of the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Should moral damages be granted, the award should be made to each of
petitioners-spouses <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">individually</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>and in varying amounts depending upon
proof of mental and depth of intensity of the same, which should not be less
than P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for each of them.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the
trial court had made an impression that respondent National Irrigation
Administration acted with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">gross </span>negligence
because of the accident and the subsequent failure of the National Irrigation
Administration personnel including the driver to stop in order to give
assistance to the victims.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, by
reason of the gross negligence of respondent,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"> </span>petitioners become entitled to exemplary damages under Arts. <span class="GramE">2231 and 2229 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">New </span>Civil
Code.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners are entitled
to an award of attorney's fees, the amount of which (20%) had been sufficiently
established in the hearing of <st1:date year="1979" day="23" month="5">May 23,
 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>This petition has been
filed only for the purpose of reviewing the findings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span>the lower court upon which the disallowance of moral damages,
exemplary damages and attorney's fees was based and not for the purpose of
disturbing the other findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, taking up the cudgels for public
respondent National Irrigation Administration, contends thus:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the
instant petition is not proper in view of the appeal taken by respondent
National Irrigation Administration to the Court of Appeals against the judgment
sought to be reviewed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The focal issue
raised in respondent's appeal to the Court of Appeals involves the question as
to whether or not the driver of the vehicle that bumped the victims was
negligent in his operation of said vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It thus becomes necessary that before petitioners' claim for moral and
exemplary damages could be resolved, there should first be a finding of
negligence on the part of respondent's employee-driver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the Solicitor General alleges
that the trial court decision does not categorically contain such finding.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The filing of the
"Appearance and Urgent Motion For Leave to File Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> Brief" dated December 28, 1981 by
petitioners in the appeal (CA-G.R. NO. 67237-R; and G.R. NO. 61045) of the
respondent National Irrigation Administration before the Court of Appeals, is
an explicit admission of said petitioners that the herein petition is not
proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Inconsistent procedures are
manifest because while petitioners question the findings of fact in the Court
of Appeals, they present only questions of law before this Court which posture
confirms their admission of the facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the
parties failed to agree on whether or not negligence caused the vehicular
accident involves a question of fact which petitioners should have brought to
the Court of Appeals within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the decision of the trial
court has become final as to the petitioners and for this reason alone, the
petition should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Judge acted
within his jurisdiction, sound discretion and in conformity with the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Respondents do not
assail petitioners' claim to moral and exemplary damages by reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>the shock and subsequent illness
they suffered because of the death of their son.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent National Irrigation
Administration, however, avers that it cannot be held liable for the damages
because it is an agency of the State performing governmental functions and
driver Hugo Garcia was a regular driver of the vehicle, not a special agent who
was performing a job or act foreign to his usual duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the liability for the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> act should not be borne by respondent government
agency but by driver Garcia who should answer for the consequences of his act.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Even as the trial court
touched on the failure or laxity of respondent National Irrigation
Administration in exercising due diligence in the selection and supervision of
its employee, the matter of due diligence is not an issue in this case since driver
Garcia was not its special agent but a regular driver of the vehicle.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole legal question on whether or not petitioners may be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">entitled to an <span class="GramE">award</span>
of moral</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and exemplary damages and attorney's fees can
very well be answered with the application of Arts. <span class="GramE">2176 and
2180 of the New Civil Code.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Art. 2176 thus provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">"Whoever by act</span>
or omission causes damage to another, there being fault or negligence, is
obliged to pay for the damage done.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such
fault or negligence, if there is no pre-existing contractual relation between
the parties, is called a quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> and is governed
by the provisions of this Chapter."</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Art.</span> 2180 read as
follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their
employees and household helpers acting within the scope of their <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">assi</span>gned<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> </span>tasks, even though the former are not engaged in any business
or industry."</p>

<p class="2Q">"The State is responsible in like manner when it acts through
a special agent; but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">not </span>when the
damage has been caused by the official to whom the task done properly pertains,
in which case what is provided in Art. 2176 shall be applicable."</p>

<p class="BODY">The liability of the State has two aspects, namely:</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Its public or
governmental aspects where it is liable for the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span>
acts of special agents only.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Its private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">or </span>business aspects (as when it engages
in private enterprises) where it becomes liable as an ordinary employer. (p.

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, the State assumes a limited liability for
the damage <span class="GramE">caused</span> by the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span>
acts or conduct of its special agent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
paragraph 6 of Art.</span> 2180, the State has voluntarily assumed liability
for acts done through special agents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
State's agent, if a public official, must not only be specially commissioned to
do a particular task but that such task must be foreign to said official's
usual governmental functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the
State's agent is not a public official, and is commissioned to perform
non-governmental functions, then the State assumes the role of an ordinary
employer and will be held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">liable as
such for its agent's tort.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the
government commissions a private individual for a special governmental task, it
is acting through a special agent within the meaning of the provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Torts and Damages, <span class="SpellE">Sangco</span>, p. 347, 1984 Ed.)</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Certain functions and activities, which can be performed only by
the government, are more or less generally agreed to be
"governmental" in character, and so the State is immune from tort
liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, a service
which might as well be provided by a private corporation, and particularly when
it collects revenues from it, the function is considered a "proprietary"
one, as to which there may be liability for the torts of agents within the
scope of their employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The National Irrigation Administration is an agency of the
government exercising proprietary functions, by express provision of Rep. Act
No. 3601.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of said Act

objectives."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indubitably, the NIA is a government corporation with juridical
personality and not a mere agency of the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>corporate body performing non-governmental functions, it now becomes
liable for the damage caused by the accident resulting from the <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> act of its driver-employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this particular case, the NIA assumes the
responsibility of an ordinary employer and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>such, it becomes answerable for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">This assumption of liability, however, is predicated upon the
existence of negligence on the part of respondent NIA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The negligence referred to here is the
negligence of supervision.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the matter of due diligence on the part of
respondent NIA becomes a crucial issue in determining its liability since it
has been established that respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is
</span>a government agency performing proprietary functions and as such, it
assumes the posture of an ordinary employer which, under Par. 5 of Art. 2180,
is responsible for the damages caused by its employees provided that it has
failed to observe or exercise due diligence in the selection and supervision of
the driver.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court further declared that "a speeding vehicle
coming in contact with a person causes force and impact upon the vehicle that
anyone in the vehicle cannot fail to notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As a matter of fact, the impact was <span class="GramE">so</span> strong
as shown by the fact that the <u>vehicle</u> <u>suffered</u> <u>dents</u> <u>on</u>

<p class="BODY">It should be emphasized that the accident happened along the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Marikina</span> National Road</st1:address></st1:street> within
the city limits of <st1:place><st1:placename>San Jose</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
an urban area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the fact that
the victim was thrown 50 meters away from the point of impact, there is a
strong indication that driver Garcia was driving at a high speed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is confirmed by the fact that the
pick-up suffered substantial and heavy damage as above-described and the fact
that the NIA group was then "in a hurry to reach the campsite as early as
possible", as shown by their not stopping to find out what they bumped as
would have been their normal and initial reaction.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Evidently, there was negligence in the supervision of the driver
for the reason that they were <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> at a high
speed within the city limits and yet the <span class="GramE">supervisor of the
group, Ely <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span>, failed to caution and make</span>
the driver observe the proper and allowed speed limit within the city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the situation, such negligence is
further aggravated by their desire to reach their destination without even
checking whether or not the vehicle suffered damage from the object it bumped,
thus showing imprudence and recklessness on the part of both the driver and the
supervisor in the group.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, this Court has ruled that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">even </span>if the employer can prove the diligence in the selection
and supervision (the latter aspect has not been established herein) of the
employee, still if he ratifies the wrongful acts, or take no step to avert
further damage, the employer would still be liable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Maxion</span> vs. Manila
Railroad Co., 44 Phil. 597).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Thus, too, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span>

SCRA 618), this Court held that a driver should be especially watchful in
anticipation of others who may be using the highway, and his failure to keep a
proper look out for reasons and objects in the line to be traversed constitutes
negligence.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
