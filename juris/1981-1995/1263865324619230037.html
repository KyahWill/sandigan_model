where it came) and its rear faced the north (towards where it was going).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>

that driver <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span> applied the brakes after which the
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> made a U-turn (half-turn) in such a manner
that it inverted its direction making it face South instead of north; that the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> stopped on the western lane of the road on the
right of way of the oncoming Phil. Rabbit Bus where <span style="">it was </span>bumped by the latter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The likewise <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>
testimony of Police Investigator <span class="SpellE">Tacpal</span> of the San

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the presumption that

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> had already executed a complete turnabout
and at the time of impact was already facing the western side of the road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
assumed a new frontal position <span class="SpellE">vis</span> a <span class="SpellE">vis</span>, the bus, and the bus assumed a new role of defensive
driving.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The spirit behind the
presumption of guilt on <span style="">one </span>who
bumps the rear end of another vehicle is for the driver following a vehicle to
be at all times prepared of a pending accident should the driver in front
suddenly come to a full stop, or change its course either through change of
mind of the front driver, mechanical trouble, or to avoid an accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rear vehicle is<span style=""> </span>given the responsibility of avoiding a collision with the front
vehicle for it is the rear vehicle who has full control of the situation as it
is in a position to observe the vehicle in front of it."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above discussion
would have been correct were </span><span style="">it
not for </span><span style="">the undisputed fact that
the U-turn made by </span><span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">jeepney</span></span><span style=""> was abrupt (Exhibit "K," <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The </span><span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, which was then traveling on the eastern shoulder,
making a straight skid mark of approximately 35 meters, crossed the eastern
lane at a sharp angle, making a skid mark of approximately 15 meters from the
eastern shoulder to the point of impact (Exhibit "K," <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes could not have anticipated the sudden U-turn
executed by <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The respondent court did not realize that the presumption was rebutted
by this piece of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the substantial factor test, it was the opinion of
the respondent court that (p. 52, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the rule under the substantial factor
test that if the actor's conduct is a substantial factor it bringing about harm
to another, the fact that the actor neither foresaw nor should have foreseen
the extent of the harm or the manner in which it occurred does not prevent him
from being liable (Restatement, Torts, 2d).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Here, We find defendant bus running at a fast speed when the accident
occurred and did not even make the slightest effort to avoid the accident, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bus driver's conduct is thus a
substantial factor in bringing about harm to the passengers of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>, not only because he was driving fast and did not
even attempt to avoid the mishap, but also because it was the bus which was the
physical force which brought about the injury and death to the passengers of
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The speed of the bus was calculated by respondent court as
follows (pp. 54-55, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">):<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>"According to the record of the case, the bus departed from <span class="SpellE">Laoag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ilocos</span> Norte, at <st1:time minute="0" hour="4">4:00 o'clock A.M.</st1:time> and the accident took place at
approximately around <st1:time minute="30" hour="12">12:30 P.M.</st1:time>,
after <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> roughly for 8 hours and 30
minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deduct from this the actual
stopover time of two Hours (computed from the testimony of the driver that he
made three 40-minute stopovers), We will have an actual <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
time of 6 hours and 30 minutes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Under the circumstances, We calculate that the <span class="SpellE">Laoag-Tarlac</span> route (365 <span class="SpellE">kms</span>.)
driving at an average of 56 km. per hour would take 6 hours and 30
minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the average speed of
the bus, give and take 10 minutes, from the point of impact on the highway with
excellent visibility factor would be 80 to 90 <span class="SpellE">kms</span>.
per hour, as this is the place where buses would make up for lost time in
traversing busy city streets."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Still, We </span><span style="">are </span><span style="">not convinced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said
that the bus was <span class="SpellE">travelling</span> at a fast speed when the
accident occurred because the speed of 80 to 90 kilometers per hour, assuming
such calculation to be correct, is yet within the speed limit allowed in
highways.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot even fault <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes for not having avoided the collision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the
<span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> left a skid mark of about 45 meters, measured
from the time its right rear wheel was detached up to the point of
collision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delos Reyes must have noticed
the perilous condition of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> from the time </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">right rear wheel was detached or some 90 meters away, considering that
the road was straight and points 200 meters north and south of the point of
collision, visible and unobstructed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Delos Reyes admitted that he was running more or less 50 kilometers per
hour at the time of the accident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Using
this speed, <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes covered the distance of 45
meters in 3.24 seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If We adopt the
speed of 80 kilometers per hour, <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes would
have covered that distance in only 2.025 seconds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Verily, he had little time to react to the
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To require <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes to avoid the collision is to ask too much from
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the </span>time <span style="">element involved, there were no options
available to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the trial court
remarked (pp. 107-108, Record on Appeal):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They (plaintiffs) tried to impress this Court
that defendant de <span class="SpellE">los</span> Reyes, could have taken either
of two options:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) to swerve to its
right (western shoulder) or (2) to swerve to its left (eastern lane), and thus
steer clear of the <span class="SpellE">Mangune</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court does not so believe, considering
the existing exigencies of space and time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As to the first option, Phil. Rabbit's evidence is convincing
and <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> that the Western shoulder of the road
was narrow and had tall grasses which would indicate that it was not
passable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even plaintiff's own evidence,
the pictures (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. P and P-2, <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>)
are mute confirmation of such fact.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it can be noticed in the picture (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
P-2, <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>) after the Rabbit bus came to a full
stop, it was tilted to right front side, its front wheels resting most probably
on a canal on a much lower elevation that of the shoulder or paved road.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It too shows that all of the wheels of the
Rabbit bus were clear of the roadway except the outer left rear wheel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These observation appearing in said picture (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. P-2, <span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>) clearly shows
coupled with the finding the Rabbit bus came to a full stop only five meters
from the point of impact (see sketch, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K-<span class="SpellE">Pascua</span>) clearly show that driver de <span class="SpellE">los</span>
Reyes veered his Rabbit bus to the right attempting to avoid hitting the <span class="SpellE">Mangune's</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it was not successful in fully clearing
the <span class="SpellE">Mangune</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> as its
(Rabbit's) left front hit said <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> (see picture <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 10-A-Rabbit) must have been due to limitations of
space and time.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs alternatively claim that defendant <span class="SpellE">delos</span> Reyes of the Rabbit bus could also have swerved to
its left (eastern lane) to avoid bumping the <span class="SpellE">Mangune</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> which was then on the western lane.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such a claim is premised on the <span class="SpellE">hypthesis</span> (sic) that the eastern lane was then empty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This claim would appear to be good copy of it
were based alone on the sketch made <u><span style="">after</span></u><span style=""> </span>the collision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, it loses force it one were to
consider the time element involved, for moments before that, the <span class="SpellE">Mangune</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was crossing that
very eastern lane at a sharp angle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under such a situation then, for driver <span class="SpellE">delos</span>
Reyes to swerve to the eastern lane, he would run the greater risk of running
smack in the <span class="SpellE">Mangune</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
either head <span style="">on </span>or
broadside."</blockquote>
