1982, denying petitioner’s motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Based from the records, the factual background of this case is as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">This action originated from the Court of First Instance of
Manila, Branch XI, when private respondent Worldwide Philippines Marketing
Corporation (WPMC for short) on <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="2">February
 2, 1981</st1:date> instituted a complaint for sums of money with damages and
preliminary attachment against petitioner Joaquin S. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaw</span></span>, which complaint was docketed as Civil Case No.
137703.</p>

<p class="BODY">WPMC had its complaint amended twice, the last of which was dated
<st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1981</st1:date> to which an
answer with counterclaim was filed by Joaquin S. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaw</span></span> on <st1:date year="1981" day="29" month="7">July
 29, 1981</st1:date>. </p>

<p class="BODY">In the amended complaint, WPMC alleged, among others, the
following:</p>

<p class="BODY">In the answer, Joaquin S. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaw</span></span>
raised among others, the following as his special and affirmative defenses:</p>

<blockquote>“20.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">That</span>
with respect to the checks alleged in paragraph 5 of the amended complaint,
defendant alleges the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Equitable Banking
Corporation (<span class="SpellE">Divisoria</span> Branch) Check No. 11289889
dated September 18,1980 is not defendant’s check; that he has not withdrawn
said check and he is not indebted to the plaintiff, much less to Charles E. Go
and/or the latter’s father in the sum of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That

 1, 1980</st1:date>, in the amount of P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which
evidenced the fact that he has obtained a loan from Charles E. Go in the said
amount of P40<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; that he alleges that he has paid
said loan of P40,000.00 but Charles E. Go refused to return to him said check,
unless he pays <span class="GramE">all the</span> loan obtained by persons whom
he accompanied and who were granted loans by Charles Go, because, with respect
to the loans obtained by the persons whom defendant merely accompanied, he has
no liability.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
63-64, Petition, Annex “C”, pp. 5-6)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="8">August 3,
 1981</st1:date> set the case for pre-trial hearing on <st1:date year="1981" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On August 4, 1981, WPMC filed a motion for partial judgment on the
pleadings alleging therein that Joaquin S. <span class="SpellE">Gaw</span> admits
the <span class="SpellE">genuiness</span> and due execution of the checks copied
or attached to the complaint because he failed to specifically deny them under
oath and WPMC further claims that Joaquin S. <span class="SpellE">Gaw’s</span>
answer failed to tender an issue and therefore, a judgment on the pleadings is
proper.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his opposition dated August 13, 1981, Joaquin S. <span class="SpellE">Gaw</span> alleged that there is absolutely no allegation in <span class="SpellE">WPMC’s</span> complaint to the effect that the signature appearing
on the checks as drawers are his signatures, for which reason, he need not
specifically deny under oath the due execution and genuineness of said checks
pursuant to and in accordance with Section 8, Rule 8 the Revised Rules of
Court; and that with respect to the P40,000.00 check, he admits that said check
is his check but he alleges that he has paid the same and considering that the
defense is payment, he therefore, need not under oath, specifically deny the
due execution and genuineness of said check.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1981</st1:date>,
Joaquin S. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Gaw</span></span> prayed for
the cancellation of the pre-trial scheduled for <st1:date year="1981" day="25" month="8">August 25, 1981</st1:date> for the reason that his motion for leave

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1984</st1:date>,
the Second Division of this Court resolved to give due course to the petition (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, 248).</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not the respondent Appellate Court committed grave abuse of
discretion in dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i> holding that appeal
is the proper remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that on <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1981</st1:date>, when the lower court rendered a
partial judgment on the pleadings against the defendant (herein petitioner) for
the following reason:</p>

<blockquote>“Considering that the checks in question
had been attached to the complaint and made integral parts thereof as Annexes
“A” and “B” of the amended complaint, the allegations of the defendant’s answer
that he denies the same and which is not under oath tendered no issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the rules, said answer was an admission
that the defendant executed said checks and that the plaintiff failed to
recover the amounts stated in the two checks.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under Rule 19, Sec. 1 of the Rules of Court, judgment on the pleadings
is well taken.” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 89-90, Petition, Annex
“J”, pp. 2-3)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span class="GramE">there</span> was no
hearing, the pre-trial hearing having been cancelled and as found by the same
trial court in its Order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="9">Sept.
 16, 1981</st1:date>, the issues have not yet been joined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 21)</p>

<p class="BODY">Under similar circumstances this Court ruled that the lower court’s
exercise of judicial authority in granting the motion for judgment on the
pleadings and in rendering a decision without conducting a hearing to allow the
parties to present their respective evidence was oppressive and amounted to
excess of jurisdiction and grave abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition was considered a special civil
action of <i>certiorari</i> (Marina vs. Eastern <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
College, 168 SCRA 105-106 [1988]) reiterating an earlier ruling that <i>certiorari</i>
is available despite the existence of the remedy of appeal in such cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Co Chuan <span class="SpellE">Seng</span> v.
C.A., 128 SCRA 308 [1984]) Hence, respondent Appellate Court erred in ruling
that appeal and not <i>certiorari</i> is the proper remedy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not unlike the foregoing situations, the instant case does not
fall within the purview of Sec. 1 Rule 19 of the Rules of Court which provides
that the lower court may, on motion of a party, direct judgment on the
pleadings “where an answer fails to tender an issue, or otherwise admits the
material allegations of the adverse party’s pleadings.”</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful perusal of the complaint filed by the private
respondent against the petitioner will readily show that there was an absence
of an allegation to the effect that the check in question in the amount of P100<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> bears the latter’s signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, petitioner in his answer
stressed that it was not his check, that he has not drawn said check, and he
was not indebted to the private respondent and/or to the latter’s father.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore evident that petitioner’s answer not only
tendered an issue but clearly contested private respondent’s allegations in the
complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly the lower court
should not have rendered judgment on the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court went further by stating that a judgment on the
pleadings was proper due to petitioner’s lack of specific denial under oath as
to the <span class="SpellE">genuinenes</span> and due execution of the questioned
check.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 8, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court provides for the rule on
implied admission (by failure to make a sworn specific denial) of the
genuineness and due execution of a document or instrument subject of an action
or defense, but the same is not without exception.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the exceptions is when the adverse
party does not appear to be a party to the instrument, as held in the case of
Lim <span class="SpellE">Chingco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Terariray</span>,
et al., 5 Phil, 120 [1906] sited in <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, Rules of
Court Annotated, Vol. <span class="GramE">I,</span> Rules 1-56, 1989 Second
Edition, pp. 258-259 and under which petitioner clearly falls, as there was no
allegation in the complaint that the aforementioned check was drawn by the
petitioner nor that the signature affixed thereto belongs to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is therefore under no obligation to
specifically deny under oath the genuineness and due execution of the said
check.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, where there are factual issues in the answer that
had to be ascertained at a hearing and not on the basis of the bare allegations
in the pleadings, or evidence had yet to be submitted by the parties and to be
assessed by the trial court, it is improper for the judge to rule on the
strength alone of the plaintiff’s allegations and to disregard the defendants’
