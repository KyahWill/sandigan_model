<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Edilberto</span>
"Peter" Laredo contends that he was the only one who had inflicted injuries

Alfredo, two persons blocked their way and hit him with a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>stone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

suddenly appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of them fired a
shot at him but failed to hit him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then
said person ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The three other
persons had their bolos with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
of them then hacked him but he was able to defend himself with his bolo and
knife, being familiar with the act of self-defense or "<span class="SpellE">arnis</span>."
The next person fell after stabbing and hacking him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The third person ran but he was able to hit
him at the back.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, he
proceeded to the <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> police station where he
surrendered himself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He came to know the
