<p class="BODY">The private respondents initially sought to appeal.  They filed a notice of appeal.  However, they later filed a motion to
withdraw their appeal, "electing (instead) to file a petition for original

withdrawn, and directing cancellation of the notice of lis pendens "on the

consequently became final.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents did file applications in May and June, 1987 with

the expanded areas thru Eduardo L. Claparols<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> and

<p class="BODY">Five months or so after the the initiation of the registration
proceedings involving the so-called "expanded areas," the Republic
filed in Civil Case No. 838 a "Motion for Writ of Possession,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

claiming that, as "the prevailing party," it was "entitled to
possession of * * (said) portions," and their segregation from the
respondents' titles, as decreed by the judgment of February 6, 1987,
"would be meaningless unless the same are placed in the (Republic's)
possession and control **." It theorized that although the judgment did
not decree restoration of the segregated portions to the Republic, that
judgment nevertheless "necessarily carries with it the delivery of
possession of said portions to the State, as successful party, and as owner of
all lands of the public domain," a judgment not being "confined to
what appears upon the face of the decision but also those necessarily included
therein or necessary thereto," citing Section 45, Rule 39, Rules of Court,
and Unson v. Lacson, 2 SCRA 861, referring to Perez v. Evite, L-16003, March
29, 1961 as "controlling precedent." The motion closed with the

Trial Court rendered an Order on May 12, 1988 denying the Republic's motion for
a writ of possession, for lack of merit.  In justification of its resolution, the Court made the following
observations:</p>

<blockquote>“The decision of this Court was founded only in the propriety of
the remedy resorted to by private defendants in securing title to the expanded
areas.  It was found that the titling of
the expanded areas was not in accordance with Act 496 and following the
decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Republic vs. Abrille, 71 SCRA 57,
the titles were ordered cancelled because the law requires that to make the
alluvial deposits of land come under the Torrens System, there must be a
judicial application for registration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The purpose of registration under the Land Registration and Cadast
Acts is merely to confirm the title of the registrant and thereafter protect
the title already possessed by the owner, making it imprescriptible by
occupation of third parties.  Ownership
of a piece of land is one thing and registration under the Torrens System of
that ownership is another.  Ownership is
governed by the Civil Code and registration under the Torrens System is not one
of the modes of acquiring ownership (Grande <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">vs. </span>Court of Appeals, 115 Phil. 521).</blockquote>

<blockquote>During the trial of this case, private defendants presented expert
witnesses who testified and concluded that the expanded areas are alluvial in
character.  And as registered owners of
the land to which the alluvial deposits adjoined, they are therefore the lawful
owners of the said alluvial areas.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Art. 475 of the Civil Code provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">To the owners of the land adjoining the bank of the river belong
the accretion which they gradually received from the effect of the current of
the waters.'</p>

<blockquote>Accretion therefore which the banks of
rivers may gradually receive from the effect of the current become the property
of the owners of the bank, such accretions being natural incidents to land
bordering on running streams.  The
provisions of the Civil Code in that respect are not affected by the Land
Registration Act. (C.N. Hodges vs. Garcia, 109 Phil. 133).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since the alluvial deposits of land adjoin the registered land of
the private defendants and the expanded areas have become part of their estate
as a result of accretion, it follows therefore that the said expanded areas
belong to them."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 28, 1988 the Republic instituted in this Court the
special civil action of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">certiorari</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>at bar

advocated before the Trial Court and contends that the latter, in not upholding
that theory, acted beyond its jurisdiction and gravely abused its discretion.  It assails the Trial Court's findings
respecting the private respondents' rights over the expanded areas as

at the very least the evidence of the private respondents established <i>prima
facie</i> than they are owners of the expanded areas in question -- pursuant to
Article 475 of the Civil Code and in virtue of open, continuous and exclusive
possession of the land for more than 50 years in concept of owners -- but that
the procedure under Section 112 of the Land Registration Act (Act No. 496) by
which they succeeded in obtaining title over said areas was incorrect, and that
title should issue in their favor only in virtue of regular, original
registration proceedings in accordance with the same law in the course of
which, as pointed out in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Republic v.

<p class="BODY">This is indeed what the respondents have done.  They have commenced original registration
proceedings for the registration of their title over the expanded areas.  Their institution of said proceedings
pursuant to the decision and order of the Trial Court did not, of course,
foreclose the right and option of the Republic to oppose their claim of
ownership over those expanded areas, and show the areas to be in truth
unclassified forest.  But these issues -­-
whether or not the land is alluvial or not, or of public or private domain, and
whether or not the private respondents are riparian owners thereof within the
contemplation of the Civil Code and have occupied the land as owners for fifty
years, are issues proper for ventilation in the registration case now pending
before the Regional Trial Court at Silay City.  As things stand now, the private respondents have in their favor a
judicial pronouncement that they have shown, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">prima</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">facie</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> </span>at least, that the expanded areas are not of public domain and
they have acquired rights of ownership over them; in a word, they have overcome
the presumption that the land is within an unclassified public forest; on the
other hand, there is no categorical declaration in the judgment in Civil Case No.
838 that the expanded areas belong to the State, surely a condition for its
entitlement to a writ of possession thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> In
any event, the issues are obviously not triable before this Court, which must
therefore reject the Republic's efforts to have said issues ventilated and
resolved on the merits in the action at bar.  And since, as the record of Civil Case No. 838 of the Regional Trial
Court now stands, no clear right to the possession of the expanded areas is
shown to exist in favor of the Republic, the Court must also reject the
Republic's submittal that the respondent Trial Court, in refusing to grant its
motion for writ of possession, had acted beyond its jurisdiction or with grave
abuse of discretion.</p>
