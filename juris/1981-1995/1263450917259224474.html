				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition "for <i>Certiorari</i>, Prohibition and
Disqualifica­tion", which was filed with the Commission on Elections on No­vember
15, 1980, and certified to this Court by the Commission in an order dated
February 6, 1981, pursuant to the case of Pimentel vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
(G. R. Nos. 53581-83, December 19, 1980, <span style="">101
SCRA. 769), the petitioner seeks to set aside the order dated November 3, 1980,
and the decision dated November 7, 1980, of respondent Judge Harold M. Hernando
of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, Branch I; in
Election Case No. 3, on the ground that the same were "rendered with grave
abuse of dis­cretion and/or lack of jurisdiction."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Anita <span class="SpellE">Seares</span> and private
respondent Solomon <span class="SpellE">Lalugan</span> were the candidates for
mayor of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lagayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, in the elections held on January 30, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On January 31, 1980, the Municipal Board of
Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Lagayan</span> declared that Solomon <span class="SpellE">Lalugan</span> obtained 1,286 votes as against 394 votes garnered
by Anita <span class="SpellE">Seares</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Charging irregularities in the voting and in the counting of the votes,
Anita <span class="SpellE">Seares</span> filed with the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> on February 11, 1980, a verified petition of
protest contesting the validity and regularity of the election proceedings in
all the eight (8) voting centers of the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Lagayan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On March
6, 1980, Solomon <span class="SpellE">Lalugan</span> filed his answer to the
petition of protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Issues having been
joined, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> ordered
the pro­duction of the ballot boxes and of all the documents used in the
election and created a committee of <span class="SpellE">revisors</span> under
whose super­vision the petitioner-protestant segregated, identified, marked and
photographed all the ballots which she wanted to question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the committee submitted its
report to the court which then set the date for the reception of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The protestant presented
her direct evidence and rested her case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> then presented his evidence and,
on November </span>3, 1980, <span class="GramE">rested</span> his case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transcript of the stenographic notes
shows that on the same day, the counsel for the protestant, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Constante</span> Pimentel, manifested in open court that from the
evidence presented by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, he discovered
that about 200 to 300 persons who were not registered voters were allowed to
vote in the subject voting centers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
he verbally moved for the reopening of the ballot boxes and for a period of
three (3) days within which to segregate the ballots of the alleged
non-registered voters and to present his evidence relative thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the protestant likewise moved
that he be given twenty (20) days after his presentation of additional evidence
within which to submit his written memorandum.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel for the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pariñas</span> opposed the
motion for reopening of the ballot boxes on the ground that it would put no end
to the case and that the evidence sought to be presented by the protestant was
not in the nature of rebuttal evidence and should have therefore been presented
at the time of her presenta­tion of direct evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the verbal motion presented by the protestant and the
opposition interposed by the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>, the trial
court, pre­sided by the herein respondent Judge Harold M. Hernando, ruled that
since the evidence sought to be presented by the protestant was not rebuttal in
nature, the same should have been presented before the protestant had rested
her case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the respondent
judge held that the alleged unregistered voters could well be those persons
authorized by illiterate voters to vote for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the respondent judge verbally
denied the protestant's oral motion for the reopening of the ballot boxes and
for a period of three (3) days within which to present her evidence relative to
the alleged unregistered voters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Counsel for the protestant verbally sought reconsideration of the
oral order of denial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He admitted that
the evidence which he wanted to present was in the nature of additional
evidence but he pointed out that he discovered said evidence only after the <span class="SpellE">pro­testee</span> had presented witnesses who testified that they
voted even though their names did not appear in the registry of voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As regards the respondent judge's assumption
that the alleged un­registered voters could well be persons who assisted
illiterate voters, counsel for the protestant contended that the minutes of
voting did not reflect the alleged fact that illiterates voted with the
assistance of other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite
said explanations, the respondent judge denied the protestant's motion for
reconside­ration in a ruling dictated in open court, on the ground that the
reopening of the ballot boxes would violate Sec. 8, Rule V of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolution No. 1451 which requires that the
presentation and reception of evidence in election cases should be completed
within 30 days from the commencement thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The judge, how­ever, gave the protestant <u><span style="">fifteen (15) days from receipt of his order within which to question
the same on <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Before the protestant could receive the written order of denial,
she was notified by telegram, on November 7, 1980, that the de­cision in the
case would be promulgated on that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only <span style="">on the following <span class="GramE">day,</span> November 8, 1980, that she received the written order
of denial dated November 3, 1980, and learned that the respondent judge had
added in said order the following: <u>"This case is now considered
submitted for decision.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Notify by
telegrams the opposing counsels that promulgation shall take place on November
7, 1980.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No postponement shall be
entertained.</u>"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1980</st1:date>,
protestant's counsel received the decision dated <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1980</st1:date>, which dismissed the election protest
and upheld the election of Solomon <span class="SpellE">Lalugan</span> as
Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lagayan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Five days thereafter, or on <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1980</st1:date>, counsel for the
protestant filed with the Commission on Elections the instant petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition and dis­qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
copy of the petition was received by the respondent judge on <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1980</st1:date> — as noted in his
order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another order of the same date, said judge
declared his decision dated <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="11">November
 7, 1980</st1:date>, as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and
directed the Deputy Clerk of Court to furnish a copy of the decision to the
Commission on Elections, the Ministry of Local Government and Community
Development and the Commission on Audit.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1980</st1:date>,
the Second Division of the Commission on Elections issued an order restraining
the respondent judge from conducting further proceedings in Election Protest
No. 3 <span style="">and requiring him, as well as
private respondent Solomon <span class="SpellE">Lalugan</span>, to answer the
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and disqualification.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1980</st1:date>,
the petitioner, thru counsel, filed with the Commission on Elections a petition
to declare the respondent judge in contempt for having declared as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, in his order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1980</st1:date>, his decision dated <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1980</st1:date>, despite receipt of
a copy of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and disqualification.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge and the private respondent filed their
answers to the petition on <st1:date year="1980" day="29" month="12">December
 29, 1980</st1:date>, and <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="1">January 13,
 1981</st1:date>, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge Hernando did not file any answer to the petition
to declare him in contempt despite notices given by the Commission on
Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1981</st1:date>, the Com­mission on Elections
received a telegram from the Clerk of Court of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span> informing the commission that Judge Hernando was no
longer reporting for duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[On <st1:date year="1980" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1980</st1:date>, this Court
ordered Judge Harold M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hernando to refrain
from discharging the functions of his office in view of the information filed
against him in Criminal Case No. 2264 before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
for violation of R. A. No. 3019, as amended, otherwise known as the Anti-Graft
and Corrupt Practices Act.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="23" month="1">January 23, 1981</st1:date>,
counsel for the petitioner filed with the Commission on Elections a motion to
certify the records of the case to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And in an order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="6" month="2">February
 6, <span style="">1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Commission on Elections did so pursuant
to the Pimentel ruling.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents were required to file their comments to the
petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a manifestation dated <st1:date year="1981" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1981</st1:date>, Judge Hernando stated
that he was adopting the comment he had filed <span style="">with the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent Solomon <span class="SpellE">Lalugan</span> filed his comment
on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="4"><span style="">April 13, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="6"><span style="">June 18, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">, <span class="GramE">We</span> sent for a copy
of the transcript of the stenographic notes taken during the hearing on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="11"><span style="">November
 3, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, which was
actually received on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="9"><span style="">September 14, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the issues raised in this petition may be resolved in the
review of the decision on appeal, the peculiar circumstances and nature of the
case require that the same be now laid to rest in this special civil action for
<i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, <span class="GramE">We</span> give due course to the petition which is impressed with
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge’s refusal to allow the presentation of the
newly discovered evidence concerning the alleged unregistered voters, as well
as the undue haste with which he rendered the decision in the electoral protest
manifested his arbitrariness and <span class="GramE">are</span> indicative of
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first reason given by the respondent judge in denying the
protestant’s motion was that the evidence sought to be pre­sented was not
rebuttal in nature and could not therefore be allowed after the protestant had
finished presenting her direct evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But the protestant never claimed that the evidence sought to be
presented was of that nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She
admitted that the same was additional evidence which was discovered only after
the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> had presented witnesses whose testimony
revealed the fact that many unregistered voters (numbering around 200-300)
actually voted in <span class="SpellE">Lagayan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent judge erred when he held as an absolute rule that
the presentation of additional evidence could not be allowed after the pasty
had finished presenting his direct evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For a trial judge has the discretion to allow, in the furtherance of
justice, the presentation of additional evidence after the parties have
produced their respective direct proofs (Sec. 1 [f], Rule 30, Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">The second reason advanced by the respondent judge to justify his
denial of the <span class="SpellE">protestant"s</span> motion was that the
alleged unregistered voters could very well be those authorized by illiterate
voters to prepare and cast their ballots for them.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the protestant's counsel pointed out — without contradiction
from the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> — that the minutes of voting in
all the 8 voting centers did not indicate that illiterate voters actually voted
in the subject voting centers with the assistance of other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the face of such circumstance, the judge's
assumption that the alleged 200-300 unregistered voters were persons authorized
by illiterate voters to vote for them was clearly unfounded and speculative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently aware of the insufficiency of the reasons given by him
in denying the motion to be allowed to present additional evidence, the
respondent judge advanced another ground to support his denial of the
protestant’s motion for reconsideration of the order of denial, namely: that to
allow the presentation of additional evidence would violate Sec. 8, Rule V of <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> Resolution No. 1451 which requires that the
presentation and reception of evidence in election cases should be completed
within 30 days from the commencement thereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But such requirement had already been violated long before the day it
was being invoked.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For
while the presentation of the protestant’s evidence began on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="17" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 17, 1980</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> rested his case only on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="11"><span class="GramE">November 3, 1980</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 30-day
requirement has to be subordinated to a more substantial requirement, namely:
to ascertain in a more accurate way the will of the voters each of which is a
particle of sovereignty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold as arbitrary the act of the respondent judge
invoking the 30-day requirement (which he had already long violated) without
regard for a substantive necessity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
plainly the pre­sentation of evidence concerning the alleged 200-300
unregistered voters (constituting almost 20% of the total number of voters who
actually voted in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype> of
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lagayan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>)
could result in a more accurate determination of the will of the people.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the judge's avowal of speedy
disposition of the electoral protest was betrayed by his own act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For while he denied the requested period of
three (3) days; he nevertheless gave the protestant a much longer period of
fifteen (15) days within which to question the order of denial on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pattern of arbitrariness pursued by the respondent judge
became more manifest when, after denying the <span class="SpellE">protestant"s</span>
motion to present additional evidence and giving her 15 days from receipt of
the written order of denial within which to question the same on <i>certiorari</i>,
in apparent bad faith he inserted in the written order of denial a statement
declaring the case submitted for decision on <span style="">November 3, 1980 and ordering promulgation on November 7, 1980 without
postponement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent judge
obviously acted in unseemly haste.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, in an attempt to prevent the nullification of his order
of denial, the respondent judge, upon notice of the filing of the special civil
action of <i>certiorari</i>, immediately declared his de­cision as final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and insisted, in his answer to the petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
that the issue of the validity of said order of denial had become moot and
academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding grave abuse of discretion in the respondent judge's acts
of denying the protestant's motion to be allowed to present evidence relative
to the alleged 200-300 unregistered voters and of precipitately rendering his
decision in the subject electoral protest, We hold as null and void the
respondent judge's order dated November 3, 1980 and his decision dated November
7, 1980.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1980</st1:date> and the decision dated <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1980</st1:date> in Election Case No.
3 are declared null and void and respondent Judge Harold M.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hernando, or whoever succeeds him as Judge of
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Abra</span>, Branch I, is
directed to conduct further proceedings in said case by ordering the re-opening
of the ballot boxes in the eight (8) voting centers and giving the
petitioner-protestant a reasonable period within which to present her evidence
relative to the alleged 200-300 unregistered voters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
