				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Fourteen (14) year-old Cristina Junio filed with the Office of the
Provincial Prosecutor a criminal complaint dated 24 May 1991 for acts of
lasciviousness against respondent Judge Pedro Rivera Jr. of the Municipal Trial
Court of Alaminos, Pangasinan.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> The

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, Cristina's father, Patricio Junio, filed a sworn
administrative charge dated 6 June 1991 against the respondent with the Court
Administrator with respect to the same acts complained of criminally; thus was
commenced the present administrative case.  Complainant Patricio Junio further requested, through the Presidential
Committee on Human Rights, the Secretary of Justice to do something about the
matter.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In a letter to the Chief Justice dated 16 January 1992, then
Justice Secretary Silvestre H. Bello III suggested that respondent Judge Rivera
be placed under preventive suspension, pending the outcome of both the criminal
and administrative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cases.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">After considering respondent's answer to the administraÂ­tive
complaint, with its attached annexes, as well as the Report of the Deputy Court
Administrator dated 27 December 1992 on this matter, the Court decided in a
Resolution dated 26 January 1993 to suspend preventively respondent Judge
during the pendency of the administrative case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> To
date, the Court has not permitted him to re-assume his official duties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In two Resolutions dated 9 and 23 March 1993, the Court directed
Judge Eugenio Ramos of Branch 39, Regional Trial Court of Lingayen, Pangasinan,
to conduct an investigation in A.M. No. MTJ-91-565 and to submit his report and
recommendation thereon within sixty (60) days from receipt of the records of
the administrative case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hearings were subsequently conducted by Investigating Judge Ramos
on 15 and 29 May 1993, as well as on 5 and 19 June 1993.  In order to complete the administrative
investigation promptly, the parties agreed to reproduce by incorporation the
transcript of stenographic notes recorded in the criminal case, containing the
testimonies of witnesses who were presented by the parties anew in the present
administrative case.  The parties
further agreed to address additional questions on direct examination to these
witnesses in the administrative case, subject to the right of the opposing party's
counsel to cross-examine the witnesses on both the testimony given in the
criminal case, as well as the additional testimony given in this administrative
case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"She testified that between the hours of 2:30 and 3:00 o'clock
in the afternoon of May 20, 1991 she was helping in the store of her parents
which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">is located at the Alaminos
Commercial Complex.  She was sent to
their rented house to get the ingredients for <u>halo</u>-<u>halo</u>.  The house is owned by the respondent who
stays at the ground floor, while the Junio family occupy the second floor.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon reaching the house, she went to their housemaid named
Concepcion Tugade who was then helping cook food for the celebration of the
respondent's birthday.  She got their
housemaid's 1 year old child in order to dress her up and bring her to the
store.  The name of the child is Shiela
May.  She brought the child to her
(Cristina) room to change the former's clothes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>While dressing up Shiela, respondent allegedly entered her room,
took Shiela and made her sit on the bed and after which he went near Cristina,
embraced her and kissed her.  She tried
to push him.  The respondent allegedly
let her loose and then left the room while she sat on the bed and cried.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Then the respondent allegedly returned, went near her and pushed
her until she was lying on the bed.  He
then mounted on top of her, kissed her on the lips, inserted his right hand
inside her blouse and, simultaneously, inserted his left hand inside her <u>maong</u>
pants, mashed her breast and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">touched
her vagina, for a long time.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Then Shiela May cried.  The
respondent stood up and left the room.  Cristina also took the child and went out of the room.  The respondent was allegedly still in the
sala and he told her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">[Cristina] to stop
crying.  Conching Tugade arrived and
complainant (Cristina) told the former what happened.  She was advised to report it to her parents.  Upon arrival in </span>their store, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">she told her mother and she also told her
father.  They then went to the police
headquarters and caused the incident to be entered in the police blotter.  She identified her sworn statement marked as
Exhibit 'D' and series (sic) which she subscribed before Fiscal Finez on May
24, 1991.  She claims damages in the
amount of P300,000.00."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

that after the incident, respondent Judge tried to console her at the sala.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge Rivera, in his testimony, gave a different
version of the events of 20 May 1991, a version narrated by the Investigating
Judge in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"He has been the Municipal Judge of Alaminos town since July
11, 1989.  His wife is Patria Tady
Rivera.  He resides in a house inherited
from his parents.  It is two (2) stories
(sic).  He resides in (sic) the ground
floor while the second floor is being rented by the Junio family since 1986.  May 20 is his birthday and he heard Mass and
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">received Holy Communion on that
day.  His wife Patria was in charge of
the cooking.  There were actually three
(3) cooks, assisted by 6 or 7 persons. <o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The party actually began at past 10:00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">o'clock </span>with close friends and relatives in attendance.  During lunch there were some 30 guests in
the garage and some 20 guests inside the dining room.  He denied that he entered the bedroom of Cristina.  He admitted going to the second floor but
only up to the front of the staircase and he was with Cesar Villar; that he
told Cristina that it was his birthday and 'why don't you kiss Tito
Peter?',  which she did by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">kissing him on the cheeks and he kissed back
also on the cheek; that Villar commented 'Ano ba yan? Birthday kiss ba yan?' He
denied that he went back to the second floor a second time because he was very
busy attending to his many guests.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>He denied that he held the breast and private parts of the
complainant claiming that he cannot do that because she was like family to him
and he treated her like a daughter.  He
denied seeing Tugade go up the house and that although he admits that there are
four (4) bedrooms in the second floor, he does not know the room of Cristina
nor as to which room is occupied by the rest of the Junio family.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After careful deliberation on the Report of Investigating Judge
Eugenio Ramos, and after close examination of the record of A.M. No.
MTJ-91-565, the Court is unable to accept the findings and conclusions of the
Investigating Judge.  The conclusions
presented by the Investigating Judge and the reasons which lead us to reject
them are set out below.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Investigating Judge set out three (3) reasons for his
recommendation that respondent Judge Rivera be absolved from this
administrative charge.  The first and
the third reasons are interrelated and will, therefore, be dealt with
together.  The first reason presented by
the Investigating Judge is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>First</u>.  The
claim of Cristina that the respondent caused her to lay down on the bed, lay on
top of her, inserted his right hand inside her blouse in order to mash her
breast, and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">simultaneously the respondent
inserted his left hand inside the denim pants of Cristina </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">order to hold her 'vagina' and that this was
done for a â</span>long timeâ is unbelievable and totally unacceptable.  It was concocted by a person who had no
imagination whatsoever, or at least, had not experience enough to know that
what was pictured <u>was physically impossible</u> of accomplishment ... <u>unless
Judge Rivera is Mr. Rubber-man himself, or he is a </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">contortion artist</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>To be sure, in order to test and verify if this particular claim
of Cristina is physically possible, the undersigned tried to re-enact it with
my wife but it was determined that it was physically impossible of
accomplishment</u>.  The jurisprudence
laid down by the Honorable Supreme Court, that 'testimony to be believed must
not only emanate from the mouth of a credible witness, but must be credible in
itselfâ has been constant and fixed as not to require citation.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Moreover</u>, the respondent was in barong tagalog and white
pants.  It is submitted that <u>Judge Rivera
was intelligent enough to know that if he will lie down on top of a girl who is
resisting, his barong will become very crumpled, as well as his pants</u>.  Certainly with visitors coming and going to
wish him well, <u>he will look funny to say the least, meeting his well wishers
in 'crumpled' baronq pilipino</u> (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The complainant Cristina appeared before the undersigned during the
investigation.  She was already 16 years
old.  The incident allegedly happened in
1991 when she was 14 years old.  Without
casting any aspersion to Cristina, even today when she is already 16 years of
age, <u>the undersigned did not notice in her a fairly developed bust, as will
turn the male eyes in a manner that will cause him to throw caution to the
winds and make him think unchaste thoughts.  It would have been more so, two years ago when she was only 14</u>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The third reason of the
Investigating Judge is set out in the following manner:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Third</u>.  The
complainants have been living in the second floor of the respondent's house for
several years.  Since 1989 the latter
has been staying in the ground floor of his house.  <u>It is highly improbable that the respondent will be stupid
enough to choose May 20 to do and perform the acts of which he is accused</u>
on that very day:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="tab-stops:81.0pt">a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>which
is his birthday;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt;tab-stops:81.0pt">b.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with so many people present coming and going
to his house, which it was his social duty and obligation to meet and entertain
as guests;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="tab-stops:81.0pt">c.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>at
a time when his wife was present;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="tab-stops:81.0pt">d.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>when
in thanksgiving he attended the offering of the holy sacrifice of the mass and
received holy communion;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:81.0pt;text-indent:-16.2pt;tab-stops:81.0pt">e.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>when only the first phase of the celebration,
i.e., lunch, was finished and that more important guests are expected to
arrive."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><sup><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
color:red"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></sup></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">The first reason given by the Investigating Judge is totally
unacceptable to this Court.  The
Investigating Judge has not provided the Court with a cogent judicial basis for
exercising (or refraining from exercising) its disciplinary jurisdiction over
judges in the case at bar.  The extraordinary
first reason submitted by the Investigating Judge has in fact given rise to the
impression, to the mind of this Court, that he has, in desperation, bent over
backwards to exonerate respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, this Court does not believe that what
Cristina, in her clear and forthright testimony, said that respondent Judge
did, i.e., that he "lay on top of her, inserted his right hand inside her
blouse in order to mash her breast, and x x x inserted his left hand inside
[her] denim pants in order to hold her 'vagina' and that this was done for a
'lon<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">g</span>-time'" was
"physically impossible." That the Investigating Judge may have found
it not physically possible for him to "re-enact" with his wife the
testimony of Christina, does not impress this Court.  That the Investigating Judge found Cristina at age 16 (and
therefore <u>a</u> <u>fortiori</u> at age 14) bereft of what he considers a
"fairly developed bust" capable of generating "unchaste
thoughts", is even less impressive to this Court.  We consider that Judge Ramos' avowed
personal tastes in the matter of female sexual attractiveness prove
nothing.  There are any number of cases
in the Philippine Reports of males convicted of raping 14-year old, and even
younger, females.  The fact, therefore,
that the Investigating Judge was able to contemplate the offended party
Cristina without experiencing "unchaste thoughts," is no legal reason
for disbelieving her testimony.  That
the Investigating Judge may have found Cristina sexually unattractive,
certainly does not demonstrate that respondent Judge found her similarly
undesirable, at that particular moment, or that the latter could not have
kissed and fondled Cristina.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Investigating Judge's argument that respondent Judge Rivera's
barong and pants would have become "very crumpled" if he had indeed
lain on top of Christina, is also unpersuasive.  Assuming, for sake of argument, that respondent Judge would have
become terribly conscious of his hypothetically crumpled clothing, we note that
the incident took place in respondent Judge's home where he could have quite
easily changed his clothing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, the Investigating Judge found the matter a question of
credibility and chose to repose his entire faith and confidence in the word of
the respondent Judge as evidenced by his third reason.  But his third reason appears to this Court
to be an <u>ad</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">hominem</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">post</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">-<u>hoc</u> </span>argument
entirely speculative in nature, to which we are unable to ascribe substantial
weight.  Moreover, the Investigating
Judge disregarded the testimony given by respondent Judge and his witnesses
that alcoholic liquor was served to respondent Judge's guests during his
birthday celebration,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> as
well as the testimony of complainant's witness Concepcion Tugade, who had
declared in Criminal Case No. 2422-A that respondent Judge had indeed been
drinking liquor along with his guests on that day.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Considering <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">inter</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>alia</u> </span>that the normal effect of
alcoholic liquor, even when the point of intoxication is not reached, is to
loosen the ordinary inhibitions of the drinker,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> we
are not impressed with the Investigating Judge's third reason.  Upon the other hand, it is pertinent to
recall that crimes against chastity have been committed in many different kinds
of places, including places which many would consider as inappropriate or as
presenting a high risk of discovery.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, the Investigating Judge has overlooked
completely the clear and forthright manner in which Cristina testified as to
what had happened to her in the afternoon of 20 May <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">1991 </span>at the second floor of respondent Judge's house.  Respondent Judge has not suggested that
Cristina is a dissolute person, a woman-child of ill-repute, capable of
deliberately fabricating a story of lewd or lascivious acts.  Neither has respondent Judge submitted any
motive which might reasonably have led Cristina to engage in such a
fabrication.  The Investigating Judge
himself simply observed that Cristina, was a "poor and innocent [girl] who
has been raised as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">a </span>country
lass up to that moment," who could have misinterpreted an
"innocent" gesture (a kiss on the cheek) administered by respondent
Judge.  Cristina immediately told
Concepcion Tugade, who arrived shortly after the incident, what respondent
Judge had done to her.  Further,
Cristina that very same afternoon reported to her parents what had happened to
her and her parents in turn forthwith reported the matter to the police at the
Alaminos Police Station where the incident was "blottered."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The Investigating Judge in his report decries the acts of Cristina's parents as
"over-reaction;" this the Court is totally unable to understand.  Cristina and her parents behaved in exactly
the way we would expect them to behave if Cristina's story was true.  They behaved as law-abiding people subjected
to an outrage upon their honor and family can be expected to behave.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge sought to explain the filing of the
administrative and criminal charges against him in terms of a supposed desire
on the part of the Junios to "get even" with him for his alleged
reminders to the Junios about their arrearages of rent.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
This explanation inspires little or no confidence.  The Junio family vacated the second floor of respondent's house
two (2) days after the incident.  At the
time they left, they apparently had four (4) months rent in arrears; respondent
Judge himself acknowledged, however, that they paid their backrentals in full
after their departure.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> The
Junios were evidently a middle class (or lower-middle income bracket)
family.  They made their living out of a
store in the Alaminos Commercial Complex; they were, in the eyes of respondent
Judge, "lowly businessmen."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> As
such, we find it very difficult to believe that Cristina and her family would
fabricate a tale of sexual abuse by respondent, a municipal judge who, in a
town like Alaminos, Pangasinan, is a personage of importance and influence, one
whom most people would go to some length to avoid offending.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cristina Junio underwent all the public travails which await a
woman who complains of acts such as those here attributed to respondent
Judge.  Cristina testified first before
the Office of the Provincial Prosecutor and then in open court in the trial of
Criminal Case No. 2422-A and finally, once again, in the administrative
proceedings before the Investigating Judge.  The record is bereft of any indication that Cristina was any different
from other ordinary teenagers her age; no indication that she was sexually
precocious or a congenital liar.  We
have already noted that the Investigating Judge himself had observed that
Cristina was an "innocent" girl, "raised as a country
lass." Thus her behavior in immediately reporting what had happened to her
parents and then to the police and the Provincial Prosecutor is consistent only
with a genuine desire to vindicate her honor and redress the wrong she knew had
been inflicted upon her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For the above "first" and "third" reasons,
the Investigating Judge concluded that "the above accusation of Cristina
was [merely] concocted." The Report then went to the second reason adduced
by the Investigating Judge:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Second</u>.  <u>Obviously
therefore, the above accusation of Cristina was concocted.  The second manufactured evidence was the
testimony of  [Concepcion] Tugade.  It was obviously intended to provide the
appearance of a corroborating testimony</u>.  It appears to be the result of an advice overheard by Eva Pertez <u>when
Prosecutor Finez told Linda Junio, 'x x x this is not the way to file a case,
you return, this is not the way to make a case</u> x x x.' The Rules of
Evidence has been particularly harsh on the 'manufacture' of evidence. x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>'If it is shown that a person has attempted to falsify, fabricate,

<p class="BODY">The Investigating Judge narrated part of the testimony of
respondent's witness Eva Pertez as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x She testified that on May 22, 1991 at about 11:00

(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The Investigating Judge evidently
construed the above testimony as proof of a conspiracy to insert false
statements in the sworn statement of Cristina Junio.  He was, in effect, not only imputing perjurious statements to
complainant's witness, Concepcion Tugade, but also gross and probably criminal
misconduct to Fiscal Finez.  We do not,
however, read the statement attributed to Fiscal Finez as an encour<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>agement or inducement to add false statements
to Cristina's affidavit.  Far from it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Policeman Joseph Cortez testified that after he had prepared
Cristina's affidavit, he directed Cristina and her father to have the document
subscribed before Prosecutor Finez.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Stenographer Merlyn Cortez declared, without objection from complainant's
counsel, that prior to being sworn to, Cristina and her father had pleaded with
Prosecutor Finez to modify the document (Cristina's affidavit) <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">because it was incomplete</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>Merlyn Cortez declared further that
Prosecutor Finez then questioned her (Cristina) anew on the incident and that
as a result, the affidavit was retyped by her (Merlyn Cortez) to reflect the
inclusion of certain words and additional questions posed by Prosecutor Finez
and answers given by Cristina.  Relevant

purpose in propounding additional questions to Cristina Junio and in causing
the modification of the affidavit to include such additional questions and

<blockquote>"The Code of Judicial Ethics mandates that the conduct of a
judge must be free of [even] a whiff of impropriety not only with respect to
his performance of his judicial duties, but also to his behavior outside his
sala and as a private individual.  There
is no dichotomy of morality: a public official is also judged by his private
morals.  The Code dictates that a judge,
in order to promote public confidence in the integrity and impartially of the
judiciary, must behave with propriety at all times.  As we have very recently explained, a judge's official life can not
simply be detached or separated from his personal existence.  Thus:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">Being the subject of constant public scrutiny, a judge should
freely and willingly accept restrictions on conduct that might be viewed as
burdensome by the ordinary citizen.</p>

<p class="2Q">A judge should personify integrity and exemplify honest public
service.  The personal behavior of a
judge, both in the performance of his official duties and in private life
should be above suspicion."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">All judges in all levels of the judicial hierarchy, from this Court
down to the Municipal or Metropolitan Trial Courts, are bound to observe the
above exacting standards.  There is,
however, a special reason for requiring compliance with those standards from
those who, like respondent Judge Rivera, are Municipal or Metropolitan judges
and are accordingly "front-liners" of the judicial department.  As such, a Municipal (or Metropolitan) Judge
is the most visible living representation of the country's legal and judicial system.  He is the judicial officer who on a day-to-day
basis deals with the disputes arising among simple, rural people who comprise
the great bulk of our population.  He is
the judicial officer who comes into closest and most frequent contact with our
people.  The judiciary as a whole and
its ability to dispense justice are inevitably measured in terms of the public
and private acts of judges in the "grass roots" level, like
respondent Judge Pedro C. Rivera, Jr.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a> It
is essential, therefore, if the judiciary is to engage and retain the respect
and confidence of our nation, that this Court insist that municipal judges and
all other judges live up to the high standards demanded by our case law and the
Code of Judicial Conduct and by our polity.</p>
