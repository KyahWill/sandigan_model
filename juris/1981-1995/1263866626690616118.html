(Appellant's Brief, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 42)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To bolster his defense of alibi, the accused-appellant further
claims that the prosecution's alleged eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Efren</span>
<span class="SpellE">Balbastro</span> is not a credible witness on account of the
following circumstances:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balbastro's</span>
name <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is </span>not included in the list
of witnesses contained in the information.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balbastro</span>
did not formally report the stabbing incident to the police nor did he give his
statement to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only in court
at the witness’ stand when he spoke about the incident for the first <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">time.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balbastro's</span>
testimony that only the accused-appellant stabbed the victim contradicts the
finding of the other prosecution witness, the medico-legal expert, that the
injuries sustained by the deceased could have been inflicted by more than two
(2) persons.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balbastro</span>
testified that there was light in the kitchenette but could not make out
whether it was red or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balbastro</span> </span>could
not also state how many times and which part of the victim's body did the
accused-appellant stab the said victim.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Balbastro</span>
was the only eyewitness presented by the prosecution but from his testimony it can
be gathered that allegedly there were other eyewitnesses whom the prosecution
failed to present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Appellant's Brief,
pp. 5-6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 43-44)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Hence, premised on the
allegation that the entire testimony of the prosecution's eyewitness must be
disregarded for being unreliable and tainted by serious inconsistencies, the
accused-appellant in this appeal prays for his acquittal on the ground that the
prosecution had not established his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the issue presented by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused-appellant zeroes in on credibility of
witnesses, i.e., whether or not <span class="SpellE">Balbastro's</span> positive
identification of the culprit operates to convict the accused-appellant and whether
or not the accused-appellant's alibi suffices to exculpate him, we accord great
weight to the factual findings made by the trial court because the trial judge
