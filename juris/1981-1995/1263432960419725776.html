<p class="BODY">The only question that needs to be answered in deciding whether
the appellant is innocent or guilty of parricide is whether or not conspiracy
exists in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled in our jurisprudence that when there is
conspiracy, the act of one is the act of all, and all persons taking part in
the crime shall be held guilty as principals.  It is of no moment that the appellant did not take part in the actual
commission of every act constituting the crime.  She is responsible for all the acts of the others done in the
furtherance of the conspiracy.  (See
People v. Maranion, 199 SCRA 421, 433 [1991] citing People v. Obando, 182 SCRA
95 [1990]; and People v. Quinones, 183 SCRA 747 [1990])</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the appellant in her four assignments of
errors asserts that there is no conspiracy.  She maintains that the version of the prosecution showing the existence
of conspiracy is not credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant states that the prosecution's version has several
flaws.  First, Cristina's testimony that
the victim ran four (4) blocks (should be three (3) blocks [TSN, March 27,
1985, p. 7]) is not true since the victim could not have run those four blocks
after receiving the fatal wound inside Cristina's house since he would have
died immediately or would have at once weakened and collapsed.  Second, Cristina failed to mention in her
statement (Exhibit "N"), given two (2) days after the stabbing, the
fact that Balignasay was holding a 1 ½ to 2 feet piece of wood and that
Balignasay shouted "sige saksakin pa at patayin" which was included
in her open court testimony.  (TSN,
April 25, 1984, <span style="">p. </span>11-12) The
only thing she mentioned in her statement as to Balignasay's participation is
that she was with the two other accused.  Third, Michael whom Cristina mentioned was with her during the time of
the stabbing, did not mention Balignasay in his statement (Exhibit
"O") at all.  Fourth, Cristina
had motive to testify against Balignasay due to Balignasay's unfaithfulness to
her son.  Because of the flaws just
mentioned, the appellant contends that the version of the defense denying the
conspiracy is then, more credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.  The alleged flaws are justifiable.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fact that the victim could not have run four (4) (three
(3) according to Cristina's testimony) blocks after receiving the fatal stab
wound, there is no showing in the medico-legal report and the testimony of Dr.
Gajardo, the medico-legal examiner, to support the theory of the
appellant.  In fact, the appellant's
theory on instantaneous death runs counter to Dr. Gajardo's testimony that the
victim could have been saved if timely medical assistance was given.  (See TSN, July 31, 1984, p. 4)</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the second and third flaws, suffice it to say that
affidavits being taken <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u> usually are incomplete and often
inaccurate, caused sometimes from partial suggestions, sometimes for want of
suggestions and inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be unable
to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the correction
of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate recollection of all
that belongs to the subject.  (People v.
Urquia, G.R. No. 94787, November 19, 1991) The statement given by Cristina
placed the appellant at the scene of the crime.  It was in her testimony in open court that she expounded on
Balignasay's participation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the supposed motive of Cristina to falsely testify against
the appellant, there is no showing in the records by clear and convincing
evidence (see People v. Urquia, <u>supra</u>) that she has carried a grudge
against the appellant because of the estrangement between her son and the
appellant.  Nowhere in her more than
100-paged testimony did she malign or bad-mouth Balignasay.  Her testimony rings true because she could
have testified that the appellant had a hand in the stabbing of her son yet she
did not.  There was also no reason to
include Caranzo as one of the accused if she was just bent on seeking revenge
on the appellant and her lover.  Furthermore, in the span of almost two (2) years that her son and the
appellant were separated, there is no mention of any altercation between
herself and the appellant even though they had every opportunity to cross paths
and to exchange heated words.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant's defense, however, did not stop there.  She contends that assuming that Cristina
Eugenio's testimony <span style="">is </span>true, the
two circumstances <span style="">that </span>she was
holding <span style="">a </span>1 1/2 to 2 feet long
piece of wood <span style="">while </span>the victim
was being stabbed and that she was shouting "Sige, saksakin <span style="">at patayin" while </span>the victim was
being stabbed again are not <span style="">sufficient
to </span>establish <span style="">conspiracy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true that a finding of criminal conspiracy must be
supported by evidence constituting proof beyond reasonable doubt, it is equally
true that such evidence need not be direct evidence.  (People v. Gabatin, G.R. No. 84730, October 28, 1991) It may be
deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was perpetrated.  The conditions attending its commission and
the acts executed may be indicative of the common design to accomplish a
criminal purpose and objective.  If
there is a chain of circumstances to that effect, then, conspiracy has been
established.  (People v. Arroyo, 201 SCRA
616, 629 [1991])</p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy has been established beyond reasonable doubt.  Aside from the two circumstances that the
appellant mentioned above, we agree with the Solicitor General that the
following additional circumstances show the existence of conspiracy:  (1) Arturo de Vera and Rosemarie Balignasay
were living together as husband and wife after the latter separated from the
victim Antonio Eugenio, Jr.; (2) Both Arturo and Rosemarie were with Jaime
Caranzo when the latter shouted at the victim to come out of his house and
fight; (3) Forthwith, the trio, armed with knives and a piece of wood, forcibly
opened the ply-wood door of the victim's house; and once inside, Arturo and
Jaime started to stab the victim, while Rosemarie stood by the door and beat the
victim with the piece of wood she was holding when the latter passed thru the
door to flee; (4) The three chased the victim until the latter fell into a
culvert along Bayani Street, where he was stabbed repeatedly by Arturo and
Jaime in the presence of Rosemarie who exhorted them to continue on stabbing
the victim; (5) Thereafter, the trio left together, leaving behind the victim
who was mortally wounded; and, (6) The victim sustained no less than fifteen
(15) wounds of different nature, indicating that they were inflicted by more
than one assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances show the unity of criminal purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the assertion of the appellant in her
first assigned error that motive <span style="">is </span>a
controlling factor to establish conspiracy in this case must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether motive exists is not essential in the case at bar.  This Court has time and again ruled that
lack of motive does not preclude conviction when the crime and the
participation of the accused therein are definitely established.  <span style="">(People
</span>v. Ballinas, G.R. No. 93300, October 4, 1991)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant <span style="">was </span>placed
at the scene of the crime and her actions before, during and after the incident
indubitably show her participation in the crime committed.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The proper penalty, however, to be imposed should only be
reclusion perpetua and not life imprisonment or reclusion perpetua as the trial
court rendered.  It is the oft-repeated
rule that in a judgment of conviction for a felony, the court should specify the
appropriate name of the penalty inasmuch as under the scheme of penalties in
the Revised Penal Code, the principal penalty for a felony has its own specific
duration and corresponding accessory penalties (See People v. Aquino, 186 SCRA
851, 863 [1990]).  There is no penalty
of life imprisonment in the scheme of penalties under the Revised Penal Code
(People v. Samillano, G.R. No. 62088, March 6, 1992). </p>

<p class="BODY">The actual damages should be <s>P</s>3,980.00 as per Exhibits
"J", "K", “K-3", "L", and
"M".  The death indemnity is
increased to <s>P</s>50,000.00.  The <s>P</s>50,000.00
moral damages <span style="">is </span>deleted.</p>
