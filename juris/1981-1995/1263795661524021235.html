<blockquote>THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN AFFIRMING <em>IN TOTO</em> 
THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The trial court made the following findings of fact:</p>
<blockquote>"Sometime in 1962 or 1964 <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, brother-in-law of defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez and former Vice-Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, engaged the 
plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> as fishpond guard of a 
fishpond located at <span class="SpellE">Pariahan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Taliptip</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, owned by defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez, when the former guard of said fishpond had 
stopped working as such guard.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
Chavez met in the house of <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and on that occasion defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez agreed to employ plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> as fishpond guard of his fishpond and the latter 
agreed to work as such guard.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> worked as guard of said fishpond until 
1970.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Sometime in 1967 when plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> was still working as guard of said fishpond, 
defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez told him to look for persons 
who could construct <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and work as <span class="SpellE">saltmakers</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> engaged plaintiffs Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and Marcelo 
<span class="SpellE">Borlongan</span> including himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs 
and defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez met in a house erected on 
said fishpond and entered into an agreement that the plaintiffs shall be the 
ones to construct the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question and be the 
tenants on the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> to be constructed by 
them.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> constructed 47 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, 47 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, 56 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Borlongan</span>, 50 <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in a 
portion of the fishpond owned by defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
Chavez, located at <span class="SpellE">Pariahan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Taliptip</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Bulacan</span></span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Plaintiff Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> acted as the 
foreman in the construction of the said <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The construction of the compartment 
called "<span class="SpellE"><em>paalatan</em></span>" and the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question including the laying of tiles thereon 
was completed sometime in January, 1968.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez defrayed the cost 
of tiles, sand and lumber used in the construction of said <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the production of salt from said 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, the agreement between the plaintiffs and 
defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez was that the plaintiffs shall 
contribute their labor and the articles needed in producing salt like the "<span class="SpellE"><em>panulong</em></span>", "<span class="SpellE"><em>tiklis</em></span>", "<span class="SpellE"><em>pangayod</em></span>" and broom, while defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez shall defray the cost of sand to be used for 
<span class="SpellE">levelling</span> the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, the 
tiles to replace the missing tiles and lumber to replace the lost or destroyed 
lumber used as partitions of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and that the 
proceeds of the sale of the harvest, after deducting the cost of measurement, 
shall be divided between the plaintiffs and defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez under the sharing ratio of 
50-50.</blockquote>
<blockquote>The plaintiffs started scraping salt from the respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in February, 1968 and terminated the same in June, 
1968.<span>&nbsp; </span>The salt scraped by the plaintiffs every day was hauled and 
stored by them in their respective compartments of the store house.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>After the scraping of salt was terminated in June, 1968 all of the salt 
produced by them was sold and the proceeds (divided) between the plaintiffs and 
defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez under the sharing ratio of 
50-50.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the salt making seasons of 1967-1968 and 1968-1969 the plaintiffs 
with the help of the members of their families and farm households, worked on 
their respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They did not 
work on the said <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in the salt making season of 
1969-1970 for the reason that the production of salt was suspended as the store 
house was still filled up with unsold salt.<span>&nbsp; </span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez was the landholder of the plaintiffs in the 
salt making seasons of 1967-1968 and 1968-1969.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the salt making season of 1970-1971, 1971-1972 and 1972-1973, Dr. 
Alberto Reyes of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> was the legal possessor-land-holder of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 21).</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>In the salt making season of 1973-1974, Dr. Mario O. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tunsuya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, Metro Manila, was the legal possessor-landholder of 
said <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, with defendant Felipe Cruz, Jr., as the 
manager (Exhibits "21-A" and Exhibit "H"). </blockquote>
<blockquote>In the salt making seasons of 1968-1969, 1970-1971, 1971-1972, 
1972-1973 and 1973-1974, the plaintiffs, with the exception of David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> who was sick in salt making seasons of 1970-1971, 
1971-1972, 1972-1973, performed all of the phases of work in the production of 
salt in their respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In 
the month of November or December, each year, plaintiff repaired the dikes, 
cleaned the dikes by removing the grasses and weeds growing thereon, cleaned the 
<span class="SpellE"><em>paalatan</em></span> by removing the fish feed called 
"<em>lablab</em>", drained the water from the <span class="SpellE"><em>paalatan</em></span>, dried up the <span class="SpellE"><em>paalatan</em></span> for three days allowed the water to enter 
the <span class="SpellE"><em>paalatan</em></span> and kept it therein to enhance 
its salinity, removed the mud or soil from the tiles of the salt-beds, repaired 
the missing tiles of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> with new ones, <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, cleaned the 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> with broom and water and after such cleaning 
dried up the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the month of February of the ensuing year, the plaintiffs allowed 
the water coming from the <span class="SpellE"><em>paalatan</em></span> to flow 
into the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> every morning, scraped the salt that 
had been formed and started scraping at about 3:00 o'clock in the afternoon, 
piled the scraped salt inside the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and late in 
the afternoon hauled and stored the salt in their respective compartments of the 
store house after scraping of salt every day was finished.</blockquote>
<blockquote>After the close of each salt making season, the salt harvests 
deposited in the store house were sold.<span>&nbsp; </span>The proceeds of the sale 
of the harvest in the salt making seasons of 1968-1969, after deducting the cost 
of measurement, was divided between the plaintiffs and defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez under the sharing ratio of 50-50.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The loans and advances extended by said defendant to the plaintiffs 
during said salt making season were paid by the plaintiffs to said defendant 
from their 50% share.<span>&nbsp; </span>One <span class="SpellE">cavan</span> for 
every 10 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span> of salt of the 50% share of the 
plaintiffs was taken by defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
Chavez.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the salt making seasons of 1970-1971, 1971-1972 and 1972-1973, 
the proceeds of the sale of the salt harvests of the plaintiffs from their 
respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, after deducting the cost of 
measurement, were divided between the plaintiffs and Dr. Alberto Reyes, thru his 
overseer, <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> <span class="SpellE">Liwanag</span> of 
<span class="SpellE">Atlag</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, under the sharing ratio of 50-50.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
loans and advances extended by Dr. Alberto Reyes to the plaintiffs were paid by 
the latter to the former from their respective 50% share.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the salt making season of 1973-1974, the proceeds of the sale of 
the salt harvests of the plaintiffs from their respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, after deducting the costs of measurement, were 
divided between the plaintiffs and defendant Felipe Cruz, Jr., manager of Dr. 
Mario O. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>, under the sharing ratio of 
50-50.<span>&nbsp; </span>The loans and advances extended by defendant Felipe Cruz, 
Jr., to the plaintiffs in said salt making season were paid to said defendant 
from the 50% share of the plaintiffs.</blockquote>
<blockquote>In the salt making season of 1974-1975, the plaintiffs started the 
preparation of their respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in the month 
of December, 1974.<span>&nbsp; </span>They cleaned the dikes and "<span class="SpellE"><em>paalatan</em></span>", removed the soil from the tiles of the 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and replaced the missing tiles with new 
ones.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On February 17, 1975, at about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon, while 
the plaintiffs were in the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question and 
about to begin scraping salt from their respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
Chavez, in company with <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez, Jr., two 
security guards carrying firearms, Patrolman Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, of the Police Department of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, P.C.

<span class="SpellE">Nito</span> <span class="SpellE">Pangan</span>, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Maniego</span>, Jr., and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> drove away the plaintiffs from the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and Marcelo 
<span class="SpellE">Borlongan</span> were brought by Patrolman Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> to the Office of the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, on said 
date.<span>&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
voluntarily went to the office of chief of Police on the same afternoon and 
inquired from said Chief of Police whether he and the other plaintiffs could 
return to the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
said Chief of Police told him that he could not do so and warned him that if he 
and the other plaintiffs would go to said <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> 
they might be considered as trespassers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the 
admonition of said Chief of Police, the plaintiffs returned to the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question, but they were prevented by the 
security guards from entering said <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On <st1:date month="2" day="19" year="1975">February 19, 
1975</st1:date>, the plaintiffs went to the P.C. Headquarters of <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, and were able to 
talk with Lt. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>, to whom they complained that 
they were prevented by defendant <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez from 
entering and working on their respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>After the lapse of a few days, 
plaintiff Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> again returned to the P.C. 
Headquarters at <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, and was advised by Lt. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> to seek the assistance of the Bureau of Agrarian 
Legal Assistance, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Department of Agrarian Reform, in filing the proper

<blockquote>After the plaintiffs were driven away from their respective <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> on February 17, 1975 and prevented from working on 
the same, defendants <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> and Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>

<p class="BODY">Defendants or petitioners presented in their brief a 
counterstatement of facts:</p>
<blockquote>"From the evidence, testimonial and documentary, the following facts 
were established, to wit:</blockquote>
<blockquote>That petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez is the 
owner of that certain fishpond located in <span class="SpellE">Pariahan</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Taliptip</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, with an area of fourteen (14) hectares, more or 
less, portion of which is utilized as <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> for 
salt-making purposes, with an area of eight (8) hectares, more or less.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>As early as <st1:date month="8" day="1" year="1959">August 1, 
1959</st1:date>, he (Chavez) engaged <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> as caretaker ("<span class="SpellE"><em>katiwala</em></span>") and overseer of said fishpond with fixed 
compensation.<span>&nbsp; </span>The services of <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> continued and then in the early part of 
September 1967 Chavez caused the construction of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question, designating said <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> as his foreman 
("<em>maestro</em>") therein because of his experience in said endeavor, in 
addition to his job as caretaker of the fishpond.<span>&nbsp; </span>Because of this, 
the compensation of <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> increased commensurately.</blockquote>
<blockquote>At the initial stages of the construction of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> commencing from the first week of September 1967 to 
September 30, 1967, Chavez hired, on "<span class="SpellE"><em>pakyaw</em></span>" 
basis, laborers (Fidel Cruz, Arturo San Jose and <span class="SpellE">Florentino</span> Rodriguez) under the supervision of <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, to perform 
the <span class="SpellE">levelling</span> of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and they were paid their corresponding wages <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>During the period from <st1:date month="10" day="1" year="1967">October 1, 1967</st1:date> to <st1:date month="10" day="31" year="1967">October 31, 1967</st1:date>, the drying of the 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> was effected in preparation for the placing 
of lumber for each compartment of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The placing of lumber for each <span class="SpellE">saltbed</span> 
compartment was done from November 2, 1967 to November 22, 1967, on "<span class="SpellE"><em>pakyaw</em></span>" contract with <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> Chavez and his helpers, also under the supervision of 
<span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, "From 
November 23, 1967 to December 15, 1967, the placing of sand ("<span class="SpellE"><em>paglalatag</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>ng</em></span> 
<span class="SpellE"><em>buhangin</em></span>") was performed by hired workers on 
"<span class="SpellE"><em>pakyaw</em></span>" contract and, thence, from December 
16, 1967 to February 2, 1968, the preparation of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> ("<span class="SpellE"><em>latag</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>ng</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>banigan</em></span>") was 
done by hired laborers, namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Borlongan</span>, 
herein respondents, and one Jose <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and Miguel 
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On February 2, 1968, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, under "<span class="SpellE"><em>pakyaw</em></span>" basis, started the production of salt for 
the stipulated amount of P6,500.00, hiring for that purpose laborers/workers 
(namely, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dolfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pera</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pera</span>, etc) and expending 
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span> for his account the costs of "<span class="SpellE"><em>tiklis</em></span>", <span class="SpellE"><em>panulong</em></span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the <span class="SpellE">saltmaking</span> season of 1968-1969, 
<span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> 
undertook the salt-production on "<span class="SpellE"><em>pakyaw</em></span>" 
contract at the price of P6<span class="GramE">,500.00</span> hiring for that 
purpose laborers (namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>Jesus <span class="SpellE">Pantanilia</span>, Pedro Guzman, <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pera</span>, etc) to perform 
the job.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Chavez did not produce salt for the season 1969-1970 as he had 
plenty of salt stored in his bodega and the price of salt was then unprofitably 
low.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the salt-making season 1970-1971, Chavez contracted, again on 
"<span class="SpellE"><em>pakyaw</em></span>" basis, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> to produce and 
harvest salt from the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question for P7<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as consideration, <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Hired helpers (namely:<span>&nbsp;

as before, by <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> who paid their wages.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On <st1:date month="2" day="23" year="1971">February 23,

sell covering fish in the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> fishpond.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Said contract expired on <st1:date month="2" day="23" year="1973">February 23, 1973</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The production of salt 
was already in progress at the time of execution of said contract and Chavez had 
already engaged <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> on "<span class="SpellE"><em>pakyaw</em></span>" 
contract to undertake the production and harvest of salt for the salt-making 
season 1970-1971.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. Alberto Reyes never engaged in salt 
production during the entire period of said contract.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the salt-making season 1971-1972, Chavez engaged <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> for the 
production and harvest of salt in his (Chavez's) <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> for the consideration of P7,000.00, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> hired workers 
(namely, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Celestino</span> <span class="SpellE">Pera</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dolfo</span> <span class="SpellE">Pera</span>,<em> etc.</em>), to 
effect his undertaking.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the <span class="SpellE">saltmaking</span> season 1972-1973, 
Chavez contracted <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> to produce and harvest salt from the questioned 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> for the consideration of P7<span class="GramE">,500.00</span>, engaging for that purpose the same hired 
helpers.</blockquote>
<blockquote>For the salt-making season 1973-1974, Chavez again contracted, for 
the sum of P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> to produce and 
harvest salt, hiring for that purpose workers to perform his undertaking.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>For the season 1974-1975, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> was contracted, for the sum of P9<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, to produce and harvest salt and for this purpose, 
<span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> engaged 
helpers to work on the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On <st1:date month="1" day="7" year="1974">January 7, 
1974</st1:date>, a contract of buy and sell was executed between Dr. Mario O. 
<span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> and Chavez covering the latter's 
fishponds.<span>&nbsp; </span>At the time of said contract of buy and sell, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> who had 
already been engaged by Chavez to work on the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, had commenced preparation for <span class="SpellE">saltmaking</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Dr. <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span> did not cause work to be done in said <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Indeed, Chavez never engaged Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> to be his fishpond guard as <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> was Chavez's 
caretaker and overseer of the fishpond during the period that Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> claims to have worked as fishpond guard for 
Chavez.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chavez likewise never requested Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> to look for <span class="SpellE">saltmakers</span> nor 
entered into any agreement with respondents for them to construct and work in 
the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> in question, and that the only activity 
of plaintiffs as regards the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> has reference to 
their participation in the construction of the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> as hired workers and suppliers of some of the 
materials used in the <span class="SpellE">saltbed</span> 
construction.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Prior to <st1:date month="1" day="6" year="1975">January 6, 
1975</st1:date>, Chavez had charged respondent Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> by virtue of 
which Criminal Case No. 1352 was filed on <st1:date month="1" day="6" year="1975">January 6, 1975</st1:date> with the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>After the filing of said case for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> 
against Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, respondent David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> (brother of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>) and other relatives entered the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> by stealth — without the permission of 
Chavez.<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, when demanded by <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> to vacate the premises, they refused to 
comply.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chavez thus charged them for trespassing in the Municipal 
Court of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> docketed as Criminal Case No. 
1356.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, respondent David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> vacated the premises voluntarily but threatened to 
kill <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> and 
to return to the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="1" day="21" year="1975">January 21, 1975</st1:date>, however, Carlos 
<span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and his relatives entered Chavez's fishpond, 
particularly the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> portion, without the owner's 
consent and permission and therein made threats, and for this incident, Chavez 
filed a criminal complaint docketed as Criminal Case No. 1359 of the Municipal 
Court of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="2" day="4" year="1975">February 4, 1975</st1:date>, respondent David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> reentered the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and 
destroyed the "<span class="SpellE">banigan</span>" thereof, for which <span class="GramE">reason,</span> Chavez instituted Criminal Case No. 1367 with the 
same court.<span>&nbsp; </span>On February 17, 1975, respondents Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Borlongan</span>, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> (son of 
David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>), Jose <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
(son of Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>), Ernesto Valdez and one <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> Torres entered the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> 
involved without the permission and consent of Chavez, drove away the <span class="SpellE">saltworkers</span> of <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span> and started scraping salt and placing the scraped 
salt in "<span class="SpellE"><em>tiklis</em></span>".<span>&nbsp; </span>Having been 
informed of this unlawful entry into the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>, 
Chavez complained with the police of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> and acting thereon, the Chief of Police, Lt. Antonio 
Cardenas, sent Pat. <span class="GramE">Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span> 
and PC Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Decrito</span> to investigate the incident and 
invite the persons who entered the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Immediately, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Carpio</span>, the PC sergeant, <span class="SpellE">Zacarias</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez, 
Jr., and petitioner <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez proceeded to the 
<span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> involved.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon their arrival at 
the scene of the incident, PC Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Decrito</span> talked with 
Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Borlongan</span>, Miguel <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> (son of David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>), 
Jose <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> (son of Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>), Ernesto Valdez and <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> 
Torres, and invited them to go to their station commander.<span>&nbsp; </span>These 
persons invited went voluntarily to the police station.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the 
five (5) persons arrived in the municipal hall of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Chavez had 
already left and the Chief Police talked with them, asking if there was any 
possible settlement or if they are really aggrieved, that they file a complaint 
and "we will help." The persons invited begged leave, after a while, to go 
home.</blockquote>
<blockquote>On said occasion on <st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1975">February 17, 1975</st1:date>, respondents Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and Felipe Cruz, Jr. were not in the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> premises.<span>&nbsp; </span>There were no security 
guards during the incident on <st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1975">February 
17, 1975</st1:date> as Chavez employed security guards only after the said 
incident to protect his property from intruders.<span>&nbsp; </span>Chavez filed 
Criminal Case No. 1375 in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, against those 
who actually entered the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The criminal cases filed against Chavez were filed long after 
various criminal cases had been lodged against them for various offenses and 
that these instant cases filed against Chavez were retaliatory moves against 
him."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The issues brought up in the petition before <span class="GramE">Us</span> boil down to the determination of whose version of the 
statement of facts is to be adopted by this Court.</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners aver that it was wrong for the trial court and the 
respondent appellate court to rely mainly on the mere verbal assertions of the 
private respondents that they are the share tenants of petitioners and totally 
disregard the documentary evidences representing the receipts signed by private 
respondents Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> and David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> as suppliers of the materials for the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners also aver that <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. "8", "8-A" to "8-D" were offered to prove that 
respondent Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> was a "hired laborer" to work 
on the construction of the questioned <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> and 
<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span><span class="GramE">. "</span>10", "10-A" and 
"10-B", were offered to establish that David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> 
was also a mere "hired laborer".<span>&nbsp; </span>Private respondents' contention 
in this respect is that they worked on the questioned construction upon an 
agreement that they would work on the <span class="SpellE">saltbeds</span> as 
tenants.</p>
<p class="BODY">We disagree with petitioners' averments.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
receipts were not for wages or salaries received but the produce.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>If indeed respondents were mere employees or laborers, why was said 
relationship not duly reported to the Social Security Commission?<span>&nbsp; 
</span>We agree with the following apt observations of the Court of Appeals.</p>
<blockquote>"Appellants make much of the fact that plaintiffs appear to have 
received their regular salary from the defendant Chavez as evidenced by receipts 
to that effect.<span>&nbsp; </span>Contrarily, We find these receipts which are 
Exhibits 3 to 3-L, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>; Exhibits 4 to 4-D; 
5 to 5-Z; 6 to 6-M; 8 to 8-D; and 9 to 9-R, Juan <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>; Exhibits 7 to 7-E; and 11 to 11-B; Marcelo <span class="SpellE">Borlongan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 7 - 7-E and 11 to 
11-B; David <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. 
10 - 10-B; as indicated are but for "<span class="SpellE"><em>hakot</em></span>

"<span class="SpellE"><em>buhangin</em></span>"; "<span class="SpellE"><em>tabla</em></span>", <em>etc.</em>, and a few "labor" not in the 
handwriting of plaintiffs and these are not indicative of they being hired 
laborers.<span>&nbsp; </span>The greater <span class="GramE">number of these receipts 
were</span> signed by <span class="SpellE">Pantanilla</span>, <em>et al.</em>, as 
overseer and who took over after <st1:date month="2" day="17" year="1975">February 17, 1975</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If they were hired 
laborers, did <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Chavez, <em>et al.</em>, make 
the SSS contributions for them under the law?<span>&nbsp; </span>Never! 
Plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> were not even confronted with 
these few receipts for "labor" by the defense as the record shows.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Also, there is no proof whatsoever that these plaintiffs-appellants were 
paid by the day, by the week or by the month, for so much, 
respectively."</blockquote>

agreement.</blockquote>

Department, 2 security guards and PC sergeant and soldiers on February 17, 1975
