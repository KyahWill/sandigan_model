Atty. Jose M. Castillo, complainant, seeks the suspension of respondent 
from the practice of law for the use of insulting language in the course
 of judicial proceedings.
<p>
As the material facts are not in dispute, we have deemed the case 
submitted for resolution on the basis of the pleadings of the parties.
</p><p>
Complainant was the counsel for the defendants (and at the same time, 
one of the defendants) in Criminal Case No. 13331 for forcible entry 
before the Metropolitan Trial Court of Caloocan.  Respondent was counsel
 for the plaintiff.  At the hearing of the case on November 19, 1981, 
while complainant was formally offering his evidence, he heard 
respondent say "bobo".  When complainant turned toward respondent, he 
saw the latter looking at him (complainant) menacingly.  Embarrassed and
 humiliated in the presence of many people, complainant was unable to 
proceed with his offer of evidence.  The court proceedings had to be 
suspended.
</p><p>
While admitting the utterance, respondent denied having directed the 
same at the complainant, claiming that what he said was "Ay, que bobo", 
referring to "the manner complainant was trying to inject wholly 
irrelevant and highly offensive matters into the record" while in the 
process of making an offer of evidence.  The statement of Atty. Castillo
 referred to by respondent was:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> ". . . The only reason why Atty. Jose Castillo was included in the
 present complaint for ejectment was because defendant Erlinda Castillo 
wife of this representation called up this representation at his house 
and crying over the phone, claiming that Atty. Sabino Padilla was 
harassing her and immediately, this representation like any good husband
 would do in the defense of his wife immediately went to the school and 
confronted Atty. Sabino Padilla, Jr. with a talk and asked for a yes or 
no answer if he harassed the wife of this representation and if yes, 
right then and there I would sock his face."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Among the duties of an attorney are:  (1) to observe and maintain the 
respect due to the courts of justice; and (2) to abstain from all 
offensive personality and to advance no fact prejudicial to the honor or
 reputation of a party or witness unless required by the justice of the 
cause with which he is charged.  (Rules of Court, Rule 138, Sec. 20 (b) 
and (f).) The Canons of Professional Ethics likewise exhort lawyers to 
avoid all personalities between counsel.  (Canon 17)
</p><p>
Whether directed at the person of complainant or his manner of offering 
evidence, the remark "bobo" or "Ay, que bobo" was offensive and uncalled
 for.  Respondent had no right to interrupt complainant which such 
cutting remark while the latter was addressing the court.  In so doing, 
he exhibited lack of respect not only to a fellow lawyer but also to the
 court.  By the use of intemperate language, respondent failed to 
measure up to the norm of conduct required of a member of the legal 
profession, which all the more deserves reproach because this is not the
 first time that respondent has employed offensive language in the 
course of judicial proceedings.  He has previously been admonished to 
refrain from engaging in offensive personalities and warned to be more 
circumspect in the preparation of his pleadings.  (CA-G.R. No. 09753-SP,
 Court of Appeals; Civil Case No. C-7790 CFI of Caloocan.)
</p><p>
The Court, however, notes that in the case at bar, respondent's 
actuation was triggered by complainant's own manifest hostility and 
provocative remarks.  Complainant is therefore not entirely free from 
blame when respondent unleashed his irritation through the use of 
improper words.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misbehavior.  He is 
directed to observe proper decorum and restraint and warned that a 
repetition of the offense will be dealt with more severely.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Melencio-Herrera, Relova</em>, and <em>Gutierrez, Jr.</em>, JJ., concur.
