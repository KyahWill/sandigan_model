				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal brought before this Court by appellant, Domingo
de Mesa y <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>, from a Decision of the Regional
Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch 104 (Special
Criminal Court),<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
dated 1 February 1989, which adjudged him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the
crime of Murder and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify the heirs of the victim in
the sum of one hundred thousand (P100,000.00) pesos representing actual,
compensatory and moral damages; and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented as a witness; <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mapalad</span>, a helper in .<span class="SpellE">Yolly's</span>
Canteen, situated at 1081 <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> Hi-way, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Kaligayahan</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, where the crime
occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his testimony (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 15-16, TSN, pp. 20-22, October 18, 1989) he
narrated that on 19 January 1988, at about 3:45 in the afternoon, the
appellant, together with his co-accused Mario de Mesa, who is his cousin, and
another man, arrived at <span class="SpellE">Yolly's</span> Canteen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They ordered beer and started drinking.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Renato</span>
Santos, a member of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police. Station and
owner of the canteen, also entered the premises and after asking for coffee,
sat on a long bench inside the canteen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant approached Sgt. Santos and asked him whom he had voted
for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the latter replied that he had
voted for "<span class="SpellE">Oreta</span>", appellant's cousin,
Mario de Mesa, addressed these remarks to Sgt. Santos, "<span class="SpellE">Gago</span> ka <span class="SpellE">pala</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Si</span> <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">ibinoto</span>
<span class="SpellE">ko</span>." Sgt. Santos said that he voted in <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mario de
Mesa, however, said, "<span class="SpellE">Baka</span> <span class="SpellE">akala</span>
mo, <span class="SpellE">komo</span> <span class="SpellE">sarhento</span> ka ay <span class="SpellE">natatakot</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
<span class="SpellE">iyo</span>." Sgt. Santos asked Mario de Mesa, "<span class="SpellE">Bakit</span>, <span class="SpellE">inaano</span> <span class="SpellE">ba</span>
<span class="SpellE">kita</span>?" As Sgt. Santos started to stand up, Mario
de Mesa pushed him on the shoulder as appellant Domingo de Mesa simultaneously
stabbed him on his left chest below the shoulder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mapalad</span> witnessed
the incident as he was only about one arm's length from the three.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The witness knew the appellant as the latter
drank and ate at the canteen quite often.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the stabbing of Sgt. Santos, Mario and Domingo de Mesa ran
away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim drew his gun and fired
three times but he was not able to hit them (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Santos was taken to the MCU
Hospital where he expired.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 January 1988, appellant was apprehended at the BLTB bus
terminal in <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span> City. He was arraigned while his
cousin, Mario de Mesa, remained at large. In the course of the trial, the
prosecution Corrected the name of the appellant appearing in the Information
from <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> de Mesa y <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span>
to Domingo de Mesa y <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 15) .</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution also presented Beatrice <span class="SpellE">Alpanoso</span>
Perez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 16, TSN, pp. 3-6, October 5, 1989) dovetailed
with that of <span class="SpellE">Mapalad</span> on all material points.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She stated that she went to <span class="SpellE">Yolly's</span> Canteen to borrow some lotion from her
sister-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Yolly</span> Santos, owner of the canteen and
the second wife of the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
observed that the appellant and the latter were having an argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It turned out that the appellant was trying
to get from <span class="SpellE">Yolly</span> Santos the clothes of a certain <span class="SpellE">Marivic</span>, but <span class="SpellE">Yolly</span> refused
because <span class="SpellE">Marivic</span> is indebted to her in the amount of
P300.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After that, the appellant
approached Sgt. Santos, and the subsequent exchange of words between them
leading to the stabbing incident, occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented only one witness, the appellant, 25 years,
single, a deep-well driller, who categorically denied that he had stabbed the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He implicated his cousin and
co-accused, Mario de Mesa, as the perpetrator of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He narrated that at 3:45 in the afternoon of
19 January 1988, he was inside <span class="SpellE">Yolly's</span> Canteen with
his cousin, Mario de Mesa and another man named Nick De Vera.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While inside the canteen, he witnessed an
argument among Sgt. Santos, the victim, Mario de Mesa (accused-at-large) and <span class="SpellE">Yolly</span>" <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to him, the argument started when
he asked <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> Santos whom he voted for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Santos answered "<span class="SpellE">Oreta</span>", Mario de Mesa said, "<span class="SpellE">Tarantado</span>
ka <span class="SpellE">pala</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City <span class="SpellE">ito</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bakit</span> <span class="SpellE">si</span> <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span>
<span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">ibinoto</span> mo." The
victim reportedly answered, "<span class="SpellE">Tarantado</span> ka <span class="SpellE">rin</span>." The appellant said that he transferred to
another bench when an altercation ensued between the two.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After several moments, appellant claimed that
Mario de Mesa told him to run.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he
asked Mario why, appellant alleged that Mario told him that he stabbed a man,
which he assumed to be Sgt. Santos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
knew that Mario, a butcher, was carrying a knife when they entered the
canteen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As they were fleeing the place,
he heard three successive gun shots (TSN, pp. 45-49, 14 December 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">When asked if he knew of any reason why <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mapalad</span> would testify against him, he told the Court
that he had a previous quarrel with the latter (TSN, p. 50, 14 December
1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused admitted that <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> used to be his <span class="SpellE">gangmate</span>
and knew him for about three years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, the appellant said that he used to talk to
the victim about the elections whenever they saw each other, and that he did
not get angry when he was told by the victim that he voted for <span class="SpellE">Oreta</span> since he knew that he was from <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>
(TSN, p. 54-55, 14 December 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the Trial Court
convicted the appellant of the crime charged, holding that his denial of
participation in the crime cannot overcome the positive identification made by
the witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court also noted the
presence of treachery in the execution of the crime (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 19).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this appeal wherein the
appellant interposes the following Assignments of Error:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN RELYING
SOLELY ON THE TESTIMONIES OF THE PROSECUTION'S WITNESSES AND IN REJECTING THE
EVIDENCE FOR THE DEFENSE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A QUO</u> ERRED IN CONVICTING
'USED DOMINGO DE <st1:city><st1:place>MESA</st1:place></st1:city> OF MURDER
-INSTEAD OF HOMICIDE GRANTING WITHOUT ADMITTING THAT HE IS GUILTY.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This appeal lacks merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
thorough law of the records of the case indicates that the guilt of the
appellant has been demonstrated beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first error assigned by the appellant revolves around the credibility
of the prosecution witnesses as against his own testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this point, the established rule is that
the Appellate Courts will generally not disturb the factual findings of the
Trial Court, as the latter is in n better position to decide the same, having
heard the witnesses themselves and having observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during the trial (People v. <span class="SpellE">Olalia</span>, No.
50669, March 12, 1984, 128 SCRA 139).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the case at bar, the testimonies of the witnesses against the appellant were
straightforward, categorical and convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their declarations were unimpaired by material discrepancies even when
subjected to cross-examination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Against
this backdrop, the veracity of their testimonies must be accepted.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution witnesses positively identified the appellant as
the one who stabbed the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Beatrice
A. Perez testified:</p>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Domingo de Mesa sat
beside Sgt. Santos, what happened next, if any?</blockquote>

Sgt. Santos, if any, to the question asked by <span class="SpellE">Domeng</span>?</blockquote>

the right shoulder and simultaneously <span class="SpellE">Domeng</span> stabbed

underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Mapalad</span>
also told the Court:</p>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then, what happened next,
if any?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After that, Mario said
that: "<span class="SpellE">Baka</span> <span class="SpellE">akala</span> mo, <span class="SpellE">komo</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarhento</span> ka ay <span class="SpellE">natatakot</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span>
<span class="SpellE">iyo</span>."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what happened next,
after that?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And Sgt. Santos said:
"<span class="SpellE">Bakit</span>, <span class="SpellE">inaano</span> <span class="SpellE">ba</span> <span class="SpellE">kita</span>?", and he attempted
to stand up, but <u>Mario pushed him on the shoulder and simultaneously, Doming
stabbed him</u> (TSN, pp. 21-22, October 18, 1988, underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, there can be no doubt regarding the positive identification
of the appellant as the perpetrator of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is well-settled that greater weight is
given to the positive identification of the accused by the prosecution
witnesses than to the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> denial and
explanation concerning the commission of the crime (People v. Canada, No.
63728, September 15, 1986, 144 SCRA 121; People v. <span class="SpellE">Mostoles</span>,
Jr., L-38644, September 30, 1983, 124 SCRA 906).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Against such positive identification, appellant's
negative assertion that he did not kill the victim cannot prevail (People v. <span class="SpellE">Sabado</span>, No. 76952, December 22, 1988, 168 SCRA 681).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, it has been ruled that the early
identification of an accused by prosecution bespeaks of their spontaneity and
veracity v. Chavez, L-38603, September 30, 1982,117 SCRA 221)</p>

<p class="BODY">In an effort to discredit the positive identification made by
prosecution witnesses, the appellant emphasized that <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mapalad</span> was the victim's canteen helper for more than
two years, hence, his loyalty to his employer cannot be discounted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, in respect of <span class="SpellE">Beacrice</span>
A. Perez, he avers that being the sister-in-law of the victim, she had a strong
motive to testify falsely (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 38).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere relationship to the victim, however,
need not automatically tarnish the testimony of witnesses. "When there is
no showing of improper motive on the part of witnesses for testifying against
the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that they are
related to the victim does not render their clear and positive testimony less
worthy of full faith and credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
contrary, their natural interest in securing the conviction of the guilty would
delve them from implicating persons other than the culprits, for otherwise, the
latter would thereby gain immunity" (People v. <span class="SpellE">Radomes</span>,
No. 68421, March 20, 1986, 141 SCRA 548; People v. Canada, <u>supra</u>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant failed to point any specific
reason that motivated the witnesses to testify falsely against him other than
their relationship to the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
regards <span class="SpellE">Mapalad</span>, the appellant told the Court that he
had a previous quarrel with him over gambling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Suffice it to state that this is not a strong enough reason to discredit
<span class="SpellE">Mapalad’s</span> testimony specially in the light of its
obvious credibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's attempt to shift culpability to Mario de Mesa, who is
still at large, is a convenient device which cannot succeed in the face of
positive evidence against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the second assigned error, the Trial Court,
correctly appreciated the presence of treachery in the commission of the
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the records disclose, the
victim was suddenly stabbed by the appellant without any warning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although he was armed with a gun, he was
never given an opportunity to ward off the assault due to its suddenness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense cannot justifiably argue that the
heated discussion had placed the victim or his guard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After all, only a trivial matter was
involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the evidence discloses, the
victim was complete unprepared for the attack, was unable to offer any
resistance, nor make any move whatsoever in his defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attack was, therefore, carried out in a
manner that precluded any risk or retaliation to the appellant that could have
come from the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Treachery was
unquestionably present.</p>
