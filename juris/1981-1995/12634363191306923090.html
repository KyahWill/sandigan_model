<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Melba had known Nito
since the elementary grades.  While he
did not court her, Nito once wrote her a letter.  Melba also wrote him a letter dated September 20, 1972 wherein
she addressed </span>him as "Dearest Freddie" and related to him her
group's activities during the Malabog fiesta.  Calling him "Noy," Melba told Nito that she was staying with
the children of Tang Senen because she would go home from school at 6:00
o'clock and nobody could fetch her anymore ("wala na sa akin magsusundo
kaya natatakot akong umuuwi ng gabi").  Melba asked Nito when he would go home ("Kailan ba ang uwi
mo?") and ended the letter with "Eternally yours, Ne." Below
this, Melba wrote "Good Luck Good Health God Bless You" and
"I'll Never Change" in quotation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Late in the afternoon of October 12, 1973, Melba boarded a bus
from the Bicol University.  She alighted
at the waiting shed in Malabog, Daraga, Albay and walked to her home in
Lacag.  After walking about a kilometer
on the small trail, Nito suddenly appeared and pulled her towards the lower
portion of the area where there was a small uninhabited hut.  Nito dragged her for a distance of around
five meters from the trail.  Melba was
shouting and boxing Nito but she was not able to free herself from his hold as
he was "wrestling" with her.  While seated, Nito forced her to remove her panty tearing it in the
process as he continued boxing her and kneeling on her thighs.  Melba tried to push him and kept on moving
away even as he succeeded in laying on top of her and forcing his penis into
her vagina.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nito fled when somebody arrived who helped Melba gather her
things, including her umbrella.  Since
she was not feeling well, Melba "took some rest" and went home.  She was crying on her way home and when her
mother saw her soiled clothes and torn panty which she was not wearing anymore,
her mother went to the barangay captain to complain.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">That night, Melba was examined by Dr. Leonila Ante of the Albay
Provincial Hospital but because she was "not contented with the first
doctor,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
she submitted herself to another medical examination at the Rural Health Unit
in Daraga on October 16, 1973 by Dr. Rafael Navera who made the following
findings:</p>

<blockquote>"EXTERNAL FINDINGS:</blockquote>

<blockquote>-    Neck:  Two (2) finger nail marks right, 2 cms.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nito, however, presented evidence to the effect that the sexual
intercourse between him and Melba that late afternoon of October 12, 1973 was
with their mutual consent.  According to
Nito, Melba became his girlfriend in August 1972 and he would call her
"Ne" as he was "Noy" to her.  When she sent him the letter, he was working with Dr. Abis in
Manila but he went home towards the end of October on account of her
information that nobody could fetch her.  From then on, he would meet her at the waiting shed in Malabog and
accompany her to her home in Malada which is a sitio of Malabog.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 7, 1973, Melba sent word to Nito through her sister,
Evangeline, that she was sick.  Hence,
before going to her house, Nito bought milk, eggs and biscuits.  With a friend, Ariston Mercadero, Nito
proceeded to Melba's house.  Evangeline
left for the store.  When told that
their mother was in Daraga for the fiesta, Nito left his friend reading comics
in the balcony and he entered Melba's room which was separated from the balcony
by the sala.  While talking with each
other, Nito asked Melba if he "could use her and she consented." Nito
kissed her and while he was embracing her, she removed her panty and they
copulated.  Afterwards, they told each
other stories.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 11, 1973, at the waiting shed in Malabog, Melba told
Nito to break up with his other girlfriend from Alcala, Lilia Manzano.  Nito obliged and focused his attention on
Melba.  Because Melba was jealous of
that girl and had signified that she did not like him anymore, the following
day, October 12, 1973, Nito waited for Melba at the Malabog waiting shed in
hopes of reconciling with her, which did take place.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">He had been at the Malabog waiting shed since ten minutes before
5:00 o'clock when Melba arrived.  While
walking to Lacag, Nito asked Melba if he "could use her and she said,
yes." She put her books on the trail and he kissed her.  She embraced him as he began holding her
private parts.  Noticing that she was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">about to lie down, Nito told her that they
should go a little farther "below." Melba was smiling as they went
down the trail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">They were still standing while engaged in foreplay but as Melba
sat down, she removed her yellow panty.  As they were copulating, a certain Juan arrived.  Nito signalled him to go away by waving his hand.  Melba could not see Juan because he was
around ten meters "above her head." The area where they had sexual
intercourse was below the trail and dense "palomaria" or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"ipil-ipil" trees blocked the view
from the trail.  They were between these
trees and they were doing the act on the banana leaves which they had gathered
and used to keep themselves from being soiled as the carabao grass on the area
was sparse.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After copulation, Nito and Melba proceeded home.  On the way, Puring Luces, a relative of Melba,
who had apparently been told by Juan about what transpired below the trail,
called Nito <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">names.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

he ignored her and they continued walking.  Melba then told him to go home and she herself would go to her own home.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">To Nito's surprise, the police came that same night and took him
to the jail in Daraga municipal hall.  It was there that Nito learned that Melba had charged him with
rape.  The following <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">morning, his statement was taken.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It gave full credence to the testimony of the victim, pointing
out that the "supposed inconsistencies" therein "refer to
incidental details which do not affect the credibility of her main
asseverations." The court said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The defense has not convincingly established that in accusing
Alfredo Nito of such a serious offense, Melba had been actuated by some
ulterior motive which induced her to resort to mere fabrication to attain her
purpose.  The claim of the accused that
one reason why Melba signed the complaint is that she was under the moral
ascendancy of her mother and elder brothers who did not like her to marry a
poor and illiterate man because of her status as a BSEEd student teacher who
was about to become a professional, is simply, to say the least, too
preposterous and absurd to inspire credence.  For indeed there is neither rhyme nor reason for the Llarenas to
consider the marriage of Melba to a poor and illiterate man as a disgrace to
their family and yet be so vile and heartless to go to the extent of exposing
her to public ridicule, humiliation and obloquy as a victim of sexual assault
just to prevent such marriage.  But the
fact is, no satisfactory evidence exists in the record showing that Melba's
mother and elder brothers have harbored any ill-feeling against the
accused.  As the Court has stated
earlier, no true Filipina would ever go around in public unravelling facts and
circumstances of her sexual debauchery, if such were not true.  Apart from these, the Court believes that
the offended party's young mind and degree of understanding at the time were
still quite raw and not so comprehensive enough to be entrusted with such
confabulation too complicated and too evil for her to fully grasp.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, the contention of the defense that the sexual
intercourse between the accused and the victim on October 12, 1973, was
mutually agreed upon is utterly incredible as it conflicts with the common and
usual manner Filipino women deport and conduct themselves.  It is highly improbable that Melba Llarena
would agree to a coitus with the accused in an open space only five meters away
from an elevated trail, where they could be easily discovered by
passers-by.  An affair such as that
claimed by the defense is carried out in a discreet manner.  Besides, if Melba Llarena consented to have
coition with the accused, her conduct thereafter defies understanding.  For if it is true that the sexual act was
indeed mutually desired and performed, why did she complain not only to her
mother but also to the authorities, such that the accused was immediately
arrested from his house on the day following the incident.  Furthermore, the statement of the accused to
the Police on October 13, 1973 (Exhibit E) negates and contradicts this pretense
of the defense.  (This is followed by
excerpts from the sworn statement of Nito in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Bicol </span>dialect.) x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In English the above admissions of Alfredo Nito mean:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>In

remember?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yesterday,
Friday, October 12, 1973 at about 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon and it happened
there at Malabog, Daraga, Albay.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In
what particular place in Malabog, did you have sexual intercourse with Melba
Llarena?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On

<blockquote>Q -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>With
regards to this incident, was it really Melba's consent or did you force her?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A -<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
forced her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(Bicol:  </span>Pigfuerza ko <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">po).’<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The admissibility of Exhibit E has not been assailed by the defense
when the same was offered in the evidence by the prosecution.  Moreover, the accused did not bother to
explain his declarations therein despite the opportunities given him by the
Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defense likewise maintain that the testimony of Dra. Leonila
Ante proves that the complainant had a previous carnal experience.  The Court will go further than that and add
that the medico-legal certificate (Exhibit 5) issued by this physician reveals
that the hymen of Melba Llarena had old lacerations at 1, 9 and 11 o'clock
positions.  But these findings do not
preclude the commission of rape (People vs. Espiritu, No. L-63451, May 31,
1984).  Virginity of the offended party
is not an essential element of this crime (People vs. Mesias, et al., Nos.
L-40318-20, Feb. 29, 1984).  The fact
that the offended party was no longer a virgin is not a defense in a charge of
rape, provided that the sexual act was committed with force and violence
(People vs. Espiritu, supra; People vs. Mesias, et al., supra; People vs.
Santos, 94 SCRA 277), just like <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the
present case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The testimony of Juanito Nolasco has not improved the cause of his
defense.  This witness has categorically
admitted that he would have testified for the prosecution had he not been
rejected by the complainant.  But because
of his rejection by the offended party, he testified for the defense.  x x x.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court cannot give any weight to the testimony of this defense
witness who has offered to swear in favor of one side, and when he was
rejected, he swore in favor of the adverse side.  It is extremely dangerous to rely on the declaration of such
witness who has lost his sense of justice and truth."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thus, the lower court
disposed of the case as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is rendered pronouncing accused Alfredo
Nito guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as principal, of the felony of rape, and
sentencing him to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <u>perpetua</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Said accused is ordered to pay to Melba Llarena, the offended
party, the sum of P15,000.00 and to her parents, another P10,000.00, for moral
damages, with costs against the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nito interposed the instant appeal questioning the lower court's
findings that he employed force and violence upon the victim and that his guilt
has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case is not the ordinary rape case wherein no witnesses are
present to support or demolish the testimony of either the accused or the
victim.  In this case, both the
testimonies of the accused and the victim are corroborated by other
witnesses.  Melba's testimony is
supported by that of Jose Navarro who testified that he was walking on the
trail that afternoon of October 12, 1993 when he heard the scream of a woman
coming from below the trail.  Thus, he
proceeded to where the scream came from and saw a woman "being
wrestled" by a man.  He noticed
that the panty of the woman "was already removed."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Nito's testimony was buttressed by that of
Juanito Nolasco who, on that fateful October day, saw Nito and Melba embracing
and kissing each other.  He was
approximately ten (10) meters away from the couple who, at first, was
standing.  After the woman sat down on
the ground the man followed suit and they embraced each other.  As the woman lay down, Nito rolled down his
pants up to the knees.  Melba also
removed her panty and she had sexual intercourse with Nito.  As they were copulating, Melba was embracing
Nito and they did not detect that they were being watched.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Nolasco saw Melba's books on the side of the trail, some of which
had rolled down the sloping ground.  There were several "palomaria" or "ipil-ipil" trees
in the area but when Nito saw him, he signalled Nolasco to go away.  Melba did not see him and there was no other
person in the area at the time.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">According to Nolasco,
Melba at first asked him to testify but he eventually testified for Nito

incident, Melba's uncle went to his house and asked him to testify.  Hence, Nolasco executed the affidavit dated
October 16, 1973 wherein he stated that he saw a woman </span>embracing a man.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

However, before he executed the affidavit, Nolasco was told by Melba's mother

that he did not know their names.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Another piece of evidence
presented by the defense was </span>Nito's testimony on rebuttal that while
they were having their "sexual play," Melba glanced upward, saw
Nolasco and told Nito about his presence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Being contrary to Nito's earlier testimony that Melba could not see Juanito
because he was above her, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">lower
court obviously considered this as a mark of weakness of the defense evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">While the issue of credibility is clearly within the jurisdiction
of the trial court and its findings on this issue must generally be respected
on appeal unless certain facts of substance and value have been overlooked

in rape cases this rule must be considered in light of the following
principles:  (a) an accusation for rape
can be made easily but it is difficult to prove and much more difficult for the
person accused, though innocent, to disprove; (b) in view of the intrinsic
nature of the crime whereby only two (2) persons are usually involved, the testimony
of the complainant must be scrutinized with great caution, and (c) evidence for
the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot be allowed to
draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Upon a scrutiny of the details of the evidence at hand, we find
that although the defense evidence is weak, neither is the prosecution evidence
strong enough to merit a finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt.  Indeed, we find pieces of evidence which
strike negatively at the very essence of the crime - <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Dr. Ante's finding that
Melba had menstrual flow on October 12, 1973 was verified by Melba herself who
admitted that it was her fourth day of menstruation and that the bloodstains
found in her panty were caused by it.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> But, as Melba herself stated, her
dissatisfaction with the findings of Dr. Ante led her to submit to another
medical examination by Dr. Navera four days after the incident or on October
16, 1973.  We find, however, that Dr.
Navera's "external findings" that she had two fingernail marks on the
neck, abrasions on the tips of her hands, a 2-cm. </span>hematoma on the right
medial aspect of the thigh and 2-cm. abrasions on the bilateral aspect of her
buttocks scarcely proved the "continuous boxing" that Melba swore she
suffered from the hands of appellant.  Dr. Navera's medical certificate also shows that Melba "was not able
to move due to body pains and (she was) in a state of shock."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

And yet, Melba testified that after the incident on Friday, she went to school
"the following Monday," which was October 15, 1973, one day before
Dr. Navera examined <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">her.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">With regard to the use of force during the incident, worth noting
is the fact that apart from the repeated general statement that she was
"boxed continuously" by appellant, Melba did not specify the
particular part of the body where she was boxed.  If it were really true that appellant boxed her so that she would
submit to his lustful intention, she would have revealed the same as early as
the preliminary investigation of the case.  However, as the defense counsel pointed out at the trial, nowhere in the
transcripts of the preliminary investigation is there a narration about
appellant's having used his fist to consummate his bestial desire.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

On the other hand, Melba seemed to be so observant as to have noticed the
length and size of appellant's sex organ and to describe it during the
preliminary investigation although at the trial, she claimed to have seen it
only for "a fleeting<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> moment.”</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Jose Navarro's corroborative testimony was neither of any help to
the prosecution with regard to the punches suffered by Melba.  All he stated at the trial was that Melba
was shouting as she "wrestled" with appellant.  Asked to demonstrate how the two
"wrestled," Navarro obliged by showing that the right hand of
appellant was embracing the back of Melba while his left hand was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"holding or touching the right nipple
and (he was) kissing the woman on the neck.”</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Moreover, to an unbiased
mind, a reading of the testimony of Melba reveals that she was not the credible
witness that the lower court found her to be.  For one thing, on cross-examination, Melba admitted that she had known
appellant since </span>the elementary grades but she "did not mind"
him.  She flatly denied that he courted
her in the same breath that she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">categorically
denied that he wrote her letters.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> But after having been shown her letter to

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Considering the principle
that all doubts must be resolved in favor of the accused, these weak points in
the prosecution evidence must certainly tilt the scale in favor of the
appellant especially because the lower court gave credence to evidence which
should not have been considered against him.  This is the confession executed by the appellant before the Daraga
police which the lower court considered weighty enough because its offer </span>in
evidence was not objected to by the defense.  To recall, on October 13, 1973, the 1973 Constitution was in full force
and effect.  Sec. 20 of its Bill of
Rights which provides for the right of the accused to counsel during custodial
investigation should, therefore, be respected even when the accused is waiving
the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn39" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
While appellant's confession was sworn to before the municipal judge, there is
no indication at all that it was executed in the presence of appellant's
counsel.  Hence, said confession should
not have been given evidentiary value.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the heinous nature of the crime of rape, the heavy
hand of the law should make itself felt in order to send the message that the
same shall not be condoned, but rather condemned strongly by the
government.  Nonetheless, in the
prosecution of the crime, as in any other crime, moral certainty, though not
absolute certainty, is required of the proof requisite <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">to produce conviction of the accused.  By reasonable doubt is meant that doubt engendered by an </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">investigation </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the mind rest easy upon the certainty of guilt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, a sexual offender deserves no place in society, but
because the evidence adduced by the prosecution in this case failed to measure
up to the degree of proof required by law, we cannot convict the accused on the
basis thereof.  As the Court has
repeatedly observed, it is better to set a guilty man free than to incarcerate
an innocent one.</p>

There is no English translation in the record but the gist of the affidavit is
that while on his way home at around 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October
12, 1973, Nolasco saw scattered along the trail several books and an umbrella
and that when he looked below the trail he saw a man and a woman whose names he
did not know, with the woman embracing the man ("nahiling kong babae na
nakokopo kan lalake").</p>
