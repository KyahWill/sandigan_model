				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an automatic review of the decision of the then Circuit Criminal Court in Pasig, Rizal, finding Edito Petenia&nbsp; and Carlo Castañeda guilty of the crime of Robbery with Homicide and sentencing both to suffer the penalty of DEATH; to pay jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased, BONIFACIA GUANLAO, in the sum of P100,000; to pay P12,000 in moral damages, and another P12,000 in exemplary damages, and to pay proportional costs.<br><br>The Information alleges:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the 1st day of May, 1978, in Quezon City, Philippines, the above-named accused, conspiring together, with intent of gain and with violence against person, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, rob and divest BONIFACIA EUSTAQUIO GUANLAO, of her cash and valuable amounting to P75,000.00, Philippine Currency, and that by reason or on the occasion of the said Robbery said accused with intent to kill and without any justifiable cause, conspiring together, did then and there, wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously, attack, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of Bonifacia Eustaquio Guanlao, by then and there hitting her with an adobe stone on her head, thereby inflicting upon said Bonifacia Eustaquio Guanlao serious and mortal injuries which were the direct and immediate cause of her death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of the victim in such amount as maybe awarded under the provision of existing laws."</blockquote>After pleas of not guilty by the accused, trial ensued.&nbsp; After trial, the lower court rendered its decision, finding the following facts to have been proven from the evidence of record:<br><blockquote>"Edito Petenia, Carlo Castañeda and Romeo Lugon were employees of the victim, Bonifacia Eustaquio Guanlao, in her factory located at No. 52, 12th Avenue, Cubao, Quezon City.&nbsp; Petenia and Lugon were factory helpers while Castañeda was the family driver (Exh. "I-1", pp. 44-45, Rec.; pp. 14-15, tsn, June 15, 1978; p. 6, tsn, June 22, 1978).<br><br>"A day or two prior to the incident in question, particularly on April 30, 1978, Petenia, Castañeda and Lugon planned among themselves to kill Mrs. Guanlao and rob her of valuables (Exh. "I-1", Ibid.; pp. 60, 65-66, tsn., June 22, 1978; pp. 56-58, tsn., June 13, 1978).<br><br>"At about 9:00 o'clock in the morning of May 1, 1978, while Mrs. Guanlao was inside her bag factory, Petenia approached the victim and covered the victim's mouth with his hand.&nbsp; As she struggled, she was hit with an adobe stone from behind by Lugon (EXh. "A" to "A-3").&nbsp; As the victim staggered from the blow, Petenia delivered fistic blows on her.&nbsp; While the victim was lying mortally wounded on the ground, Lugon hit her again on the head with the same adobe stone while Petenia got another adobe stone and also hit the victim's head which caused her instantaneous death (Exhs. "E" &amp; "H", pp. 33-42, Rec., pp. 71-72, tsn., June 22, 1978).&nbsp; Simultaneously, Castañeda entered the victim's house and cut the telephone wire.&nbsp; Thereafter, he entered the victim's bedroom and took her handbag (Exh. "F-2") containing cash, jewelry and other valuables (Exh. "E-1", <i>Ibid</i>; Exh. "H-1", p. 41, Rec. p. 27, tsn., June 22, 1978).&nbsp; After killing the victim, Lugon and Petenia carried the corpse to a corner of the factory and covered it with used bags to prevent detection (p. 72, tsn., June 22, 1978; Exh. "H-1" <i>Ibid</i>).&nbsp; They then drove the Ford Fiera of the victim as their get-away vehicle with Castañeda on the wheels, abandoning it later at Tejeron Street, Makati, Metro Manila (pp. 13-15, 72, 73, tsn., Ibid).&nbsp; From there, the three proceeded to Pasay City where they boarded a JB Bus bound for Sorsogon.&nbsp; They went later to Samar, from there to Tacloban, Leyte and then to Barrio Tawagan, Oras, Eastern Samar where they divided the loot (pp. 73-74 tsn., June 22, 1978).&nbsp; Later Petenia went to hide in Barrio Villa Alvarez, Balud, Masbate, while Castañeda went to Barrio Buenavista, Bacon, Sorsogon (pp. 18-19, 74, tsn., <i>Ibid</i>).<br><br>"The body of the deceased was discovered at about 2:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day the crime was committed underneath the pile of bags in the warehouse of said bag factory.&nbsp; Detectives led by P/Lt. Cesar Dalanon arrived at the scene and took pictures of the victim as well as the surrounding areas (Exhs. "D" to "D-19").&nbsp; Police investigation and medico-legal reports revealed that the victim was hit a number of times on the head with two (2) adobe stones (Exh. "A" to "A-2") which were found at the scene of the crime and smeared with the victim's blood (pp. 49-67, tsn., June 13, 1978; pp. 3-5, June 9, 1978).<br><br>"On May 18, 1978, team of detectives led by P/Lt. Cesar Dalanon arrested Petenia at Barrio Villa Alvarez, Balud, Masbate.&nbsp; Upon his arrest, Petenia admitted to Lt. Dalanon his participation in the commission of the crime on May 1, 1978.&nbsp; He told Lt. Dalanon that two days before the commission of the crime, the three accused agreed to kill the victim and take her valuables (pp. 56-57, tsn., June 13, 1978).&nbsp; Petenia said, that after Lugon struck the victim on the head with an adobe stone, he (Petenia) delivered fistic blows on her.&nbsp; He volunteered to guide the police team to Oras, Eastern Samar for the apprehension of Lugon.&nbsp; However, the group failed to locate Romeo Lugon in said place (pp. 51-58, 59, tsn., June 13, 1978; p. 74 tsn., June 22, 1978).<br><br>"It was on May 31, 1978, when a team of policemen led again by Lt. Dalanon, with Petenia as guided, arrested Castañeda at Barrio Buenavista, Bacon, Sorsogon.&nbsp; Recovered from his possession at the time of arrest were personal belonging of the victim consisting of a Seiko wrist watch (Exh. "F"), a bunch of keys (Exh. "F-1"), a travelling bag ("F-2"), an abaca bag (Exh. "F-3"), a brown folder with business entries (Exh. "F-4") and assorted personal belongings, papers, pictures, letters, diary, etc. (Exh. "F-5" to "F-9"; pp. 11-13, tsn., June 13, 1979).&nbsp; Castañeda admitted to Lt. Dalanon having participated in the killing of the victim and having taken articles from the victim's house (p. 75, tsn., June 22, 1978; pp. 56-61, 69-70, tsn., June 13, 1978).<br><br>"Thereafter, appellants were brought back to Manila.&nbsp; When investigated by Detective Prudente Kaabay of Quezon City Police, Petenia and Castañeda voluntarily gave written statements admitting their participation in the commission of the crime".</blockquote>Both Edito Petenia and Carlo Castañeda assail the decision against them and submit that the lower court erred (1) in not rejecting their extrajudicial confessions (Exhs. "E", "G", “G-1”, "H"); (2) in finding that the crime was committed in conspiracy; and (3) in not acquitting them of the crime charged despite the presence of the exempting circumstance of uncontrollable fear.<br><br>We find no reason to disturb the finding of conviction.<br><br>Setting aside for the moment the constitutional requisites for the validity and admissibility of extra-judicial confessions, the fundamental rule is that a confession is presumed voluntary until the contrary is proved (People vs. Dorado, SCRA 53).&nbsp; The burden is on the defense to prove that a confession was obtained as a result of violence, intimidation, threat or promise of reward or leniency (People vs. Soligan, 101 SCRA 264; <i>People vs. Castañeda,</i> 93 SCRA 56; <i>People vs. Caramonte,</i> 94 SCRA 150; People vs. Ramos, 94 SCRA 842).&nbsp; We have scrutinized the records and We have found no evidence whatsoever to justify the claim that the extrajudicial confessions of the accused were extracted by force.&nbsp; There was no attempt to discredit the same during the trial; neither did appellants challenge their admissibility on grounds that they were extracted out of violence, torture or intimidation.&nbsp; Moreover, both appellants affirmed on the witness stand the truth and voluntariness of their confessions.<br><br>Carlo Castañeda testified in part as follows:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">"COURT:</div></td> <td width="90%"> <div align="justify">So it is true that what you have stated now is in accordance with that statement marked as Exhibit "H"?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Your Honor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">There is question here. ‘Sino ang pumatay kay Mrs. Bonifacia Guanlao?

This defense does not deserve serious consideration.&nbsp; For this exempting circumstance to be Invoked successfully, the following requisites must concur:&nbsp; (a) existence of an uncontrollable fear; (b) the fear must be real and imminent; and (c) the fear of an injury is greater than or at least equal to that committed.<br><br>Petenia categorically testified that Lugon did not have a knife at the time the crime was committed.&nbsp; He declared that he delivered fistic blows on the victim because of his fear that Lugon and Castañeda might hit him with hollow blocks.&nbsp; This is his testimony:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">"COURT:<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify"></div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">As a matter of fact it was Carlo Castañeda who testified who pointed to you a sharp pointed instrument that is why you did not participate in bumping the head of the victim?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">It is not true that there is a knife, your Honor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">How was you threatened by Carlo Castañeda? </div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Tinakot po nila ako at baka bagsakan ng hollow blocks, you Honor. <br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="center">x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x x x<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td colspan="2"><div align="justify">COURT:</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify">It is not true that Carlo Castañeda was being threatened by a knife or sharp pointed instrument by Romy?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">No, your Honor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">As a matter of fact, they are very close friends with each other after this incident?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A. </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, Your Honor."
