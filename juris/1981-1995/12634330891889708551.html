<p class="BODY">This letter-offer, hereinafter referred to as Exhibit “A”, was
prepared, typed and signed on 7 June 1973 in the office of Mr. Teodoro
Catindig, Senior Vice-President of the Consolidated Bank and Trust Corporation
(Solid Bank).<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue raised in this case is whether or not the
aforesaid letter-offer, as accepted by YKS, is a contract that binds the
PWCC.  The trial court ruled in favor of
the petitioner, but the respondent Court held otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose the following material operative facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">In its meeting in Cebu City on 30 June 1973, or twenty-three (23)
days after the signing of Exhibit “A”, the Board of Directors of PWCC
disapproved the same; the rejection is evidenced by the following Minutes
(Exhibit “10”):</p>

<blockquote>“the 10,000 bags of white cement sold to Yao Ka Sin Trading is sold
not because of the alleged letter-contract adhered to by them, but must be
understood as a new and separate contract, and has in no way to do with the
letter-offer which they (sic) distinct consideration, as the letter-contract
which they now hang on (sic) as consummated is by this resolution, totally
disapproved and is unacceptable to the corporation.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 5 July 1973, PWCC wrote a letter (Exhibit “1”) to YKS
informing it of the disapproval of Exhibit “A”.  Pursuant, however, to its decision with respect to the 10,000
bags of cement, it issued the corresponding Delivery Order (Exhibit “4”) and
Official Receipt No. 0394 (Exhibit “5”) for the payment of the same in the
amount of P243,000.00.  This is the same
amount received and acknowledged by Maglana in Exhibit “A”.</p>

<p class="BODY">YKS accepted without protest both the Delivery and Official
Receipts.</p>

<p class="BODY">While YKS denied having received a copy of Exhibit “1”, it was
established that the original thereof was shown to Mr. Henry Yao; since no one
would sign a receipt for it, the original was left at the latter's office and
this fact was duly noted in Exhibit “1” (Exhibit “1-A”).</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 August 1973, PWCC wrote a letter (Exhibit “2”) to YKS in
answer to the latter's 4 August 1973 letter stating that it is “withdrawing or
taking delivery of not less than 10,000 bags of white cement on August 6-7,
1973 at Asturias, Cebu, thru M/V Taurus.” In said reply, PWCC reminded YKS of
its (PWCC's) 5 July 1973 letter (Exhibit “1”) and told the latter that PWCC
“only committed to you and which you correspondingly paid 10,000 bags of white
cement of which 4,150 bags were already delivered to you as of August 1, 1973.”<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Unfortunately, no copy of the said 4 August 1973 letter of YKS was presented in
evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 August 1973, PWCC wrote another letter (Exhibit “3”)<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
to YKS in reply to the latter's letter of 15 August 1973.  Enclosed in the reply was a copy of Exhibit
“2”.  While the records reveal that YKS
received this reply also on 21 August 1973 (Exhibit “3-A”),<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
it still denied having received it.  Likewise, no copy of the so-called 15 August 1973 letter was presented
in evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 10 September 1973, YKS, through Henry Yao, wrote a letter<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
to PWCC as a follow-up to the letter of 15 August 1973; YKS insisted on the
delivery of 45,000 bags of white cement.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><sub><o:p></o:p></sub></p>

<p class="BODY">On 12 September 1973, Henry Yao sent a letter (Exhibit “G”) to
PWCC calling the latter's attention to the statement of delivery dated 24
August 1973, particularly the price change from P23.30 to P24.30 per 94 lbs.
bag net FOB Asturias, Cebu.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 November 1973, YKS sent a telegram (Exhibit “C”)<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
to PWCC insisting on the full compliance with the terms of Exhibit “A” and
informing the latter that it is exercising the option therein stipulated.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 3 November 1973, YKS sent to PWCC a letter (Exhibit “D”) as a
follow-up to the 2 November 1973 telegram, but this was returned to sender as <u>unclaimed</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As of 7 December 1973, PWCC had delivered only 9,775 bags of
white cement.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 February 1974, YKS wrote PWCC a letter (Exhibit “H”)
requesting, for the last time, compliance by the latter with its obligation
under Exhibit “A”.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 February 1974, PWCC sent an answer (Exhibit “7”) to the
aforementioned letter of 9 February 1974; PWCC reiterated the unenforceability
of Exhibit “A”.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 March 1974, YKS filed<b> </b>with the then Court of First
Instance of Leyte a complaint for Specific Performance with Damages against
PWCC.  The complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
was based on Exhibit “A” and was docketed as Civil Case No. 5064.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Answer with Counterclaim<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
filed on 1 July 1974, PWCC denied under oath the material averments in the
complaint and alleged that:  (a) YKS
“has no legal personality to sue having no legal personality even by fiction to
represent itself;” (b) Mr. Maglana, its President and Chairman, was lured into
signing Exhibit “A”; (c) such signing was subject to the condition that Exhibit
“A” be approved by the Board of Directors of PWCC, as corporate commitments are
made through it; (d) the latter disapproved it, hence Exhibit “A” was never
consummated and is not enforceable against PWCC; (e) it agreed to sell 10,000
bags of white cement, not under Exhibit “A”, but under a separate contract
prepared by the Board; (f) the rejection by the Board of Exhibit “A” was made
known to YKS through various letters sent to it, copies of which were attached
to the Answer as Annexes 1, 2 and 3;<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>

and Official Receipt<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
issued by PWCC, that only 10,000 bags were sold to it, without any terms or
conditions, at P24.30 per bag FOB Asturias, Cebu; (h) YKS is solely to blame
for the failure to take complete delivery of 10,000 bags for it did not send
its boat or truck to PWCC's plant; and (i) YKS has, therefore, no cause of
action.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Counterclaim, PWCC asks for moral damages in the amount of
not less than P10,000.00, exemplary damages in the sum of P500,000.00 and
attorney's fees in the sum of P10,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 24 July 1974, YKS filed its Answer to the Counterclaim.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Issues having been joined, the trial court conducted a pre-trial.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
On that occasion, the parties admitted that according to the By-Laws of PWCC,
the Chairman of the Board, who is also the President of the corporation, “has
the power to execute and sign, for and in behalf of the corporation, all
contracts or agreements which the corporation enters into,” subject to the
qualification that “all the president's actuations, prior to and after he had
signed and executed said contracts, shall be given to the board of directors of
defendant Corporation.” Furthermore, it was likewise stated for the record
“that the corporation is a semi-subsidiary of the government because of the
NIDC participation in the same, and that all contracts of the corporation
should meet the approval of the NIDC and/or the PNB Board because of an
exposure and financial involvement of around P10 million therein.”<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, PWCC presented evidence to prove that Exhibit
“A” is not binding upon it because Mr. Maglana was not authorized to make the
offer and sign the contract in behalf of the corporation.  Per its By-Laws (Exhibit “8”), only the
Board of Directors has the power “x x x (7) To enter into (sic) agreement or
contract of any kind with any person in the name and for and in behalf of the
corporation through its President, subject only to the declared objects and
purpose of the corporation and the existing provisions of law.”<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Among the powers of the President is “to operate and conduct the business of
the corporation according to his own judgment and discretion, whenever the same
is not expressly limited by such orders, directives or resolutions.”<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Per standard practice of the corporation, contracts should first pass through
the marketing and intelligence unit before they are finalized.  Because of its interest in the PWCC, the
NIDC, through its comptroller, goes over contracts involving funds of and white
cement produced by the PWCC.  Finally,
among the duties of its legal counsel is to review proposed contracts before
they are submitted to the Board.  While
the president may be tasked with the preparation of a contract, it must first
pass through the legal counsel and the comptroller of the corporation.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 20 November 1975, after trial on the merits, the court handed
down its decision in favor of herein petitioner, the dispositive portion of
which reads:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, judgment is hereby rendered:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In disregarding PWCC's theory, the trial court interpreted the
provision of the By-Laws -- granting its Board of Directors the power to enter
into an agreement or contract of any kind with any person <u>through</u> <u>the</u>
<u>President</u> -- to mean that the latter may enter into such contract or
agreement at any time and that the same is not subject to the ratification of
the board of directors but “subject only to the declared objects and purpose of
the corporation and existing laws.” It then concluded:</p>

<blockquote>“It is obvious therefore, that it is not the whole membership of
the board of directors who actually enters into any contract with any person in
the name and for and in behalf of the corporation, but only its president.  It is likewise crystal clear that this
automatic representation of the board by the president is limited only by the
'declared objects and purpose of the corporation and existing provisions of
law.'”<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It likewise interpreted the provision on
the power of the president to “operate and conduct the business of the
corporation according to the orders, directives or resolutions of the board of
directors and according to his own judgment and discretion whenever the same is
not expressly limited by such orders, directives and resolutions,” to mean that
the president can operate and conduct the business of the corporation according
to his own judgment and discretion as long as it is not expressly limited by
the orders, directives or resolutions of the board of directors.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court found no evidence that the board had set a prior limitation
upon the exercise of such judgment and discretion; it further ruled that the
By-Laws does not require that Exhibit “A” be approved by the Board of
Directors.  Finally, in the light of the
Chairman's power to “execute and sign for and in behalf of the corporation all
contracts or agreements which the corporation may enter into” (Exhibit “I-1”),
it concluded that Mr. Maglana merely followed the By-Laws “presumably both as
president and chairman of the board thereof.”<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, Exhibit “A” was validly entered into by Maglana and thus binds the
corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, however, ruled that the option to sell is not
valid because it is not supported by any consideration distinct from the price;
it was exercised before compliance with the original contract by PWCC; and the
repudiation of the original contract by PWCC was deemed a withdrawal of the
option before acceptance by the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both parties appealed from the said decision to the respondent
Court of Appeals before which petitioner presented the following Assignment of
Errors:<b><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">“I</p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE OPTION TO RENEW THE

Plaintiff's complaint is dismissed with costs.  Plaintiff is ordered to pay defendant corporation P25,000.00 exemplary damages,
and P10,000.00 attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Such conclusion is based on its findings, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“Before resolving the issue, it is helpful to bring out some
preliminary facts.  First, the defendant
corporation is supervised and principally financed by the National Investment
and Development Corporation (NIDC), a subsidiary investment of the Philippine
National Bank (PNB), with cash financial exposure of some P10,000,000.00.  PNB is a government financial institution
whose Board is chairmaned (sic) by the Minister of National Defense.  This fact is very material to the issue of
whether defendant corporation's president can bind the corporation with his own
act.<span style="font-size: 4pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Second</u>, for failure to deny under oath the following
actionable documents in support of defendant's counterclaim:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">1.  The resolution contained in defendant's
letter to plaintiff dated July 5, 1973, on the 10,000 bags of white cement
delivered to plaintiff was not by reason of the letter contract, Exhibit “A”,
which was totally disapproved by defendant corporation's board of directors,
clearly stating that ‘If within ten (10) days from date hereof, we will not
hear from you but you will withdraw cement at P24.30 per bag from our plant,
then we will deposit your check of P243,000.00 dated June 7, 1973 issued by the
Producers Bank of the Philippines, per instruction of the Board.’ (Annex “1” to
defendant's Answer).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">2.  Letter of defendant to plaintiff dated
August 4, 1973 that defendant ‘only committed to you and which you accordingly
paid 10,000 bags of white cement of which 4,150 bags were already delivered to
you as of August 1, 1973’ (Annex “2” of defendant's Answer).</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">3.  Letter dated August 21, 1973 to plaintiff reiterating defendant's letter
of August 4, 1973 (Annex “3” to defendant's Answer).<span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="">4.  Letter to stores dated August 21, 1973,</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">5.  Receipt from plaintiff (sic) P243,000.00 in
payment of 10,000 bags of white cement at 24.30 per bag (Annex “5” to
defendant's Answer).</p>

<blockquote>plaintiff is deemed to have admitted, not
only the due execution and genuiness (sic) of said documents, (Rule 8, Sec. 8,
Rules of Court) but also the allegations therein (Rule 9, Sec. 1, Rules of
Court).  All of the foregoing documents
tend to prove that the letter-offer, Exhibit “A”, was rejected by defendant
corporation's Board of Directors and plaintiff was duly notified thereof and
that the P243,000.00 check was considered by both parties as payment of the
10,000 bags of cement under a separate transaction.  As proof of which plaintiff did not complain nor protest until
February 9, 1974, when he threatened legal action.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Third</u>.  Maglana's
signing the letter?offer prepared for him in the Solidbank was made
clearly upon the condition that it was subject to the approval of the board of
directors of defendant corporation.  We
find consistency herein because according to the Corporation Law, and the
By-Laws of defendant corporation, all corporate commitments and business are
conducted by, and contracts entered into through, the express authority of the
Board of Directors (Sec. 28, Corp. Law, Exh “I” or “8”).</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Fourth</u>.  What Henry
Yao and Maglana agreed upon as embodied in Exhibit “A”, insofar as defendant
corporation is concerned, was an unauthorized contract (Arts. 1317 and 1403
(1), Civil Code).  And because Maglana
was not authorized by the Board of Directors of defendant corporation nor was
his actuation ratified by the Board, the agreement is unenforceable (Art. 1403
(1), Civil Code; Raquiza et al. vs. Lilles et al., 13 CA Rep. 343; Gana vs.
Archbishop of Manila, 43 O.G. 3224).</blockquote>

<blockquote>While it may be true that Maglana is President of defendant
corporation nowhere in the Articles of Incorporation nor in the By-Laws of said
corporation was he empowered to enter into any contract all by himself and bind
the corporation without first securing the authority and consent of the Board
of Directors.  Whatever authority
Maglana may have must be derived from the Board of Directors of defendant
corporation.  A corporate officer's
power as an agent must be sought from the law, the articles of incorporation
and the By-Laws or from a resolution of the Board (Vicente vs. Geraldez, 52
SCRA 227, Board of Liquidators vs. Kalaw, 20 SCRA 987).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It clearly results from the foregoing that the judgment appealed
from is untenable.  Having no cause of
action against defendant corporation, plaintiff is not entitled to any
relief.  We see no justification,
therefore, for the court <u>a</u> <u>quo's</u> awards in its favor.  x x x”<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

It also appears that, as gathered from the decision of the trial court, no <u>Yao</u>

capacity to sue.  Considering that private

same interests, the same witnesses, and the same evidence.  The name of the plaintiff would constitute
the only difference between the old trial and the new.  In our judgment there is not enough in a
name to justify such action.”</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And now to the merits of the petition.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Court correctly ruled that Exhibit “A” is not
binding upon the private respondent.  Mr. Maglana, its President and Chairman, was not empowered to execute
it.  Petitioner, on the other hand,
maintains that it is a valid contract because Mr. Maglana has the power to
enter into contracts for the corporation as implied from the following
provisions of the By-Laws of private respondent:</p>

<blockquote>a)  The power of the Board of Directors to “…
enter into (sic) agreement or contract of any kind with any person in the name
and for and in behalf of the <span style="">corporation
through its President, subject only to the declared objects and purpose of the
corporation and the existing provisions of law” (Exhibit “8- A”); and<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>b) The power of the
Chairman of the Board of Directors to “execute and sign, for and in behalf of
the corporation, all contracts or agreements which the corporation may enter
into”.  (Exhibit “I?<span style="">1”).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="color: windowtext;">And even </span>admitting,
for the sake of argument, that Mr. Maglana was not so authorized under the
By-Laws, the private respondent, pursuant to the doctrine laid down by this
Court in <i><span style="">Francisco vs. Government
Service Insurance System</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and <i><span style="">Board of Liquidators </span>vs. </i><i><span style="">Kalaw,</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">is
</span>still bound by his act for clothing him with apparent authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since a corporation, such as the private respondent, can act only
through its officers and agents, “all acts within the powers of said
corporation may be performed by agents of its selection; and, except so far as
limitations or restrictions may be imposed by special charter, by-law, or
statutory provisions, the same general principles of law which govern the
relation of agency for a natural person govern the officer or agent of a
corporation, of whatever status or rank, in respect to his power to act for the
corporation; and agents when once appointed, or members acting in their stead,
are subject to the same rules, liabilities and incapacities as are agents of
individuals and private persons.”<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"> </span></span>Moreover,
“x x x a corporate officer or agent may represent and bind the corporation in
transactions with third persons to the extent that authority to do so has been
conferred upon him, and this includes powers which have been intentionally
conferred, and also such powers as, in the usual course of the particular
business, are incidental to, or may be implied from, the powers intentionally,
conferred, powers added by custom and usage, as usually pertaining to the
particular officer or agent, and such apparent powers as the corporation has
caused persons dealing with the officer or agent to believe that it has
conferred.”<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While there can be no question that Mr. Maglana was an officer --
the President and Chairman -- of private respondent corporation at the time he
signed Exhibit “A”, the above provisions of said private respondent's By-Laws
do not in any way confer upon the President the authority to enter into
contracts for the corporation independently of the Board of <span style="">Directors.  That power is exclusively lodged in the latter.  Nevertheless, to expedite or facilitate the
execution of the contract, only the President -- and not all the members of the
Board, or so much thereof as are required for the act -- shall sign it for the
corporation.  This is the import of the
words </span><u>through</u> <u>the</u> <u>president</u> <span style="">in Exhibit “8-A” and the clear intent of the power of the chairman “to
execute and sign for and in behalf of the corporation all contracts and agreements
which the corporation may enter into” in Exhibit “I-1”.  Both powers presuppose a <u>p</u></span><u>rior</u>
<u>act</u> <span style="">of the corporation exercised
through the Board of Directors.  No
greater power can be implied from such </span>express, but limited, delegated
authority.  Neither can it be logically
claimed that any power greater than that expressly conferred is inherent in Mr.
Maglana's position as president and chairman of the corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although there is authority “that if the president is given
general control and supervision over the affairs of the corporation, it will be
presumed that he has authority to make contracts and do acts within the course
of its ordinary business,”<a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a>
We find such inapplicable in this case.  We note that the private corporation has a <u>general</u> <u>manager</u>
who, under its By-Laws has, <i><span style="">inter
alia</span></i><span style="">, </span>the following
powers:   “(a) to have the active and
direct management of the business and operation of the corporation, conducting
the same according to the order, directives or resolutions of the Board of
Directors or of the president.” It goes without saying then that Mr. Maglana
did not have a direct and active hand in the management of the business and
operations of the corporation.  Besides,
no evidence was adduced to show that Mr. Maglana had, in the past, entered into
contracts similar to that of Exhibit “A” either with the petitioner or with
other parties.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner's last refuge
then is his alternative proposition, namely, that private respondent had
clothed Mr. Maglana with the apparent power to act for it and had caused
persons dealing with it to believe that he was conferred with such power.  The rule is of course settled that
“[a]lthough an officer or agent acts without, or in excess of, his actual
authority if he acts within the scope of an apparent authority with which the
corporation has clothed him by holding him out or permitting him to appear as
having such authority, the corporation is bound thereby in favor of a person
who deals with him in good faith in reliance on such apparent authority, as
where an officer is allowed to exercise a particular authority with respect to
the business, or a particular branch of it, continuously and publicly, for a
considerable time.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn54" name="_ftnref54" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Also, “if a private corporation intentionally
or negligently clothes its officers or agents with apparent power to perform
acts for it, the corporation will be estopped to deny that such apparent
authority is real, as to innocent third persons dealing in good faith with such
officers or agents.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> This “apparent authority may result from (1)
the general manner by which the corporation holds out an officer or agent as
having power to act or, in other words, the apparent authority with which it
clothes him to act in general, or (2) the acquiescence in his acts of a
particular nature, with actual or constructive knowledge thereof, whether
within or without the scope of his ordinary powers.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn56" name="_ftnref56" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was incumbent upon the petitioner to prove that indeed the
private respondent had clothed Mr. Maglana with the apparent power to execute
Exhibit “A” or any similar contract.  This could have been easily done by evidence of similar acts executed
either in its favor or in favor of other parties.  Petitioner miserably failed to do that.  Upon the other hand, private respondent's <span style="">evidence overwhelmingly shows that no contract can be signed by </span>the
president without first being approved by the Board of Directors; such approval
may only be given after the contract passes through, at least, the comptroller,
who is the NIDC representative, and the legal counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases then of <i>Francisco vs. GSIS</i> and <i>Board of Liquidators
vs. Kalaw </i>are hopelessly unavailing to the petitioner.  In said cases, this Court found sufficient
evidence, based on the conduct and actuations of the corporations concerned, of
apparent authority conferred upon the officer involved which bound the
corporations on the basis of ratification.  In the first case, it was established that the offer of compromise made
by plaintiff in the letter, Exhibit “A”, was validly accepted by the GSIS.  The terms of the offer were clear, and over
the signature of defendant's general manager, Rodolfo Andal, plaintiff was
informed telegraphically that her proposal had been accepted.  It was sent by the GSIS' Board Secretary and
defendant did not disown the same.  Moreover, in a letter remitting the payment of P30,000 advanced by her
father, plaintiff quoted verbatim the telegram of acceptance.  This was in itself notice to the corporation
of the terms of the allegedly unauthorized telegram.  Notwithstanding this notice, GSIS pocketed the amount and kept
silent about the telegram.  This Court
then ruled that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“This silence, taken together with the unconditional acceptance of
three other subsequent remittances from plaintiff, constitutes in itself a
binding ratification of the original agreement (Civil Code, Art. 1393).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘ART. 1393. Ratification may be effected expressly or tacitly.  It is understood that there is a tacit
ratification if, with knowledge of the reason which renders the contract
voidable and such reason having <span style="">ceased,
the person who has a right to invoke it should execute an act which necessarily
implies an intention to waive his right.’”</span><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the second case, this Court found:</p>

<blockquote>“In the case at bar, the practice of the corporation has been to
allow its general manager to negotiate and execute contracts in its copra
trading activities for and in NACOCO's behalf <i>without </i>prior board
approval.  If the by-laws were to be
literally followed, the board should give its stamp of prior approval on all
corporate contracts.  But that board
itself, by its acts and through acquiescence, practically laid aside the by-­law
requirement of prior approval.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the given circumstances, the Kalaw contracts are valid
corporate acts.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The inevitable conclusion then is that Exhibit “A” is an
unenforceable contract under Article 1317 of the Civil Code which provides as
follows:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“ARTICLE 1317. No one may contract in the name of another without
being authorized by the latter, or unless he has by <span style="">law a right to represent him.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A contract entered into in the name of another by one who has no
authority or legal representation, or who has acted beyond his powers, shall be
unenforceable, unless<b> </b>it is ratified, expressly or impliedly, by the person
on whose behalf it has been executed, <span style="">before
it is revoked by the other contracting party.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second ground is based on a wrong premise.  It assumes, contrary to O<span style="">ur </span>conclusion above, that Exhibit “A”
is a valid <span style="">contract binding upon the
private respondent.  It was effectively
disapproved and rejected by the Board of Directors which, at the same time,
considered the amount of P243,000.00 received by Maglana as payment for 10,000
bags of white cement, treated as an entirely different contract, and forthwith
notified petitioner of its decision that “If within ten (10) days from date
hereof we will not hear from you but you will withdraw cement at </span>P24.30 <span style="">per bag from our plant, then we will deposit
your check of P243,000.00 dated June 7, 1973 issued by the Producers Bank of
the Philippines, per instruction of the Board.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn57" name="_ftnref57" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Petitioner received a copy of this
notification and thereafter accepted without any protest the Delivery Receipt
covering the 10,000 bags and the Official Receipt for the P243,000.00.  The respondent Court thus correctly ruled
that petitioner had in fact agreed to a new transaction involving only 10,000
bags of white cement</span><span style="font-size: 13pt;">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The third ground must likewise fail.  Exhibit “A” being unenforceable, the option to renew it would
have no leg to stand on.  The river
cannot rise higher than its source.  In
any event, the option granted in this case is without any consideration.  Article 1324 of the Civil Code expressly
provides that:</p>

<blockquote>“When the offerer has allowed the offeree a certain period to accept,
the offer may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance by communicating such
withdrawal, except when the option is founded upon, a consideration, as <span style="">something paid or promised.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">while Article 1749 of the same Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>“A promise to buy and sell a determinate thing for a price certain
is reciprocally demandable.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>An accepted unilateral promise to buy or to sell a determinate
thing for a price certain is binding upon the promissor if the promise is
supported by a consideration distinct from the price.”<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, even if it were accepted, it can not validly bind
the private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn58" name="_ftnref58" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fourth ground is, however, meritorious.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 8, Rule 8 of the Rules of Court provides:<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“SECTION 8.  <i>How to </i><i><span style="">contest genuineness </span>of such </i><i><span style="">documents</span></i><span style="">. -- </span>When an action or defense is founded upon a written
instrument, copied in or attached to the corresponding pleading as provided in
the preceding section, the genuineness and due execution of the instrument
shall be deemed admitted unless the adverse party, under oath, specifically
denies them, and sets forth what he claims to be the facts; but this provision
does not apply when <span style="">the </span>adverse
party does not appear to be a party to the instrument or when compliance with an
order for an inspection of the original instrument is refused.”<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that the petitioner is not a party to any of the
documents attached to the private respondent’s Answer.  Thus, the above quoted rule is not
applicable.<a style="" href="#_ftn59" name="_ftnref59" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[59]</sup></span></span></a>
While the respondent Court erred in holding otherwise, the challenged decision
must, nevertheless, stand in view of the above disquisitions on the first to
the third grounds of the petition.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
