				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1981</st1:date> Decision of the
then Court of First Instance of Manila affirming the <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1979</st1:date> Decision of the City Court of
Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner is the owner of an apartment situated at <st1:street><st1:address>3415
  F. Aguilar St.</st1:address></st1:street>, Bo. <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
being rented by herein private respondent since March, 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1974" day="22" month="1">January
 22, 1974</st1:date>, they executed a lease contract, and stipulated therein,
among others, that the monthly rental is One Hundred Eighty Pesos (P180<span class="GramE">,00</span>) to be paid within the first five (5) days of every
month.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1978</st1:date>,
the law office of <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> E. <span class="SpellE">Salalongos</span>
and Associates sent private respondent a letter, the body of <span class="GramE">which,</span>
reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Upon arrival of your <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Leonila</span> <span class="SpellE">Licuanan</span> from the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>, she found out that you have occupied
her garage situated at 3415 F. Aguilar, Bo. <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, Manila, which portion is not included in your lease
contract, and that despite her request that you remove the <span class="SpellE">aparador</span>
and other things which you have placed there as your stockpile, you have failed
and refused to do so, and instead showed arrogance by telling her that it will
need a court order before she removes the same and restores possession to you,
in violation of the terms of your contract.</p>

<p class="2Q">"In view thereof, we are giving you five (5) days from receipt
hereof within which to vacate the premises at 3415 F. Aguilar, otherwise, we
shall be constrained to file an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> suit
against you."</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, reacting to the said letter, on <st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="4">April 12, 1979</st1:date>, wrote the Civil
Relations Service, AFP, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, for help.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A portion of her letter, reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"May I have the honor to solicit the help of your good office
with regard to the letter I received from the law office of <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Sagalongos</span> &amp; Associates attached herein.</p>

<p class="2Q">"The accusations implied therein are not true and for your
information, Sir, I have faithfully paid my monthly rentals from the time we
occupied our apartment on March, 1973 up to March, 1978."</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 24, 1978, both petitioner and private respondent appeared
before Lt. Col. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Penala</span>, Hearing Officer of
the Civil Relations Service, but since the parties failed to reach any
agreement, Lt. Col. <span class="SpellE">Penala</span> placed the notation
"HOLD" on the pertinent document; and as precautionary measure,
instructed private respondent to deposit the amount of rental due for that
month so that she could not be charged with non-payment, which directive
private respondent readily complied with and she was issued the corresponding
receipt.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1978</st1:date>,
private respondent received a letter from Atty. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Melo</span>,
counsel for petitioner, demanding payment of the April to August, 1978 rentals
amounting to P900.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="13" month="9">September 13, 1978</st1:date>,
petitioner filed Civil Case No. 037226-V with the City Court of Manila, Branch
VII, presided over by Hon. Priscilla C. <span class="SpellE">Mijares</span>,
against private respondent for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> with
damages (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 11-13).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same, petitioner alleged, among
others, that private respondent had failed to pay her monthly rentals from
April to September, 1978, amounting to P1<span class="GramE">,080.00</span>; that
a demand letter dated August 23, 1978, was sent and received by private
respondent on August 30, 1978, wherein it is demanded that she pay her rentals
in arrears and to vacate the premises; and that despite repeated demands,
written and verbal, she refuses to pay her rentals in arrears and to vacate the
premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="9">September 27, 1978</st1:date>,
private respondent filed her answer (Ibid., pp. 14 - 17).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same, private respondent, among
others, denies that she failed in paying her monthly rentals, claiming that
petitioner has refused the rental being tendered and that upon advice of the
Office of the Civil Relations, AFP, she deposited her monthly rentals with that
office, for the months of April to September, 1978, inclusive at P180.00 a
month; and that she admits having received the letter of demand dated August
23, 1978, and claims that upon receipt of the said letter, she called up by
telephone petitioner's counsel, Atty. Manuel <span class="SpellE">Melo</span>,
informing him that the rentals due for the months of April to August, 1978 have
been deposited with the Office of Civil Relations, AFP, and that petitioner can
withdraw the said amount due from the said office.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, in a Decision dated <st1:date year="1979" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1979</st1:date>, ruled in favor of private respondent
(Ibid., pp. 37-42).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the said decision reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"In view thereof, the complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> with damages is hereby dismissed for lack of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition for consignation
having been rendered moot and academic, said petition is also hereby
dismissed."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed the decision, but the then Court of First
Instance of Manila, presided over by herein respondent judge, in a Decision <span class="GramE">dated</span> <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="10">October 15,
 1981</st1:date>, affirmed the appealed judgment (Ibid., pp. 71-74).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">decretal</span>
portion of the said decision reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, the decision of the lower Court dismissing the
instant cases for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> with damages and
for consignation is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Aida Pineda, is
hereby ordered to pay the plaintiff the monthly rentals as provided for in the
lease contract for all the succeeding months from September, 1981."</p>

<p class="BODY">A Motion for Reconsideration was filed (Ibid., pp. 75-77), but
the same was denied in an Order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="2">February
 18, 1982</st1:date> (Ibid., pp. 92-93).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner raised six (6) assignments of error to wit:</p>

<p class="2Q">"Error 1, the finding as valid and legal 'consignation'
Pineda's deposit with the Office of Civilian Relations of the Armed Forces at
Camp <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, her rent due to <span class="SpellE">Licuanan</span>,
instead of making proper CONSIGNATION with a court or with a bank as provided
by law.</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Error 2, the finding as sufficient and
valid in law the testimony of Pineda one year after the alleged deposit with
the Army.</span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Error 3, in affirming the lower Court's
grave legal error of injecting a totally outlandish matter into the case and
improperly converting the same to form part of the ground for its erroneous
decision.</span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Error 4, in not finding as REASONABLE COMPENSATION for
illegally detained property the payments made by Pineda to <span class="SpellE">Licuanan</span>
which were delayed far beyond the three months at any one time provided by the
rental law.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Error 5, in finding as bona fide rent what Pineda paid which
was delayed for sixteen months (16) from October of 1978 to January of 1980,
which was five times the three (3) months at any one time provided by law.</p>

<p class="2Q">"Error 6, being germane to Error 1 supra, but earlier omitted
by inadvertence, is in finding that Pineda tendered her rent payment to <span class="SpellE">Licuanan</span> but that <span class="SpellE">Licuanan</span>
refused to accept the same."</p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not private
respondent's deposit of the rentals due to petitioner with Civil Relations
Service, now Office for Civil Relations, AFP, is a valid consignation.</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue was already answered in the negative by this Court in
the case of <span class="SpellE">Landicho</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tensuan</span>
(150 SCRA 410, 415 [1987]) wherein it stated -</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">"Their protestation that they deposited the
rentals due though belatedly in the Office of then Presidential Assistant <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> Zamora does not help their cause at all.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law prescribes that such consignation or
deposit of rentals should be made with the Court and/or under Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25 in the bank and
not elsewhere."</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, it must be stated that in the case of <span class="SpellE">Soco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Militante</span> (123 SCRA 160,
166-167 [1983]), this Court ruled that the <span class="SpellE">codal</span>
provisions of the Civil Code dealing with consignation (Articles 1252-1261)
should be accorded a mandatory construction -</p>

<p class="2Q">"We do not agree with the questioned decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the essential requisites of a
valid consignation must be complied with fully and strictly in accordance with
the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Articles 1256
to 1261, New Civil Code.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
these Articles must be accorded a mandatory construction is clearly evident and
plain from the very language of the <span class="SpellE">codal</span> provisions
themselves which require absolute compliance with the essential requisites
therein provided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Substantial compliance
is not enough for that would render only directory construction to the
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The use of the words ‘shall’ and
‘must’ which are imperative, operating to impose a duty which may be enforced,
positively indicated that all the essential requisites of a valid consignation
must be complied with.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Civil Code
Articles expressly and explicitly direct what must be essentially done in order
that consignation shall be valid and effectual. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span class="GramE">.."</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, in the said <span class="SpellE">Soco</span> case, this
Court enumerated the requirements prescribed by law for a valid consignation
(p. 173).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One of the given requirements
is that - after consignation had been made, the person interested was notified
thereof (Art. 1178, Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
reason for such a requirement was given by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It stated -</p>

<p class="2Q">"The reason for the notification to the persons interested in
the fulfillment of the obligation after consignation had been made, which is
separate and distinct from the notification which is made prior to the
consignation, is stated in <span class="SpellE">Cabanos</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Calo</span>, G.R. No. L-10927, <st1:date year="1958" day="30" month="10">October 30, 1958</st1:date>, 104 Phil. 1058, thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘There should be notice to the creditor prior
and after consignation as required by the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this is obvious, namely, to
enable the creditor to withdraw the goods or money deposited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it would be unjust to make him suffer
the risk for any deterioration, depreciation or loss of such goods or money by
reason of lack of knowledge of the consignation.’" (p. 181)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, a perusal of the records will readily show
that private respondent failed to comply with this requirement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that petitioner was present
when the hearing officer of the Office for Civil Relations, AFP, instructed
private respondent to deposit the April rental, it will be noted that
petitioner thereafter was never notified that a deposit was made in the said
office; and in the succeeding monthly rentals, no tender of payment was made to
petitioner, nor was she given any notice that consignation will be made or that
consignation had been made.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1981</st1:date> Decision of the then Court of First
Instance of Manila is REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the respondent is ordered to
vacate the premises and to pay all accrued rentals.</p>
