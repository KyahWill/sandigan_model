Appeal from the decisions of the Government Service Insurance System and
 Employees Compensation Commission denying the claim for death 
compensation benefits of herein petitioner on the ground that "the cause
 of death of the late Jovencio A. Silencio was attributed to 
cardio-respiratory arrest due to lymphosarcoma with multiple metastasis 
which was not shown to be work-oriented and, therefore, not compensable 
under P.D. No. 626, as amended."
<p>
Jovencio A. Silencio was an enlisted man of the Armed Forces of the 
Philippines (Philippine Army) starting as a private in February 1950 at 
the age of 24. He was a master sergeant at the time of his death on May 
27, 1980, after several promotions in the course of his continued 
service. In 1950, he married Estrella Silencio with whom he had six (6) 
children, namely: Jovencio, Jr., Susan, Rolando, Romel, Nora and 
Maritess, all surnamed Silencio.
</p><p>
When he was in the service, Sgt. Silencio was assigned as driver of his 
military unit from June 1977 to August 1979, aside from his regular 
duties as a soldier. Later, he felt bodily pains and was confined at the
 AFP Medical Center where he was treated of an "on and off productive 
cough with hemoptysis", and a mass of flesh was also noted over his 
"left scapular area". Further examination shows that he was suffering 
from pulmonary tuberculosis and he was given anti-TB therapy. Later, 
because of his frequent coughing and complaints of pain on his left 
upper extremity, it was found that Silencio was afflicted with an 
ailment called "lymphosarcoma" with multiple metastasis. Despite 
medication and proper medical care, the condition of Silencio turned for
 the worst and, on May 27, 1980, he died.
</p><p>
His death was attributed to cardio-respiratory arrest due to lymphosardoma with multiple metastasis.
</p><p>
His widow, herein petitioner Estrella A. Vda. de Silencio filed a claim 
for death compensation benefits under PD No. 626, as amended, with 
respondent Government Service Insurance System (GSIS). Respondent GSIS 
denied the claim on the ground that "lymphosarcoma" is not an 
occupational disease and the decedent's risk of con足tracting the illness
 was not increased by his working condition as a soldier. Likewise, 
respondent GSIS denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration.
</p><p>
Appeal to respondent Employees Compensation Commission was dismissed and the decision of the GSIS was affirmed.
</p><p>
The issue in this case is whether or not the death of Jovencio A. 
Silencio due to lymphosarcoma with mul足tiple metastasis is compensable 
under PD No. 626, as amended.
</p><p>
We find no merit in the petition. The late Jovencio A. Silencio died of 
"cardio-respiratory arrest due to lymphosarcoma with multiple 
metastasis", not of pulmonary tuberculosis. While it is true that 
earlier he was treated at the military hospital of pulmonary 
tuberculosis he recovered from said ailment after he had been given 
anti-TB therapy. In his death certificate and/or in his medical records 
it was not shown that pulmonary tuber足culosis has something to do with 
or contributed to his death.
</p><p>
Under paragraph 1 of PD No. 626, as amended, a compensable sickness or disease is defined, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(1)  'Sickness' means any illness definitely accepted as an occupational disease listed by the Commission, <em>or
 any illness caused by employment, subject to proof that the risk of 
contracting the same is increased by the working conditions</em>" (Italics ours for emphasis). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
And, Section 1 (b), Rule III of the Rules of Employees Compensation Commission, provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 1 (b). For the sickness and the resulting disability or 
death to be compensable, the sick足ness must be the result of an 
occupational disease listed under Annex 'A' of these Rules with the 
conditions set therein satisfied; <em>otherwise, the employee must prove that the risk of contracting the disease is increased by the working conditions</em>" (Emphasis through Italics ours). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is clear that the illnesses or the diseases which are not listed as 
compensable diseases by the Employees Compensation Commission, are, 
nevertheless, recoverable provided that the employee submits proof that 
the risk of contracting the same is increased by his working conditions.
 In the case at bar, petitioner failed to present evidence to sustain 
her claim that decedent's working conditions resulted, directly or 
indirectly, in getting the ailment which finally led to his death.
</p><p>
Thus, respondents are justified in rejecting the claim of petitioner 
because lymphosarcoma with multiple metastasis is not an occupational 
disease since it does not usually and directly result from the 
occupation or profession of a soldier. In short, it is not 
service-connected; the risk of contracting said disease was not 
increased by the working conditions concomitant with the decedent's' 
employment.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the petition is DISMISSED and the decisions of the 
Government Service Insurance System and the Employees Compensation 
Commission denying the claim are affirmed. No costs.
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Gutierrez, Jr., </em>and <em>De La Fuente, JJ., </em>concur.
