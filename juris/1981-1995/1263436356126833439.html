the most pernicious evils that has ever crept into our society.  More often than not the young, who
constitute the greater majority of the populace, are the victims.  It is of common knowledge that drug addicts
become useless if not dangerous members of society and in some instances turn
out to be among the living dead.  This is
the reason why the courts and law enforcement agencies should continue in their
relentless campaign not merely to minimize but to totally eradicate the evil
before it is too late.  And everyone
must be involved in this drive if we were to succeed.  The peddlers of drugs are actually agents of destruction.  They deserve no less than the maximum
penalty.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">At the same time, we
cannot close our eyes to the many reports of evidence being planted on unwary
persons either for extorting money or exacting personal </span>vengeance.  By the very nature of anti-narcotics
operations, the need for entrapment procedures, the use of shady characters as
informants, the ease with which sticks of marijuana or grams of heroin can be
planted in pockets or hands of unsuspecting provincial hicks, and the secrecy
that inevitably shrouds all drug deals, the possibility of abuse is great.  Courts must also be extra vigilant in trying
drug charges lest an innocent person is made to suffer the unusually severe
penalties for drug offenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

Metro-Manila and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, without being authorized by law, did then and there
wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously sell and seliver (sic) to Pat. Reynaldo

the present appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">The antecedent facts are,
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">According to the
prosecution, at about 9:00 o'clock in the evening on December 16, 1989, Lt.
Norberto Surara, Chief of the Anti-Narcotics Unit of the Kalookan City Polite
Station, called a meeting at his office.  Present at the meeting were Sgt. Juan Grajo, Cpl. Agapito Quimson, Sgt.
Manuel Buenaobra, Pfc. Reynaldo Ventinilla, Cpl. Antonio Cortez, Police Aide
Garcia, Pat. Eliseo Gargaritano, Pfc. Raymundo Padpad and others.  The meeting was held because of reports that
a certain Philip of Sta. Lucia St., Kalookan City, accused-appellant herein, is
engaged in the illicit selling of prohibited drugs.  Lt. Surara then planned a buy-bust operation with
accused-appellant as the target.  He
showed to the members of the team a P100.00 bill as buy-bust money and handed
it over to Pfc. Padpad, whom he designated as poseur-buyer.  Pfc. Padpad wrote the letter "T"
inside one of the number "0" in the P100.00 bill (Exhibit
"A").<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">The team of policemen
proceeded to Sta. Lucia St. aboard a jeep and a land cruiser.  Upon arrival at the designated area at about
1:30 o'clock in the morning on December 17, 1989, the policemen alighted and
positioned themselves at strategic places while Pfc. Padpad proceeded to the
house of accused-appellant.  The
policemen saw Pfc. Padpad talking to accused-appellant.  After a while, Pfc. Padpad and
accused-appellant left the place on a motorcycle driven by the latter.  They proceeded to the Mini Park along M.
Hizon St., Kalookan City.  The </span>policemen
followed aboard their vehicles.  They
stationed themselves in places near the park in order to observe the movements
of Pfc. Padpad and accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The policemen saw former policeman Emmanuel Dizon and Pat.
Edgardo Adawag at the Mini Park talking to each other.  Pat. Gargaritano saw Pfc. Padpad hand over
something to accused-appellant.  In
turn, accused-appellant approached Dizon and handed over the same to the
latter.  At the same time, Dizon gave
something to accused-appellant, who handed over something to Pfc. Padpad.  As soon as accused-appellant handed over to
Pfc. Padpad that something which the former got from Dizon, Pfc. Padpad grabbed
his hands.  Instantly, the back-up
policemen approached accused-appellant Pat. Gargaritano grabbed the gun from
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">waist </span>of Dizon, recovered the
buy-bust money and confiscated two (2) sticks of marijuana from him.  Pat. Ventinilla grabbed the service gun of Pat.
Adawag and confiscated a bottle containing suspected Methamphetamine
Hydrochloride from him.  It was about
2:00 o'clock in the morning when the arrests were made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the policemen brought accused-appellant, Dizon and
Adawag, together with all the confiscated articles to Cpl. Daniel del Rosario
of the Anti-Narcotics Unit of the Kalookan City Police Station.  Pat Gargaritano and Pfc. Ventinilla executed
a joint affidavit (Exhibit "B<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">")
</span>while Pfc. Padpad executed a separate sworn statement (Exhibit
"D").  Cpl. del Rosario then
prepared a letter referral for inquest purposes (Exhibit "J").</p>

<p class="BODY">Beverly Eloria-Vidanes, Forensic Biologist of the NBI Forensic
Chemistry Section, received from Pfc. Padpad a letter request for examination
of an aluminum foil with white granules.  She examined the contents of the foil and then prepared a certification
stating that the specimen was positive for Methamphetamine Hydrochloride
(Exhibit "G").  After
conducting the spectrum test, she issued a final report confirming her earlier
finding (Exhibit "H").</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented Pfc. Ventinilla and Pat. Gargaritano as
main witnesses.  Pfc. Padpad was not
able to testify because he died in a stabbing incident sometime in June, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dizon and Pat. Adawag were charged separately.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the part of the defense, accused-appellant contends that at
1:30 o'clock in the morning on December 17, I989, he was riding on his
motorcycle along Roxas St. between 11th and 12th Avenues, Kalookan City.  His path was blocked by Pat. Gargaritano,
Pfc. Mendoza and Pfc. Ventinilla, who were riding in a taxi cab.  He was frisked by the policemen but nothing
was found on his person.  Nevertheless,
the policemen forced him to board the taxi cab and he was brought to the LRT
station at Monumento.  He was told to
alight from the taxi cab.  After twenty
(20) minutes, he was put aboard a service cruiser and handcuffed.  He was then brought to M. Hizon St.,
Kalookan City, near the Mini Park.  The
service cruiser stopped in front of Dizon who was standing nearby.  Pfc. Ventinilla informed Dizon that they are
conducting "Operation Kapkap" and frisked him.  A gun was confiscated from him.  The policemen also arrested in the area Pat.
Adawag and the latter's companion named Alvin Tong.  During the arrests of Dizon and Adawag, accused-appellant was
handcuffed inside the service cruiser.  Later, he was brought to the Kalookan City Police Headquarters.  He does not know the reason for his arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant submits that the trial court gravely erred in
admitting the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">August </span>8, 1990
testimony of Pat. Gargaritano on the ground that the prosecution did not first
offer it at the time he was called to the witness stand, in contravention of
the mandatory provisions of Sections 34 and 35, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules
on Evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">presumption of </span>regularity in
the performance of duty has been rebutted by the weak and insufficient
testimonies of Pat. Gargaritano and Pfc. Ventinilla and the straightforward and
detailed testimony of accused-appellant.  The policemen had a motive in imputing the offense on him, that is, upon
learning that his motorcycle was not registered and that he has no license to
drive it, they planned to get it from him.  Granting <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">arguendo</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>that the evidence for the prosecution
is not worthless, nevertheless, the case at bar involves inducement or
instigation that justifies the acquittal of accused-appellant.  It is the claim of Pfc. Ventinilla that Pfc.
Padpad and accused-appellant talked for more or less 15 to 20 minutes.  If this were true, it is reasonable to infer
from the length of time of the supposed conversation that Pfc. Padpad was
engaged in inducing accused-appellant to commit the offense.  Accused-appellant concludes that there are
strong grounds for his acquittal in view of the failure of the prosecution to prove
that he committed the offense charged.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">The Office of the
Solicitor General maintains that the circumstances pointing to the guilt of
accused-appellant are borne by the evidence on record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">We do not think so.  In fact, we find that the trial court erred
in convicting accused-appellant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Admittedly, the
prosecution failed to formally offer in evidence the August 8, </span>1990
testimony of Pat. Gargaritano at the time he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">was </span>called to testify.  Nevertheless, the counsel of accused-appellant, at the inception of the
direct examination of Pat. Gargaritano, informed the trial court that:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. LAGMAN:</blockquote>

<blockquote>To obviate lengthy
questions regarding his membership in the Caloocan Police Station, we would
admit his membership and that he was even on duty on December 16, 1989, your
Honor.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">When it was his turn to cross-examine
Pat. Gargaritano, he manifested that said testimony is inadmissible in
evidence, citing Sections 34 and 35, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules on
Evidence.  The trial court interpreted
the rules liberally and allowed the prosecution to make a belated offer of said
testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned testimony of Pat. Gargaritano is admissible in
evidence although it was not formally offered at the proper time because the
counsel of accused-appellant, by admitting Pat. Gargaritano's membership in the
Caloocan <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Police Station and that he was
on duty on December 16, 1989, is deemed to have waived his objection to the
admissibility thereof.  The belated
offer by the prosecution is not even necessary in view of said waiver.  In the recent case of People v. Java,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> which involves a similar issue, this Court
enunciated the rule that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Indeed, Section 34, Rule 132 of the Revised Rules of Court
requires that for evidence to be considered, it should be formally offered and
the purpose specified.  This is
necessary because a judge has to rest his findings of fact and his judgment
only upon the evidence offered by the parties at the trial (citing People v.
Pecardal, G.R. No. 71381 [1986]).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the new procedure as spelled out in Section 35 of the said
rule which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">became effective </span>on
July 1, 1989, the offer of the testimony of a witness must be made at the time
the witness is called to testify.  The
previous practice was to offer the testimonial evidence at the end of the trial
after all the witnesses had testified.  With the innovation, the court is put on notice whether the witness to
be presented is a material witness and should be heard, or a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">witness who would be testifying on irrelevant
matter or on facts already testified to by other witnesses and should
therefore, be stopped from testifying further.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, we note that Pastor Valdez was not one of the
witnesses originally intended to be presented by the prosecution.  He was merely called to the witness stand at
the latter part of the presentation of the prosecution's evidence.  There was no mention why his testimony was
being presented.  <u>However,
notwithstanding that his testimony was not formally offered, its presentation
was not objected to either</u>.  Section
36 of the aforementioned Rule requires that an objection in the course of the
oral examination of a witness should be made as soon as the grounds therefor
shall become reasonably apparent.  Since
no objection to the admissibility of evidence was made in the court below, an
objection raised for the first time on appeal will not be considered.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
(underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">It is clear in the
aforementioned disquisition that the testimony of a witness, although not
formally offered in evidence, may still be admitted by the courts, <u>if its
presentation was not objected to by the opponent</u>.  It is argued that in the present case, the counsel of
accused-appellant objected to the admissibility of the questioned testimony
after the direct examination of Pat. Gargaritano.  We find this argument unavailing.  It is immaterial that he raised his objection later because he
has already waived his right to object.  We reiterate that the questioned testimony of Pat. Gargaritano is
admissible in evidence.  To
accused-appellant’s favor, </span>however, the admissibility of evidence is
quite different from the weight and sufficiency that may be accorded to it by
the courts.  In other words, the
questioned testimony of Pat. Gargaritano will still be subject to the rule on
weight and sufficiency of evidence, as we shall discuss later.</p>

<p class="BODY">In finding accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the crime charged against him, the trial court rationalized:</p>

<blockquote>“The testimonies of Pat. Eliseo Gargaritano were clear and
positive.  Pfc. Ventinilla corroborated
the testimonies of Pat. Gargaritano on most of its important points.  Both identified the accused Philip Cadocio
during the trial.  Pfc. Ventinilla
testified that the placed (sic) where the accused Philip Cadocio <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">were (sic) arrested at the Mini Park along M.
Hizon St., Kalookan City was visible from the places where the policemen were
hiding in strategic positions.  (TSN-July 30, 1990, p. 12).  <u>Both
policemen did not actually see what Emmanuel Dizon gave to the accused Philip
Cadocio and what Philip Cadocio later handed to Pfc. Padpad</u>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>In his testimony given on August 27, 1990, Pat. Gargaritano
testified that after the apprehension of Philip, he came to know that what
Philip handed to Pfc. Padpad immediately before their arrest was
Methamphetamine Hydrochloride contained in an aluminum foil.  Pat. Gargaritano saw Pfc. Padpad turn over
to the investigator, Cpl. Daniel del Rosario, the aluminum foil (Exhibit “F”),
which Pat. Gargaritano identified during the trial.  Pat. Gargaritano was able to identify the subject aluminum foil
because of the marking ‘P.C.B.’ which he saw Cpl. Del Rosario wrote on it at
their office.  The letters 'P.C.B.' are
the initials of the accused.  (TSN-Aug.
27, 1990, pp. 3-5).  Pfc. Ventinilla
also testified that he came to know later that the thing given by the accused
Philip to Pfc. Padpad just before the accused Philip was arrested, was an
aluminum foil containing Methampetamine (sic) Hydrochloride.  When the arresting officers turned over Philip,
Adawag and Dizon to the investigator, Cpl. (sic) Ventinilla saw Pfc. Padpad
turn over to the investigator, Cpl. Del Rosario an aluminum foil (Exhibit
"F") containing Metamphetamine Hydrochloride.  Pfc. Ventinilla identified the subject aluminum
foil because of the markings written by Investigator del Rosario.  (TSN-Sept. 12, 1990, pp. 6-9).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The subject aluminum foil containing Metharnphetamine Hydrochloride
was turned over by Pfc. Padpad personally to Cpl. del Rosario.  Cpl. Del Rosario identified the initials of
the accused Philip which he wrote on the foil with the use of a blue pen at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">their office.  </span>(TSN-Sept. 21, 1990, pp. 13-14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The records show that it was Pfc. Raymindo (sic) Padpad who
personally brought the subject aluminum foil marked Exhibit “F” to the NBI
Forensic Chemistry Section at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">11:00 am </span>on
December 17, 1989 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">(see </span>Exhibit
“E”).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Pat. Eliseo Gargaritano also identified the buy-bust money of P100
bill during the trial (Exhibit "A").  He was able to identify it because of its serial number and because of
the marking Pfc. Padpad wrote on the figure '0' on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">face of the paper bill.  (TSN-Aug. 8, 1990, p. 7).  Pat.
Eliseo Gargaritano first saw said paper bill when the Chief of the
Anti-Narcotics Unit, Kalookan City Police Station, handed the same to Pfc.
Padpad (TSN-Aug. 8, 1990, p. 7).  After
the arrest, the same paper bill was recovered (sic) from Emmanuel Dizon
(TSN-Aug. 27, 1990, pp. 8-9).  Pfc.

<blockquote>"Trial courts (should) always require precise and convincing
testimony in cases involving buy-bust operations.  Competent and effective handling of a case by the prosecution is
particularly urgent in drug-related offenses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We sustain the rule that police officers in buy-bust operations are
entitled to the presumption of having acted pursuant to official duty.  Their testimony is entitled to great
respect.  Theirs is a most difficult
and, in the light of an ever increasing drug menace, a seemingly hopeless
assignment, Anti-narcotics agents deserve utmost support and consideration.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Nonetheless, we are also cognizant of the ease with which
prohibited drugs may be ‘planted’ on innocent individuals.  Except for influential persons or those who
can afford the best lawyers, it is well nigh impossible to refute a charge that
drugs were 'planted' and not 'possessed' or 'pushed.' The complaints of
mulcting activities by unscrupulous policemen, especially by those who are
assigned to traffic duties or some other chores but who somehow stumble on
possession of prohibited drugs by teenagers or provincianos, are legion.  It is for this reason that trial courts
should be more wary and careful in assessing conflicting, ambiguous, or
non-relevant testimony.  More important
than apprehending and convicting criminals is faithful adherence to due
process, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">need to accord to every
