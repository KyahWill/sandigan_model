and/or her operator to immediately vacate and turn over the possession of the
mining area to the respondent Hi-Cement Corporation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As gathered from the records, the antecedent facts are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Hi-Cement Corporation (Hi-Cement, for short) is a manufacturer of
cement with plant located at Bo. <span class="SpellE">Matiktik</span>, <span class="SpellE">Norzagaray</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For its operation, Hi-Cement leased and
acquired several placer mining claims <span style="">from
the Bureau of Mines and Geo-Sciences (BMGS), namely Mining Lease Contract (MLC)
Nos. V-78,85,90,150,</span>261, and 269.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>MLC V-90 covers mining claim Red Star VIII, <span style="">Red </span>Star IX <span style="">and Hunter I
in the name of Red Star Association.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said mining claims were transferred to Hi-Cement by virtue of a deed of
assignment dated </span><st1:date year="1965" day="13" month="12"><span style="">December 13, 1965</span></st1:date><span style=""> duly approved by the Director of BMGS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 24, 1984, BMGS issued Quarry License (QL) No. 37 in
the name of Angelina P. Santiago, petitioner herein, covering 19.5 hectares
which are entirely within the mining claims of respondent Hi?<span style="">Cement despite the fact that its lease
contract has </span>not <span style="">been declared
abandoned or cancelled by the BMGS </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="">p. 55).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="4"><span style="">April 10, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="">, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Santiago</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> entered into an Operating Agreement with the
Philippine Development and Industrial Corporation (PDIC).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Director of BMGS, in a letter dated April 3, 1984,
informed Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>, Senior V?president
of Hi-Cement, that per field verification conducted, Hi-Cement has complied
with the annual work obligation requirements <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span>
MLC V-90 and that the BMGS recognizes the validity of Hi-Cement mining lease
contracts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, the Director
recognized as valid the intervening rights prior to the field verification,
although the same would no longer be <span style="">subject
to renewal (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 89).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1984</st1:date>,
Hi-Cement filed a petition with the BMGS, amended on <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1985</st1:date>, praying for the revocation of
QL No. 37 on the following grounds:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Hi-Cement is the lessee and surface titled owner of the area covered
by QL No. 37 of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="">p. </span>27);</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Hi-Cement's mining claims covered under MLC V-­90 has never
been declared abandoned nor cancelled (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 29);</p>

<p class="BODY">3. That under Sec. 63, PD 463 and its implementing rules and
regulations, areas covered by valid and existing mining lease shall not be
subject to any quarry permit or license (Ibid., p. 28);</p>

<p class="BODY">4. That <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> has
misled the BMGS into issuing a quarry license by misrepresenting <span style="">the </span>area to be public and (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 30).</p>

<p class="BODY">In her answer to the above petition, Santiago alleged, among
others, that the failure of Hi-Cement to file Affidavits of Annual Work
Obligations (AAWO) for more than two (2) consecutive years constituted
automatic abandonment of the mining claims under Sec. 27 of PD 463, as amended (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 36) and that Hi- Cement's title over the disputed
area is void as it covers mineral lands (Ibid., p. 53).</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 17, 1985, the Officer-In-Charge (OIC) of the BMGS,
Benjamin Gonzales, issued a decision, the <span class="SpellE"><span style="">dispositive</span></span><span style=""> portion of which is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, this office, finding
the instant petition of HI-CEMENT Corporation to be well-founded, the same is
hereby granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Quarry
License No. 37 of Respondent Angelina Santiago is hereby declared cancelled and
she and/or her operator is ordered to immediately vacate and turn<span style=""> over</span> the possession of the mining
area subject of this case to the petitioner." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 63)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1985</st1:date>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> filed an appeal with the
then Ministry of Natural Resources, alleging that:</p>

<p class="BODY">1. The OIC erred in rendering and signing the aforesaid decision
considering that he has no legal authority to do so (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 66).</p>

<p class="BODY">2. The OIC erred in not holding that 'Red Star VIII' under MLC
V-90 was not automatically abandoned for failure of Hi-Cement to comply with
the filing of the AAWP for more than two consecutive years (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 72).</p>

<p class="BODY">3. The OIC, erred in stating that <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
committed misrepresentation or deception fatal enough to cause the cancellation
<span style="">of </span>her QL No. 37 (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="">p. </span>81).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1986</st1:date>,
the Minister of Natural Resources issued a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of <span style="">which reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, P. 102)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From said decision, Hi-Cement filed an appeal with the Office of
the President, dated <st1:date year="1986" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1986</st1:date>,

null and void the Decision of the OIC of the BMGS;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">2. The <span style="">Hon. </span>Minister
of Natural Resources erred <span style="">in </span>declaring
as automatically abandoned the Placer Lease Contract of Hi-Cement Corporation
for failure to file proof of annual work obligation despite lessee having
performed the work obligation required, and despite the fact that no previous
hearing was even conducted in accordance with Section 44 of the Consolidated
Mines Administrative Order, implementing <span style="">PD
</span>463; and</p>

<p class="BODY">3. The Hon. Minister of Natural Resources erred in not taking

misrepresentation of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 190).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1986</st1:date>,
the then Deputy Executive Secretary rendered a decision, holding thus:</p>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 106)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="8" month="11">November 8, 1986</st1:date>,
<st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city> filed a motion for
reconsideration of the aforesaid decision (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
111) but was denied by the Deputy Executive Secretary not only because it was
filed late but her motion contained <span style="">mere
</span>reiterations of the matters already considered and found to be without
merit (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 117).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues <span style="">to </span>be
resolved in this case are as <span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">1. Whether or not private respondent automatically abandoned its
mining claim on MLC V-90 by reason of its failure to file affidavit of annual
work obligations for two years, <span style="">as </span>required
by Section 27 of PD 463, <span style="">as </span>amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Whether or not QL No. 37 of <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
is a valid intervening right that prevails over the mining claim of private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that Hi-Cement abandoned its mining claim
over MLC V-90 when it failed to file affidavit of annual work obligations
(AAWO) as required by Sec. 27, PD 463, as amended, which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 27.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annual Work
Obligations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The claim-owner shall
submit proof of compliance with the annual work obligations by filing an
affidavit <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> <span style="">and the statement of expenditures and technical report in the
prescribed form in support thereof with the Mines Regional Officer concerned
within one hundred twenty days from the end of the year in which the work
obligation is required:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That
failure </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the claim-owner to comply therewith for two
(2) consecutive years shall constitute automatic abandonment of the mining
claim:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, further, That, if it is
found upon field verification that no such work was actually done on the mining
claim, the claim owner/lessee shall automatically lose all his right thereto
notwithstanding submission of the aforesaid documents:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, finally, That the Director, in
cases of unstable peace and order conditions and/or involvement in </span>mining
conflicts may grant further extensions."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The argument is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to petitioner's claim, there is no rule of automatic
abandonment with respect to mining claims for failure to file AAWO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the Consolidated Mines Administrative
Order (CMAO), implementing PD 463, as amended, the rule that has been
consistently applied is that it is the failure to perform the required assessment
work, not the failure to file the AAWO that gives rise to abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Interpreted within the context of <span style="">PD </span>1902, the last amending decree of PD
463, it is intended, among others, to accelerate the development <span style="">of </span>our natural resources and to
accelerate mineral productions, abandonment under the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
Sec. 27 refers to the failure to perform work obligations which in turn is one
of the grounds for the cancellation of the lease contract (Sec. 43 (a),
Consolidated Mines Administrative Order, implementing PD 463).</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of whether or not the failure to submit AAWO for
more than <span style="">two </span>(2) consecutive
years constitutes abandonment as ground <span style="">for
</span>cancellation of a mining lease contract has been the subject matter of
many cases in the Ministry of Natural Resources (now Department of Environment
and Natural Resources).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public
respondent had made the following significant findings, to quote:</p>

<blockquote>"In a number of cases, the MNR answered the question in the
negative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Sec. 1, Malayan Integrated
Industries Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Apo</span> Cement Corporation; 2.
"In the matter of the denial by the Director of Mines Temporary Permit
Application No. V-2780 of <span style="">the Republic
Glass Corporation" and 3. "In Re:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Denial of Mines Temporary Permit</span> Application No. V-2340, Bonanza
Consolidated Mines, Inc., Appellant", docketed as <span style="">MNR </span>Case Nos. 5036, 4386, 4459, respectively).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As there explained, it is the continued
failure to perform the annual work obligations, NOT the failure to <span style="">file </span>AAWO, that gives rise to
abandonment as ground for cancellation of a mining lease, contract; that
compliance with AAWO requirements, not being related to the essence of the acts
to be performed, is a matter of convenience rather than substance; and that
non-submission of AAWO does not preclude the lessee from proving performance of
such working obligation in some other way." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 106; Decision, O.P., p. 6).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, before any mining lease contract is cancelled,
Consolidated Mines Administrative Order, Section 44 thereof, requires notice
and hearing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said <span style="">BMGS OIC Director Gonzales:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>provision <span style="">of </span>Sec. 44 of Consolidated Mines
Administrative Order (CMAO) specifically provides for the necessity of the
cancellation of the Mining Lease Contract before the same can be considered
open to relocation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And in cases of
non-compliance with the filing of AAWO, it has been a long consistent policy of
this office to first require field verification before any recommendation for
cancellation be endorsed to the Ministry of Natural Resources (MNR).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the field verification reveals that
cancellation is not in order and neither can it be said that the <span style="">verification </span>conducted was improperly
made." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 107)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that the then Minister of Natural
Resources Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> reiterated the Ministry's
previous ruling in his decision dated April 10, 1986, in MNR Case No. 6300,
entitled "RE PLACER <span style="">LEASE
APPLICATION NO. V-3895 OF CONTINENTAL MARBLE CORPORATION." To quote:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This office has been consistent on its ruling that it is the
continued failure to undertake the work obligation that causes a mining claim
to lapse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The affidavit (of annual work
obligation) is merely a <u><span style="">prima</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">facie</span></u><span style=""> </span>proof
of performance of said work obligations, and the omission to submit said
affidavit raised only a disputable presumption that no work had been done and
shift upon the claim owner the burden of proof to show otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The claim-owner is not precluded from making
proof of performance in some other way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Malayan Integrated Industries v. <span class="SpellE">Apo</span> Cement
Corporation, et al. MNR Case No. 5036, July 6, 1982, Republic Glass
Corporation, MNR Case 4336 and <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Rosario
Fertilizer Corporation, MNR Case No. 4369).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These decided cases fall squarely with the facts of the instant
case." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 195)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid decision was penned after the then Minister Ernesto
<span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> overturned the decision of the BMGS in the
case of Hi-Cement v. Angelina Santiago.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As can be seen therefore, it has always been an administrative policy
that the requirement to file AAWO <span style="">is </span>a
matter of convenience rather than substance as it is not related to the essence
of the acts performed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
administrative policies enacted by administrative bodies to interpret the law
have the force and law and entitled to great respect (<span class="SpellE">Tayug</span>
<span style="">v. </span>Central Bank, G.R. <span style="">46158, Nov. 28, 1986; Warren Manufacturing Workers
Union v. Bureau of Labor Relations, 159 SCRA 387 [1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the general policy of this Court to
sustain the decision of administrative authorities not only on the basis of the
doctrine of separation of powers but also for their presumed <span class="SpellE">knowledgeability</span> and even expertise in the laws they are
entrusted to enforce (<span class="SpellE">Cuerdo</span> v. COA, 166 SCRA 657
[1988]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, Hi-Cement has never abandoned its mining
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may not <span style="">have </span>filed the AAWO but it has
actually performed the annual work obligations as found by the BMGS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Administrative findings of facts are
sufficient if supported by substantial evidence on record and as a general
rule, actions of administrative agencies need not be disturbed by the judicial
department (Manahan v. People, G.R. 37010, <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="11">Nov. 7, 1988</st1:date>; Gordon v. <span class="SpellE">Veridiano</span>,

60741-45, <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="12">Dec. 22, 1989</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This court finds no reason to disturb such
findings.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner insists that her Quarry License <span style="">No. </span>37 is a valid intervening right
that prevails over the mining claims of Hi-Cement as its claims were
automatically abandoned without need for any proceeding or declaration for
cancellation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Given the fact that Hi-Cements Mining Lease Contract has never
been cancelled nor its mining claim abandoned, this Court rules that <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
can not have any valid intervening right over the mining claims of the
respondent for the following reasons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, the license of the respondent covers an area which is closed to
mining location under <span style="">Sec. 13, </span>PD
463, as amended.</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 13.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Areas Closed
to Mining Location.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- No prospecting and
exploration shall be allowed:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>"C.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In lands covered by valid and subsisting mining
claims located, and leases acquired, under previous mining laws and in <span style="">accordance with the provisions of this </span>Decree."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Second,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sec. 63 of the
Consolidated Mines Administrative Order categorically states that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>"xxx.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Areas covered by valid and subsisting mining
claims and mining leases shall not be the subject of a quarry permit or
license."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, it <span style="">is </span>only
when the mining lease contract has been cancelled or terminated in the manner
provided by law that a leased mining area may be open to location and lease by
other qualified persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
mining lease contract of <span style="">Hi-Cement </span>over
the area <span style="">covered </span>by the quarry
license of petitioner is <span style="">still </span>valid
and existing at the time the license was obtained <span style="">by </span>the petitioner, her license is null and void and, therefore,
cannot be considered as a valid intervening <span style="">right </span>that prevails over the mining claim of Hi-Cement.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third, both the BMGS and the public respondent found the
petitioner guilty of misrepresentation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said the <span style="">public </span>respondent:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>
misrepresented in her application for a quarry license that the area applied
for was a public land when, in reality, it is covered by TCT No. T-62628 in the
name of Hi-Cement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this regard, the <span style="">provisions of PD 512 require the locator </span>or
prospector <span style="">before entering a private
land to give prior notification to the landowner who is thereby entitled to
compensation and </span>royalty." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="">p. 110)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Such finding is binding on this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Findings<span style=""> </span>of <span style="">the
</span>administrative agency on matters falling within its competence will not
be disturbed by the courts, especially with respect <span style="">to </span>factual findings, they are accorded respect if not finality,
because of the special knowledge and expertise gained by the tribunals from
handling specific matters falling under their jurisdiction (<span class="SpellE">Mapa</span>
v. Arroyo, G.R. 78585, July 5, 1989; Needle Queen Corp. v. Nicolas, et al.,

said statements."<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner assails the decision rendered by OIC Benjamin A.
Gonzales of the BGMS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claims that <span style="">under Special Order No. 86 dated </span><st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="3"><span style="">March
 19, 1985</span></st1:date><span style=""> which

<blockquote>"Except appointments and matters involving policy, the
Assistant director or the Officer-in-charge of his office shall sign on
official papers; xxx" (p. 18, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the jurisdiction to exercise
quasi-judicial authority to resolve mining controversies lies solely with the
Director of BGMS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, she alleges
that the decision <span style="">of </span><st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="5"><span style="">May </span>17,
 1985</st1:date> <span style="">is null and void for
want of authority (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, </span>pp. 228-230).</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is actually excluded in the aforesaid order is the
formulation of new policies of the BGMS.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>OIC Gonzales did not formulate new policies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He merely upheld and reiterated the long and
consistent policy of <span style="">the Bureau in
similar disputes previously passed upon </span>not only by <span style="">the Director of Mines but also by the
Secretary of Environment and Natural Resources based on the applicable
law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, as the public respondent
said, </span>"the more important consideration is <span style="">that the decision correctly disposes of the controversy" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 110).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, the decision
issued by the OIC is valid.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

DISMISSED for lack of merit and the decision of the Deputy Executive Secretary,
