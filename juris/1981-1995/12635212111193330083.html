This is another of those administrative complaints where the charge is 
one of immoral conduct.  Respondent Jose Ma. Salindong, a member of the 
bar, was sought to be disbarred on that ground.  From the allegations of
 the complaint, it would appear that complainant, Emma C. Banaag, who is
 a married woman, was appointed a casual employee in the Regional Office
 of the Bureau of Internal Revenue at San Pablo City.  Respondent was 
then the Acting Chief of the Specific Tax Department of the then Bureau 
of Internal Revenue.  He, also married, lost no time on courting her, 
with a promise to make her a permanent employee should she live with him
 as his common-law wife.  She finally acceded to such arrangement.  She 
left her husband to join respondent in Manila until a child named 
Josephine Marie Capistrano Salindong was born on November 2, 1972 out of
 their illicit relationship.  During the time that complainant and 
respondent were living together as man and wife in Manila, she was given
 a monthly support of P2,000.00.  Two weeks before the birth of their 
child, however, respondent abandoned the complainant and stopped giving 
her monthly support up to the time the complaint was filed.
<p>
Respondent was required to answer.  In his responsive pleading to the 
complainant, captioned "Answer and Motion to Dismiss," he denied all the
 material averments in the complaint.  By way of affirmative defenses, 
he alleged that there was no more cause of action against him based on 
the affidavit of desistance of complainant dated March 28, 1976.  Under 
date of September 22, 1976, this Court required the complainant to file a
 "Reply" to the "Answer and Motion to Dismiss" of respondent.  
Accordingly, com­plainant filed on October 25, 1976 a pleading captioned
 "Rejoinder and Opposition to Dismiss" wherein she reiterated in 
substance the allegations in her complaint.  She further alleged that 
respondent induced her to execute the affidavit of desistance attached 
to respondent's answer upon the promise that he would live with her and 
support the child, but once appointed to his present position as Chief 
of the Specific Tax Division of the Bureau of Internal Revenue, 
respondent did not comply with his promise.  She was therefore 
withdrawing her affidavit of desistance.
</p><p>
This Court then referred this case to the Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.
</p><p>
Such Report and Recommendation was then submitted to this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  On the question of the sufficiency of evidence, it stated:  "In the 
instant case, the only evidence in support of the complaint is 
complainant's own testimony.  But said testimony has little or no value 
in evidence because she was not cross-examined by the respondent due to 
her persistent failure to appear for cross-examination inspite of due 
notice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  Instead, what she eventually did was to submit anew an affidavit of desistance according to such Report.
</p><p>
It was made clear in the Report that the loss of interest by complainant
 in prosecuting the case does not of itself suffice to call for the 
automatic dismissal of the administrative complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>
  Nonetheless, in the absence of any credible evidence against 
respondent, there would be no justification for a finding of guilt.  As 
noted in the Report, confidence in such a conclusion was strengthened by
 her admission:  "Atty. Hipolito:  When the respondent did not give 
adequate support to your child, what did you do if you do anything?  
'Mrs. Banaag:  When I was asking and he did not give me I did not do 
anything.  I only filed charges against the respondent because of the 
insult he hurled at me during the meeting at the office.' (pp. 68-69, 
t.s.n., Dec. 29, 1976)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> 
</p><p>
The recommendation was for the dismissal of the complaint due to 
"insufficiency" of evidence.  Such a recommendation merits approval.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  The quantum of proof required to warrant a disciplinary action was not
 met.  Nonetheless, there are circumstances not sufficiently explained 
which, to say the least, justify the inference that respondent's conduct
 could not be characterized as meeting the high standard that membership
 in the bar imposes.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the administrative complaint against Attorney Jose Ma. 
Salindong is dismissed.  Let a copy of this resolution be spread on his 
record.

Nonetheless her complaint could not be disregarded because this Court is concerned with maintaining the high standards of the legal profession. I am afraid that the insufficiency of the evidence was the result of some understanding between the parties. Hence my reluctant concurrence.<br></p><p><br></p></div>
