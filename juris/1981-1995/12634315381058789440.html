Momblan, for alleged neglect of duty in the performance of his functions as
Deputy Sheriff, Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 33, Iloilo City.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on 24 June 1987, the aforesaid RTC Branch
rendered a Decision in Civil Case No. 14789, entitled "Salvacion Solis, et
al. vs. Ramona Fernandez, et al.," for Annulment of Contract, Cancellation
and Damages.  Complainant, Pancho Yap
Young, was a defendant as well as a third-party-plaintiff therein.  The dispositive portion of the judgment
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

Rights (Annex "A") covering Lot No. 7988 and Lot No. 7996 in favor of

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 8 September 1988, the RTC granted the Motion for Issuance of <span style="">a </span>Writ of Execution filed by the
plaintiffs therein.  A Writ of Execution
<span style="">was </span>then issued on 11 October
1988 relative to the <span style="">said </span>RTC
Order.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">is </span>in
connection with the execution of the aforesaid Writ that this Complaint, dated
26 May 1989, <span style="">was </span>filed against
respondent Deputy Sheriff.  Complainant
asserts that Respondent maliciously failed to fully implement the Writ
according to its tenor, there having been no execution made against
third-party-defendant Caños, who is the niece of the plaintiffs in that case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant also took Respondent to task for the latter's alleged
malicious actuations in serving him <span style="">a </span>copy
of the Writ of Execution and, at the same time, demanding from him his owner's
copy of the Transfer Certificates of Title of the lots in question.  Complainant contends that he should not have
been served a copy of the <span style="">said </span>Writ
because he <span style="">was </span>not a
"judgment delinquent."</p>

<p class="BODY">In his Comment, dated 28 May 1991, Respondent denied that he <span style="">was </span>negligent and had acted
maliciously in not fully executing the Writ against the cross-defendants and
third-party-defendant.  He explained
that the aforesaid Writ was issued at the instance of the plaintiff in that
case.  It <span style="">was </span>also his honest opinion that the Writ may not be utilized by
Complainant against the cross-defendants and third-party-defendant unless said
Complainant moved for execution, which Complainant <span style="">never </span>did.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent also contended that he served a copy of said Writ on
Complainant because the RTC Decision itself required the latter to surrender
the Transfer Certificates of Title in question so that the same may be
cancelled by the Register of Deeds.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant, in his Reply to Comment, dated 12 June 1991,
asserted that Respondent failed to execute the RTC Decision pursuant to its
terms and conditions because the latter had allegedly received bribes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 June 1991, this case was referred to the Office of the
Court Administrator for evaluation, report and recommendation.  In compliance therewith, the Court
Administrator submitted his Report, dated 24 September 1991, with the finding
that although Complainant failed to prove that Respondent received bribe money
in connection with the enforcement of the Writ of Execution in Civil Case No.
14789, the latter’s Comment on why he failed to execute the same as against the
cross-defendants and third-party-defendants was unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the findings of the Court Administrator.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Writ<span style="">&nbsp; </span>of Execution, dated
11 October 1988, explicitly commanded Respondent to execute the RTC Decision,
dated 24 June 1987, which had already become final and executory, in the manner
spelled out in its dispositive portion.  As a matter of fact, he <span style="">was </span>commanded
to seize "lands and buildings of the said
defendants/third-party-defendants" should their personal property be
insufficient to satisfy the Writ and its lawful fees.  No part of the disposition in said Decision was either modified
or deleted.  All that Respondent had to
do then was to merely execute the same in accordance with its mandate.</p>

<p class="BODY">After all, the Sheriff and/or his deputies merely perform ministerial,
not discretionary functions.</p>

<blockquote>"2. Duty of a
sheriff as to execution of process.  -  When a writ is placed in the
hands of a sheriff, it is his duty in the absence of <span style="">instructions, </span>to proceed with reasonable celerity and promptness
to <u>execute</u> <u>it</u> <u>according</u> <u>to</u> <u>its</u> <u>mandate</u>

Court, p. 178, citing 47 Am. Jur. 855) <span style="">(Underscoring
</span>ours).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It should be recalled that a purely ministerial act or duty <span style="">is </span>one which an officer or tribunal
performs in a given state of facts, in a prescribed manner, in obedience to the
mandate of legal authority, without regard to the exercise of his own judgment,
upon the propriety or impropriety of the act done (Lamb v. Phipps, 22 Phil
456).  Discretion, on the other hand, <span style="">is a </span>faculty conferred upon a court or
official by which he may decide the question either way and still be right
(Asuncion v. De Yriarte, 28 Phil 67).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, Respondent's only duty was to have
implemented the Writ of Execution according to its terms, without
exception.  Thus, he should have also
enforced the Writ insofar as the cross-defendants and the third-party
defendants were concerned.  Not having
done so, Respondent must be held to have been remiss in the performance of his
functions.  His defense that even if the
Writ had been served against said parties the same would have been returned
unsatisfied because they have no properties in their names is no justification
for an incomplete enforcement of the Writ.  His notion that another Writ, at Complainant's instance, was necessary
neither finds any support in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is axiomatic that those "involved in the administration
of justice x x x must live up to the strictest standard of honesty and
integrity in the public service " (Mejia v. Pamaran, G.R. Nos. 56741-42,
15 April 1988, 160 SCRA 477).  Their
conduct, therefore, must, at all times, not <span style="">only </span>be characterized with propriety and decorum but above all
else must be above suspicion (Llanes v. Borja, A.M. No. P-86-32, 10 December
1990, 192 SCRA 288).  Respondent's
actuations in enforcing the Writ of Execution in <span style="">Civil </span>Case No. 14789 below did not live up to this strict
standard.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the charge that Respondent maliciously served Complainant
with <span style="">a </span>copy of said Writ when,
in fact, the latter was not even a "judgment delinquent" therein, we
agree with the finding of the Court Administrator that there was nothing
irregular with the procedure followed.  Complainant's Transfer Certificates of Title were declared by the RTC as
null and void and at most, the service of a copy of the Writ merely served <span style="">as </span>a notice to Complainant of his
obligation to surrender the same to the Register of Deeds for cancellation.</p>
