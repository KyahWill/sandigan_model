				<H3>ANTONIO GARCIA, JR., PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, LASAL DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On April 15, 1977, the Western <span class="SpellE">Minolco</span>
Corporation (WMC) obtained from the Philippine Investments Systems Organization
(PISO) two loans for P2,500,000.00 and P1,000,000.00 for which it issued the
corresponding promissory notes payable on May 30, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, Antonio Garcia and Ernest
Kahn executed a surety agreement binding themselves jointly and severally for
the payment of the loan of P2,500,000.00 on due date.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon failure of WMC to pay after repeated demands, demand was
made on Garcia pursuant to the surety agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Garcia also failed to pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, on <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1983</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Lasal</span> Development
Corporation (to which the credit had been assigned earlier by PISO) sued Garcia
for recovery of the debt <span style="">in </span>the
Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 18, 1983, Garcia moved to dismiss on the grounds
that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the complaint stated no cause
of action; (b) the suit would result in unjust enrichment of the plaintiff
because he had not received any consideration from PISO; (c) the <span style="">surety agreement
violated </span>the doctrine of the limited liability of corporations; and (d)
the principal obligation had <span style="">been <span class="SpellE">novated</span>.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the arguments and evidence of the parties, the
trial court granted the motion and dismissed the complaint on the ground that
the surety agreement was invalid for absence of consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff moved for reconsideration and when this was denied
elevated the matter to the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In a decision dated <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="6">June 23,
 1987</st1:date>, the respondent court reversed Judge Jesus M. <span class="SpellE">EIbinias</span> and remanded the records of the case for trial on
the merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Garcia then came to this
Court in this petition for review on <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><i><span style="">,</span></i><span style=""> </span>pleading the same arguments raised in
the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's first ground is that, as found by the trial
court, the surety agreement was invalid because no consideration had been paid
to him by PISO for executing the contract and that the amount of the entire
loan had been received and enjoyed by WMC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He cites the following articles of the Civil Code <span style="">in </span>support of his contention that lack
of consideration was a personal defense available to him as surety:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 2047.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By guaranty a
person, called the guarantor, binds himself to the creditor to fulfill the
obligation of the principal debtor <span style="">in
case the latter should fail to do so.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>If a person binds himself solidarity with the principal debtor, the
provisions of Section 4, Chapter 3, Title I of this Book <span style="">shall be observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such case the contract is called a <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span>.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Art. 1222.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtor may, in actions filed by the creditor,
avail himself of all defenses which are derived from the nature of the
obligation and of those which are personal to him, or pertain to his own
share.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>W<span style="">ith respect to those which personally belong to the others, he may
avail himself thereof only as regards that part </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the debt for which the
latter are responsible.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The point is not well taken in view of the nature and purpose of
a surety agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Suretyship</span> is a contractual relation
resulting from an agreement whereby one person, the surety, engages to be
answerable for the debt, default or miscarriage of another, known as the
principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surety's obligation is
not an original and direct one for the performance of his own act, but merely
accessory or collateral to the obligation contracted by the principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, although the contract of a
surety is in essence secondary only to a valid principal obligation, his
liability to the creditor or <span class="SpellE">promisee</span> of the
principal is said to be direct, primary and absolute; <a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in other words, he is <span style="">directly and
equally bound with the principal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
surety therefore becomes liable for the debt or duty of another although he
possesses no direct or personal interest over the obligations nor does <span style="">he </span>receive any benefit <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The peculiar nature of a surety agreement is that it is regarded
as valid despite the absence of any direct consideration received by the surety
either from the principal obligor or from the creditor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contract of surety, like any other
contract, must generally be supported by a sufficient consideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the consideration necessary to
support a surety obligation need not pass directly to the surety; <span style="">a </span>consideration moving to the
principal alone will suffice.</p>

<p class="BODY">It has been held that if the delivery of the original contract is
contemporaneous with the delivery of the surety's obligation, each contract
becomes completed at the same time, and the consideration which supports the
principal contract likewise supports the subsidiary one.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
And this is the kind of surety contract to which the rule of strict
construction applies as opposed to a compensated surety contract undertaken by
surety corporations which are organized for the purpose of conducting an
indemnity business at established rates and compensation unlike an ordinary
surety agreement where the surety binds <span style="">his </span>name through motives of friendship and
accommodation.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It follows from the above principles that <span class="SpellE">Lasal</span>
<span style="">would </span>not be unjustly enriched
if the petitioner were to <span style="">be </span>held liable for the obligation contracted by WMC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The creditor would only be recovering the
amount of its loan plus its increments.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioner, for his part, can still go against WMC for the amount he
may have to pay <span class="SpellE">Lasal</span> as assignee of the PISO credit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the petitioner's claim that he is liable only as a
corporate officer of WMC, the surety agreement shows that he signed the same
not in representation of WMC or as its president but in his personal
capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is therefore personally
bound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no law that prohibits a
corporate officer from binding himself personally to answer for a corporate
debt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the limited liability
doctrine is intended to protect the stockholder by immunizing him from personal
liability for the corporate debts, he may nevertheless divest himself of this
protection by voluntarily binding himself to the payment of the corporate
debts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner cannot therefore
take refuge in this doctrine that he has by his own acts effectively waived.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the issue of <span class="SpellE">novation</span>, we
note first the following provisions of the memorandum of agreement supposedly
entered into by WMC and its creditors which the petitioner argues had the
effect of releasing him from the surety agreement: </p>

<blockquote><span style="">IV.<span style=""> </span> </span><u>Release of JSS</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>The CREDITORS expressly agree to release
and hereby release the Joint and Several Signatories (JSS) of <span class="SpellE">MINOLCO's</span> officers from any liability whatsoever on the
obligations <span style="">which they have personally
guaranteed or secured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any action
therefore against all the aforesaid signatories are waived in view of the
promissory notes to be issued by NDC which are fully and unconditionally
guaranteed by the Philippine Government, in payment of <span class="SpellE">MINOLCO's</span>
obligations to said CREDITORS.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>VI. The CREDITORS who have filed cases in
court against MINOLCO and who are signatories to this Agreement agree to
dismiss the case<span style="">&nbsp; </span>with prejudice,
accepting the repayment scheme set fourth in paragraph II as a just and <span style="">equitable procedure for collecting their
credits.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, however, the <span style="">a</span>greement
(Annex 5) was signed <span style="">only </span>by <span style="">Don </span>M. Ferry as chairman of the board
of directors of WMC and does not carry the signature of any of the creditors.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, it has no <span style="">binding force whatsoever </span>on such creditors.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cites other developments or transactions between
the parties to the original loans that he contends had the effect of <span class="SpellE">novating</span> the said contracts and consequently extinguished
the surety agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among these are
the extension of the original period of payment and the compounding of the
interest on the principal obligations, both of which operated to the prejudice
of the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner invokes Article 2079 of the <span style="">Civil </span>Code, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>Art. 2079.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An extension
granted to the debtor by the creditor without the consent of the guarantor
extinguishes the guaranty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere failure
on the part of the creditor to demand payment after the debt has become due <span style="">does not of itself constitute any extension
of time referred to herein.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">However, Paragraphs 5 of the surety agreement clearly stipulated
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The sureties expressly waive all rights to demand payment and
notice of non-payment and protest, and agree that the securities of every <span style="">kind, that now or may hereafter be left with
the lender, its successors, <span class="SpellE">indorsees</span> or assigns, as
collateral, for the said loan, or any evidence of debt or obligations, or upon
which a </span><span style="">lien </span><span style="">may exist may be withdrawn or surrendered at
any time, <u>and the time of payment thereof extended, without notice to or
consent by the sureties</u>, and the liability on this <span class="SpellE">suretyship</span>
shall be <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>, direct and immediate and not
contingent upon any pursuit by the lender, its successors, <span class="SpellE">indorsees</span>
or assigns, of whatever remedies the lender may have against the principal or
the securities or liens it may possess.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Emphasis supplied.)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since in the surety contract, the petitioner not only consented
to an extension in the payment of the obligation but even waived his right to
be notified of such extension, he cannot now claim that he has been released
from his undertaking because of the extension granted to the principal.</p>

<p class="BODY">As for the compounded interest, we apply by analogy the <span style="">case </span>of Bank <span style="">of </span>the Philippine Islands v. Gooch and <span class="SpellE">Redfern</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
which was affirmed in the later case of the Bank of the Philippine Islands v. <span class="SpellE">Albaladejo</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Cia</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="color: windowtext;">In the said</span><span style="color: rgb(153, 204, 0);"> </span>cases,
the respective sureties claimed that since the creditor changed the rate of
interest in the principal obligation without their knowledge or consent, they
were relieved from liability under their contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was held, however, that the change in the
rate of interest was merely a collateral agreement between the creditor bank
and the principal debtor that did not affect the surety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the debtor promised <span style="">to </span>pay the extra rate of interest on
demand of the plaintiff, the liability he assumed was his alone and was
separate and apart from the original contract.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>His agreement to <span style="">pay </span>the
additional rate of interest was an additional burden upon him and him
only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That obligation in no way affected
the original contract of the <span style="">surety, </span>whose
liability remained unchanged.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, despite the compounding of the <span style="">interest, </span>the liability of the surety remains only <span style="">up </span>to the original uncompounded
interest, as stipulated in the <span style="">promissory
</span>note, that is, 17% per annum, with a penalty <span style="">charge of </span>2 1/2% per month until full payment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cites other supposed agreements in support of his
theory of <span class="SpellE">novation</span> such as the prepayment of the
restructured loans of WMC before the distribution of dividends to the common
stockholders, the proposed sale on installments of its assets to <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental Copperfield Mines, and the preference
given to other creditors of WMC over PISO.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But we do not think these are material as, to be <span style="">so </span>the alteration must change the legal effects of the<span style=""> o</span>riginal contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The alleged alterations do not have that
effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is axiomatic, and only fair, that the creditors of a
corporation must be paid first before dividends may <span style="">be </span>distributed among the
stockholders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unsecured creditors are
given preference in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings because secured
creditors can after all <span style="">go </span>against
the security given by the debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As </span>for the installment sale of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">WMC's</span></span><span style=""> </span>assets to <span class="SpellE">Negros</span>
Occidental Copperfield Mines, which might make it difficult <span style="">for </span>the petitioner to recover any
amount it may have to pay on the loan <span style="">of
</span>WMC, this was a risk he took when he signed the surety agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As it did not prohibit the alienation of the
properties <span style="">of </span>the principal
debtor, the sale to <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Negros</span></st1:place>
cannot <span style="">be </span>considered a <span class="SpellE">novation</span> of the original agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the proposed sale was intended
precisely to enable WMC to meet its pending obligations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The most important argument against the alleged <span class="SpellE">novation</span> is the failure of the petitioner to establish the
validity <span style="">of </span>the new contract, an
essential requisite for the <span class="SpellE">novation</span> of a previous
valid obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner insists
that the various communications made by WMC with DBP, together with the
memorandum of agreement (Annexes <span style="">1 to</span>
7), are sufficient to establish the new undertaking made <span style="">by WMC </span>with all its creditors,
including DBP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do not think <span style="">so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that as a general rule no form <span style="">of </span>words or writing is necessary to give effect to a <span class="SpellE">novation</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Nevertheless, since the parties involved here are corporations, it must first
be proved that the contracts, assuming they were made, were executed by the
persons possessing the proper authority to bind their respective
principals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annexes <span style="">1-4 </span>are a mere exchange of
correspondence between the officers of WMC and DBP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although they contain the provisions and
proposals that, according to petitioner, should suffice to establish that the
original contract between WMC and PISO has been materially altered, they cannot
be considered <u><span style="">per</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>se</u> suff<span style="">icient</span> to give rise to a valid new obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WMC was in fact directed by Joseph W. <span class="SpellE">Edralin</span>, the Assistant Executive Officer of the DBP, to
communicate with Atty. <span class="SpellE">Hilario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oraolino</span>
of the Office of the Chief Legal Counsel for the preparation and execution of
the necessary legal documents to cover the approval and confirmation <span style="">of </span>the several proposals made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">No </span>such
documents, as duly signed by the parties, were ever presented in court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annexes 5 to 7<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
are also incomplete documents and not binding without the signatures of the
supposed contracting parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The argument of subrogation cannot be considered at this stage as
it is being invoked only now.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
settled that an issue not raised in the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u> cannot be raised for the first
time on appeal because this would be offensive to the basic rules <span style="">of </span>fair play.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="">for </span>the alleged
substitution of debtors, nowhere in the record can we find evidence of this
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The commitment made by DBP to the
<span style="">creditors </span>of <span style="">WMC </span>was that, although they had a first
mortgage <span style="">lien </span>over substantially
all the assets of WMC (which if foreclosed would leave most of <span style="">its creditors </span>without recourse), they
would nevertheless defer proceedings against those assets and instead allow
their sale to NDC (with better terms) <span style="">to
</span>enable WMC to meet <span style="">the </span>obligations.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
In effect, what DBP did was <span style="">merely </span>to
restructure its credit with WMC and make additional accommodations in the form
of investments on preferred and common shares of stock of WMC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was clearly an effort to <span style="">assist </span>WMC perform its obligations with
its creditors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But not <span style="">more </span>than that.</p>

<p class="BODY">Concerning the promissory notes <span style="">supposedly </span>issued by NDC to the creditors of WMC and with <span style="">the full and
unconditional guaranty of the Philippine Government as contained in Annex </span>5,
suffice it to repeat that such Annex <span style="">5 </span>(memorandum
<span style="">of </span>agreement between WMC and
DBP), as well as Annex 6<span style=""> </span>(addendum
to Annex 5, making <span style="">NOCOMIN, </span>instead
<span style="">of </span><span style="">NDC </span>as the buyer) and Annex 7 (contract <span style="">of sale </span>between <span style="">WMC </span>and
NOCOMIN), are all not signed by the contracting parties and therefore have no
evidentiary weight or <span style="">binding </span>force.</p>

<p class="BODY">We approve the following observations made by the Court of <span style="">A</span>ppeals:</p>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Novation</span> <span style="">of </span>contract cannot be presumed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In order that an obligation may be extinguished by<span style=""> </span><span style="">another
which substitutes the same, it is imperative that it be so declared in
unequivocal terms, or that the old and the new </span>obligations be on every
point incompatible with each other (Art. 1292, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In every <span class="SpellE">novation</span>
there are four essential requisites:<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) a previous valid obligation; (2) the
agreement </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">all the parties to the new contract; (3) the
extinguishment of the old </span>contract; and (4) validity of the new
one.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Novation</span>
requires the creation of new contractual relations <span style="">as </span>well as the <span style="">extinguishment
of the old.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There must be a consent of
all the parties to the substitution, </span>resulting in the extinction of the
old obligation and the creation of a valid new one <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Tiu</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Siuco</span></span><span style=""> v. <span class="SpellE">Habana</span>, 45 Phil. 707).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance of the promissory note by the
plaintiff is </span><span style="">not </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">novation</span></span><span style=""> of the contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legal doctrine is that an obligation to </span>pay
a <span style="">sum of money is not <span class="SpellE">novated</span> in a new instrument by changing the term of payment
and adding other obligations not incompatible with the old one (<span class="SpellE">Inchausti</span> &amp; Co. </span><span style="">v. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Yulo</span></span><span style="">, 34 Phil. 978).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It is not proper to consider an
obligation <span class="SpellE">novated</span> as in the case at bar by the mere
granting of extension of payment which did not <span style="">even alter its essence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
sustain <span class="SpellE">novation</span> necessitates that the same be so
declared in unequivocal terms or that there is complete and </span>substantial
incompatibility between the two obligations (<span class="SpellE">Sandico</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Paquing</span>, 42 SCRA 322).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An obligation to pay a sum of money is not <span class="SpellE">novated</span> in a new instrument wherein the old is ratified by
changing only the terms of payment and adding other obligations not
incompatible with the old one or wherein the old contract is merely
supplementing the new one (<span class="SpellE">Dungo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Lopeña</span>, L-19377, Dec. 29, 1962, 6 SCRA 1007; Magdalena
Estates, Inc. v. Rodriguez, 18 <span style="">SCRA </span>967;
