Compensation Commission dated October 9, 1975 in R04-WC Case No. 14840
entitled, "<span class="SpellE">Generosa</span> S. Hernandez, Claimant,
versus Republic of the Philip­pines and City of Manila [Bureau of Public
Schools, Division of City Schools, Manila]"; as well as the Order dated
February 6, 1978 of then Secretary of Labor <span class="SpellE">Blas</span> I. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span> and the Orders of then Acting Secretary of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> dated June 9 and
September 13, 1978, denying petitioner's mo­tion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are undisputed:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Generosa</span> S. Hernandez was
employed as a classroom teacher since 1946 until 1958 when she was designated
head of the Pilipino Department of the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mapa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>High School</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

Bureau of Public Schools, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
with a total monthly income of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">P5</span>30.00
or P6,600.00 per annum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In January,
1968, she began feeling chest pains, dizziness, easy fatigability and body
weakness, diagnosed by her phy­sician <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as
</span>resulting from hypertension and diabetes mellitus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was advised to undergo medication, which
she did.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1970</st1:date>,
she suffered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>stroke as a
consequence of which she was hospitalized at the <st1:place><st1:placename>GSIS
  General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
from <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="3">March 9 to 20, 1970</st1:date>,
under the care of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Joven</span> <span class="SpellE">Cuanang</span>,
who diagnosed her illness as <span class="SpellE">cerebro</span>-vascular
accident, cerebral thrombosis secondary to essential hypertension and diabetes
mellitus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After her discharge from the
hospital, she continued physical therapy at the National Ortho­pedic Hospital
from May to November 1970.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
meantime, she resumed work on <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="7">July 6,
 1970</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Shortly thereafter,
however, she applied for retirement at age 61 for reasons of deteriorating
health.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was accordingly paid her
retirement benefits.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1971</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a claim for disability compensation and medical benefits
against the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The claim was amended on may 28, 1972 to
include the Bureau of Public Schools as respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing on the merits, a decision was rendered on November
19, 1974 by the Hearing Officer Pedro <span class="SpellE">Pelaez</span> granting
disability compensation to peti­tioner in the amount of P6,000.00 under
Sections 14 and 18 of the Workmen's Compensation Act based on the rating given
her sickness by the Compensation Rating Medical Officer and the sum of P940.07
as reimbursement of medical expenses incurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The decision was based on a finding that the illness of petitioner
"was precipitated or aggravated by the strains, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">stress </span>and tensions attendant to her <span class="SpellE">multi­ferious</span>
[sic] arduous duties and functions", which her employer failed to rebut.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The decision of <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="11">November
 19, 1974</st1:date> further stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, the respondents<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>are
now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from contesting the claim or setting up
non-jurisdictional defenses for failure to submit its report and notice of <span class="SpellE">controversion</span> within the time limit provided for in
Sections 37 and 45 of the Act, despite actual knowledge and notice of her
disabling illness thereby constructively admitted that the claim is
compensable."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Ironically, on the same day, <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1974</st1:date>, petitioner died of the ailment
complained <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">of.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal by therein respondents Bureau of Public Schools and
City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, the Workmen's
Compensation Commission reversed on <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="10">October
 9, 1975</st1:date> the decision of the Hearing Officer and dismissed the case
for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It stated:</p>

<blockquote>"While it is true that claimant suffered hypertension and
diabetes mellitus while still in the employ of respondent, it was shown that
except for a brief period of medical treatment from March 9 to 20, 1970 and
afterwards she continued to receive medical treatment as an out patient, this
did not actually impair her earning capacity as in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">fact </span>she was able to resume her work on July 6, 1970.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When she applied for retirement at the age of
61 years old, she was paid her retirement benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by respondent, hypertension is
only a symptom and in the absence of any complications, it cannot be medically
considered as a disabling ailment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that claimant's ailments were brought about by reason of her old age or
as part of her aging process and to the extent that this did not actually cause
the loss or impairment of her earning capacity as an employee of the respondent
until the time she retired from the service, no compensation is due the
claimant as a retired employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is
compensated under the law is the disability for labor by reason of a
work-connected injury or illness which causes the employee impairment or loss
of earning capacity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
the claimant continued to be employed and entitled to her salary, even while
afflicted with the disease aforementioned, until her retirement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">which </span>accordingly resulted in the
severance of employer?employee relationship by operation of law."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

moved for a reconsideration of the decision of the Commission but was denied

Compensation Commission dated <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="10">October

<p class="BODY">The first issue is hardly a novel one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of <b><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Hernandez</span></u></b><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Workmen's</u> <u>Compensation</u> <u>Commis­sion</u></span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>14 SCRA 219, this Court resolved
this question in the affirmative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
ruled therein that an employee forced to ask for retirement ahead of schedule
not because of old age but principally because of his weakened bodily condition
due to illness contracted in the course of his employment should be given
compensation for his inability to work during the remaining days before his
scheduled compulsory retirement, aside from the retirement benefits received by
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in the case of <span class="SpellE"><b><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Afable</span></u></b></span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>vs</u>. <u>Workmen's</u> <u>Compensation</u>
<u>Commission</u>, <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>135 SCRA 336, the same conclusion was reached on the basis of
the law it­self, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"An affirmative answer is called for. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Section 3 of the Workmen's Compensation Act
provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘This Act shall also be appli­cable to all officials, employees and
laborers in the service of the National Government and its poli­tical
subdivisions and instrument­alities; Provided, however, That officials,
laborers, and employees insured with the Government Ser­vice Insurance System,
and their dependents when entitled to the benefits of said insurance system
shall, in addition to the same, be entitled to the benefits granted by this
Act.’”</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner applied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">for </span>retirement at age 61, not for reason of old age but because
of the stroke she suffered in the course of her employment that left her right
arm and hand paralyzed and her right leg and foot with a limp despite physical
therapy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for this
disability, she could have continued her employment until she reached the age
of compulsory retirement at 65 on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="6">June
 16, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As her disability
caused her loss of earning capacity from July, 1970 until <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="6">June 16, 1974</st1:date>, she should be compensated <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> in accordance with the schedule provided by
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No disability compensation was due
her during the period of hospitalization and recuperation as there was no loss
of earning capacity, petitioner having been paid her usual salary during said
period.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the reimbursement of medical expenses, there can
be no question of petitioner's entitlement thereto, the provision of law in
this regard being explicit and categorical:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>13. <b><u>Services,</u>
<u>appliances</u> <u>and</u> <u>supplies</u></b>.- Immediately after an
employee has suffered an in jury or contracted sickness and during the
subsequent period of disability, the employer or the insurance carrier shall
provide the employee with such services, appliances and supplies as the nature
of his disability and the process of his recovery may require; and that which
will promote his early restoration to the maximum level of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">his </span>physical capacity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The word 'service' used herein shall include medical,
surgical, dental, hospital and nursing attendance and treatment as well as the
proper fitting and training in the use of appliances and the necessary training
for purposes of rehabilitation xxx".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Anent the second issue, the records disclose that a copy of the
decision of the Workmen's Compensation Commission dated <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="10">October 9, 1975</st1:date> was received by counsel for
