<p class="BODY">In a decision dated <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="6">June
 14, 1989</st1:date>, the Court of Appeals annulled the orders of the trial
court and directed it to cease and desist from proceeding with the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the Court of Appeals, Fu <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>
and K.K. Shell were not suppliers but sub-agents of NSS, hence they were bound
by the Agency Agreement between <span class="SpellE">Crestamonte</span> and NSS,
particularly, the choice of forum clause, which provides:</p>

<blockquote><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">12.0</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> - </span>That this Agreement shall be

concerned regarding this Agreement shall be subject exclusively to the
jurisdiction of the District Courts of Japan.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, concluded the Court of Appeals, the trial court should have
disallowed their motions to intervene.</p>

<p class="BODY">A motion for reconsideration was filed by Fu <span class="SpellE">Hing</span>
and K.K. Shell but this was denied by the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the pleadings filed by the parties and the
arguments raised therein, the Court finds reversible error on the part of the
Court of Appeals insofar as it disallowed petitioners’ intervention in the case
before the trial court and ordered the latter to cease and desist from
proceeding with the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A reading of the Agency

south-bound cargoes as above-mentioned be insufficient to cover the aforesaid
expenses, the Agent shall provide credit to the extent of the vessels’
requirements, provided however that said obligation shall be secured by the
Owner committing at least forty-eight (48) sailings of Japan/Philippines liner

due collection of all inward freight payable at the port against delivery

governed by the Laws of Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any
matters, disputes, and/or differences arising between the parties hereto
concerned regarding this Agreement shall be subject exclusively to the jurisdiction
of the District Courts of Japan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Annex
"G" of the Petition, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 100­-104.]<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">No express reference to the contracting of sub?agents or
the applicability of the terms of the agreement, particularly the
choice-of-forum clause, to sub-agents is made in the text of the agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the contract clearly states are NSS’
principal duties, i.e., that it shall provide for the necessary services
required for the husbanding of <span class="SpellE">Crestamonte’s</span> vessels
in Japanese ports (section 2.0) and shall be responsible for fixing south-­bound
cargoes with revenues sufficient to cover ordinary expenses (section 3.0).</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the complaint-in-intervention filed by K.K. Shell
merely alleges that it provided and supplied the MV Estella with marine diesel
oil/fuel, upon request of NSS who was acting for and as duly appointed agent of
<span class="SpellE">Crestamonte</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
116-117.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is thus no basis for the
Court of Appeal’s finding, as regards K.K. Shell in relation to its
intervention in Civil Case No. 87-38930, that "the sub-agents admitted in
their pleadings that they were appointed as local agent/sub-agent or
representatives by NSS by virtue of said Agency Agreement" [Decision, p.
7; <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>p. 33.] What the Court of Appeals
could have been referring to was K.K. Shell’s Urgent Motion for Leave to Intervene
dated February 24, 1987 in another case (Civil Case No. 86-38704) in another
court and involving other vessels (MV Ofelia and MV Christina C), where it was
alleged that K.K. Shell is "one of the representatives of N.S. Shipping
Corporation for the supply of bunker oil, fuel oil, provisions and other
necessaries to vessels of which N.S. Shipping Corporation was the general
agent." [Comment, p. 17; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 274.]
However, this allegation does not conclusively establish <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>sub-agency
between NSS and K.K. Shell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
therefore surprising how the Court of Appeals could have come to the
conclusion, just on the basis of the Agency Agreement and the pleadings filed
in the trial court, that "<span class="SpellE">Crestamonte</span> is the
principal, NSS is the agent and . . . Fu <span class="SpellE">Hing</span> and
K.K. Shell are the sub-agents." [Decision, p. 6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 32.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the inconclusiveness of the Agency Agreement and the
pleadings filed in the trial court, additional evidence, if there be any, would
still have to be presented to establish the allegation that K.K. Shell is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>sub-agent
of NSS.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same vein, as the choice-of-forum clause in the agreement
(paragraph 12.0) has not been conclusively shown to be binding upon K.K. Shell,
additional evidence would also still have to be presented to establish this
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>K.K. Shell cannot therefore, as
of yet, be barred from instituting an action in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents
have anticipated the possibility that the courts will not find that K.K. Shell
is expressly bound by the Agency Agreement, and thus they fall back on the
argument that even if this were so, the doctrine of <u>forum</u> <u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>conveniens</u></span> would be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>valid ground to cause the dismissal
of K.K. Shell's complaint-in?intervention.</p>

<p class="BODY">K.K. Shell counters this argument by invoking its right as
maritime <span class="SpellE">lienholder</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It cites Presidential Decree No. 1521, the Ship Mortgage Decree of 1978,
which provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC.<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>21.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Maritime</u> <u>Lien</u> <u>for</u> <u>Necessaries:</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>person</u> <u>entitled</u> <u>to</u> <u>such</u>
<u>lien.</u> - Any person furnishing repairs, supplies, towage, use of dry dock
or marine railway, or other necessaries, to any vessel, whether foreign or
domestic, upon the order of the owner of such vessel, or of a person authorized
by the owner, shall have a maritime lien on the vessel, which may be enforced
by suit <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>rem</u></span>, and it shall be
necessary to allege <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>prove
that credit was given to the vessel.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents on the other hand argue that even if P.D. No.
1521 is applicable, K.K. Shell cannot rely on the maritime lien because the
fuel was provided not exclusively for the benefit of the MV Estella, but for
the benefit of <span class="SpellE">Crestamonte</span> in general.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the law it must be established that the
credit was extended to the vessel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now, this is a defense that calls precisely
for a factual determination by the trial court of who benefited from the
delivery of the fuel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
again, the necessity for the reception of evidence before the trial court.</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In other words, considering the dearth of evidence due to the
fact that the private respondents have yet to file their answer in the
proceedings below and trial on the merits is still to be conducted, whether or
not petitioners are indeed maritime <span class="SpellE">lienholders</span> and
as such may enforce the lien against the MV Estella are matters that still have
to be established.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither are we ready to rule on the private respondents’
invocation of the doctrine of <u>forum</u> <u>non</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>conveniens</u></span>,
as the exact nature of the relationship of the parties is still to be
established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We leave this matter to the
sound discretion of the trial court judge who is in the best position, after
some vital facts are established, to determine whether special circumstances
require that his court desist from assuming jurisdiction over the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was clearly reversible error on the part of the Court of
Appeals to annul the trial court's orders, insofar as K.K. Shell is concerned,
and order the trial court to cease and desist from proceeding with Civil Case
No. 87-38930.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are still numerous material
facts to be established in order to arrive at a conclusion as to the true
nature of the relationship between <span class="SpellE">Crestamonte</span> and
K.K. Shell and between NSS and K.K. Shell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The best recourse would have been to allow the trial court to proceed
with Civil Case No. 87-38930 and consider whatever defenses may be raised by
private respondents after they have filed their answer and evidence to support
their conflicting claims has been presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court of Appeals, however, substituted its judgment for that of the
trial court and decided the merits of the case, even in the absence of
evidence, on the pretext of reviewing an interlocutory order.</p>
