This is a land registration case involving 128 hectares of land located in Cabagan, Isabela. On page 125 of the <em>Gaceta de Manila</em> dated January 30, 1884, it was published that the land applied for by <em>Bruno Cabanatan</em> (sic) "en la jurisdiccion de <em>Cabagan </em>de la de Isabela de Luzon" was declared "enagenables" (Exh. P).
<p>
On page 142 of the <em>Gaceta de Manila</em> dated <em>August 2,</em> 1885, this entry was published: "Adjudicando a x x x D. Bruno <em>Cabanatan </em>(sic) la extension de <em>138 hectareas,</em> 91 areas y 50 centiareas de terreno situado en el pueblo de <em>Cabagan</em>, en Isabela de Luzon, en la cantidad de pfs. 188'71, 6/8" (Exh. Q. The name is "Cabauatan" in Exh. M).
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Bruno Cabanatan" of <em>Cabagan</em>, Isabela appears as No. 322 
in a handwritten list of "Expedientes Remitidos a Terrenos Publicos" 
(terminated cases) dated November 30, 1901 in the files of the Division 
of Archives (Exh. L and O). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, the applicants have not produced in evidence any composition 
title, the basis of their application. It was allegedly burned in the 
house of Pepe Buraga during the war (34 tsn June 26, 1956). So, we do 
not know the boundaries of the 138-hectare land allegedly adjudicated to
 <em>Bruno Cabanatan,</em> granting that he was the same as Bruno Cabauatan, the ancestor of the applicants; in what barrio or sitio of <em>Cabagan</em> it is located; why in 1932 the 138 hectares had been increased to <em>154 hectares</em>,
 and why in 1921 the same land was declared for tax purposes in the name
 of Honofre Cabauatan, Bruno's nephew, and not in the names of Bruno's 
heirs.
</p><p>
As correctly contended by the Solicitor General, the land applied for must be <em>identified</em>. The claim of possession or having a composition title is inutile if the land is not identified.
</p><p>
Bruno died during the Spanish regime. The year when he died is not 
known. He is survived by seven children with the following descendants:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    1.  Candida, survived by Lucio Guingab and Jose Buraga.
  </p>
  <p>
    2.  Paulina, survived by Maria, Jose, Gregorio and Epifania, 
surnamed Samus (children of the first marriage) and by Eugenia and 
Vicente Uanan, children of her second marriage.
  </p>
  <p>
    3.  Francisco, survived by Manuel, Faustina, Juan and Remedios.
  </p>
  <p>
    4.  Bruno 2nd, survived by Purisima, Francisco, Cristeta, Benjamin and Respicio.
  </p>
  <p>
    5.  Salvador, survived by Paz, Lucio, Lourdes and Pilar, who is dead
 and is in turn survived by her children Celso Mesa and Ruben Mesa.
  </p>
  <p> 6.  Heculina, survived by Faustino, Maria, Alejandra, Genoveva, 
Amada and Francisco, all sur­named Cauan. Genoveva Cauan is dead and is 
survived by her child, Josefina Balmaceda. </p>
  <p>
    7.  Guillermo, survived by his son, Pedro Cabauatan.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Bruno had a brother named Leon, who had a son named Honofre (Onofre) 
who, curiously enough, obtained in 1921 a tax declaration for the 138 
hectares assessed at P5,200. In that tax declaration, it was stated that
 the land is located at Malasi, <em>Cabagan</em>, bounded on the north, 
east and south by public land (P.D.) and on the west by a mountain. How 
Onofre came to have a tax declaration for that land has not been 
adequately explained.
</p><p>
Emilio Cabauatan, a son of Onofre, in his opposition and testimony 
claimed that lawyer Miguel Binag, in behalf of Bruno's heirs, in 1937 
proposed to use the said declaration in the land registration 
proceeding. He promised to give the heirs of Onofre Cabauatan one-third 
of the land. However, lawyer Binag denied that he ever made such a 
proposition.
</p><p>
Emilio also claimed that the land of Bruno is in <em>Sitio Malini</em>, three kilometers from <em>Sitio Malasi</em>. The trial court and Binag denied that there was a sitio in <em>Cabagan</em> called Malini. It was not found in the list of sitios in the governor's office.
</p><p>
On <em>March 5, 1934</em> Judge Mariano Rosauro issued Decree No. 536561 for the registration of a parcel of land, plan Psu 95520, with an area of <em>25 hectares</em> located at the "sitio of Malisi, Barrio of Aggub," <em>Cabagan</em>. It was registered in the names of the following heirs of Bruno as <em>proindiviso</em> co-owners <em>without regard to the right of representation</em> (Exh. J):

<p>The 25 hectares land already registered has as boundaries parts of 
the land under controversy. Thus, the decree states that the 25 hectares
 are bounded on the northeast and sough by public lands; on the east by 
property of Tomas Vinarao vs. heirs of Bruno Cabauatan; on the west by 
property of Lucas Pagulayan vs. heirs of Bruno Cabauatan and on the 
northwest by the Lagoon Malasi Grande and public land.

</p><p>
It may be asked: why did not that 1934 registration case embrace the 
whole 138 hectares allegedly covered by Bruno's composition title and 
why did Bruno's heirs have to resort to a second or another registration
 case in 1937? The applicants have not offered any satisfactory 
explanation.
</p><p>
In 1934, the year the 25 hectares of land located at Malasi, <em>Cabagan</em>, was registered in the names of Bruno's heirs, they produced a <em>survey plan, Psu-95458</em>, for his land which had an area of <em>154 hectares</em>, much larger than the <em>138 hectares</em>,
 adjudicated to Bruno in 1885. Clearly, the area was inflated by 16 
hectares. The land consisted of seven contiguous lots located in Barrio 
Aggub, <em>Cabagan</em>. <em>It included the 25 hectares of plan Psu-95520</em> which was already registered and which was designated as <em>Lot No. 6.
</em>
</p><p>
The plan was based on a 1932 survey. The surveyor in 1934 indicated in 
the plan Psu-95458 the following claimants of the seven lots (Exh. F):

<p>The provincial fiscal, in representation of the Director of Lands, 
alleged in his opposition that the land claimed by Bruno's heirs was 
covered by the <em>approved and subsisting homestead applications</em> 
of (1) Santiago Aggabao, deceased, now heirs represented by Simplicio 
Aggabao; (2) Ignacio Bangug, deceased, now his heirs represented by 
Anacleto Bangug; (3) Eusebio Gumiran, deceased, now his heirs 
represented by Luis Gumiran; (4) Antonio Deray, deceased, now his heirs 
represented by Pablo Deray; (5) Casiano Mabbayad, transferor, now 
Rodolfo Albano, transferee, and (6) Gaudencio Flores (p. 23, RA).

</p><p>
As already stated, the instant <em>second </em>registration case was 
filed in 1937 based on an expanded survey. The applicants are the very 
same heirs of Bruno who were the applicants in the first registration 
case.
</p><p>
They claim the land without taking into account the rule on 
representation. The record does not disclose why the case was not 
finished before liberation. The trial commenced <em>in 1956 </em>or almost twenty years after the application was filed. That is an unusual feature of the case.
</p><p>
<em>Evidence for the applicants, Bruno's heirs</em>. - From the 
testimonies of Candida Cabauatan, Jose Buraga, Gabriel Zipagan and 
Placido Angoluan, the trial court found that the land in question (128.8
 plus 25.4 or 154 hectares) was administered by Bruno's son, Salvador. 
There were allegedly forty tenants during the Spanish regime working in 
the middle portion of the land.
</p><p>
Some of the tenants were still on the land during the American regime. 
They have been cultivating the land under the overseers, Zipagan and 
Angoluan. During the Spanish regime, Bruno's children received 1/3 of 
the products, such as corn and palay, as the owner's share. The tenants 
also planted kapok, acacia trees and some oranges.
</p><p>
They allegedly constructed rice paddies and built dwelling houses. 
Bruno's heirs have possessed the land openly, peacefully, continuously 
and in the concept of owner since the Spanish regime up to the present 
time.
</p><p>
In 1916, about 50 hectares of the land were under cultivation, the 
greater portion of which is included in Lot No. 6, which, as already 
mentioned, was registered in 1934 in the names of Bruno's heirs, the 
same applicants in this 1937 case. The land taxes were paid since 1921 
in the name of Honofre, not an heir of Bruno.
</p><p>
<em>Evidence for the Director of Lands and homesteaders</em>. - As oppositor, the Director of Lands presented the following documentary evidence:
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    (1)  The 1924 homestead application of <em>Eusebio Gumiran </em>and his intention to make final proof dated July 22, 1930 for 24 hectares of land located at Sitio Malasi, Barrio Aggub, <em>Cabagan</em> (Exh. 1-3).
  </p>
  <p>
    (2)  The order dated August 28, 1931 for the issuance of a patent to <em>Pascual Bangug </em>for 24 hectares covered by his 1911 application (Exh. 5 and 6-DL).
  </p>
  <p>
    (3)  The approval dated November 23, 1931 of <em>Ignacio Bangug's</em> homestead application for 10 hectares (Exh. 7 and 8-DL).
  </p>
  <p>
    (4)  The approval dated March 23, 1932 of <em>Casiano Mabbayad's </em>homestead application for 24 hectares (Exh. 10 and 11-DL).
  </p>
  <p>
    (5)  The approval dated August 12, 1950 of <em>Gaudencio Flores' </em>homestead application for 24 hectares (Exh. 12 and 13-DL).
  </p>
  <p>
    (6)  The approval dated August 24, 1932 of <em>Santiago Aggabao's </em>1926 homestead application for 24 hectares (Exh. 14 and 16-DL).
  </p>
  <p>
    (7)  The approval dated May 15, 1928 of <em>Antonio Deray's </em>homestead application for 24 hectares (Exh. 17-DL).
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As noted by the Solicitor General, the Court of Appeals failed to 
mention in its decision the evidence for the homesteaders. The following
 is a summary of that evidence by the Solicitor General and the trial 
court.
</p><p>
<em>Ignacio Bangug</em> in 1917 occupied about ten hectares of the land 
in Sitio Malasi. He planted it to rice, corn, tobacco and beans. He 
applied in 1926 for a homestead over that parcel of land (Exh. 11). He 
paid the land taxes as early as 1922 (Exh. 1 to 10). His application was
 approved in 1931. After his death in 1931, his son Jose continued to 
occupy the homestead. Jose Bangug did not know that the land was 
included in the survey made for Bruno's heirs.
</p><p>
<em>Pascual Bangug,</em> who died in 1950, had cultivated a portion of 
the disputed land since 1910 and in 1911 he filed his homestead 
application (Exh. F). He declared it for tax purposes and paid the land 
taxes since 1916 (Exh. 2 to 24). The homestead patent was issued in 1931
 (Exh. 25). He built his house on the land. His heirs continued his 
possession after his death. Pascual planted the land to rice, corn, 
mongo, peanuts, oranges, lemon, acacia and bamboos.
</p><p>
<em>Eusebio Gumiran</em> occupied in 1924 a portion of Lots Nos. 4 and 5
 (Exh. K). He filed his homestead appli­cation in that same year. He 
planted the land to rice and other staple crops. He made a final proof 
in 1930. After his death in 1942, his children and widow conti­nued to 
possess the homestead.
</p><p>
<em>Santiago Aggabao</em> started occupying the land in Sitio Malasi in 
1927. It has an area of 24 hectares. His homestead application was 
approved in 1932 (Exh. 16). His children have possessed the homestead 
after his death. They planted it to rice, corn and vegetables.
</p><p>
<em>Antonio Deray</em> filed in 1924 his homestead application for 24 
hectares in what is now Lot No. 2 of the survey plan. It was approved in
 1928 (Exh. 17 and 18-DL). His heirs have been in possession of the 
homestead.
</p><p>
<em>Gaudencio Flores </em>and the heirs of Honofre Cabauatan also presented evidence as oppositors but they did not appeal to this Court.
</p><p>
<em>Ruling.</em> - The trial court granted the application for 
registration of the six lots with an area of 128 hectares, in addition 
to the oft-mentioned 25 hectares already registered. It reasoned out 
that if Bruno's heirs had possession of the said 25 hectares, they could
 be deemed to have "constructive possession" of the remaining part of 
the land provided that the same is not in the adverse possession of 
another person (Ramos vs. Director of Lands, 39 Phil. 175).
</p><p>
We hold that the rule on constructive possession does not apply to this 
case because the major portion of the disputed 128 hectares has been in 
the adverse possession of homesteaders and their heirs and is still part
 of the public domain until the patents are issued.
</p><p>
The area claimed is in excess of that mentioned in the composition 
title. The alleged lost composition title cannot be given any probative 
value. Its contents were not proven by secondary evidence. The precise 
location of the land and the possession thereof were not proven by the 
applicants. The alleged possession of Bruno's heirs may refer to the 25 
hectares already registered in their names. Inexplicably, the 
registration of the 154 hectares was made in two installments.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the decisions of the Court of Appeals and the trial court are
 reversed and set aside. The application for registration is dismissed. 
The Director of Lands should issue to appellant heirs of the deceased 
homesteaders their patents in accordance with the Public Land Law. Costs
 against the applicants.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero, Escolin,</em> and <em>Cuevas, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Abad Santos, J</em>., no part.
