that at most Complainants should be suspended by way of punishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why did we make such a conclusion?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We took into consideration the circumstances
surrounding the complainants' employment in the year 1982 where most of their
infractions committed made basis of their termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to 1982 there were four employees doing
<span class="SpellE">tellering</span> work with Respondent at <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> Branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the resignation of the two above-mentioned employees only herein
Complainants were left to perform the duties as tellers with the same volume of
work, if not more, as handled before in 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Definitely with the two remaining tellers (herein Complainants) who
handled the <span class="SpellE">tellering</span> work in the bank there was a
change of pace, effort and efficiency in their performance which inevitably led
to the overages and shortages and the encashment <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">of </span>checks without following the usual procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainants have to double their efforts in
the performance of duties as tellers to accommodate the same, but probably
more, transactions and clients of herein Respondent bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why Respondent Bank failed to augment the
depleted number of tellers knowing that Bank transactions do not increase and
normally increase is beyond our comprehension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

was the result of a situation wherein there were only two tellers doing the <span class="SpellE">tellering</span> work normally for four subsequently to <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">six </span>would mean chances of committing
shortages and overages, rendering of overtime work and in some instances allow
checks to be <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> without following proper
procedures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainants could not be
totally blamed and branded as inefficient and negligent, because of
contributing factors of being over burdened in the performance of their duties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is a limit to human <span class="SpellE">endeavour</span>
that once you reach the peak inevitably one is likely to commit slight error or
infraction similar to what has been incurred to by herein Complainants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We want to treat deeper the aspect of allowing encashment of
checks without the proper verification of drawer's signature and without
signature of authorized bank officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the records it appears procedurally when a check is presented for
encashment to a teller, the teller refers the check to a <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">signature </span>verifier then it is given
to the bank officer for its signature that everything is in order and to be
returned to the teller for encashment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From the circumstances cited by Complainants in their position paper and
in their explanation during the investigation it was the duty of a signature
verifier, if there is one, to study the specimen of the drawer and gives it to
a bank officer for signature and before a check should be returned to the
teller everything presumably is in order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But in the case of Complainant <span class="SpellE">Rana</span> the checks
were returned to her even if there was no signature of authorized bank officer
likewise in the case of Complainant <span class="SpellE">Suratos</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is what happened to Complainants that
upon the return of the checks, which were supposedly verified and signed they
presumed were in order and because of the volume of transaction did not notice
that not all the procedures were followed the checks were <span class="SpellE">encashed</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Why were the checks returned to the teller
despite lacking in certain requirements?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The situation therefore again could not be possibly entirely complainants'
fault, but definitely they were negligent to a certain degree by force of
circumstances prevailing due to lack of sufficient personnel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the matter of Complainants' failure to
report to the Central Bank Cash Unit for instruction this can again be
justified that due to the volume of work that they could not immediately leave
the bank without finishing all bank transactions required of them that when
they realized it the lecture being conducted by the Central Bank was already
finished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span> <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Finally, by way of evaluating whether overages
and shortages are to be considered as serious we took into consideration the
provision of the CBA particularly Section 3 - <u>Tellers Allowance</u> -<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">" 'Each</span> teller shall be given a
yearly allowance to Six Hundred Pesos (P600.00) from which shall be deducted
the shortages she may incur during the year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">balance of the allowance
after deduction of shortages shall be given to the teller; However if no
shortage is incurred, the full amount of the allowance shall be received by the
teller, and the same shall be paid not later than July 31, of each year.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Article XIII)' "<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"This particular provision of the CBA
shows that among the hazards of the tellers is to incur shortages and overages
up to a certain limit and the same serves as an incentive to tellers who will
not incur shortages and overages the said allowance shall be given <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to the employee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This very provision therefore is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">clear indication that such infractions are allowable provided that it
should not go beyond the limit provided, but to reiterate for the last time the
shortages and overages were inevitable infractions of Complainants due to
volume of work they handled at that time." </span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

petitioner states that notwithstanding its manifestation, the Executive Labor
Arbiter issued an Order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="6">June 24,
 1985</st1:date> ordering the disbursing officer to <span class="SpellE">encash</span>
the check for delivery in favor of the private respondents as partial
settlement of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that it was forced to make such payment
because of the arbitrary and whimsical acts of the Labor Arbiter, the sheriff,
and the private respondents' counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The respondents do not rebut these allegations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General is the lawyer for the Government and its
various departments and instrumentalities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, he is correct in not sustaining the acts of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">public officials when they commit grave error
and he, instead, pleads justice for the private party.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no question from the records that the private
respondents committed violations which, because of the nature of their jobs,
are appropriately penalized by dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

"advanced payment" erroneously ordered by the Labor Arbiter may be
set off against the respondents' termination pay and only the balance, if any,
will have to be returned to the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This arrangement would be in keeping with the spirit of harmony and
compassion that workers and employers should show to one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
