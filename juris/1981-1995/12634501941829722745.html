				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Charged with murder in the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Agbot</span> was, after due trial, convicted of the crime charged,
and sentenced to death and ordered to indemnify the heirs of the deceased,
Leona <span class="SpellE">Agbot</span> <span class="SpellE">Subat</span>, in the
sum of P12,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence this mandatory
review of the death sentence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts upon which
appellant was convicted, as quoted from the People's brief are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>At about 4:00 o'clock in the afternoon of October 8, 1972, the
accused Antonio <span class="SpellE">Agbot</span> went to the house of his sister
Leona <span class="SpellE">Agbot</span>, married to <span class="SpellE">Asisclo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subat</span>, in <span class="SpellE">sitio</span> <span class="SpellE">Panganudan</span>, barrio <span class="SpellE">Lamiawan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Carraga</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental, and
demanded from her the return of his twelve-year old daughter <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>, who had been under the care and custody of Leona
<span class="SpellE">Agbot</span> <span class="SpellE">Subat</span> since she was
two years old. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Leona refused to
surrender the child to the accused because of her sacrifices and expenses in
the upbringing and education of <span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused left angrily, saying --
"tighten your belt", a phrase which, in the custom of the <span class="SpellE">Mandayan</span> tribe to which they belong, meant "something
bad will be forthcoming to you not long from now." (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
pp. 45-47, <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">Mar. 26, 1973</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="30" hour="19">7:30 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1972" day="8" month="10">October 8, 1972</st1:date>,
while <span class="SpellE">Asisclo</span> <span class="SpellE">Subat</span> and
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Baucan</span>, step-son of the victim, were
relaxing at the porch of their house, and Leona <span class="SpellE">Agbot</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subat</span> was preparing supper in the kitchen, a gun
explosion was heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Asisclo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subat</span> and Francisco <span class="SpellE">Baucan</span>
tried to ascertain where the gun report came from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, Francisco called out -- "Mama,
mama," directing his call to his step-mother Leona <span class="SpellE">Subat</span>
who came rushing from the kitchen, wounded and bleeding on the right
breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a few seconds, the latter
dropped on the floor and exÂ­pired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 48-50, <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">Mar.
 26, 1973</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the following morning, <st1:date year="1972" day="9" month="10">October 9,
 1972</st1:date>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Baucan</span>, who was a
councilor of the place, went to barrio captain <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span> and reported the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter sent a note to Patrolman Manuel <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span> who was assigned in a nearby police checkpoint and,
together, they proceeded to the house of the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 5-6, <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">Mar, 26, 1973</st1:date>) A joint investigation
was conducted by <span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found the cadaver already dressed up and
ready for burial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They also saw gunshot
wounds on the right breast of the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 6-7, id.) Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span> drew a sketch (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. D)
indicating the place where the victim was found dead and the location of the
wounds sustained by the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 117-118, <st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="6">June
 21, 1973</st1:date>) No post-mortem examination was conducted on the cadaver
of Leona <span class="SpellE">Subat</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While thus conducting their investigation in the house of the
victim, the accused arrived thereat and admitted to <span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span>
that he was the one who shot the victim using a "<span class="SpellE">paltik</span>"
shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
pp. 11-12, 16-18, <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">Mar. 26, 1973</st1:date>)
Whereupon, <span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span> ordered two of his barrio
councilmen, Luis <span class="SpellE">Ligasan</span> and Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Benaning</span>, who were present to proceed to the house of the
accused and get the firearm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
getting the firearm, the same was shown to the accused who identified it as the
weapon he used in shooting the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 8-13, <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">Mar. 26, 1973</st1:date>) Thereafter, Barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span> turned over the shotgun and empty shell, as well as
the person of the accused to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 23-24, <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">Mar.
 26, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1972</st1:date>,
appellant executed an extrajudicial confession before the police authorities of
<span class="SpellE">Caraga</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C) which was
subscribed and sworn to by him before Municipal Judge Manuel B. Castro.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, pp. 107-108,
June 21, 1973; pp. 34-35, <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="3">Mar. 26, 1973</st1:date>)"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">From the fact that no
post-mortem examination was made, nor was a ballistic examination conducted,
appellant would dispute the sufficiency of the evidence to support his
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he would claim that no
competent proof was adduced that the wounds were caused by a gunshot, or that
assuming that they were, the home-made gun (<span class="SpellE">paltik</span>)
belonging to appellant was the gun that fired the shots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">That a gun explosion was
heard just seconds before the deceased was wounded while she was alone in the
kitchen is by itself an almost undisputable evidence that the wounds were
caused by that same gunshot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No one was
seen near her who could have inflicted the wounds with a weapon that could find
its mark only if the victim was within physical reach of the assailant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only a gun could have caused the wounds which
can reach its target even from an appreciable distance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The wounds themselves, as seen by the state witnesses,
particularly Barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span> and Patrolman Manuel <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span>,
were readily described by them as gunshot wounds, one as big as one and
one-half inches in diameter and six (6) smaller ones obviously caused by
pellets of a bullet fired from appellant's kind of a gun, a shotgun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can hardly be any ground for doubt as
to their competence in identifying the wounds as caused by a gun as distinguished
from one caused by a sharp-bladed weapon, much less a blunt instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of exits of the wounds, as
testified to by Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
bolsters the conclusion or finding that the wounds sustained by the victim were
gun-inflicted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an effort to discredit
the testimony of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span> and Barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span>, appellant points to Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span>
allegedly saying that he saw one (1) big penetrating wound while Barrio Captain
<span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span>, as well as <span class="SpellE">Asisclo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Subat</span>, declared he saw six (6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An examination of Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Quiros</span>' testimony will show that he did not say that he saw
only one (1) wound with no other wounds sustained by the deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The small wounds caused evidently by tiny
pellets bursting out of a shotgun bullet may not have been noticed by Patrolman
<span class="SpellE">Quiros</span>, and so, he made mention only of the one (1)
big penetrating wound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lack of ballistic
examination can neither detract from the weight of the evidence presented
showing that appellant's gun was the offending weapon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It fits the nature of the wounds inflicted on
the deceased, being a shotgun whose bullet emits pellets, and the empty shell
which was found with the shotgun (<span class="SpellE">paltik</span>) taken from
appellant's house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ballistic experts are
not needed to establish the relation between the wounds and appellant's "<span class="SpellE">paltik</span>" shotgun in the face of the evidence that the
weapon is admittedly one that belonged to appellant, and the empty shell found
in his house even smelled gun powders which was proof of recent firing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The shotgun (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A) and the empty shell (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. B) were indeed retrieved
from appellant's house the morning following the night of the shooting made
possible by appellant's own admission of authorship of the shooting, without
which these objects could not have been traced to, and recovered from, his
house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's denial of having made the foregoing admission and <span style="">of having mentioned anything about the
shotgun to Barrio Captain <span class="SpellE">Sobiaco</span> is unworthy of
belief.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he did not make the admission
when confronted by the barrio captain at the victim's own house, how could the
two (2) barrio councilmen, Luis <span class="SpellE">Ligasan</span> and Adolfo <span class="SpellE">Benaning</span>, have been sent to recover appellant's firearm at
the latter's house?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A fact related to
what part the weapon had in the killing and the person who actively played the
role in using it, must have surfaced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
other fact suggests itself more than the appellant's owning the shooting when
confronted by the barrio captain to whom report of the shooting had been
earlier made, and to whom the only suspect was mentioned, together with the
circumstance that drew suspicion to appellant -- the threat of harm befalling
the deceased with the meaningful words "tighten your belt."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The verity of appellant's
admission of guilt having been firmly established, the contention that the
confiscation or seizure of the gun was illegal, there being no search warrant
and its </span>use as <span style="">evidence is not
permissible, clearly becomes devoid of factual or legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With his confession, his voluntarily
surrendering the weapon with which he committed the offense would be but a
natural consequence of his having admitted guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The taking of the gun from his house was,
therefore, with consent and acquiescence that would not constitute a violation
of the constitutional guaranty against the admissibility of illegally seized
objects as evidence against an accused.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellant's claim of his
confession having been extracted by force and maltreatment would, likewise, be
completely unbelievable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having readily
admitted his guilt when confronted by the investigators right in the house of
the victim, the very presence of his own departed sister laying in state
perhaps unnerving him in his vile desire to conceal the truth, how could he
still try to deny and turn back from his earlier admission made to a barrio
official when he later was formally investigated by the police?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No less than the Municipal Judge Manuel B.
Castro, testified to appellant having answered in the affirmative when asked if
he was willing to </span>swe<span style="">ar</span> <span style="">to the truth of his confession</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The confession itself, by
the facts with which it is so replete, which appellant alone could have
supplied and the obvious attempt to mitigate his liability by alleging that he
did the act in </span>a <span style="">fit of
vengeance because the victim was the one who ordered the killing of his brother
<span class="SpellE">Ansog</span> <span class="SpellE">Agbot</span>, bears the
earmarks of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span>.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The police investigators could not have just
conceived of this alleged fact from pure imagination to be placed in
appellant's confession, considering the extreme improbability of a sister
ordering the killing of a brother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
the motive of the killing, what should have found its way to the confession is
the incident just before the shooting when appellant hurled a threat at his
sister, as narrated by the victim's husband to the barrio captain, had
appellant not been allowed full freedom to tell his story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">With appellant's confession fulfilling all elements of
admissibility, and supported as it is by independent evidence of <u>corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span></u>, which is the fact of the crime having been
committed,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
together with the finding in appellant's house of the weapon that <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> inflicted the fatal wounds sustained by the
deceased, it would be futile to argue against the sufficiency of the evidence
to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt, as counsel has tried to do, and
commendably so, had it not been for his manifest misreading of the
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he would aver that <u>corpus
<span class="SpellE">delicti</span></u> has not been proven<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
when the fact of death due to foul means has been so undeniably established by
the lifeless body bearing wounds that <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span>
caused the death to the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed is murder, qualified by treachery and with
the aggravating circumstances of dwelling<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and relationship, the victim being the sister of appellant.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Evident premeditation
cannot be appreciated against appellant it appearing that no time sufficient
for calm reflection of the consequences of the crime committed intervened
between planning and execution.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Neither sex could be taken against appellant

<p class="BODY">While lack of instruction may not be appreciated in favor of
appellant as argued by counsel, the offense of taking one's life being
forbidden by natural law and therefore within the instinctive knowledge and
feeling of an human being not deprived of reason,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
appellant being a member of the cultural minority may be considered in his
favor, pursuant to Sec. 106 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and <span class="SpellE">Sulu</span> and entitle him, regardless of the attending
circumstances, to life imprisonment instead of death.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
It is no legal obstacle to accord to him this benefit of the law because he
failed to invoke same in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, for in an appeal of a

commission or omission, as may be imputable to the trial court.</p>
