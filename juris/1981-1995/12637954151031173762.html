<p>The accused-appellant was charged in the Regional Trial Court of Aparri, 
Cagayan, with the crime of robbery with arson, committed in conspiracy with two 
other persons who could not be tried with him because they were then at 
large.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> He asks for a reversal of the 
decision convicting him of the crime of arson and sentencing him to the maximum 
penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> plus civil indemnity in the sum of 
P40,000.00 for the properties burned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>To prove the guilt of the accused, 
the prosecution presented three witnesses, namely, Teresa Gorospe, the owner of 
the burned house where the robbery allegedly took place, her son Frederick, and 
her brother Loreto Amorada.<br><br>Teresa Gorospe testified that at about 8 
o'clock in the evening of August 25, 1980, while she and some neighbors were 
watching their children at play in front of her house at Minaga, Gonzaga, 
Cagayan, Juan Ancheta, the accused-appellant, arrived and drove the group away, 
warning them that something would happen that night.&nbsp; He appeared to be 
intoxicated.&nbsp; Disturbed and intimidated by his presence, they dispersed and 
returned to their respective houses.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Later that night, she heard 
somebody shouting for her husband and when she peeped through her window she saw 
Ancheta and two men she did not know who asked to come into her house.&nbsp; One of 
them fired a gun and then forcibly opened the kitchen door.&nbsp; Once inside, the 
three men demanded the sum of P1,000.00, threatening to burn the house if the 
money was not delivered.&nbsp; It was at this point that she jumped out of the window 
to report the matter to their <em><em>barangay</em> </em>captain.&nbsp; She later 
returned with him and a councilman to find her house already in flames.&nbsp; She 
further declared that the people who had gathered could not put out the fire 
because the accused-appellant was brandishing a bolo and warned them they should 
not approach because he had more than thirty companions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Her son Frederick corroborated her 
testimony and added that he recognized the accused-appellant's companions as 
Remedios Yangat and Agustin Garcia because they had come to their house earlier 
in the afternoon to sell carabao meat.&nbsp; He further testified that it was Garcia 
who poured kerosene on the floor of their house and ignited it.&nbsp; Frederick and 
the other persons in the house escaped through the window but they received no 
response when they called for help because the people were afraid of the 
accused-appellant and his companions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Loreto Amorada, brother of Teresa 
Gorospe, recited a substantially similar version of the occurrence except that 
as he saw it the accused-appellant was unarmed and alone.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>For his part, the accused-appellant 
submitted a rather implausible tale that the trial court, we believe with good 
reason, found difficult to accept.&nbsp; According to him, he and his brother-in-law, 
Feliciano Reynon, were on their way to a betrothal at a relative's house at 
about 9 o'clock in the evening of August 25, 1980, when they met two armed men 
they did not know who asked them for the addresses of the <em>barangay</em> 
captain and a certain policeman.&nbsp; When they could not give this information, 
they were maltreated by the strangers with the firearms they were carrying.&nbsp; The 
accused-appellant was taken to the nearby sea and further manhandled by the two 
in knee-deep water.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> Reynon had earlier 
managed to escape, but, as he later testified, he stayed in hiding some twenty 
meters away to watch what was being done to Ancheta.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Continuing, the accused-appellant 
said that the two men took him along with them and, when they passed Teresa 
Gorospe's house, ordered him to call the owner to let them in.&nbsp; Teresa Gorospe 
opened her window and angrily scolded them for their rudeness in waking them up 
in the middle of the night but, unmindful of her rebuke, one of the two men 
pushed his way into the house.&nbsp; The other forcibly took him to a spot about 
thirty meters away.&nbsp; He soon heard a gunshot and saw the other man running away 
from Teresa Gorospe's house, which was then already on fire.&nbsp; After warning him 
not to report the incident on pain of death, the two men set him free.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Corroborating the 
accused-appellant, Reynon also testified that he reported the incident to the 
<em>barangay</em> captain, then went home and slept.&nbsp; There is no explanation in 
the record why he did not bother later to check what had happened to his 
brother-in-law, whose house was only 30 meters away from his<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> or why he was not awakened by the fire 
that razed Teresa Gorospe's house, which was only 100 meters away.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup><br><br>Ernesto Requinio's testimony 
affirmed the reports made to him as <em>barangay</em> captain, first by Teresa 
Gorospe, of the intruders in her house, and later by Reynon, of the entry in the 
<em>barangay</em> of two strangers.&nbsp; He declared that he went to the house of 
Teresa Gorospe that night and found it already on fire and that he did not see 
Ancheta then nor did he notice that the people were being prevented from 
quenching the fire.&nbsp; It would appear, however, that he was more concerned at the 
time with saving his brother's house nearby, which he ordered the people to wet 
to prevent it from being burned, and could not observe much of what was then 
happening elsewhere in the place.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup><br><br>We sustain the trial judge in 
giving credence to the evidence of the prosecution after having assessed it 
against the testimony of the defense witnesses, whom he also had the opportunity 
to observe personally.&nbsp; His impressions on these matters are binding on us in 
the absence of a clear showing of a grave abuse of discretion or an obvious 
misapprehension of the facts.&nbsp; We do not find such flaws in the factual 
conclusions of the court <em>a quo</em>.<br><br>While it may be conceded that 
there are certain inconsistencies and contradictions in the evidence of the 
prosecution, as the defense meticulously recites,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> they do not in our view detract from its 
substantial truthfulness and credibility.&nbsp; It is not difficult to believe that 
Ancheta committed the acts imputed to him while he was intoxicated,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> which is also the reason why — 
unnaturally, as the defense would now put it — he warned the victim of the crime 
they were intending to commit it.&nbsp; Interestingly, he himself testified that 
after the fire the brothers of Teresa Gorospe stoned his house and dared him to 
come out, but he did not accept the challenge, nor did it occur to him to at 
least ask why they were angry with him.&nbsp; He just slept.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellant's claim that 
he acted under the compulsion of an irresistible force or under the impulse of 
an uncontrollable fear severely strains the credibility and patience of this 
Court.&nbsp; His story of manhandling and coercion by two mysterious strangers — who 
had to take him to the nearby sea to maul him "in knee-deep water" as if in some 
esoteric ritual — is not even worthy of the pulp magazine fiction or the 
unbelievable television hogwash so popular nowadays.<br><br>We agree that there 
was a conspiracy among the accused-appellant and his two companions when they 
forcibly entered the house of Teresa Gorospe and burned it after their demand 
for P1,000.00 was not met.<br><br>A conspiracy exists when two or more persons 
come to an agreement concerning the commission of a felony and decide to commit 
it, whether they act through the physical volition of one or all, proceeding 
severally or collectively.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> It is 
settled that conspiracies need not be established by direct evidence of acts 
charged, but may and generally must be proved by a number of indefinite acts, 
conditions, and circumstances which vary according to the purpose to be 
accomplished.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> The very existence of a 
conspiracy is generally a matter of inference deduced from certain acts of the 
persons accused, done in pursuance of an apparent criminal or unlawful purpose 
in common between them.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><br>It has 
been amply demonstrated that in the evening of August 25, 1980, at about 11 
o'clock, Ancheta and his two companions awakened Teresa Gorospe, forced their 
entry into her house, demanded the amount of P1,000.00, and burned her house 
when the money was not delivered.&nbsp; Later, while the house was in flames, the 
accused-appellant, brandishing a bolo, prevented the people from approaching and 
putting out the fire by warning them that he had thirty companions.&nbsp; The three 
men who sought to rob and then burned the house were obviously acting in concert 
in accordance with a preconceived design which they ultimately carried 
out.<br><br>The conspiracy having been established, it should follow that the 
accused-appellant is as guilty as his companions of the crime of arson, even if 
it be conceded that he was not the one who actually poured the kerosene and 
ignited it to burn Teresa Gorospe's house.&nbsp; When there is a conspiracy, the act 
of one is the act of all and visits equal guilt upon every conspirator.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br><br>The charge of robbery was 
correctly rejected because it was not proved by any of the prosecution 
witnesses.&nbsp; Nobody testified that he actually saw any of the three intruders 
take anything from the house, and no article taken from the house that was 
burned was found in the possession of Ancheta or his co-accused.&nbsp; The policemen 
who recovered the things alleged in the information to have been stolen were not 
presented at the trial to testify on where or from whom they were 
recovered.<br><br>Under Article 321 of the Revised Penal Code, the penalty of 
<em>reclusion temporal</em> to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> shall be imposed "if 
the offender shall set fire to any building, farmhouse, warehouse, hut, shelter, 
or vessel in port, knowing it to be occupied at the time by one or more 
persons.&nbsp; x x x."<br><br>The aggravating circumstance of nighttime was correctly 
appreciated because it was sought by the defendants to facilitate the commission 
of the offense and their subsequent escape.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> Evident premeditation should also have 
been applied because the offenders had deliberately plotted the crime, as early 
as 9 o'clock of the night in question, or two hours before they actually burned 
the house.<br><br>Ancheta's intoxication cannot be considered aggravating 
because there was no showing that it was habitual or intentional;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> and neither can it be considered 
mitigating because it did not sufficiently impair the accused-appellant's will 
power or his capacity to understand the wrongfulness of his acts.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup><br><br>With these aggravating 
circumstances and no mitigating circumstances to offset them, the proper penalty 
as imposed by the trial court is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.&nbsp; The civil 
indemnity of P40,000.00 is allowed, but the costs of the suit shall be adjudged 
in toto against the accused-appellant and not to be shared, as ordered by the 
trial court, by the Station Commander of Gonzaga, Cagayan, who was not even a 
party to the case.<br><br>WHEREFORE, the appealed decision is affirmed as above 
modified, It is so ordered.</p>
