<p class="2Q">The Court heard the testimonies of both police officers and saw
their demeanor, and read the contents of their joint affidavit that Lilibeth
Caco received from Pat. Wilfredo Quillan the P20.00, went inside the house and
when she came out she gave to Pat. Wilfredo Quillan 10 sticks of marijuana,
which were proven by the prosecution to be marijuana.  The testimony and written allegations of Pat. Rafael Tamayo that
he peeped through the hole and saw Lilibeth hand to Teodoro Caco the money and
the latter 'may kinuha sa kaning kuarto' cannot be taken against Teodoro Caco
because as stated above said hole was not proven to exist and it is not
categorically proven as to what Teodoro Caco hand (sic) to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lilibeth inside the house.  It was Lilibeth who was proven to have
received the money and who was proven to have handed to poseur buyer Pat.
Quillan the 10 sticks.  Teodoro Caco was
not proven successfully by the prosecution to have participated in the sale.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">The Court noted the recent jailbreak of prisoners of the Valenzuela
Jail.  The accused Teodoro Caco was one
of them (sic) who bolted but he surrendered thereafter before the authorities
gave chase, he, alleging that he was threatened to be killed if he declined to
join the jailbreak.  The Court takes
this gesture of his in surrendering to the authority and returning to jail
while <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">this </span>case pends, as an
indication of an innocent person.</p>

<p class="2Q">Since Lilibeth Caco was apprehended during the illegal act of
selling marijuana the confiscation from her house of the 89 sticks of marijuana
even without search warrant is legal, and said evidence cannot be taken against
him (sic), as pursuant to a legal arrest.</p>

<p class="2Q">It has been held in our jurisprudence that possession of a large
quantity of such prohibited drug without evidence showing that the accused is a
user, bolsters the charge that he/she is a pusher.</p>

<p class="2Q">Overwhelming evidence that prove (sic) the guilt of the accused
Lilibeth Caco but innocense (sic) of Teodoro Caco in Criminal Case No.
10108-V-90 has been presented by the accused (sic).  The weak defense of Lilibeth Caco cannot really prevail over said

Patrolman Wilfredo Quillan received information from a civilian informant that
appellant and her husband were selling marijuana in their house at Tanke
Street, Malinta, Valenzuela, Metro Manila (pp. 2-3, tsn, March 23, 1990).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Patrolman Quillan relayed the information to Sergeant Loreto
Rodriguez, head of the Anti-Narcotics Unit.  Sgt. Rodriguez formed a team to conduct a 'buy-bust' operation.  He designated Patrolman Quillan to act as
'poseur buyer,' giving him a marked P20.00 bill for the purpose (p. 3, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The group composed of Patrolmen Quillan, Federico Patag, Jose
Villaseñor, Rafael Tamayo and Crisanto Zuriaga proceeded to Tanke Street,
Valenzuela, Metro Manila.  The civilian
informant showed them the house of appellant (p. 4, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Patrolmen Quillan and
Tamayo went to the house of appellant and called for her.  When appellant came out, they asked if her
husband, Boy Andeng, was there.  They
then told her that they wanted to buy marijuana worth P20.00 (ibid.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant got the money and went inside.  When she returned, she handed to them ten sticks of
marijuana.  Thereupon, Patrolmen Quillan
and Tamayo introduced themselves as police officers and signaled their
companions to approach (p. 5, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The police went inside the house and found two rouches (sic) of
marijuana on the floor.  Appellant's
husband, Teodoro Caco, surrendered eighty nine (89) more sticks of marijuana
(p. 6, ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Patrolman Quillan identified the ten sticks of marijuana appellant
sold to him (Exhibits I-1 to E-10) through his initials (p. 2, tsn, May 23,

sticks of marijuana (Exhibits I-11 to I-99) found inside the house of appellant

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The formulation of the
assigned errors leaves much to be desired and it is obvious that it was done
with undue haste.  As worded, the first
suffers from ambiguity with a shade of self-contradiction while the second
proposes a novel rule of evidence by shifting to the trial court the burden of
proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.  This Court, however, will resolve the issues
not on the basis of the formulation of the assignment of errors but on the
merits of the arguments proffered in support thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In seeking the reversal
of the decision, the appellant points out in the first assigned error what she
perceives to be </span>inconsistencies between the testimonies of prosecution
witnesses Quillan and Tamayo which the trial court allegedly failed to
notice.  According to her, although
Tamayo testified that he and Quillan introduced themselves to the appellant
when the latter went inside the house, and that the five (5) women (accused in
Criminal Case No. 10106-V-90) were just sitting down, Quillan declared that the
introduction was made before <u>he</u> went inside the house after the sale was
made and that the five (5) women were dancing.  She then concludes that these disparities, taken in the light of the further
declaration of Tamayo that he was only one (1) meter away from Quillan, show
that Tamayo was not within the area of the appellant's house, but somewhere
else.  Appellant further claims that the
trial court erred in not verifying whether there was a legitimate buy-bust
operation and whether the apprehending policemen entered the house of the
appellant with a search warrant in compliance with the mandate of the
Constitution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant opens her discussion of the second assigned error with
a reiteration of her quaint theory that "the court was not able to prove
accused's guilt beyond reasonable doubt," hence, it committed an error in
convicting her.  She submits that there
are doubts on the "reasonableness of the search made on accused's
house," and on the "existence of the buy-bust operation for the lower
court failed to prove that the front door of the accused's house was either
open or close."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> As
to the latter, she observes that the prosecution's evidence tends to establish
that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the door was closed because the
policemen had to knock while the defense was able to prove that it was wide
open.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

admissibility in evidence" of the eighty-nine (89) sticks of marijuana
allegedly voluntarily surrendered by Teodoro Caco because there </span>was no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">search warrant issued therefor, and describes
the alleged surrender thereof as beyond comprehension because she and her
husband had questioned the authority of the policemen to search their house and
had demanded for a search warrant.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Appellee refutes in detail the assigned errors by showing that:  (1) the buy-bust operation was fully

non-crucial details which do not detract from their overall credibility,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

and (4) the search and seizure in this case were made as an incident to a
lawful arrest; hence, pursuant to Section 12, Rule 126 in relation to Section

<p class="BODY">A thorough examination and evaluation of the records and the
evidence adduced by the prosecution does not sustain the appellant's
position.  Her appeal is clearly
unmeritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claimed inconsistencies in the testimonies of Quillan and
Tamayo concern minor, if not trivial, matters.  It is doctrinally settled that minor discrepancies or inconsistencies do
not impair the essential <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">integrity </span>of
the prosecution's evidence as a whole or reflect on the witnesses' honesty.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Such inconsistencies, which may be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">caused
</span>by the natural fickleness of memory, even tend to strengthen rather than
weaken the credibility of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prosecution's
witnesses </span>because they erase any suspicion of rehearsed testimony.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
The test is whether the testimonies agree on the essential facts and whether
the respective versions corroborate and substantially coincide with each other
to make a consistent and coherent whole.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant does not even attempt to dispute the factual infrastructure of the
successful buy-bust operation as established by the evidence for the
prosecution, <i>viz</i>., that she received the P20.00 buy-bust money in
consideration of which she delivered to the poseur-buyer, Pat. Quillan, ten
(10) sticks of marijuana.   By no stretch
of the imagination can it be said that these facts were whittled down or
depreciated by the alleged inconsistencies.  The "reasonable doubt" she raised regarding the buy-bust
operation is wholly unacceptable for it is based on the paradoxical statement
that "the lower court failed to prove that the front door of the accused's
house was either open <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or c</span>lose.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not, </span>of course, the duty
of the trial court to prove the guilt of the accused.  That is the burden of the prosecution.  The court's duty is to weigh the evidence and determine if the
quantum of proof required for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">conviction
-- </span>proof beyond reasonable doubt -- is met.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the condition of the door in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">instant
</span>case is entirely irrelevant to the issue of whether there was in fact a
buy-bust operation.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the legality <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and </span>validity of the search and seizure conducted by the
policemen, this Court notes that no specific assignment of error is devoted to
it and that the appellant merely makes a passing reference to it in her second
assigned error.  Such a paramount issue
involving a sacred constitutional right certainly deserves more than just a
fleeting mention or a passing interest if indeed the appellant had a valid
grievance.  The records of this case
yield <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nothing </span>to support such a
plaint.  On the contrary, the legality
and validity of the search and seizure is beyond dispute.  Appellant was caught <i>in flagrante</i>
selling marijuana to the poseur-buyer.  Under Section 5, Rule 113 of the Revised Rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"Having caught the appellant <i>in flagrante </i>as a result
of a buy-bust operation, the policemen were not only authorized but were also
under obligation to apprehend the drug pusher even without a warrant of
arrest.  And since appellant's arrest
was lawful, it follows that the search made incidental to the arrest was also
valid.  [Rule 126, Sec. 12, Alvero vs.
Dizon, 76 Phil. 637 (1946); People vs. Claudio, G.R. No. 72564, April 15,
1988]."</blockquote>

the product of a lawful search, the eighty-nine (89) sticks of marijuana are,

<p class="BODY">The decision appealed from must perforce be affirmed as it is
fully supported by the facts and the applicable law and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We end, however, with a note that We are not exactly happy at
seeing a married woman suffer the penalty of life imprisonment for drug pushing
while her husband was acquitted of the same charge.  She would, thus, leave a family deprived of maternal love and a
husband divested of consortium.  However,
she committed an offense whose consequences go beyond her immediate victims and
in open defiance of the continuing and relentless campaign of the Government to
rid society of the drug menace and its disastrously harmful social, economic,
and even spiritual effects.  It has
broken the lives, shattered the hopes and destroyed the future of thousands of
our young citizens.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a> Let
