<p class="BODY">Upon arraignment, the accused pleaded not guilty to the offenses
charged.  The cases were tried jointly.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution presented the four (4) private complainants
(Cirilo Lising, Montessa Gasmin, Leopoldo Realino and Jesus Sumalinog) as
witnesses.  They testified as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>CIRILO LISING</b>, a 41-year old farmer from Gapan, Nueva
Ecija testified that in August 1991, he was summoned by his brother-in-law,
Jose (Jhun) Cruz, to fix the septic tank in his house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

he was introduced to the accused and a certain Loida de Guia who represented
themselves to be husband and wife.  The
two were boarders in Cruz’ house.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> While
fixing the tank, the couple engaged him in a conversation and told him they
could facilitate his employment in Korea.  He was informed that the placement fee was forty thousand pesos
(P40,000.00).  Relying on the couple’s
representations, he decided to try his luck abroad.  The couple promised him a job as factory worker in Korea with an
income of $500.00 per month.  They asked
him to prepare an initial amount of nine thousand seven hundred pesos
(P9,700.00) for his plane fare.  They
told him that he could pay for the balance of the fee when he reach Korea for
upon his arrival, he would receive a two-months cash advance on his
salary.  He agreed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">On August 12, 1991, he submitted to the accused his passport and
biodata in their office, ML Promotions, at Room 102, Marrieta Apt., 1200 J.
Bocobo Street, Ermita, Manila.  He
handed the amount of P9,700.00 to Loida and the latter issued and signed a
receipt therefor.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Lising, however, failed to leave for Korea.  He then verified the status of the agency
from the POEA and discovered that the accused and Loida were not licensed
recruiters.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

Thus, on February 13, 1992, he complained to CIS PO3 Romeo M. Cerezo and gave a
written statement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

from San Juan, Tarlac testified that she learned from her cousin, Joey Lino,
that the accused and Loida de<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>Guia
were engaged in job placement overseas.  On May 15, 1991, she asked her cousin to accompany her to the couple’s
Ermita office where the accused informed her that they deploy workers to
Korea.  Relying on said representation,
she applied as a factory worker in Korea and accomplished the corresponding
application form.  She was told that she
would earn $500.00 per month and was asked to pay thirty thousand pesos
(P30,000.00) to cover her traveling expenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

The couple assured her that she could leave for Korea by the end of June
1991.  The promise proved to be
false.  On July 14, 1991, she again went
to the couple’s office in Ermita to follow-up her departure.  Again, the spouses assured her that she
would be able to leave on the succeeding week.  Nothing came out of the promise.  Thus, together with the other private complainants, she reported the
matter to the CIS Camp Crame where she executed her written statement.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><b>LEOPOLDO REALINO</b>, a 42 year-old driver, residing at
Balibago, Angeles City testified that her brother, Roger, brought him to the
couple’s recruitment office in Ermita where he met the accused.  He inquired from the accused whether he
could work out his employment in Japan.  The accused replied in the affirmative.  Still undecided, he told the accused he would just come back.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Sometime in August 1991, he returned to their Ermita office and
applied as a contract worker in Japan.  The accused told him to prepare one hundred twenty thousand pesos
(P120,000.00).  He was also asked to
fill up and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sign </span>an application
form.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">On November 4, 1991, Leopoldo went to their office and handed the
money to the accused.  The accused then
ordered Loida, whom Leopoldo met for the first time, to prepare the necessary
receipt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

The accused failed to employ him in Japan despite repeated promises.  He demanded the return of his money but to
no avail.  He, together with his
companions, went to the POEA where they discovered that the accused was not
licensed to recruit workers for overseas employment.  With the intention of confronting the accused, they proceeded to
their Ermita office but were informed that the accused was already detained at
Camp Crame.  Thus, they went to Camp
Crame where they gave their statements.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The last witness for the prosecution was <b>JESUS SUMALINOG</b>,
an industrial electrician from Makati.  He testified that he first met the accused in May 1991 in the accused’s
Ermita office where he inquired about the possibility of employment in
Japan.  The accused interviewed
him.  The accused told him that the cost
of processing his papers would run from P85,000.00 to P95,000.00.  However, when Sumalinog intimated that he
could only afford to pay P50,000.00, the accused conferred with Loida, who was
introduced by the accused as his wife.  The couple then agreed to be paid P50,000.00 and he was told to fill up
an application form.  He was informed
that he could work as a contract worker in a computer firm where he would earn
$1,200.00 per month.  The couple asked
him to prepare the money.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sumalinog gave the money to the accused in four (4) installments,
thus:  P10,000.00 on October 3, October
30, November 18 and November 21, 1991; P8,000.00 on November 25, 1991; and
finally, P2,000.00 on December 11, 1991.  In each instance, the accused instructed Loida to prepare the receipts
and the same were duly issued and signed by Loida.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">The two assured Sumalinog that he could leave after two (2)
weeks.  Failing to leave as promised, he
was again made to wait for another two (2) weeks.  Still, the accused did not make good with said promise.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">He then went to the POEA where he discovered that the accused was
not licensed to recruit workers for overseas employment.  He sought the accused in his Ermita office
but found out that the accused was already in the custody of the CIS.  He talked with the accused in Camp Crame and
the latter asked him not to file any complaint.  The accused assured him that his money would be returned.  He did not heed said request and filed the
complaint at bar.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence of the accused rests mainly on denial and alibi.  He alleged that he was not a recruiter but a
driver by profession from 1970 up to December 1991.  He contended that he could not have participated in the
recruitment of complainants since from May to December 1991, he was employed at
RTS Trading Associate Corporation where he reported for work from 7:00 o’clock
in the morning until 5:00 o’clock in the afternoon.  He was employed as a driver delivering various merchandise for
the corporation.  He alleged that after
work, he always went straight home to Montalban, Rizal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">He further testified that his legal wife is Paula Diones and that
he has no illicit relationship with one Loida de Guia.  According to the accused, he first met Loida
in the latter’s house in Baclaran in May 1991.  He met Loida to secure overseas employment for his son.  He again went to Loida’s house in July 1991
to follow-up his son’s employment application.  Further, the accused claimed that he met the complainants only while he
was already detained in Camp Crame.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Renato Samonte, owner of RTS Trading and a childhood friend of
the accused, corroborated his alibi.  He
testified that the accused acted as his part-time driver from May 1991 until
December 1991.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The first (2) assigned errors are interrelated and shall be
discussed together.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant’s position is that the real perpetrator of the charges
imputed against him is Loida de Guia whose signature appears on all the
receipts issued to the complainants.  He
submits that his mere presence at the Ermita office everytime the complainants
paid the required fees cannot be made the basis of a finding that he was
involved in the illegal recruitment of private complainants.  He contends that Loida de Guia should have
been charged as the proper accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant’s submission deserves scant consideration.  To begin with, appellant did not raise this
argument in the trial court.  It is too
late to raise it on appeal.  More
importantly, the Informations against the appellant show that the appellant was
charged with “conspiring and confederating with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">one </span>whose true name, identity and present whereabouts are still
unknown x x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> x.” </span>From the
evidence, this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">co­-conspirator </span>is
Loida de Guia who pretended to be the wife of herein appellant.  There is no obstacle for the State to charge
this person who goes by the name of Loida de Guia as soon as her true identity
and address become known to the prosecution.  Her non-prosecution at this stage, however, provides no ground for the
appellant to fault the decision of the trial court convicting him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also erred in dismissing the receipts issued by Loida
de Guia as hearsay evidence.  The
records show that Leopoldo Realino and Jesus Sumalinog testified that they personally
handed the money representing the required fees to herein appellant.  The latter, in turn, instructed Loida <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>prepare the corresponding
receipts.  This was after private
complainants were made to believe that the accused and Loida, aside from being
husband and wife, were jointly operating the recruitment business, with the
former as travel consultant and the latter as the general manager.  The evidence shows that the receipts were
signed by Loida in the presence of the complaining witnesses.  Consequently, Realino and Sumalinog had
personal knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the issuance of these
receipts and their testimonies cannot be considered as hearsay evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not also correct to argue that the guilt of the appellant
was based alone on the receipts issued by Loida de Guia.  All the complaining witnesses testified that
the accused took an active and direct part in misrepresenting that he had the
authority and the power to facilitate their employment abroad.  Aside from their testimonial evidence,
calling cards were presented showing the accused to be the Travel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Consultant </span>of said agency, with Loida
as the General Manager.  Moreover, the
evidence also showed that it was the accused who asked the applicants to fill
up their applications and to prepare their respective biodata.  He also demanded from them varying amounts
of money as processing fees.  All these
show that the accused and Loida de Guia, who are not licensed recruiters,
adopted a systematic and elaborate scheme to defraud the complainants through
false promises of jobs abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are not also impressed by the defense of the appellant.  Glaring inconsistencies marred his short
testimony.  At one time, he testified
that he was arrested by the CIS officers at a department store in Ermita,
Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
Later on, however, he stated that he was arrested in Marrieta Apartment,
located at J. Bocobo Street, Ermita, Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> He
likewise claimed during the trial that he was not aware that Loida de Guia had
an office located in Marrieta Apartment, Ermita,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a> but
at the same time, he raises in this appeal the defense that he himself has been
at the Ermita office to follow-up the job placement of his son in Korea.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is not all.  Initially, appellant claimed during the trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">that he could not have possibly been at the </span>Ermita office and
received payments made by the complainants for he was then employed as a
professional driver for RTS Trading.  On
appeal, however, appellant would have Us believe that during the period from
May to December 1991 when private complainants went to the Ermita office to
file their application and pay the corresponding fees, accused-appellant “just
happened to be there” for he was himself following-up the job application of
his son.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant’s corroborating witness, Renato Samonte, was equally
unimpressive.  In fact, Samonte’s
testimony rendered the defense’s theory more open to doubt.  For one, his testimony that appellant has
been in his employ from May to December 1991 was not corroborated by any
documentary evidence, such as pay slip/pay roll, certification of SSS
contributions and, hence, has little value.  Moreover, even assuming that appellant was a part-time driver of
Samonte, the nature of his job would not make it physically impossible for him
to operate a recruitment business on the side.  Time and again, We have ruled that alibi, being a weak defense, must be
proved by clear and convincing evidence which should reasonably satisfy the
Court of its veracity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The credence of the private complainants is further bolstered by
the admission of appellant himself that he does not know of any ill-motive why
they would hurl such serious accusations against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
The private complainants were all previously unknown to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant’s alleged warrantless arrest will not
exculpate him from his guilt as found by the trial court.  To be sure, the plea comes too late in the
day.  We note that upon arraignment,
appellant pleaded not guilty to the Information and did not raise the alleged
illegality of his arrest.  By so
pleading, he waived the alleged illegality of his arrest.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

ruled that the illegality of appellant’s warrantless arrest cannot render all
the other proceedings, including the appellant’s conviction, void.  It cannot deprive the State of its right to
convict the guilty when all the facts on record point to his culpability.</p>
