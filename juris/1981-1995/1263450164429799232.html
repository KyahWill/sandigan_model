				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Considering the following report and recommendation of the Court
Administrator, Justice Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>:</p>

<blockquote>"The charge of misconduct against respondent Court Interpreter
Marty <span class="SpellE">Desacada</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, Branch I is cast by Court Stenographer Benjamin
Barrera, of the same court, in a letter-complaint dated January 24, 1979
alleging that respondent twice slapped complainant and uttered slanderous <span style="">words, </span>to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'<span class="SpellE">Porke't</span> <span class="SpellE">malakas</span> ka <span class="SpellE">kay</span> Judge ...<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sinong</span> <span class="SpellE">ipinagmamalaki</span> mo, <span class="SpellE">si</span> Judge?<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hindi <span class="SpellE">ako</span>
<span class="SpellE">natatakot</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Basagin</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">ko</span></span>
pa yang <span class="SpellE">salamin</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">mukha</span> mo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Putang-ina</span> <span class="SpellE">ninyong</span> <span class="SpellE">mga</span> <span class="SpellE">Ilocano</span>, <span class="SpellE">kabago-bago</span>
<span style="">pa </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">lang</span></span> kayo <span class="SpellE">dito</span> e.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is further alleged that the incident took place at the
session hall of the court, in <span style="">the </span>presence
of Presiding Judge Pablo D. Suarez, Assistant Provincial Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> <span class="SpellE">Gervacio</span>, court
personnel, attending lawyers and about fifty other persons, as the trial of
cases was about to begin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When required to comment on the complaint, respondent in a
letter dated <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1979</st1:date>
did not deny complainant's allegations but merely mentioned the latter's
withdrawal made earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said
withdrawal, in a letter dated <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="3">March
 20, 1979</st1:date>, disclosed complainant's forgiveness upon accepting
respondent's apology.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In it, complainant
also expressed his sufferance, that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It
is hard and painful to be aggrieved, especially when you are only considered a
stranger in a particular place, but I felt it is better to forgive and be
oppressed (in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>)
than seek redress but have enemies.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The undersigned in a letter dated <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1979</st1:date>, again required respondent to
submit his comment on the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
date, respondent has remained silent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The circumstances considered<span class="GramE">,</span> it
should be fit to now determine respondent's administrative accountability under
this complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having chosen not to
comment and deny the charge cast against <span class="GramE">him,</span>
respondent is to be deemed having admitted complainant's <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span>
allegations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent's admission is
also to be implied from his giving assent to complainant's letter of withdrawal
which revealed his offer of apology to complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant's desistance cannot be an obstacle in taking disciplinary
action against respondent where the basis of his accountability has been
sufficiently established (<span class="SpellE">Bais</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Tugaoen</span>, Adm. Matter No. 1575-MJ, April 20, 1979).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, to condition, administrative
action upon the will of the complainant, who may, for one has<span style=""> </span>reason or another, <span class="SpellE">candone</span>
a detestable act is to strip this Court of its supervisory power to discipline
those who err.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Anguluan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Anguluan</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Taguba</span>, Adm. Matter No. 1402-MJ, September 14, 1979).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, for his misconduct, taking into consideration
respondent's heretofore un足blemished record of service in Court since 1960, it
is respectfully recommended that respondent Marty <span class="SpellE">Desacada</span>
beheld administratively liable and meted the penalty of suspension of fifteen
(15) days without pay."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court, after carefully considering
all relevant circums足tances extant in the record resolved to APPROVE said re足commendation,
and respondent is hereby suspended accor足dingly.</p>
