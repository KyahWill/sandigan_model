affirming the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch IV, in Civil Case No. 12252, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration of Continental Cement Corporation
was denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner Continental Cement Corporation is a domestic
corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of cement for domestic use and
exportation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. is also a domestic corporation engaged in <span class="SpellE">interocean</span>
shipping.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner was the <span class="SpellE">awardee</span> or
end-user of heavy machineries and equipment for cement manufacture as
reparations from Japan through the Philippine Reparations Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, as a shipping company, was also a re­cipient
of inter-cargo vessels as reparations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1967, the petitioner shipped on board the private respondent's
vessel M/V "Irene 1,469 packages of cement machineries and equipment,
through the Reparations Commission consisting of machineries and equipment for
a cement plant, all consigned to the Reparations Commission and which arrived
at the Port of Manila on June 20, 1967.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the contract of <span class="SpellE">affreightment</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
the petitioner was bound to pay freight charges in the amount of about
P300,000.00 including all necessary expenses and normal charges after unloading
at the piers within a period of 120 days from the arrival of the vessel M/V
"Irene" at the Port of Manila on June 20, 1967 with a freight rebate
of not less than 30% on the basic freight rates.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the shipment arrived in the Port of Manila, a dispute arose
between the petitioner and the private respondent on the time and manner of
payment of the freight charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner demanded that the shipment be unloaded shipside on
barges for delivery to a customs bonded warehouse, invoking the right to the
period of 120 days within which to pay the freight charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The private respondent refused to release
said shipment until the full payment of the freight charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the shipment was unloaded ship­side on
the pier, as a result of which stevedoring, <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span>,
storage, conduction and other charges and fees were unduly incurred and accumu­lated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent finally decided, after due notice to the
parties concerned by publication, to sell at public auction the re­paration
machineries in the total amount of P573,401.56 plus interest and costs of sale
to cover the alleged unpaid freight charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view thereof, the petitioner Continental Cement Corporation
filed a complaint on July 18, 1968 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; Branch IV,
against the private respondent, Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. for damages, seeking the following relief:</p>

<blockquote><i>"WHEREFORE, it is most respectfully prayed this Hon. Court
that judgment be rendered sentencing defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of
P200,000.00 as actual damages and attorney's fees of P20,000.00, aside from
costs.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>It is likewise respectfully prayed that pending the hearing on
the merits hereof and by reason of the urgency of the relief prayed for, a writ
of prelimi­nary injunction, ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> if necessary, or
at least a restraining order, be issued upon filing by herein plaintiff of a
bond in an amount to be determined by this Hon. Court executed in favor of the
defendant con­ditioned for the payment of whatever damages said de­fendant may
sustain should plaintiff be found later as not entitled thereto, commanding
defendants, its agents and/or representatives, to desist and refrain from
conducting and carrying out the sale at public auction of the 1,469 packages of
cement plant machineries and equipment presently located at plaintiff's bonded
ware­house at the Atlas Textile Mills Compound at <span class="SpellE">Novaliches</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City starting July 22, 1968 at 10:00 in the
morning and everyday thereafter, until further orders from this Hon. Court, and
to make said injunction permanent.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Plaintiff finally prays for such other and further relief as
this Hon. Court may deem just and equitable in the premises.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court issued a temporary restraining order to stop the
sale of the machineries at public auction upon the filing by the plaintiff,
petitioner herein, of a bond in the amount of P50,000.00 and set for hearing
the petition for preliminary injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">However, before a preliminary injunction
was issued, the parties submitted the following partial compromise agreement:</p>

<blockquote><i>"COME NOW the parties, plaintiff and defendant Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc., by their respective undersigned counsels,
and by way of partial compromise agreement of the subject-matter of this case,
to this Hon. Court respectfully manifest:<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"1. That,
defendant Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc., claims that the
total freight payable by plaintiff in its favor for the shipment on board its
vessel M/V "Irene" of 1,469 packages of reparations cargo
subject-matter of this case is P573,401.56, plus interest and other charges;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"2. That on
the other hand, herein plaintiff disputes liability for freight charges to the
extent of said amount of P573,401.56, plaintiff maintaining that its liability
for these freight charges is only to the extent of P269,132.58;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"3. That
plaintiff is ready and willing to tender payment as it hereby tenders payment
of said amount of P269,132.58 which it considers as the net undisputed freight
charges subject-matter of this case in favor of the defendant Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc., leaving the matter of the balance
from the total amount being claimed by said defendant as hereinabove stated,
subject of final adjudication in this case, without defendant waiving any
defenses and counterclaims which it may have;<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"4. That in
consideration of the payment by plain­tiff of the aforesaid amount of P269,132.58,
defendant Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc., hereby binds
and obligates itself, simultaneously with the receipt of the payment of said
amount, to issue in favor of the plaintiff the corresponding delivery permits
addressed to and in the form furnished by the Bureau of Customs covering the
aforesaid cargo of 1,469 packages of machineries for a cement plant described
in two (2) bills of lading Nos. MM-2 issued on<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>May 29, 1967 and YM-6 issued June 16, 1967 to enable herein plaintiff to
withdraw said cargoes from the customs bonded warehouse where they are present­ly
deposited, without prejudice to the continuation of this action with respect to
the balance of said freight that the parties herein dispute and with prejudice
further to the continuing vitality of any lien which defendant may have on this
cargo.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

an order issue approving the foregoing partial compromise agreement and
enjoining the parties herein to adhere strictly to the terms thereof.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In its original answer to the petitioner's complaint filed on
December 22, 1969, the Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc.
interposed only a counterclaim for actual and other damages in the amount of
P300,000.00 allegedly because the plaintiff's suit was unjustified and for
attorney's fees in the sum of P30,000.00 which the defendant allegedly incurred
by virtue of plaintiff's unwarranted filing of the complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 23, 1971, the defendant Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. filed a motion for leave to amend the answer allegedly because the
said defendant "had inadvertently failed to include in its answer by way
of counterclaim its claim for P573,401.56 less P269,132.58 as freight
charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the amended answer, the
defendant interposed an additional counterclaim for the balance of the freight
charges.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The amended answer was admitted by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing in the trial court on September 24, 1973, counsels
for both parties made a joint manifestation that the only issue for resolution
of the Court was the counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
the conformity of plaintiff's counsel, the defendant's motion to dismiss the
complaint was granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">With the dismissal of the complaint, the only remaining issue to
be resolved was whether the defendant's claim for freight charges had been
fully liquidated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff claimed that full payment had been made to the de­fendant
with the acceptance by the latter of P269,132.58 on November 22, 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of this claim the plaintiff, petitioner herein,
presented in evidence a voucher marked as Exhibit "6" which showed
that the Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc. had received
the sum of P269,132.58 as full payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Above the signature of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nordy</span> P. Diploma,
counsel and vice-president of Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. are the following particulars:</p>

<blockquote><i>a. Full payment
to ANTONIO MARTEL, BOTELHO SHIPPING CO. &amp; MANILA INTEROCEAN LINES for
freight charges on Cement Machineries &amp; Equipment shipped ex. S/S
"Irene".</i><i><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendant contended that the alleged acknowledgment that the
Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc. had received the sum of
P269,132.58 as full payment typewritten in the voucher marked as Exhibit
"6" was an interpolation and therefore spurious.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court concluded, in the light of the evidence adduced
by the parties, that the plaintiff's claim that full payment had been made was
not substantiated by clear and convincing evidence and that the plaintiff still
owes the defendant the balance on the freight charges as stated in the
defendant's counterclaim and ordered the plaintiff to pay the defendant the
amount of U.S.$78,017.68 with interest at 6% com­puted from November 28, 1967
until fully paid and the amount of P25,000.00 as attorney's fees.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court ordered the immediate execution of the judgment
pending appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To stay immediate
execution, the Continental Cement Corporation had to file a <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span>
bond in the amount of P899,656.18.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff Continental Cement Corporation appealed to the
Court of Appeals assigning the following errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><i>"1<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review the decision
of the majority of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its answer the defendant averred that the alleged contract of <span class="SpellE">affreightment</span> (Annex "A") is null, void,

<blockquote><i>"D.

calculated from time of arrival of the vessel in Manila."</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is a fact that the defendant Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. reneged on the terms of the contract of <span class="SpellE">affreightment</span>
by demanding full payment of the freight charges before releasing the shipment
to the Continental Cement Corporation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, had the petitioner not filed Civil Case No. 12252 of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, the Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc. would have sold at public auction the
shipment to pay the freight charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
a consequence of the breach by the defendant, the petitioner Continental Cement
Corpora­tion had to pay customs storage charges and handling charges in the
total amount of P100,598.46.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also a fact that when the original answer was filed on
December 22, 1969 the defendant did not include in its counterclaim the alleged
balance of the freight charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was
only on Feb­ruary 23, 1971, after the lapse of one year and two months, that
the defendant thought of amending its answer to include in the counter­claim
the alleged balance of the freight charges.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason given in the motion for leave to amend the answer was that
the defendant had inadvertently failed to include in the counterclaim in its
answer the claim of P573,401.56 less P269,132.58, the amount paid by the
plaintiff under their November 1968 Partial Compromise Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is highly incredible that the defendant
could have overlooked such a large amount demanded in the additional
counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the
defendant to demand in the original answer the alleged balance of the freight
charges supports the contention of the Conti­nental Cement Corporation that its
payment of the amount of P269,132.58 is a full discharge of the liability for
freight charges as clearly indicated in the receipt-voucher, Exhibit
"6".</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is a fact that upon payment by the Continental
Cement Corporation of the P269,132.58 to the Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. the entire shipment was released to the plaintiff, petitioner
herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">As counter-claimant, the defendant, Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. had the burden to prove its claim for the alleged balance of the
freight charges still owed by the Continental Cement Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Confronted with the receipt-voucher, Exhibit "6", which
clearly shows full payment by the Continental Cement Corporation of the freight
charges, the Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc. averred
that the words indicating full payment were interpolated after the voucher was
signed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prove this contention, the
Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Lines, Inc. presented as witness
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nordy</span> P. Diploma who declared that "when I
signed that original it does not seem to bear this Parti­culars." (p. 20, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., Feb. 4, 1974)</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant contends that the words indicating full payment of
the freight is an interpolation and amounts to a charge of the crime of
falsification committed by the Continental Cement Corpo­ration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. has the burden of proving such a serious charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Continental Cement Corporation is presumed to be innocent of
crime or wrong.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Against this presumption and the positive testimony of <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span> A. Morales, executive assistant of Continental
Cement Corporation, that the voucher, Exhibit "6", represents full
payment of the freight charges to the defendant, (pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., January 3, 1974) the Manila <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
Lines, Inc. presented only the uncertain testimony of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Nordy</span>
P. Diploma.</p>

<p class="BODY">The voucher, Exhibit "6" is regular on its face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no indication in the spacing of the
typewritten words acknowledging full payment of the freight charges that said
words were inter­polated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if
said words are eliminated, the voucher would be incomplete.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent failed to rebut the evidence of the
petitioner that it had fully paid the freight charges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of this finding, it is no longer
necessary to pass upon the other errors assigned in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals sought to
be reviewed is hereby SET ASIDE and the decision of the trial court ordering
the Continental Cement Corporation to pay the Manila Inter ocean Lines, Inc.
the sum of US$78,017.68 as the balance of the freight charges with interest at
6% from November 28, 1967 until fully paid and the amount of P25,000.00 as
attorney's fees is here­by REVERSED and the counterclaim of the defendant,
private respondent herein, is DISMISSED, without pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">supersedeas</span> bond in the amount of
P899,656.18 filed by the petitioner to stay the immediate execution of the
judgment pending appeal is declared CANCELLED.</p>
