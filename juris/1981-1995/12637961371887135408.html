				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulpo</span>
was an employee of the Post Office at <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>, holding a temporary appointment
as letter-carrier from <st1:date year="1983" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1983</st1:date>,
until the termination of his employment on <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon the complaint of Mrs. Lorna <span class="SpellE">Lacorte</span>
(formerly Mrs. Lorna <span class="SpellE">Abelon</span>) of <span class="SpellE">Zapote</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>, the accused letter-carrier was charged on
July 10, 1985 before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> in two
separate <span class="SpellE">informations</span> for having feloniously taken
and carried away two airmail letters allegedly containing international money
orders for $150 and $100, received at the <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span> Post
Office on January 8 and January 21, 1985, respectively, and entrusted to him
for delivery to the addressee.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
while absolving <span class="SpellE">Dulpo</span> as to the alleged <span class="SpellE">asportation</span> of the international money orders on the ground
that it was not sufficiently proven that the letters contained said money
orders, found him guilty of the crime of infidelity in the custody of documents
under Article 226 of the Revised Penal Code for the loss of the two airmail
letters and sentenced him in each of the cases "to suffer an indeterminate
penalty ranging from two (2) years, four (4) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>, as minimum,
to eight (8) years and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor,
as maximum; to pay a fine of P500.00, plus costs; and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
18.0pt">to </span>suffer the additional penalty of temporary special
disqualification for a period ranging from ten (10) years, eight (8) months and
one (1) day, as minimum, to sixteen (16) years, eight (8) months and one (1)
day, as maximum".</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration and a motion for
leave to file a second motion for reconsideration, both of which were denied by
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, hence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">this petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Two assignments of error were raised by petitioner, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
erred in finding the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of infidelity in
the custody of documents; and (2) it erred in imposing too severe a penalty
considering that what were involved were ordinary airmail letters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The first assignment of error alleged by petitioner is devoid of
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The finding of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> as to the guilt of petitioner is amply
supported by the evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
the two letters in question were entrusted to, and received by, the accused
letter-carrier, <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulpo</span>,
for delivery to the addressee is admitted by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is also a fact admitted by him that those
letters were never delivered to the addressee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Dulpo's</span> defense is that he could not deliver
the letters because the addressee was unknown at the given address, hence, in
accordance with standard procedure, he returned the said letter to the sender
by putting them in the dispatch box in the post office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the burden of proof to establish
such defense lies on the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
cannot rely simply on the presumption that official duty has been regularly
performed, since there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was </span>evidence
presented by the prosecution which negated such presumption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that upon
verification from her son, she learned that the letters were not returned to,
and received by, him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it was
shown that the money orders which were intended for the complainant apparently
went to someone else as they were <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> by a
certain <span class="SpellE">Adela</span> <span class="SpellE">Bonavie</span>, and
someone had apparently signed complainant's name on the money order, putting
her address as <st1:place><st1:placename>1221</st1:placename> <st1:placename>P.</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename>Street</st1:placename><st1:placename>,</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused claimed, in his defense, that he
recorded in a logbook which he kept for the purpose the fact that he returned
the letters to the sender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he
could not produce said logbook, saying that they were kept in the post office. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The incumbent postmaster of <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span> Post Office, who was subpoenaed at the request of
the accused to bring the logbook in question to the court at the hearing on the
petitioner's motion for reconsideration, brought only two logbooks, one bearing
the date October 18, 1982, and the other with the date June 23, 1983, and
stated to the court that these were the only books of the accused which he
found in the post office and that he could not find any logbook of the accused
for the year 1985.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>
accordingly did not give credence to the defense of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason for disturbing the court's
findings in this regard.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second assigned error concerning the penalty imposed by the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is well-taken.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Article 226 of the Revised Penal Code provides for two ranges of penalty
for infidelity in the custody of documents:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">prision</span> mayor and a fine not exceeding P1,000
if the damage to a third party or to the public interest is serious, and <span class="SpellE">prision</span> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span> in its
minimum and medium periods and a fine not exceeding P1,000 if such damage is
not so serious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the facts
and circumstances of the case, we find that the proper penalty to be imposed on
the accused should be that which is prescribed by paragraph 2 of Article 226,
which is the lesser penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> itself did not sustain the charge in the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> that money orders were contained in the
undelivered letters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, these
letters were sent by ordinary airmail, not by registered mail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not find the cases cited by respondent
- U.S. vs. Marino<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
and U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Balilo</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
- to be controlling, since the letters involved in those cases were registered
letters and the circumstances and facts established therein showed that the acts
and deeds of the accused (who were both postmasters) were of such nature that
they clearly undermined the public's faith and confidence in the postal
service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We do not find a parallel
situation in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the appealed decision should be modified and the accused
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of six (6) months of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">arresto</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <u>mayor</u>, </span>as minimum, to two (2)
years, eleven (11) months and ten (10) days of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prision</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>,
</span>as maximum, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">each of the
cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's motion, dated <st1:date year="1987" day="7" month="1">January 7, 1987</st1:date>, praying that the "threefold
rule" should be applied by the Court in sentencing him, is denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Conviction for multiple felonies requires the
imposition of multiple penalties.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The so-called threefold rule can only be taken into account in connection with
the service of the sentence imposed, not in the imposition of the penalty<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> with the modification above-mentioned, i.e.
reducing the penalty of imprisonment imposed upon the petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Dulpo</span>, the judgment of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> is affirmed in other respects.</p>
