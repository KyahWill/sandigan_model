<p class="BODY">This is an appeal interposed by the accused Wilbur <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> y Evangelista <em>alias</em> Willy from the decision 
of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch 89, 
finding him guilty of the crime of Murder and sentencing him to <em>reclusion 
perpetua</em>, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Emiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> the sums of 
P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, as compensatory damages; P10,000.00 as 
moral damages and P1,200.00 as funeral expenses, and to pay his proportionate 
costs.</p>
<p class="BODY">The information filed against the accused alleged:</p>
<blockquote>"That on or about the 22<sup>nd</sup> day of August 1979, in <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Philippines, the above-named accused, 
conspiring with, confederating together and mutually helping one another, did 
then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously, 
with intent to kill and qualified by evident premeditation and taking advantage 
of superior strength, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of 
EMITERIO ROQUID Y CLEOFAS by then and there hacking him with bolos, thereby 
inflicting upon him serious and mortal wounds which were the direct and 
immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said 
victim in such amount as may be awarded to them under the provisions of the 
Civil Code."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The lower court found the following facts 
established:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"At about 6:30 in the evening of August 21, 1979 accused Rodolfo 
<span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> alias Boy <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> 
was at the store of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, father of accused 
Wilbur <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, at Commonwealth Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, talking about the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> desire to rent the house of the latter, at which 
accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> requested Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, who agreed, to transfer to the latter's house without 
paying advance rental.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> was thankful.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>And, because of this, he invited Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> 
to celebrate with him.<span>&nbsp; </span>For this purpose, at the instance of 
accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, who guaranteed for the said accused, accompanied 
accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> to buy one (1) case of beer from his 
daughter on credit, as their own beer supply had already been 
exhausted.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, cooked <span class="SpellE">pancit</span> for their '<span class="SpellE"><em>pulotan</em></span>', and he and accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> started drinking at 7:30 P.M.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"While thus drinking beer at the same time 
conversing with each other, the brothers:<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Graciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Aldabe</span>, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Aldabe</span>, and Alberto <span class="SpellE">Aldabe</span>, as 
well as Tommy <span class="SpellE">Tubal</span>, arrived and joined the drinking 
at the invitation of Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>.</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"Later, at past 8:30 P.M., Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> and <span class="SpellE">Emiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> arrived and ordered beer from the wife of Ricardo 
<span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>But, they were later invited by 
the latter to join the group which they did.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"While thus drinking, an argument arose between <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> and accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> 
regarding the card game '<span class="SpellE">pusoy</span>' with <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> asking accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> why 
the latter <span class="SpellE">quarelled</span> with his brother.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> asked that it be 
forgotten.<span>&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> <span class="GramE">stood,</span> remarking why it should be forgotten, then boxed 
accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> at the forehead, causing the latter to 
fall from his chair.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"At this, accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> stood, then got 
a knife and ran after <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> towards the 
outside.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"After a while, accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span>, still 
with his knife, returned to the store saying he did not catch up with <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>; and he then asked <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span>, who was left there, why his <span class="SpellE">Compadre</span> <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> boxed him, to 
which <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> answered that <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> is like that whenever he is drunk.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Then, they continued drinking.<span>&nbsp; </span>But after a while, 
accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> borrowed P5.00 from Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, who instead gave P10.00, as he was going to some 
place.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"After accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> left, <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> arrived with a scythe.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> told him that accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> already left.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"At this, <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> asked <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> to go home with him.<span>&nbsp; </span>They went to 
the house of <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>"It was at this time, when </span>accused Wilbur <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, who was at the store of his mother from 6:30 P.M. 
that evening on August 21, 1979 helping her, asked the permission of his mother 
to sleep inside the room.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Then accused <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> 
and his brother 'Little Boy' also known as 'Boy <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span>' arrived asking for the house of <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Luis <span class="SpellE">Revero</span>, who was the neighbor of <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> and <span>who was pointed to by an old man, 
accompanied the <span class="SpellE">Navarras</span> to the house of <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"It turned out that upon the arrival of <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> at the 
latter's house situated in the compound of the <span class="SpellE">Diliman</span> 
Preparatory School, Don Mariano Marcos Ave., <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> 
City, which is<span> </span>just 500 meters away from the <span>store </span>of 
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, they rested at the open balcony of 
<span class="SpellE">Pantinople's</span> house and slept there.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>, the wife of <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>, slept inside the house.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"At about 12:00 midnight, a thud was suddenly heard by <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He woke up and saw accused:<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> <em>alias</em> Boy <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span>, Wilbur <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span>, and 
Little Boy <em>alias</em> 'Boy <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span>', with bolos in 
their hands.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Accused Little Boy <em>alias</em> 'Boy <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span>' hacked <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>But he was not hit as he was able to enter the room of his house.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>But he was able to see, at a distance of one (1) arm length away, the 
said three (3) accused hacking <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> several times 
with their bolos while the latter was lying down at the porch.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"This was also seen by <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span>, wife of 
<span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span>, at a distance of two (2) arm lengths 
away.<span>&nbsp; </span>For, when her husband entered their house, she asked him 
what happened.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, instead of answering, her husband leaped 
out of the house thru the window.<span>&nbsp; </span>She then looked <span>outside at 
</span>the porch and there saw the three (3) accused hacking <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> who was lying down.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"At this, <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> asked help from his 
neighbors, and they brought <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> to the Hospital Ng 
<span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Lipunan</span> at <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City where he died on arrival on August 22, 1979, per 
his certificate of death (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A").</blockquote>
<blockquote><span class="GramE">"At the request of <span class="SpellE">Roquid's</span> sister (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "</span>E"), 
Major <span class="SpellE">Desiderio</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Moraleda</span>, 
Chief, Medico-Legal Branch of the PC Crime Laboratory, Camp <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, conducted an 
autopsy on the cadaver of <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span>, issuing as a result 
thereof a Medico-Legal Necropsy Report on October 2, 1979, with the following 
postmortem findings:</blockquote>
<p class="2Q">"'Fairly developed, fairly nourished male cadaver in the rigor 
mortis with postmortem <span class="SpellE">lividity</span> over the dependent 
portions of the body.<span>&nbsp; </span>Conjunctivae, lips and <span class="SpellE">nailbeds</span> are pale.<span>&nbsp; </span>Stomach is 1/3 full of

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> raised the following 
assignment of errors in this appeal:</p>
<p style="margin: 15pt 0in;" class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED GRAVE AND REVERSIBLE ERROR IN GIVING 
CREDENCE TO THE ALLEGED POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION MADE BY THE PROSECUTION 
WITNESSES;</blockquote>
<p style="margin: 15pt 0in;" class="NUMROMANS" align="center"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT COMMITTED GRAVE ERROR IN FINDING THE 
ACCUSED-APPELLANT WILBUR ABOGA GUILTY AS CHARGED MERELY BECAUSE HIS EVIDENCE IS 
WEAK.</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The two assigned errors center on the issue of whether or not the 
trial court erred in determining the value and credibility of the evidence 
presented.</p>
<p class="BODY">We have carefully studied the records of this case and we find no 
reason to deviate from the well-settled rule that the findings of fact of the 
trial court on the cre<span>dibility of witnesses are generally accorded the 
highest respect by the appellate court in view of its privilege of examining the 
demeanor of the witnesses as they testify (<em>People v. Ramilo</em>, G.R. No. 
52230, Dec. 15, 1986; <em>People v. Natipravat</em>, G.R. No. 69876, Nov. 13, 
1986; and <em>People v. Adones</em>, G.R. No. 63453, Sept. 24, 
1986).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The appellant contends that the spouses <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> could not have made a positive identification on 
him, as one of the attackers of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span>, 
because at the time of the assault, they (the <span class="SpellE">Pantinoples</span>) had just awakened from sleep and it was very 
dark, there being no electricity in the area nor was the moon out that 
night.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The contention is without merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Both Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> and <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> were then sleeping on the balcony of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> house.<span>&nbsp; </span>When the assault was 
committed, Reynaldo woke up to see the appellant together with <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> <em>alias </em>Boy <span class="SpellE">Britanico</span> and Little Boy <em>alias </em>"Boy <span class="SpellE">Ilongo</span>" with bolos in their hands.<span>&nbsp; </span>Reynaldo 
was able to run inside the house but not before he saw <span>the three accused 
hacking <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He could not have erred 
in his identification as he was only one arm length away.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN., February 25, 1980, p. 6).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Although, he had just awakened from sleep, Reynaldo recognized the 
assailants immediately.<span>&nbsp; </span>He saw that they were carrying bolos and 
he then instinctively decided to enter the house right away before he could be 
mortally wounded.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Likewise, Reynaldo's wife, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> was able to identify the assailants when Reynaldo 
rushed inside the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The appellant questions the credibility of the testimony of 
<span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> due to its alleged "infirmity, 
inconsistency, unreliability and absurdity".<span>&nbsp; </span>He said that, at one 
time, <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">Q<span>&nbsp; </span>-</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>Will you 
please state briefly what you saw and witnessed?</blockquote>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span>&nbsp; </span>-</span><span>&nbsp; </span>While I 
was resting at our porch, I heard a commotion.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Q - Now, when you heard a commotion, what did you do, if you have 
done anything?</blockquote>
<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">A<span>&nbsp; </span>-</span><span>&nbsp; </span>I saw my 
husband enter our house and I asked him what happen(ed).<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead 
of answering me, I saw that he immediately leap(ed) and from our porch I look 
and saw men holding <span class="GramE">bolo(</span><span class="SpellE">es</span>).<span>&nbsp; </span>What I did was to lean against our door.' 
(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., p. 3, hearing of <st1:date month="11" day="6" year="1979">November 6, 1979</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span>Accordingly, the appellant contends that <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> could not possibly have seen the hacking 
incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is clear from the records that <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> saw the assailants as she was only two arms 
length away and although there was no electricity, there </span><span>was a 
</span><span>lighted "<span class="SpellE"><em>gacera</em></span>" or wick lamp 
inside the house when <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> was sleeping (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., </span><st1:date month="2" day="25" year="1980"><span>February 25, 1980</span></st1:date><span>, p. 
26).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We agree with the following observations of the Solicitor 
General:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Moreover, appellant Wilbur <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> was long 
known to the <span class="SpellE">Pantinoples</span>, he being a long time 
neighbors of theirs.<span>&nbsp; </span>The two other accused â€” the <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> brothers â€” were also known to the <span class="SpellE">Pantinoples</span> for about a year already prior to <span class="SpellE">Roquid's</span> killing; the <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> 
brothers were then living with the appellant in the same house (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date month="2" day="25" year="1980">February 25, 
1980</st1:date>, pp. 9-11).<span>&nbsp; </span>Consequently, his identification, as 
well as that of the <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> brothers, was prompt and 
immediate, for it is a fact that when one meets a person known to him, 
identification takes place at first sight.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Also, it should be noted that immediately after the killing of 
<span class="SpellE">Roquid</span>, when Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> and his wife <span class="SpellE">Luzviminda</span> 
were still too shaken to concoct a story falsely incriminating the appellant and 
his two co-accused, the former positively and promptly stated to the authorities 
that appellant Wilbur <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> and his two co-accused â€” 
the <span class="SpellE">Navarra</span> brothers Rodolfo and Little Boy â€” hacked 
to death <span class="SpellE">Emiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> 
(<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Feb. 25, 1980, pp. 15-16; see also pp. 21-22, 
record).</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Aside from the positive identification of the appellant and <span class="GramE">his two co-accused,</span> the existence of sufficient motive on the 
part of the appellant and his two co-accused was also established.<span>&nbsp; 
</span><span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> and <span class="GramE">his two 
co-accused</span> were mad at <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> and <span class="SpellE">Roquid</span> who appeared to have gotten the upper hand in their 
verbal altercation, and with <span class="SpellE">Pantinople</span> boxing Rodolfo

night.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"On the other hand, there is no evidence whatsoever to show that 
these witnesses had ulterior motive to testify falsely against the appellant or 
falsely implicate him if he was not involved at all in the killing.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>On the contrary, appellant <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> even admitted 
that he had no personal differences with the <span class="SpellE">Pantinoples</span> and <span class="GramE">that</span> they were in 
fact friends.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such a contrary evidence, the only 
logical conclusion is that no such improper motive existed and their testimony 
are worthy of full faith and credit (<em>People v. Angeles</em>, 92 SCRA 
432)."</blockquote>

accused Wilbur <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> and his father, Richard <span class="SpellE">Aboga</span> that the accused was sleeping at their house at the
