<p class="BODY"><span style="">On April 22, 1974</span>,
<span style="">or </span><span style="">more </span><span style="">than ten </span><span style="">years after the levy was made, <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span> filed</span><span style="">

cancellation </span>a <span style="">the levy on the
ground of pres­cription.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition
was opposed by the bank.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1974" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1974</st1:date> directed <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>
to ask the <st1:place>Manila</st1:place> court to quash the writ <span style="">of </span>execution <span style="">on </span>the ground of prescription and thereafter to <span class="SpellE">refile</span> his petition in the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The said court also adverted to the rule that relief <span style="">under </span>section 112 of Act No. 496 can be
granted only when there is unanimity among the parties or there is no adverse
claim or serious objection on the part of an interested party.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 20, 1975, <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span> filed in the
same court an action to <span style="">quiet </span>title
or for the cancellation of the notice of embargo on the ground that, although
more than ten years had elapsed from <span style="">the
</span>time <span style="">the </span>levy was made,
no execution sale<span style=""> had </span>been held
and, therefore, the levy had become in­efficacious and was a cloud on his <span style="">title (Civil </span>Case No. 685).</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank answered the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a pre-trial <span style="">and the </span>submission
of memoranda, the trial court rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1977" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1977</st1:date> dismissing the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
heirs of <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span> (he died on </span><st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="1"><span style="">January
 20, 1977</span></st1:date><span style="">) appealed
to this Court under Republic Act No. 5440.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="">should </span>be borne
in mind that an action upon a judg­ment must be brought within ten years from
the time the right of <span style="">action accrues</span>
(Art. 1144, Civil Code).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As clarified <span style="">in the Rules of </span><span style="">Court, </span><span style="">that prescriptive period means that "a judgment may be </span><span style="">executed on motion within </span><span style="">five (5) years from the date of its entry or
from the </span><span style="">date it </span><span style="">becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>"
and "after the lapse of such time, and before it is barred by the statute </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">limitations, a judgment may be enforced by action" (Sec. </span><span style="">6, Rule 39).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">Jalandoni</span>
heirs, </span>in <span style="">support of their
contention that the levy cannot </span>be enforced <span style="">after the expiration <u>in 1969</u> of the ten-year period for
enforcing the judgment, rely on the rule laid down in <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span>
vs. Fidelity and Surety Co. of the <span class="SpellE">P.I</span>., 88 Phil.
547, a 1951 case, that "<u>properties levied upon by execution must be
sold in public auction within the period of ten years during which the judgment
can be en­forced by action</u>".<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reason for that rule is that an execution is enforced (and therefore
accomplished) by levy and sale, not by levy alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Ansaldo</u></span> case, a writ of
execution was issued by the Court of First Instance of Manila on <st1:date year="1933" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1933</st1:date> and a notice of levy
was annotated on <st1:date year="1933" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1933</st1:date>
on the <st1:place>Torrens</st1:place> titles covering the lots <span style="">of </span>the judgment debtor, Angel A. <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other
step was taken by the judgment creditor on the writ of execution and levy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>More than fourteen </u><u><span style="">years later,</span></u><span style=""> or on </span><st1:date year="1947" day="30" month="7"><span style="">July 30,
 1947</span></st1:date><span style="">, Jose Ma. <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo</span>, the heir of the judgment debtor, filed a petition
with </span><span style="">the Court </span><span style="">of First Instance of Manila for the
cancellation of the levy in view of the inaction of the judgment creditor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter opposed the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court granted it on the ground that the judgment <span style="">creditor's right </span>to enforce the
judgment by execution <u>had prescribed</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This Court affirmed the lower <span class="GramE">court' s</span> order <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the levy annotated on <span class="SpellE">Ansaldo's</span>
titles.</p>

<p class="BODY">In passing, this Court noted that, although it was ruled in
Government of the Philippines vs. <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span>, 71 Phil.
318 that if there is a valid levy within the period prescribed by law, the
execution sale may be enforced <u>thereafter</u>, the execution sale in that
case took place <u>within the ten-year period from the entry of judgment</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In The <span class="SpellE"><u>Echaus</u></span> case, the judgment
was rendered in 1932, the writ of execution was issued and the levy was made in
1934, and the execution sale was held in 1939 or within the ten-year period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, in this case the trial court and the bank hold
the view that the execution sale can be made beyond the ten-year period for
enforcing the judgment as long as the levy was <span class="GramE">effected</span>
within five years from the entry of judgment as in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">They rely on the dictum that while section 6 of Rule 39
"limits the time within which a writ of execution may be issued to enforce
a judgment, it does not prescribe a period when the sale at public auction by
the sheriff shall take place after the issuance of the writ of execution and a
valid levy made pursuant thereto" (Del Rosario vs. <span class="SpellE">Yatco</span>,
L-18735, December 29, 1966, 18 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 1263).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That dictum was based on the following
ruling, also cited in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Echaus</u></span> case:</p>

<p class="BODY">"The levy is the essential act by which the property is set
apart for the satisfaction of the judgment and taken into the custody of the
law, and. . . <span class="GramE">after</span> it has been taken from the
defendant, his interest is limited to its application to the judgment, <u>irrespective
of the time when it may be sold</u>." <span class="GramE">(Southern Cal.

<p class="BODY">In the decision in the <u>Southern California Lumber</u> case,
the phrase "irrespective of the time when it may be sold" means that
after a levy <span style="">has </span>been made, the
property levied upon may be sold even after the sixty-day period, which is the
term of the writ of execution, but that phrase does not mean that the execution
sale could be held beyond the ten-year period for enforcing the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the <u>Del Rosario</u>
case, </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">judgment was rendered in 1955, the writ of
execution was issued in 1956 and a levy was made on the land of the judgment
debtor, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Rosario,
which levy was annotated on his title and was recorded in the registry of
deeds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No execution sale was held.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In 1961, Del Rosario and the persons to whom he had mortgaged the
land levied upon filed in court a petition to cancel the levy on the ground
that more than five years had already elapsed since the levy was made and no
auction sale had been held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Del Rosario
contended that the judgment <span class="GramE">creditor' s</span> remedy was to
file an action to revive the judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court did not
grant the petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It ordered the
judgment creditor to take steps that the land levied upon </span><span style="">he sold at an execution sale within sixty
days.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court affirmed that </span><span style="">order of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should be noted </span><span style="">that the said </span>execution <span style="">sale would </span><span style="">take place within the ten-year </span><span style="">prescriptive period for enforcing the </span><span style="">judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <u>Del Rosario</u> <span style="">case,
this Court cited the case </span>of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Quimbao</span></span><span style=""> vs.
Manila Motor Co., Inc., </span>113 Phil. 431, which <span style="">reaffirmed the rule in the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ansaldo</u></span>
case that <u>"a valid execution issued and levy made within the five-year
period after entry of the judgment may be enforced by sale of the property
levied upon thereafter, provided the sale is made within ten years after the
entry of the judgment</u>".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We hold that the </span>trial
court erred in not applying the <span style="">ruling
in the </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Ansaldo</u></span> c<span style="">ase which is on all fours with this </span>case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The employees of the bank
were negligent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">They did </span><span style="">not </span><span style="">require the sheriff

at public auction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bank is bound by </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">employees' </span><span style="">negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case should teach the responsible
