possession and occupation of that parcel of land continuously and
uninterruptedly since 1970, having originally erected a hut thereon which was
later replaced by a bungalow; and that the land has been declared for taxation
in his name and the real property taxes thereon paid by him for the years 1970

<p class="BODY">In the present appeal, petitioner contends that the respondent
court (1) gravely abused its discretion in giving due course to the petition
for review notwithstanding the fact that the decision sought to be reviewed had
already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>; and (2) gravely
erred in holding that "the instant petition must be resolved on the all
important issue of priority of possession instead of the issue as to who is the
legal possessor of the lot subject of the litigation".<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">Concordant with the claim of private respondent, the respondent
court found the following relevant facts established by the evidence of record:</p>

<blockquote>"On August 16, 1961, Ordinary Residence Permit No. 1675 was
issued by the Bureau of Forestry authorizing the petitioner to occupy four
hectares of public forest land situated in <span class="SpellE">Sitio</span>
Upper <span class="SpellE">Kalaklan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zambales</span> (Exhibit A), on which he constructed a warehouse
and a gasoline station pursuant to permits issued to him by the said bureau
(Exhibits C, C-1, 1 and J), which on February 10, 1970 were declared for
purposes of taxation in his name (Exhibits E and E-1) and taxes due thereon
were paid (Exhibits F-4 and F-5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1977</st1:date>,
the parcel of land in question, designated as Block V, LC Project No. 14, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
BF Map LC. 2427, containing an area of 42,086 square meters, covered by the
sketch (Exhibit G), having been declared alienable and disposable, the
petitioner filed an application with the Bureau of Lands to purchase it under
Miscellaneous Sales Application No. (111-4) 9019 (Exhibit M).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1980</st1:date>,
the petitioner wrote to the respondent advising him to stop construction of the
building that he was putting up within the parcel of land in question (Exhibit
H).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On March 6, 1980, the respondent having refused to desist from
constructing the building that he was putting up, the petitioner filed the
instant complaint for forcible entry in the then City Court of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">We </span>initially take
up the first error imputed by petitioner which, although the records do not
show that the same was raised in the petition for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">review </span>in respondent court, deserves a corresponding resolution
since it indirectly attributes a jurisdictional defect.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner claims that a copy of the decision of the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was sent by registered mail to the counsel of private respondent at his given
address.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the envelope was
supposedly returned to the court when counsel for private respondent allegedly
failed to claim the same after a second notice was made on <st1:date year="1985" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner then contends that, pursuant to Section 3, Rule 13 of the
Rules of Court, the decision of the regional trial court became final on July
15, 1985, private respondent not having seasonably filed either a motion for
reconsideration or a notice of appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We are not persuaded by this argument belatedly raised by
petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is incumbent upon a party
who relies upon constructive service under Section 5 of Rule 13 of the Rules to
prove that the first notice of the registered letter was sent and delivered to
the addressee, as the presumption that official duty has been regularly
performed does not apply to such a situation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, the assertions in the petition of the facts stated in the next preceding
paragraph are unsubstantiated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of such proof in the record, the disputable presumption of completeness
of service does not arise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
not only has petitioner failed in such requisite proof but, as earlier stated, the
records do not show that such issue was raised or proved by him in the
respondent court when, the petition for review was filed with and was pending
therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The principle of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> by <span class="SpellE">laches</span>, which is in
the interest of a sound administration of the laws, consequently bars this
objection from being raised by petitioner for the first time and at this late stage.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It is next alleged that respondent court gravely erred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>adjudicating the case on the basis
of priority of physical possession instead of legal possession.</p>

<p class="BODY">As already adumbrated, respondent court held that private
respondent was granted a residence permit over a lot with an area of 42,086
square meters by the Bureau of Forestry on <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1961</st1:date>, and a permit to construct a warehouse and
gasoline station thereon by the then municipal government of <span class="SpellE">Olongapo</span> on <st1:date year="1963" day="1" month="10">October
 1, 1963</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
This residence permit, which was renewable every year, was not renewed after <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1969</st1:date> because it was stopped
by then Vice-President Fernando Lopez, although private respondent continued to
pay rental fees for the land until 1973.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Upon application by private respondent, the said lot was declared alienable and
disposable public land and released by the Bureau of Forest Development to the
Bureau of Lands in March, 1973.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he filed a Miscellaneous Sales Application with the Bureau
of Lands on <st1:date year="1977" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1977</st1:date>
for the purchase of the said lot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It likewise appears that private respondent declared the warehouse and gasoline
station for taxation purposes and paid taxes thereon in 1970 and 1971.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner claims that he entered into and
took possession of the contested lot in 1970 pursuant to a permit granted to
him by the Bureau of Forest Development, as supposedly evidenced by a
certification from the latter dated April 10, 1979,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
and a building permit and sanitary/plumbing permit issued for the construction
of his house thereon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
This is an egregious inaccuracy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>aptly
observed by respondent court, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Said permits (Annexes A, B and C to answer) were not actually
introduced in evidence by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">respondent
</span><span class="SpellE">Elane</span> in support of his allegations and defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They may not, therefore, be considered at all
as evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the certification
(Annex A to answer) do (sic) not attest to the issuance of any permit to occupy
the parcel of land in question in favor of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Elane</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It merely certified to the fact that the
parcel of land in question 'was found to be Alienable and <st1:place><st1:placename>Disposable</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Land</st1:placetype></st1:place>.' And the building and
sanitary/plumbing permits (Annexes B and C to answer) could not have
established his possession of the parcel of land since 1970 because aside from
the fact that they bear no date of actual issuance, they were accomplished by
the applicant whose residence certificate appears to have been issued only on
January 5, 1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>How then can it be
correctly concluded that based upon such certification and permits (Annexes A,
B and C to answer), the respondent <span class="SpellE">Elane</span> had entered
into and had taken possession of the parcel of land in question since 1970?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Moreover, the survey of the parcel of land in question was
prepared for the respondent <span class="SpellE">Elane</span> only on <st1:date year="1979" day="25" month="2">February 25, 1979</st1:date> (Exhibit 6). His
miscellaneous sales application was filed in the Bureau of Lands only on <st1:date year="1979" day="26" month="3">March 26, 1979</st1:date> (Exhibit 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lot and residential building constructed
thereon were declared for purposes of taxation only on <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1979</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1981</st1:date> (Exhibits 4-A and 5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The realty taxes due for 1970-73, 1974-78 and
1979 (Exhibit 8) and those due for the succeeding years were paid only on April
14, 1980, May 8, 1981 and March 16, 1982 (Exhibits 8-1 to 8-5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Elane's</span>
possession based on those documents cannot, therefore, retroact as of
1970."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under these circumstances, We are convinced that private
respondent has priority of possession over petitioner whose entry into the
subject lot may be reckoned only as of 1979. There is no merit in the
suggestion that petitioner was authorized by the Bureau of Forest Development
to occupy the land by virtue of an alleged permit issued by said bureau.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A cursory examination of said document readily
shows that it is a mere certification that the lot claimed by petitioner is
part of the alienable and disposable land of the public domain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere is it stated therein that petitioner
is allowed to take possession of the subject lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it is <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span>
that private respondent was issued a residence permit way back in 1961 which
entitled him to possession of the disputed land starting in the same year.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner, however,
submits that the expiration of private respondent's permit in 1969, and its
non-renewal, deprived the latter of his <span class="SpellE">possessory</span>
right over and </span>the corresponding right to eject petitioner from the
subject lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner argues that by
reason of the expiration of said permit, the right of possession over the land
reverted to the Bureau of Lands thereby vesting in said entity the sole right
to institute any forcible entry case over the land in question.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We likewise reject this
submission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court expressly observed that while private
respondent's permit to occupy the land may have expired in 1969, he remained in
physical possession thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the
decisive issue is priority of possession and private respondent had been in
actual and continuous possession of the land since <st1:date year="1961" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1961</st1:date>, his material possession must be
protected in this <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case until a competent
court in an appropriate case determines which of the contending parties has the
better right of possession.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As tersely emphasized by respondent court, and correctly so,
"it is of no moment that petitioner's right to occupy said parcel of land
by reason of the permit issued to him by the Bureau of Forestry has already
expired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, it is not whether he has a
legal right to possess it that is in issue; it is whether he is in actual
physical possession of it that is decisive in the instant case for forcible
entry."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, private respondent was in earlier possession of the
contested lot; his sales application preceded that of petitioner; his warehouse
and gasoline station already existed long before petitioner took possession of
the parcel of land in question; and he has been paying <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">taxes and rental fees thereon since 1968.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As provided by the Civil Code -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Art. 538.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Possession
as a fact cannot be recognized at the same time in two different personalities
except in the case of co-possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Should a question arise regar<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">d</span>ing
the fact of possession, the present possessor shall be preferred; if there are
two possessors, the one longer in possession; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Having been in prior continuous
possession, private respondent is preferentially entitled to occupy the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's intrusion upon the disputed premises can properly be
categorized as one effected through stealth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where forcible entry was thus made clandestinely, the one-year
prescriptive period should be counted from the time private respondent demanded
that the <span class="SpellE">deforciant</span> desist from such dispossession
when the former learned thereof.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The records reflect that such discovery and prohibition took place on <st1:date year="1980" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1980</st1:date>, reiterated
thereafter in the demand letter of <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="3">March
