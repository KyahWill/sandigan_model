she was appointed in 1983 Senior Vice President assigned to the Fund Transfer
Department.</p>

<p class="BODY">Starting 1 April 1986 up to 20 February 1987, petitioner filed
several applications for leave of absence (due to medical reasons) which were
duly approved.  While she was on leave,
Executive Order No. 80 (Revised Charter of the PNB) <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:

not avail of the ERIP/Supple­mentary Retirement Plans adopted by the PNB in
1986, you have therefore lost your right thereto.  Moreover, since you lack the required number of years of service
to entitle you to retirement benefits under existing laws, you may be entitled
to the return of your GSIS personal contributions.  Considering further that you have exhausted all your accumulated
leave credits as you went on leave of absence for the period from April 1, 1986
to February 20, 1987, there is no legal or valid basis to entitle you to
payment of terminal leave.</blockquote>

others, the abolition of positions/offices.  The records show that prior to its reorganization, PNB originally had 7,537
positions which were reduced to 5,405 after the reorganization.  Indeed, 2,132 positions were abolished, that

believe that the reorganization of PNB was done in good faith.  For indeed, the reorganization was pursued
to achieve economy.  It undertook
reduction in force as a means to streamline the number of the workforce.  It was incidental that movant Yap's position
was one among those abolished.  Movant
Yap failed to substantiate her claim by clear and convincing evidence that the
abolition of her position was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">a </span>result

First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos.  This being <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">so, </span>and
pursuant to the presump­tion of regularity in the performance of official

employees was done in good faith.'"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“x x x Reorganizations in this jurisdiction have been regarded as
valid provided they are pursued in good faith.  As a general rule, a reorganization is carried out in 'good faith' if it
is for the purpose of economy or to make bureaucracy more efficient.  In that event, no dismissal (in case of
dismissal) or separation actually occurs because the position itself ceases to

'abolition,' which is nothing else but a separation or removal, is done for
political reasons or purposely to defeat security of tenure, or other­wise not
in good faith, no valid 'abolition' takes place and whatever 'abolition' is
done, is void ab initio.  There is an
invalid 'abolition' as where there is merely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

economy are belied by the existence of ample funds.  It is to be stressed that by predisposing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a </span>reorganization to the yardstick of good faith, we are not, as
a consequence, imposing a 'cause' for restructuring.  Retrenchment in the course of a reorganization in good faith is
still removal 'not for cause,' if by 'cause' we refer to 'grounds' or
conditions that call for disciplinary action.  Good faith, as a component of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">reorganization under a constitutional regime,

<p class="BODY">Executive Order No. 80 conferred upon the PNB the authority to
reorganize.  The order was issued by
then Pres. Corazon Aquino on 3 December 1986 while she was exercising the
powers vested in the President of the Philippines by the Freedom Constitution.  After 3 December 1986, what remained to be
done was the implementation of the reorganization.  There is no doubt as to the legal basis for PNB's reorganiza<span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">tion.  The real </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

<p class="BODY">To start with it is almost absurd for petitioner to insist that her

conceived.  In most of PNB's pleadings,
it has documented and supported its stand that the year of petitioner's
separation is 1987 not 1986.  The
antedating of the termination date, aside from being clearly a typographical
error, is a peripheral issue.  The real
issue is existence of bad faith consisting of tangible bureaucratic/management
pressures exerted to ease her out of office.  Bad faith has been defined as a state of mind affirmatively operating
with furtive design or with some motive of self interest or ill will or for an
ulterior purpose.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> It is the performance of an act

<p class="BODY">PNB's reorganization, to repeat, was by virtue of a valid
law.  At the time of reorganization, due
to the critical financial situation of the bank, departments, positions and
functions were abolished or merged.  The
abolition of the Fund Transfer Department (FTD) was <u>deemed necessary</u>.  This, to the Court's mind, was a management
prerogative exercised pursuant to a business judgment.  At this point, a distinction can be made in
ruling on the validity of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>reorganization
between a government bureau or office performing constituent functions (like
the Customs) and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>government-owned
or controlled corporation performing ministrant functions (like the PNB).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Constituent function are those which constitute the very bonds of
society and are compulsory in nature; ministrant functions are those undertaken
by way of advancing the general interests of society, and are merely optional.  Commercial or universal banking is, ideally,
not a govern­mental but a private sector endeavor.  It is an optional <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">function
of government.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x The principles determining whether or not a government
shall exercise certain of these optional functions are:  (1) that a government should do for the
public welfare those things which private capital would not naturally undertake
and (2) that a government should do those things which by its very nature it is
better equipped to administer for the public welfare than is any private individual
or group of individuals (<u>Malcolm, The Government of the Philippine Islands</u>,
pp. 19-20)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"From the above we may infer that, strictly speaking, there
are functions which our government is required to exercise to promote its
objectives as expressed in our Constitution and which are exercised by it as an
attribute of sovereignty, and those which it may exercise to promote merely the
welfare, progress and prosperity of the people.  To this latter class belongs the organization of those
corporations owned or controlled by the government to promote certain aspects
of the economic life of our people such as the National Coconut Corpora­tion.  These are what we call government-owned or
controlled corporations which may take on the form of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">a </span>private enterprise or one organized with powers and formal
characteristics of a private corporation under the Corporation Law."
(Bacani vs. Nacoco, No. L-9657, November 29, 1956, 100 Phil. 468)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But a reorganization whether in a government bureau performing
constituent functions or in a government-owned or controlled corporation
performing ministrant functions must <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">meet
a common test, the test of good faith.  In this connection, the philosophy behind PNB's reorganization is
spelled out in the whereas clauses of Executive Order No. 80:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, within the context of the general policy there
nevertheless exists a clear role for direct government participation in the
banking system, particularly in servicing the requirements of agriculture,
small and medium scale industry, export development, and the government sector.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, in pursuit of this national policy there is need to
restructure the government financial institutions, particularly the Philippine
National Bank, to achieve a more efficient and effective use of available
scarce resources, to improve its viability, and to avoid unfair competition
with the private sector, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the reorganization and rehabili­tation of the
Philippine National Bank into a similar but stronger and more operationally
viable bank is an important component of the nationali­zation programs for both
the financial system and the government corporation sector; x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Whether there was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>hidden
political agenda to persecute petitioner due to her consanguinial relation to
Mrs. Imelda Romualdez Marcos, the widow of former President Marcos, is not
clearly shown.  On the other hand, it is
entirely possible that precisely because of such consanguinal rela­tion,
petitioner may have been the object of deferential, if not special treatment
under the Marcos regime.  It is part of
the Filipino culture to extend such deferential, if not <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">special treatment to close relatives of persons in power.  Many times this is carried to unwholesome
extremes.  But a discontinuance of such
deferential or special treatment in the wake of a change in government or
administration is not bad faith <u>per</u> <u>se</u>.  It may be merely putting things in their proper places.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the restructuring - and this is empirically verifiable -
PNB became once more a viable banking institu­tion.  The restoration of the FTD four years after it was abolished and
its functions transferred to the International Department, can be attributed to
the bank's growth after reorganizations, thereby negating malice or bad faith
in that reorganization.  The essence of
good faith lies in an honest belief in the validity of one's right.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It consists of an honest intention to abstain from taking an unconscionable and
unscrupulous advantage of another, its absence should be established by
convincing evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The records also clearly indicate that starting April 1986 to
February 1987, petitioner went on leave of absence for medical reasons.  While she was not reporting to the office,
the bank's reorganization got underway.  She continued, however, receiving her salaries, allowances, emoluments,
honoraria and fees up to March 1987.  Employees who were affected by the reorganization had the option to
avail of the bank's Separation Benefits Plan/Early Retirement Plan (SBP/ERIP).  Petitioner opted not to avail of such plan
and instead submitted to the result of the bank's ongoing reorganization and
management's discretion.  If petitioner
had the desire for continued employment with the bank, she could have asserted
it for management's consideration.  There is no proof on record that she affirmatively expressed willingness
to be employed.  Since she cannot rebut
the CSC finding that her earliest appeal was made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">on </span>4 August 1989, there is no reason for this Court to hold that
she did not sleep on her rights.  On the
contrary, her present argument that bad faith existed at the time of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">abolition of the FTD because it was
restored four years later is a little too late.  Who could have predicted in 1986 or 1987 that PNB would be able
to rise from its finan­cial crisis and become a viable commercial bank
again?  The decision to abolish the FTD
at the time it was abolished, to repeat, was a business judgment made in good
faith.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, Rep. Act No. 6656 cannot be invoked by
petitioner because it took effect on 15 June 1987, or after PNB's

applicable here and petitioner must be accorded preferential right to
appointment in the bank, PNB in its rejoinder impressively asserts:</p>

<blockquote>"Needless to say, there were various committees that were
created in the implementation of the organizational restructuring of the Bank
based on the foregoing policy guidelines.  Each personnel to be retained was evaluated in terms of relative fitness

International Department from among other officers of the Bank, including Ms.
Yap, his qualifications far exceeded those of the other candidates for the
position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We attach hereto as Annexes 'G-1' and 'G-2' the service records of
Mr. Federico Pascual and Petitioner Ms. Yap, respectively, which clearly show
that the qualifications of Mr. Pascual far exceed those of Petitioner Yap.  Aside from being a lawyer having been a law
graduate from the Univer­sity of the Philippines, he is also a Bachelor of Arts
degree holder from Ateneo de Manila and a Master of Laws graduate of Columbia
Law School.  He had studied Masteral
Arts in Public Administration at the London School of Economics and had
undergone extensive seminars since 1974 at the International Department and had
been assigned in several foreign branches of the Bank.  Before he resigned from the Bank, he held
the second highest position of Execu­tive Vice President and served as Acting
President of the Bank before the incumbent president, President Gabriel Singson
assumed his position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, the service record of Petitioner Yap will show
that she only holds a Bachelor of Science in Commerce Degree from Assumption
