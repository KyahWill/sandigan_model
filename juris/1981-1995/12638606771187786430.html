company terminated his services for dishonesty, grave abuse of discretion,
gross negligence, and violation of employment policies and procedures.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Among his duties as
credit and collection manager was to file collection suits against defaulting
dealers and customers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One such dealer
was the Anchor Fishing and Trading Supply owned by Henry <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>

the debtor's failure to comply with the judgment, a writ of execution was
issued by the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
implementation of the writ, a levy was made by the Deputy Sheriff of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Legaspi</span></span></st1:placename><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> on twelve (12) parcels of land owned by </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Samar</span></span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the sale of the levied properties at public auction was aborted
because, at the petitioner's behest, <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> signed on
December 22, 1979, a Deed of Sale of ten (10), out of twelve (12), of his
parcels of land in favor of <span class="SpellE">Mariwasa</span>, and another
sale of the remaining two (2) parcels to the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">A report of this
transaction reached the company through some </span>unidentified
informant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Having some premonition <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of impending trouble, petitioner wrote a
letter to Emerson T. <span class="SpellE">Coseteng</span>, president of <span class="SpellE">Mariwasa</span>, offering </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">resign but with salary
up to May, 1981, separation pay, and cash conversion of his vacation and sick
leaves.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also applied for a 15-day <span class="GramE">vacation</span> leave effective </span><st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">March 16, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, before he could take a vacation, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">company's manager,
Kazue Ito, advised him on March 13, 1981 that effective on that date he was
being suspended indefinitely as credit and collection manager; that an
investigation of his activities as head of the Credit and Collection Department
was being conducted; and that he should effect a smooth turnover of his
department to the officer-in-charge of the Special Task Force.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">March
 16, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, <span class="SpellE">Mariwasa</span> sent telegrams and memos to its branches and
dealers advising them that the petitioner was no longer connected with the
company, that <span class="SpellE">Cris</span> <span class="SpellE">Cifra</span>
had taken his place as credit </span>and collection manager, and that any
transactions with him after <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="3">March 13,
 1981</st1:date> would not be honored by the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1981</st1:date>,
petitioner addressed a letter to the Personnel Manager, Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Antalan</span>, reiterating his request to be allowed to resign
with separation pay and with vacation leaves and sick leaves conversion.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Shortly thereafter, he
learned about the company's memos to its branches and dealers </span><span class="SpellE">disauthorizing</span> him to do business with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a letter dated <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1981</st1:date> to the manager, he withdrew his
offer to resign and his application for a 15-day leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He assailed the order for his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">indefinite </span>suspension and
investigation and asked the company to recall it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1981</st1:date>,
the company advised him that his services were terminated effective <st1:date year="1981" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1981</st1:date> for loss of trust and
confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He, thereafter, filed a
complaint for illegal dismissal in the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">After hearing the complaint, the Labor Arbiter found that "complainant
has not been accorded his basic right to due process" (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) for he "was already dismissed from the service
before any investigation was formally conducted by the said company" (p.
32, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, he held:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"that
respondent company had every reason to sever, as in fact, it did sever, its
relationship with the complainant (Del Castillo)" for he prostituted his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">office "in order to gain material wealth
at the expense of the company" (pp. 34-35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent portion of the Labor Arbiter's
decision is quoted below:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"Delving, however, into the cause/s that led the management
to terminate the services of the complainant, it would appear that respondent
company had every reason to sever, as in fact, it did </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sever, </span>its relationship with the
complainant herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been clearly
established that complainant wrote a letter to the Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Albay</span> requesting that the Notice of Levy filed by Deputy
Sheriff Ernesto Ramirez on January 26, 1979 be cancelled and/or withdrawn on
the ground that judgment debtor, Henry C. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span>, has
already executed in favor of the respondent company a Deed of Sale covering
only ten (10) parcels of land, which were part of the twelve (12) originally
levied in January 1979; that the two (2) parcels were obtained by the
complainant for himself on December 19, 1979 from the spouses Aida B. <span class="SpellE">Samar</span> and Henry</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>Samar</i></span><i>
three (3) days before the ten (10) parcels of land were conveyed to the
respondent company; that had there been a public auction of the twelve (12)
parcels of land levied by the Sheriff, the company would have acquired all the
twelve (12) parcels of land instead of only ten (10) parcels; and, that <u>complainant's
action has prejudiced the interest of the respondent company</u> as in </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">this case</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Assuming that the value of the ten (10) parcels of land
was more than enough to cover the judgment debt, the fact that complainant as
Collection and Credit Manager acquired </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>two (2) parcels of land which were also included in the
levied properties undeniably exposes himself to the charge of prostituting his
office in order to gain material wealth at the expense of the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By giving him said position, respondent
company has reposed in him trust and confidence which, unfortunately, he
betrayed by committing acts inimical to the interest of the company</i>. <i>It
is within management's prerogative to seek his dismissal for loss of trust and
confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a well-settled rule </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in </span>this jurisdiction that an employer
cannot be compelled to </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">retain
under his employ an employee whose continued employment is inimical </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">his interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law in
protecting the interest of the laborer does not authorize the oppression or
destruction of the employer." <span class="GramE">(Underscoring supplied;
pp. 34-35, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Labor Arbiter dismissed
the complaint and ordered the respondent to </span>pay <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the complainant separation pay equivalent to 5 and 1/2 <span class="GramE">months</span> salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, as his dismissal was for a valid and justifiable cause, his
claim for damages was dismissed for lack of merit (p. 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon appeal by Del Castillo, the appealed
decision was affirmed by the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
now seeks a review of that decision by this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After a careful
consideration of the petition and <span class="SpellE">Mariwasa's</span> comment
thereon, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold that the NLRC and the Labor Arbiter
correctly found that petitioner was lawfully dismissed for a just cause -
dishonesty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, they erred in
awarding to him separation pay equivalent to 5-1/2 months’ salary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An employee who is found guilty of dishonesty
deserves no such reward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span class="GramE">We</span> held in a similar case:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><i>"The Court feels that distinctions are in order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note that heretofore </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the separation pay, when it was </span>considered
warranted, was required regardless of the nature or degree of </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the ground proved, be it mere inefficiency or
something graver like </span>immorality or dishonesty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The benediction of compassion was made to
cover a multitude of sins, as it were, and to justify the helping hand to the
validly dismissed employee whatever the reason for his dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This policy should be re-examined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is time we rationalized the exception, to </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">make </span>it fair to both labor and
management, especially to labor.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"There should be no question that where it comes to such
valid but not iniquitous causes as failure to comply with work standards, the </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">grant </span>of separation </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">pay </span>to the dismissed employee may be
both just and compassionate, particularly if he has worked for some time with
the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, a subordinate
who has irreconcilable policy or personal differences with his employer may be
validly dismissed for demonstrated loss of confidence, which is an allowable
ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A working mother who has to be
frequently absent because </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">she </span>has
also to take care of her child may also be removed because of her poor
attendance, this being another authorized </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is </span>not the
employee's fault if he does not have the necessary aptitude for his work but on
the other hand the company cannot be required to maintain him just the same at
the expense of the efficiency of its operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He too may be validly replaced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these and similar circumstances,
however, the award to the employee of separation pay would be sustainable under
the social justice policy even if the separation is for cause.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"But where the cause of the separation is more serious than
mere inefficiency, the generosity of the law must be more discerning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no doubt it is compassionate to give
separation pay to a salesman if he is dismissed for his inability to fill his
quota but surely he does not deserve such generosity if his offense is
misappropriation of the receipts of his </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This is no longer
mere incompetence but clear dishonesty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A security guard found sleeping on the job is doubtless subject to
dismissal but may be allowed separation pay since his conduct, while inept, is
not depraved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But if he was in fact not
really sleeping but sleeping with a prostitute during his tour of duty and in
the company premises, the situation is changed completely.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not only inefficiency but immorality
and the grant of separation pay would be entirely unjustified.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">"We </span>hold that
henceforth separation pay shall be allowed as a measure of social justice only
in those instances where the employee is validly dismissed for causes other
than serious misconduct or those reflecting on his moral character.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the reason for the valid dismissal is,
for example, habitual intoxication or an offense involving moral </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">turpitude, </span>like theft or illicit
sexual relations with a fellow worker, the employer may not be required to give
the dismissed employee separation pay, or financial assistance, or whatever
other name it is called, on the ground of social justice." <span class="GramE">(PLDT vs. NLRC, et al., G.R. No. 80609, August 23, 1988.)</span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the NLRC is affirmed except
the award of separation pay to the employee, Jose P. Del Castillo, Jr., which
is hereby set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In lieu thereof and
