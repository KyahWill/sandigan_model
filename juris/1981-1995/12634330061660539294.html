in Criminal Case No. 5205 finding accused-appellant Ramonito Gelotin, alias
"Kumander Putol", guilty of the crime of Kidnapping.  The dispositive portion of the trial court's
decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, viewed from the foregoing and finding that there are no
mitigating circumstances to reduce the penalty, Ramonito Gelotin is hereby
found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of kidnapping and he is
hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>He is further ordered to pay the family or heirs of Romeo Marcos
the amount of P30,000.00 as damages for his disappearance and to pay the cost of
the suit.  He is credited with 4/5 of
his temporary imprisonment as a detention prisoner.  As for the other accused, their case is hereby placed in archive.  Let a warrant for their arrest be issued for
their apprehension.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, on March 16, 1987, Ramonito Gelotin alias "Kumander
Putol", Gerry Aliman, and two John Does were charged with kidnapping
before the said trial court in an information that reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about August 16, 1985, in
the afternoon thereof, at Barangay Mapuyo, Municipality of Mobo, Province of
Masbate, Philippines, within the jurisdiction of this Court, the said accused
who are private individuals confederating together and helping one another,
being then transients of said place armed with guns did then and there willfully,
unlawfully and feloniously kidnap one Romeo Marcos, permanently separating the
latter from his dwelling, detained him from the date of the commission up to
the present time depriving him of his personal liberty."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that only Ramonito Gelotin was arraigned
while the other three accused, namely: Gerry Aliman and the two John Does, were
not.  Gelotin entered a plea of
"not guilty" upon his arraignment on June 16, 1987.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts are well-stated in the People's Brief and they are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On August 16, 1985, at around 5 o'clock in the afternoon,
while Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos; her sons, Raquel and Ruel; and a certain David
Marcos, were in their house in Mapuyo, Mobo, Masbate, five armed men suddenly
arrived (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 3; June 16, 1987, pp. 2-3).  Of the five armed men, two were identified
as herein accused Ramonito Gelotin alias "Kumander Putol", and a
certain Jerry Aliman alias Baludoy (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 3; July 28, 1988, p.
3).  Ramonito Gelotin had a very distinguishable
mark: his left arm was amputated (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 13).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The armed men were looking for Romeo Marcos, husband of Fe
Monton Vda. de Marcos (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 3; July 28, 1988, p. 3).  Romeo Marcos was in the fields plowing the
land, so Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos ordered her son, Raquel, to go and fetch him
(TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 3; June 16, 1987, p. 3).  Raquel Marcos did as he was told (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 3; June
16, 1987, p. 3).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When Romeo Marcos reached their house, the herein accused
Gelotin ordered him to go near the unidentified armed men (TSN, June 16, 1987,
p. 3).  One of the armed men, at
gunpoint, ordered Romeo Marcos to lie, face down, on the ground (TSN, June 16,
1987, p. 4; July 28, 1988, p. 4).  They
then bound his hands at his back and hit him with the butt of their guns (TSN,
June 16, 1987, p. 4; July 28, 1988, p. 4).  Meanwhile, Ramonito Gelotin ordered another to search their house for
firearms, but they found nothing (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and her sons sat beside each other,
around five meters away from where her husband was, helplessly watching.  (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 5).  When asked as to why they were tying up
Romeo Marcos, Ramonito Gelotin replied that it was because he was an informer
of the military (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Raquel Marcos was also hogtied (Exhibits "A" and
"B", pp. 3-6, Records).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, at around 6 o'clock in the evening, they made
Romeo Marcos stand up, hit him in his back, and made him walk towards the
mountains of Barag (TSN, July 28, 1988, pp. 4-5; June 16, 1987, pp. 5-6).<sup><o:p></o:p></sup></blockquote>

<blockquote>"That was the last time Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos saw her
husband (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Two days after her husband was taken, Fe Monton Vda. de
Marcos proceeded to the Detachment Command of the Philippine Constabulary in
Mapuyo, Mobo, Masbate for assistance (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 6; December 14,
1988, p. 2).  She informed them that
"Kumander Putol", Gerry Aliman, Baludoy, and two others, who she
believed were members of the "Walang Patawad" group, kidnapped her
husband (TSN, June 16, 1987, pp. 12-14; December 14, 1988, p. 2).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A team of Philippine Constabulary soldiers was immediately
dispatched to look for Romeo Marcos and his kidnappers (TSN, July 28, 1988, pp.
5-6; June 16, 1987, p. 7).  The search,
however, yielded negative results (TSN, July 28, 1988, p. 6; June 16, 1987, p.
7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On or about December 1986, Ramonito Gelotin surrendered to
the authorities (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 8).  The surrender was broadcast over the local radios of Masbate (TSN, July
28, 1988, p. 10).  When Fe Monton Vda.
de Marcos and Raquel Marcos heard the radio broadcast, they immediately
proceeded to the headquarters of the Philippine constabulary to ascertain
whether the surrenderee was the same person who kidnapped Romeo Marcos (TSN,
July 28, 1988, p. 10; June 16, 1987, p. 14).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the accused was presented to them, they immediately
recognized him as one of the persons who kidnapped Romeo Marcos (TSN, July 28,
1988, p. 10; June 16, 1987, p. 15).  He
was immediately identified because of his distinct physical appearance, his
amputated left arm (TSN, June 16, 1987, p. 13).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A complaint for kidnapping was then filed."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant is now before Us to seek, naturally, favorable
appellate action.  He raises the sole
issue of whether or not the prosecution was able to establish positively and
beyond doubt, his identity as one of the perpetrators of the kidnapping.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in his appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, there can be no doubt that the appellant was one of the
kidnappers of the unfortunate victim, Romeo Marcos.  This fact is sufficiently established by the convincing
testimonies of Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and Raquel Marcos, wife and son,
respectively of Romeo Marcos.  Both of
them positively identified, not only once but twice, Ramonito Gelotin as one of
the kidnappers - first, when accused-appellant came down from the mountains to
surrender at the PC Headquarters in Masbate, Masbate,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
and second; in open court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Both likewise testified to the fact that accused?appellant has a very
peculiar physical characteristic, which is, his left arm was amputated,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
hence the name by which he was notoriously known: “Kumander Putol”. </p>

Monton Vda. de Marcos and Raquel Marcos:</p>

the complainants' memory,"<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, "the complaining witnesses Fe Monton Vda. de Marcos and Raquel Marcos
could not have erred in identifying the appellant as one of the
kidnappers."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Necessarily then, the trial court correctly arrived at a judgment
of conviction when it brushed aside, as unworthy in evidence, appellant's alibi
that he was in another island at the time of the kidnapping.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It need only be stressed that in this jurisdiction, the unbending rule to which
our Courts have long and faithfully adhered to is that alibi cannot prevail in
the light of the positive identification of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to that part of the decision appealed from sentencing
appellant to pay damages in the sum of P30,000.00 to the heirs of the late
Romeo Marcos, the same should be understood as damages for the Kidnapping and
not for the victim's death for it is to be noted that the crime with which
appellant was charged, and later convicted of, at the trial court was
Kidnapping only.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed from, as clarified
above, is hereby AFFIRMED, with costs against accused-appellant.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
