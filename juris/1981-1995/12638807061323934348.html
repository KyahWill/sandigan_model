				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner was appointed patrolman in the Manila Police
Department on <st1:date year="1948" day="1" month="6">June 1, 1948</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was in the service until <st1:date year="1980" day="1" month="1">January 1, 1980</st1:date>, when he reached the compulsory
retirement age.</p>

<p class="BODY">During <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">his </span>incumbency,
he contracted malignant hypertension, hypertensive cardio-vascular disease with
premature <span class="SpellE">venticular</span> and <span class="SpellE">atrial</span>
contraction, and cystitis.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1985</st1:date>,
he filed a claim for compensation benefits for his ailments with the GSIS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His claim was approved upon a finding that
his illnesses were service-connected and therefore compensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was awarded the corresponding benefits for
8 months under the category rated as Permanent Partial Disability.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later, he requested conversion of the category to Permanent Total
Disability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This request was denied on
the ground that he had already been awarded the maximum benefits commensurate
with the degree of his disability.</p>

<p class="BODY">The denial was elevated on <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="3">March
 7, 1988</st1:date>, to the Employees’ Compensation Commission, which found the
appeal devoid of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
petition for review on <i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, </span>on the sole issue of whether or not
the disability caused by the petitioner's ailments may be classified as
permanent and total.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner bases his appeal upon the opinion of his attending
physician, Major Felix M. Reyes, Jr., that his disability is total and
permanent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, such disability was
described as merely "total" in the GSIS Certification of Attending
Physician and in the Adjudication dated <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="8">August
 22, 1980</st1:date>, of the National Police Commission for his claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the GSIS correctly observes, the petitioner has not even
submitted the certification of the other physicians who attended him when he
was hospitalized on <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1979</st1:date>,
at the PCH/MPF Hospital at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Panopio</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, and on <st1:date year="1979" day="13" month="11">November 13, 1979</st1:date>, at the <st1:place><st1:placename>AFP</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No corroboration of Major Reyes's findings
was offered to bolster the petitioner's claim of "total" disability.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the GSIS is not bound by such findings as it is its
own Medical Director who is authorized by law to determine the nature and
degree of a claimant's ailments, subject to the approval of the Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dalupe</span> also argues that the benefits
awarded him for permanent partial disability is grossly insufficient and not
commensurate with the degree of his disability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, conversion of his disability rating to permanent and total would
only be just and equitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument cannot stand because the award of his benefits was
determined on the basis of his disability at the time of his separation from
government service and in accordance with the ECC Schedule of Compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As noted by the Solicitor General:</p>

<blockquote>Appendix "E" of the ECC Schedule of Compensation provides
the criteria and rating for said ailment, thus:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:-.45pt">"<u>CRITERIA FOR HYPERTENSIVE </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">CARDIO-VASCULAR </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">DISEASE</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

must be satisfied:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:.95in;text-indent:-24.75pt"><span class="GramE">"(a)
There must be a history, which should be proved, of trauma at work (to the head
especially), or trauma unusual and extra-ordinary strain or event, or undue
exposure to noxious gases in industry.</span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:.95in;text-indent:-24.75pt">"(b) There must
be a direct connection between the <span class="GramE">trauma</span> of exertion
in the course of the employment of the worker's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:63.0pt;text-indent:-19.35pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">"(c) </span>If the trauma or exertion
then <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and there caused a brain <span class="SpellE">hemmorhage</span> which would not have happened, an injury may be
considered </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">arising from the
work.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:-.45pt">"<u>RATING FOR PERMANENT PARTIAL
DISABILITY</u></p>

<p class="2Q">"Patients without any cardiovascular changes but whose blood pressure
rises under conditions of stress and strain to well above normal range but
promptly falls down to normal under resting conditions within twenty-four hours
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">and able to perform ordinary physical
activity . . . . . . <span class="GramE">.10</span>%<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Patients with or without cardiovascular changes whose
elevated blood pressure requires longer rest periods for its return <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">to normal and whose ordinary physical
activity is slightly limited . . . . . . . . . . . .25%<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">"Patients with continued hypertension which no longer falls to
normal even at rest and with demonstrable evidence of cardiovascular disease
and whose physical <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">activity is greatly
limited - </span>P.T.D."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find, therefore, that respondents ECC and GSIS committed no
abuse of discretion in not converting the petitioner's disability rating from
permanent and partial to permanent and total.</p>

<p class="BODY">While as a matter of policy, we incline in case of doubt to
sustain the worker's claim consistently with the mandate of the Constitution,
we can do so only when the provisions of the applicable law and the facts as
established by the evidence justify such conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, they do <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>in the case at bar.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is DENIED, with costs against
the petitioner.</p>
