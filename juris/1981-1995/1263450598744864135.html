				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In 1968, herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eulogio</span> <span class="SpellE">Borres</span> was then the acting mayor of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
while private respondent <span class="SpellE">Silverio</span> <span class="SpellE">Parages</span>
was a detective in the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> Police Department holding
such position in a permanent capacity being a civil service eligible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was assigned to the Homicide and General
Inves­tigation Section of the Investigation Branch of said department,
particularly to the Missing Persons Section.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1968</st1:date>,
acting on verbal complaints that respondent <span class="SpellE">Parages</span>
had been molesting Chinese businessman in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place>
and the fact that his performance was not satisfactory, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Borres</span> issued a memorandum ordering the detail of
respondent to his office.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1968</st1:date>,
after the said detail order was endorsed by the Chief of Police, <span class="SpellE">Parages</span> was served with a copy thereof, but he refused to
receive it and to comply with said order.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He informed petitioner that he was declining the detail because the
order was illegal<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and continued to <span style="">report to his unit.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1968" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1968</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Parages</span> filed a petition for prohi­bition and
injunction in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> against petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court, however, did not issue the writ of
preliminary injunction as prayed for, but preferred to hear the evidence before
taking any action.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, in view of respondent's refusal to comply with the
detail order, petitioner charged him with insubordination and neglect of duty
in the Police Commission through the City Board of Investigators.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, he ordered the suspension
of respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">Respondent </span>thus amended his
petition for prohibition and injunction, with the additional prayer that his
suspension be declared illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the trial court rendered its decision
dated <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="2">February 4, 1969</st1:date>
declaring the detail order of <st1:date year="1968" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1968</st1:date> illegal and therefore null and void, for being contrary to
Section 90 of Republic Act No. 3857, otherwise known as Revised Charter of the
City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place></st1:city>
and to the constitutional protection of security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, it held the order of suspension
dated <st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="12">December 16, 1968</st1:date>
likewise illegal, and ordered the immediate reinstatement of private respondent
to the service and the payment of his back salaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the order of <st1:date year="1969" day="3" month="3">March 3,
 1969</st1:date>, the lower court denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration
of the decision and granted the immediate execution of the judgment pending
appeal upon filing by private respondent of a bond in the sum of P3,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner filed the present petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>,
raising principally the issue of whether or not it is within the power of the
Mayor to order the detail <span style="">of<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>private respondent under the Revised
Charter of the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> and the latter's suspension for refusing to
comply with the order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of herein petitioner that although Section
90 of the Revised Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>Section 90. Power and Duties of the Chief of Police</u>.-
There shall be a Chief of Police with a salary of seven thousand eight hundred
pesos per annum who shall have charge of the police depart­ment and everything
pertaining thereto including the organization, administration, discipline, and
disposition of, and the transfer of, members from and to the city police and
detective bureau; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> and
shall promptly and faithfully execute all orders of the Mayor, <u>including
assignments and transfer of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>personnel</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">is applicable, it should, however, be
read in the light of Section<span style="">&nbsp; </span>20 of the
said law, which reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Section 20</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>General

<blockquote>"e.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To see that executive officers and employees
of the city are properly discharging their respective duties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Mayor may, in the interest of the

from <span style="">one </span>section, division,
service, or department to another section, division, service, or department
without changing the compensation they receive."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Iikewise</span> cites Section 19 </span><span style="">of the city.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>C</span><span style="">harter which </span><span style="">provides:</span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Section 19</u>. <u>Nature of Officer; Qualification;</u><u><span style=""> </span>Compensations</u>.- The Mayor shall be
the chief executive of the city and as such shall have immediate <u>control

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">and
Section 32 which enumerates the departments on which the mayor may exercise
supervision and control and reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the following city departments over which the Mayor shall have <u>direct

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent, </span>on
the <span style="">o</span><span style="">f</span><span style=""> other hand, claims
that pursuant</span><span style=""> to Administrative
Order </span><span style="">No. 4</span><span style="">2, </span><span style="">Seri</span><span style="">e</span><span style="">s of 1937, </span><span style="">issued by the </span><span style="">Civil </span><span style="">Service Commission "whenever the Head of
any Department or Dependency of the National Government </span>deems <span style="">it necessary </span>to assign <span style="">any employee </span><span style="">outside </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the Bureau or office where he is regularly
employed, or to </span><span style="">perform within
the same Bureau </span><span style="">or office</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">kind of work which </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">different from that for </span><span style="">which
</span><span style="">the position he occupies has
been provided, the said Department or Dependency shall issue an order stating
the necessity for such </span><span style="">special
assignment and a copy of</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">the order shall be furnished to</span> <span style="">the </span><span style="">Budget Office, but </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">such special assign</span><span style="">ment shall be m</span><span style="">ade </span>for <span style="">more than </span>30
days."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also claims <span style="">that in addition </span><span style="">to the foregoing requirement, Memorandum</span>
Circular Nos.<span style=""> </span>45 and 29<span style=""> of the Civil Service</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">Commission
dated</span><span style=""> September 24, 1964 and
July 29, </span><span style="">1965, </span>respectively,
<span style="">require </span><span style="">that all assignments </span><span style="">a</span><span style="">nd reassignments</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">to
positions of a </span><span style="">grade or </span><span style="">character not contemplated by the examination
</span><span style="">from the results of which
appointment was made x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
should also be submitted to the Commission for prior</span> <span style="">approval.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Aside from the
aforementioned administrative order and circulars, private respondent likewise
cites Section 684 of the Revised Administrative Code which provides:</span></p>

<blockquote>''No person appointed to a position in the classified service
shall, without the approval of the Commission of Civil Service, be <u>assigned</u>
to or employed in a position of a grade or character not contemplated by the
examination from the result of which appointment was made, unless otherwise
provided by law."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent also
disputes the validity of his </span>sus<span style="">pension,
claiming that contrary to Section 16 of </span>Republic Act No. 4864,<span style=""> he was suspended even before the filing of
an administrative complaint against him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 16 provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Section 16. Suspension of Members of the Police Force or
Agency</u>.- When an administrative charge is filed under oath against any
member of the local police agency, the city mayor or municipal mayor, as the
case may be, may suspend the respondent:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, That the charge involves disloyalty to the government,
dishonesty, oppression, grave misconduct, serious irregulari<span style="">ties</span>, or serious neglect of duty, if
there are strong reasons to believe that the respondent is probably guilty
thereof which would warrant his suspension or removal from the service
xxx."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">He further contends that
the suspension order is a premature conclusion considering that the detail
order was then already subject of a judicial deter</span>mination <span style="">as to its validity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under the foregoing facts
and the pertinent </span>laws cited, the <span style="">power
o</span>f <span style="">petitioner, as </span>Mayor <span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, </span><span style="">to detail respondent cannot be denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">power to detail must
necessarily be deemed included in his power of control and supervision over
different departments, among which is the Police Department, as expressly so
provided in Sections 19 and 32 of the Revised Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;</span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Mondano</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Silvosa</span> 97 Phil. 143, this Court had the occasion
to define "supervision" and </span><span style="">"control" </span><span style="">thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Supervision means overseeing of the power or authority of an
officer to see that subordinate officers perform their duties; control on the
other hand, means the power of an officer to alter, modify or nullify or set
aside what subordinate officer had done in the performance of his duties and to
substitute the judgment of the former for that of the latter."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Rodriguez, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>, et al., 94 Phil. 964, 972, We had earlier said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"To supervise is to oversee, to have oversight of, to
superintend the execution of or the performance of a thing, or the movements or
work of a person, to inspect with authority; to inspect and direct the work of
others.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted that there
are two senses in which the term "supervision" has been
understood.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In one it mean<span style="">s</span> superintending alone or the
oversight of the performance of a thing without power to control or to
direct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">In </span><span style="">the other, the
inspection is coupled with the right to direct or even to annul.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions </span><span style="">of courts in</span><span style=""> the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">United States</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> distinguish between supervision exercised by
an official of a department, and supervision for the purpose of preventing and
punishing abuses, discrimination and so forth."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If by the</span><span style=""> grant of the power of control and
supervision, the Mayor can nullify or set aside what a subordinate ha done in
the performance of his duties, it is evident that he can order the detail of
private respondent to correct or prevent him from committing any abuse in the
performance of his duties; otherwise, said Sections 19 and 32 of the city
charter would just be stale and meaningless provisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The power to detail may
also be gleaned from the fact that Section 20 of the same charter provides</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">that
the Mayor has the power to see to it that executive officers and employees are
properly discharging their respective duties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It should be recalled that the Mayor </span><span style="">issued </span><span style="">the questioned
detail order after he has received reports that <span class="SpellE">Parages</span>'
efficiency is far from satisfactory and had been molesting Chinese
businessmen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in this desire to
gain information of actual facts and closely look at his activities, he ordered
the detail of private respondent to his office.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is no effective way by which the Mayor can see to it that private
respondent properly discharged his duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Furthermore, the same S</span><span style="">ection </span><span style="">20</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">authorizes the Mayor, in </span>the <span style="">interest </span><span style="">of the service, to </span>transfer <span style="">officers and employees from one section, division, service or
department without changing the compensation.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>A transfer is </span>a <span style="">movement
of personnel, more or less permanent in nature, while detail is merely
temporary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the former, the employee
concerned loses position, while in the latter he does </span><span style="">not.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span><span style="">It
would be illogical to hold that a Mayor </span>can <span style="">transfer employees from one station to another--which action involves
permanency and severance of official connection of the trans</span>feree <span style="">with his former position, but cannot order
the detail of the private</span> <span style="">respondent
which is for a more or less brief period, and is therefore only temporary in
character.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">power of the Mayor in
the disposition and transfer of members of the Police Department is not by any
means limited by the provision of Section 90 of the Revised Charter</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
the City of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Cebu</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> which refers expressly to the </span>powers <span style="">and duties of the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> which are thereby enumerated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among such duties is to execute promptly and
faithfully all orders of the Mayor "including assignments and transfers of
personnel."<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 90 of the said
charter, therefore, far from supporting private respondent's claim of
illegality of his</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">detail order issued by the Mayor, expressly
recognizes the latter's powers to make transfer of personnel in the police
department, under the more general grant of power to him under </span><span style="">Section 20 of th</span><span style="">e Charter of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
City which gives him very broad p</span><span style="">ower
</span><span style="">to make transfer of officers and
employees from one section, division, ser­vice or department to another
section, division, service or department without changing the compensation they
receive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The administrative order and circulars cited by private
respondent are totally inapplicable to the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Administrative Order No. 42, Series 1937,
refers to Head of any Department <span style="">or </span>Dependency
of the National Government<span style=""> </span>assigning
any employee outside of the bureau or office, where he is regularly
employed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, they are in the
nature of general laws which cannot prevail over the charter of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cebu</span></st1:place> which is a special law granting the City
Mayor exclusive power of control and supervision over city employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Public service and the practical necessities
o<span style="">f </span>efficient and honest
government demand immediate action from the Mayor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The stability and efficiency of the city
government may be jeopardized if the Mayor has to secure prior approval of the
Com­missioner of Civil Service in order that he may validly detail and closely
supervise an employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As was aptly said
in Pineda vs. Claudio, 28 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 34, it is the local
executive, more than anybody else, who is primarily responsible for <span style="">efficient (and honest) governmental
administration in the</span> <span style="">locality
and the effective maintenance of peace and order therein, and is directly
answerable to the </span>people <span style="">who
elected him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere is this more true
than in the sensitive area of police administration.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Similarly, the case of <span class="SpellE">Lejano</span> vs. Garcia, 109 Phil. 117, which held that an
officer cannot be detailed or transferred even temporarily without his consent
has no application in the instant case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In that case, the transfer of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Lejano</span>
already amounted to removal, for as found by this Court, such transfer was not
a mere temporary assignment but a veritable new appointment which he had
declined, and that respondents had already appointed another to take <span class="SpellE">Lejano's</span> place.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Likewise not in point is
the constitutional provision on security of tenure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A temporary detail is neither removal,
suspension or transfer when made in the interest of public service</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> and absent a showing of manifest abuse of
discre­tion or </span>that <span style="">the detail
is due to some improper motive or purpose.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As found by the respondent court, the
alleged bad faith of the petitioner in ordering the detail of respond­ent to
his office is not clear and the doubt should be re­solved in his favor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, it should also be stressed
that the constitutional provision on removal or suspension except for cause as
provided by law gives in to the fundamental postulate that a public office is a
public trust.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the order of
suspension dated </span><st1:date year="1968" day="16" month="12"><span style="">December 16, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">, We are also constrained to reject the
contention of private respondent that his suspension is invalid because it was
made before the filing of the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For while it is true that the complaint dated December 16, 1968 was
forwarded by the Office of the Mayor and filed before the Police Com­mission
only in the morning of December 17, 1968,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the said suspension order was expressly made
to take effect only upon receipt of the same by petitioner.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It was not shown when petitioner received
said order of suspension, but in all likelihood it must have been not before
the filing of the complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Neither does the filing
of the petition for prohibition and injunction render the suspension order
invalid.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere filing of the petition
did not, <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u>, make the detail order illegal, nor did it
authorize private respondent to ignore the said order, the implementation of
which had not been restrained by the </span>lower <span style="">court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Noteworthy is the fact
that the issuance of the detail order carries with it the </span>presumption <span style="">of regularity.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The suspension order was predicated on his obstinate refusal to
obey the detail, and although the charge involved was denominated by petitioner
as neglect of duty it cannot be doubted that such refusal properly constitutes
grave misconduct which is one of the grounds for suspending an officer under
Section 16 of the <span class="SpellE">Polcom</span> Law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the decision of the lower court dated February
