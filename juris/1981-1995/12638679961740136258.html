				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The twin requirements of notice and hearing are essential
elements of due process in cases of employee dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure to satisfy these requisites has been
recognized to be fatal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This orthodoxy
is not about to be abandoned yet.</p>

<p class="BODY">The paramount question is whether or not the requirements of due
process were substantially complied with in dismissing an employee, after an
inquiry conducted for the purpose of filing a criminal case against another
employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondents contend that
it is sufficient.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner holds
otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision in question pertains to the National Labor Relations
Commission (NLRC, for brevity),<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
promulgated on March 8, 1990, deleting the award of separation pay granted by
the labor arbiter to the herein petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The material facts, as culled from the records of the case, are
as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Norman de Vera was an Assistant Cashier at the Taft
Avenue Branch of the respondent Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI, for
brevity), when he was placed under preventive suspension then subsequently
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By then, he had served the
respondent bank for a total of twenty five (25) years, more or less.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner's predicament started on May 28, 1987, when the
representatives of ASB Realty Corporation (ASB, for brevity) presented to the
BPI Taft Avenue Branch a P10-million RCBC Manager's Check payable to BPI for
the time deposit account of ASB.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
branch manager, Rebecca <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, asked the petitioner
to present the check to the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span> bank for special
clearing, which the latter did.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RCBC
cleared the P10-million check and a Special Clearing receipt was subsequently
issued to the petitioner, which receipt was in turn given to Branch Manager <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and teller Myrna <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span> presented to the petitioner for the latter's
initials three (3) personal checks with a total amount of P1,650,000.00, all
drawn against the account of one Daniel Martinez.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner claims that since he is one of
the validating officers for the encashment of checks, as per bank procedure
requiring two (2) officers to approve transactions of P50,000.00 and above, and
since the said checks had already been <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> under
the orders of <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, his superior, he endorsed
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the
"transaction" was already fait accompli when the petitioner entered
the picture.</p>

<p class="BODY">Afterwards, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> apparently made a
mistake (or slipped) and handed to the petitioner for his signature Time
Certificate of Deposit (TCD, for brevity) No. 119762 with a face value of P10
million.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner asserts that
"he got the shock of his life, became tongue-tied and refused to affix his
signature" after realizing that the said TCD contained his forged
signature.</p>

<p class="BODY">Later that day, <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> entered <span class="SpellE">ASB's</span> check in the computer at the BPI <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>
Boulevard Branch (since the computers at the Taft Avenue Branch were out of
order), not in <span class="SpellE">ASB's</span> account, but instead, in the
account of Daniel Martinez.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, May 29, at around 10:00 o'clock a.m., <span class="SpellE">ASB's</span> representative informed BPI Vice-President Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Nera</span> that ASB had placed a P10-million time deposit with <span class="SpellE">BPI's</span> Taft Avenue Branch.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Vice-President <span class="SpellE">Nera</span> then called the Branch to
verify the transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He talked to the
petitioner who said that it was <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> who had full
knowledge of the transaction, but that <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> had not
yet reported for work at that time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Vice-President <span class="SpellE">Nera</span> then requested for a
return call from <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner later relayed the
Vice-President's request to <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> who allegedly
ignored the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">After office hours, petitioner de Vera, together with BPI Asst.
Manager <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Ventura, informed BPI Asst. Vice
President Gregorio Santayana of the forged signature on the TCD and its
apparent irregular issuance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the 30th of May 1987, a non-working Saturday, a group composed
of the petitioner, Asst. Managers <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> Ventura
and <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Ortiz, and Ret. General <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span>, head of BPI Security, proceeded to the BPI Taft
Avenue Branch and examined its books.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They discovered that the P10-million time deposit of ASB was diverted to
the personal account of Martinez.</p>

<p class="BODY">Several personal and cashier's checks drawn against the account
of Martinez were then intercepted and retrieved, and the remaining balance in
his checking account was frozen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, by then, around P3-million had already been withdrawn, although
this was refuted by the petitioner who argued that since some three (3) checks
amounting to P1.4-million had been "stopped payment", the actual
amount withdrawn was only P1,650,000.00, and not P3-million as claimed by the
respondent bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pending further investigation, allegedly to ascertain the extent
of the loss to the bank, and to pinpoint responsibility of the parties
involved, the petitioner, on June 4, 1987, received a Notice of Preventive
Suspension dated June 2, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the following day, June 5, 1987, the petitioner was queried
regarding the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was
followed by an interview with the Criminal Investigation Service (CIS, for
brevity) on June 8, 1987, when the petitioner was summoned by Ret. General <span class="SpellE">Bueno</span> to give a statement in connection with the <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> case filed by the respondent bank against Daniel
Martinez.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank, in the course of its investigation, also uncovered a
similar pattern of operation which had transpired earlier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On May 5, 1987, the NAFP Retirements and
Separation Benefit System (NAFP-RSBS, for brevity) issued a P4.7-million check
in favor of the respondent bank in consideration of a P5-milion TCD placement
with the Taft Avenue Branch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
P4.7-million was the net of the front end discount of six per centum (6%) of
the face value of the TCD granted by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> to
NAFP-RSBS as an incentive for placing the money with the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it turned out that this was neither
deposited nor credited in the account of NAFP-RSBS, but instead in the account
of a certain <span class="SpellE">Russel</span>, <span class="SpellE">Crame</span>
and Co., Inc. (<span class="SpellE">Russel</span>, for brevity) whose authorized
signer is the same Daniel Martinez.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the time the irregularity was discovered, four (4) checks, all
payable to cash and drawn against the account of <span class="SpellE">Russel</span>,
had already been <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> at the Taft Avenue Branch,
three of which were jointly approved by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> and the
petiÂ­tioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, eleven (11)
other checks drawn against the account of <span class="SpellE">Russel</span>,
four of which had an aggregate amount of P2,578,480.00, were discovered to have
been approved for encashment by <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>, together with
the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must, however, be
noted that nowhere in the records was there an indication that the petitioner
was questioned regarding this anomaly involving the account of the NAFP-RSBS.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 3, 1987, the petitioner received a Notice of
Termination dated July 10, 1987, terminating his services on the ground of
fraud or willful breach of trust and setting forth therein the transgressions
he had allegedly committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aggrieved, the petitioner, on August 6, 1987, commenced this
proceeding by filing a case with the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On December 7, 1988, Labor Arbiter Evangeline <span class="SpellE">Lubaton</span>
rendered a decision on the sole basis of the pleadings presented and the
evidence attached thereto, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of
which is quoted hereunder, a savoir:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
ordering the Bank of the Philippine Islands to pay Norman M. de Vera separation
pay according to bank policy, or in the absence thereof, equivalent to one-half
month pay for every year of service plus all other benefits, privileges and
emoluments he may have been entitled to at the time of his termination from his
employment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The claims for moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees and
costs of suit are hereby dismissed for lack of merit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent bank, not satisfied with the labor arbiter's
decision, interposed an appeal with the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Second Division of the NLRC then promulgated a resolution on March
8, 1990, holding that the requirements of due process were substantially
complied with and accordingly, deleted the award of separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's subsequent motion for
reconsideration was later denied by another resolution.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
These resolutions are now assailed in this special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner basically contends that the respondent NLRC
committed a grave abuse of discretion in holding that his dismissal had indicia
of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also claims that he
is entitled to reinstatement or separation pay, plus full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and all other benefits, in either case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He stresses that while it is true that he was interviewed and later
summoned by the CIS to give sworn statements in connection with the anomalous
transaction, he was not aware that he was already being indicted and tried for
an offense of which he was never informed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To support his contentions on due process, the petitioner cited Sections
1 to 6 of Rule XIV, Book V of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
which lay down the procedure taken in cases of termination of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the respondent bank posits that the Notice of
Preventive Suspension received by the petitioner was sufficient notice since
the tenor of the letter itself should have already alerted the latter that the
investigaÂ­tion then being conducted was partly being done to determine the
extent of the latter's involvement in the anomalies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it would have been unlikely for
a person not suspected of involvement in the anomalies to be suspended pending
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the petitioner
was suspected of complicity in the swindle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And if the Notice of Preventive Suspension was not sufficient notice,
certainly the subsequent interviews should have placed the petitioner on notice
that he was suspected of possible involvement in the swindle.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent NLRC likewise contends that it is "hard to
believe that a person with the education and position as that of the
complainant (herein petitioner) after having gone through rigorous
interrogations would still fail to convince himself of being suspected and
investigated for possible complicity in the respondent bank's swindle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, his answers to the questions then
propounded or his explanation given thereto were all in defense or designed to
show his innocence or non-connection with the culprits."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents also submit that the petitioner was given ample
opportunity to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
was allowed to explain his side when he was questioned on June 5, 1987
regarding the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Three days
later, he was given another opportunity when he was summoned by the CIS.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent further claims that "what the due
process clause of the Constitution proscribes is the total absence of the
chance to be heard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a party was not
initially given a chance to be heard (i.e., at the level of a school panel of
investigators) but later was given full opportunity to present his case and
arguments (i.e., before the arbitration branch of the NLRC), this defect is
cured."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the respondents submit that the petitioner is not
deserving of the reinstatement prayed for nor of any award for separation
pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They contend that the petitioner
"had deliberately shied away from performing the legal and moral duty of
reporting peremptorily [sic] the anomaly to his employer, an act of
indiscretion of the highest order, or, better still, a deliberate omission or
prevarication which undoubtedly makes him unworthy of being awarded the bonanza
of separation pay.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A contrary ruling
would have the net effect of rewarding the complainant for betraying the
interest of his employer."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court rules that the petitioner, Norman de Vera, was denied
due process of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, his
dismissal is hereby declared illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents' submissions that the Notice of Preventive
Suspension is adequate notice and the subsequent interviews ample opportunities
to be heard are devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have
laid down in <span class="SpellE"><b>Ruffy</b></span><b> v. NLRC</b><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and in <span class="SpellE"><b>Tingson</b></span><b> v. NLRC</b><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
the procedure to be observed by an employer who seeks to dismiss an
employee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once more, we quote the Labor
Code:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>HOWEVER,
THE EMPLOYER SHALL FURNISH THE WORKER WHOSE EMPLOYMENT IS SOUGHT TO BE
TERMINATED A WRITTEN NOTICE CONTAINING A STATEMENT OF THE CAUSES FOR
TERMINATION AND SHALL AFFORD THE LATTER AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD AND
DEFEND HIMSELF WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS REPRESENTATIVE IF HE SO DESIRES IN
ACCORDANCE WITH COMPANY RULES AND REGULATIONS PROMULGATED PURSUANT TO
GUIDELINES SET BY THE MINISTRY OF LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">These requirements of notice and hearing
are recited anew in the rules implementing the above-cited provision, <b>supra</b>,
as correctly pointed out by the petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Definitely, the Notice of Preventive Suspension can not be considered
adequate notice since the objectives of the petitioner's preventive suspension,
as stated in the notice, were merely to ascertain the extent of the loss to the
bank, and to pinpoint responsibility of the parties involved, and not to apprise
the petitioner of the causes of his desired dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the subsequent interview is not the
"ample opportunity to be heard" contemplated by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ample opportunity to be heard is especially
accorded to the employee sought to be dismissed after he is informed of the
charges against him in order to give him an opportunity to refute the
accusations <span class="SpellE">levelled</span> against him, and it certainly
does not consist of an inquiry conducted merely for the purpose of filing a
criminal case against another person.</p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the respondents' position that the petitioner, with
his education and position, should have realized, after going through some
rigorous interrogations, that he himself was being suspected and investigated
for possible complicity in the anomalies is unacceptable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner as an assistant cashier is not
expected to be proficient with the intricacies of law and procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should not be faulted if he relied on the
statement of the private respondent that the investigation was being conducted
in connection with the criminal case filed against Martinez, and consequently
failed to realize that he himself was being suspected for possible involvement
in the fraud.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the private
respondent should be admonished for provoking self-incriminating statements
from the petitioner under the guise of conducting an investigation for some
other reason.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, this Court has repeatedly held that the employer is
mandated to furnish the employee sought to be dismissed two notices, the written
charge, and the notice of dismissal, if, after hearing, dismissal is indeed
warranted.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
No written charge was ever furnished the petitioner in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents then claim that the alleged defects in due
process were cured when the petitioner presented his case and arguments before
the NLRC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case before the NLRC is the petitioner's
complaint for illegal dismissal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that
time, he had already been terminated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>What the Labor Code sets forth is the procedure prior to dismissal.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
"Fire the employee, and let him explain later" is not in accord with
the due process under the law.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We can not accept claims of "a wider latitude of
discretion"<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
of management in the discipline of managerial employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, management's discretion is subject to
the requirements of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we held, "loss of confidence", as a ground for
dismissal, must rest on "some basis".<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Here, none has been established, for the plain reason that the petitioner was
never investigated or heard in his defense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It can not be said therefore that he is guilty--to justify management's
claim of loss of trust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To that extent,
this case must be distinguished from <b>PLDT v. NLRC,</b><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
where "theft" was established clearly and convincingly and no
question of due process was involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due process, as we also held,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
is applicable to managerial employees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the absence thereof, any dismissal becomes unlawful and reinstatement
plus <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> are warranted.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The RESOLUTION of the public respondent is
hereby ANNULLED and SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
private respondent is ORDERED to REINSTATE petitioner NORMAN DE VERA to his
