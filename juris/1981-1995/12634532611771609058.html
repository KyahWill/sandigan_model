what court has jurisdiction over criminal prosecutions for simple seduction.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=GramE>In G.R. No.</span> L-38579, Judge Pedro A. <span
class=SpellE>Revilla</span> of the Court of First Instance of <span
class=SpellE>Rizal</span> ruled that the crime of simple seduction is within
the original jurisdiction of the municipal court.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He, therefore, dismissed the petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
prohibition, and <i>mandamus</i> with preliminary injunction which sought to
enjoin the Municipal Court of <span class=SpellE>Parañaque</span> from proceeding
with the trial of Criminal Case No. 35936.</p>

<p class=BODY><span class=GramE>In G.R. No.</span> L-39951, respondent <span

of the Court of First Instance of <span class=GramE>Manila,</span> dismissed
Criminal Case No. 17765 for seduction and ordered the Fiscal to file the case
with the &quot;proper&quot; court.</p>

<p class=BODY>In <span class=SpellE><u>Luansing</u></span><u> v. Court of
Appeals</u> (27 SCRA 305), <span class=GramE>We</span> ruled:</p>

<blockquote><span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>&quot;x
</span><span class=SpellE>x</span> <span class=SpellE>x</span> The penalty
imposed by Article 338 of the Revised Penal Code for the crime of simple
seduction is <span class=SpellE>arresto</span> mayor, the duration of which is
from one month and one day to six months.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span>Apparently, the crime of simple seduction falls under the original jurisdiction
of the Justice of the Peace or Municipal Courts. <span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'> </span>However, it should not be overlooked that
persons guilty of seduction shall also be sentenced to indemnify the offended
woman, to acknowledge the offspring unless the law should prevent him from so
doing, and to give support to such offspring (Article 345, Revised Penal
Code).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>These are inherent accessory
civil liabilities when a child is born as a result of the crime.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The acknowledgment of, and the giving of
support to, the offspring are matters beyond the jurisdiction of the Justice of
the Peace or Municipal Courts.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>They </span>pertain to the Courts of First
Instance (Section 44 [a]<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt'> </span>and
[e], Republic Act No. 296).<span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>&quot;It has been held that laws conferring jurisdiction on the
inferior courts over demands below certain amounts do not preclude a
determination of said demands in the superior court, where they are connected
with larger claims or with a type of demand solely within the jurisdiction of
the superior court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Thus for instance,
where an action is within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance
because it involves an issue of admiralty, the said court must be held likewise
to have jurisdiction over other causes of action joined thereto even if the
amount <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>sought to be collected is less
than the jurisdictional limit (Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. vs. <span

 27, 1867</span></st1:date><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>).<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In like manner, since the crime of seduction
carries with it a liability, under Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code, to acknowledge
and give support to the offspring resulting from the crime-matters beyond
jurisdiction of the Justice of the Peace or Municipal Courts-it follows that
the instant case falls within the jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance
(U.S. vs. Bernardo, 19 Phil. 265).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It
would be absurd to have the principal case of seduction tried and decided by
the Municipal Court and the resulting acknowledgment and support of the offspring
by the Court of First Instance.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The
duplication would entail unnecessary waste of time and effort for the parties
and for the courts, to the detriment of an orderly administration of
justice.&quot;</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>The respondent courts took cognizance of the <span class=SpellE><u>Luansing</u></span>
ruling.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>However, the Court of First
Instance of <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span> observed that in Criminal Case No.
35396, the issue of acknowledgment of offspring and support was already out of
the question.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Court of First Instance of <span class=SpellE>Rizal</span>

<p class=BODY>The Court of First Instance of Manila added that &quot;the case
at bar may also provide a <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>propitious
occasion </span>for our Supreme Court to review and re-examine those rulings in
view of the enlargement of jurisdiction of the municipal courts and city courts
since those cases were decided.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic'>We
</span>have carefully considered the arguments and reasons given by the
respondent judges in these cases but find no reasons to warrant <span

style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'> </span>Appeals.</p>

<p class=BODY>In criminal prosecutions, the jurisdiction of the court is not
determined by what may be meted out to the offender after trial (People v. <span
class=SpellE>Cuello</span>, 1 SCRA 814), or even by the result of the evidence
that would be presented during the trial (People v. Co <span class=SpellE>Hiok</span>,
62 Phil. 503), but by the extent of the penalty which the law imposes, together
with other legal obligations, on the basis of the facts as recited in the
complaint or information (People v. <span class=SpellE>Purisima</span>, 69 SCRA
341, 347) constitutive of the offense charged, for once jurisdiction is
acquired by the court in which the information is filed, it is there retained
regardless of whether the evidence proves a lesser offense than that charged in
the information (People v. Mission, <span style='mso-bidi-font-weight:bold'>48 </span>O.G.
1330), or the subsequent happening of events, although of a character which
would have prevented jurisdiction from attaching in the first <span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>instance (Ramos </span>v. Central Bank, 41
SCRA 565, 583).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The above rulings were
reiterated in the fairly recent case of <u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt'>People v. <span class=SpellE>Buissan</span></span></u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'> </span>(105 <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt'>SCRA 547) where this Court </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt'>stated
that </span><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt'>jurisdiction over a simple
seduction case lies with the Court of First Instance and not with the inferior
court, notwithstanding the fact alleged in the private respondent's answer that
the complainant gave birth to a child some eighteen months after the alleged
commission of sexual intercourse in the simple seduction case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>The jurisdiction of a court depends upon the state of facts
existing at the time it is invoked, and if the jurisdiction once attaches to
the person and subject matter of the litigation, the subsequent happening of
events, although they are of such a character as would have prevented
jurisdiction from attaching in the first instance, will not operate to oust
jurisdiction already attached.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span
class=GramE>(<span class=SpellE>Tinitigan</span> v. <span class=SpellE>Tinitigan</span>,
Sr., 100 SCRA 619, 634.)</span></p>

<p class=BODY><span class=GramE>The court in G.R. No.</span> L-39951 contended
that a separate case for acknowledgment must be filed with the Juvenile and
Domestic Relations Court even as the seduction case should be tried by the City
Court of Manila.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>There is no merit in
this contention.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The indemnification,
acknowledgment, and support provided by Article 345 of the Revised Penal Code
are civil liabi­lities <u>inherent and accessory</u> to the finding of guilt in
rape, seduction, or abduction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>It would
be needless multiplication of suits to bring to another court a liability
already beyond dispute because of a judgment of conviction in another
court.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Furthermore, the charter of the
Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of Manila, Republic Act No. 1401 clearly
provides in Sec. 38-A which stated the exclusive original jurisdiction of said
court that &quot;if any question involving any of the above matters (falling
under the court's jurisdiction) should arise as an incident in any case pending
in the ordinary courts, said incident shall be determined in the main
case.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Considerations of consistency and orderliness have led this Court
to rule as early as 1911 that a justice of the peace court is divested of
jurisdiction over a case for simple seduction.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'> 
</span><st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region> v.
Bernardo, 19 Phil. 265).<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The law on
criminal jurisdiction must be as certain and predictable as possible.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Judges, fiscals, and accused alike should not
be made to speculate on whether or not an offspring may still arise from the
crime, whether or not the complainant or the accused may be sterile or
incapable of procreation, whether or not the complainant was already pregnant
by another man when the crime was committed, and various other factual
considerations before jurisdiction may be fixed.</p>

<p class=BODY>The value of the doctrine of stare <span class=SpellE>decisis</span>
- to stand by decisions and not disturb settled matters - is best exemplified
when lower courts believe that a doctrine should be re-examined but nonetheless
apply it.</p>
