towards and in front of the tricycle cab, holding his M-16 rifle in his right
hand, not noticing that the rifle's safety lever was on “semi-automatic” (and
not on "safety").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
accidentally touched the trigger, firing a single shot in the process and
hitting Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>, then still sitting in the cab,
in the left lower abdomen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Sergeant
did not apparently realize immediately that he had been hit; he took three (3)
steps forward, cried that he had been hit and fell to the ground.</p>

shooting and there talked with the wounded Sergeant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter confirmed to Capt. <span class="SpellE">Besas</span> that he had indeed been accidentally shot by <span class="SpellE">Dft</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> was

<p class="BODY">An investigation conducted by H.Q., 14<u><sup>th</sup></u>
Infantry Battalion on <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="8">11 August 1985</st1:date>

On 19 November 1985, a "Line of Duty Board of Officers" was convened
by H.Q., 14<sup>th</sup> Infantry Battalion, "to determine Line of Duty
Status of [the] late Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lemick</span> <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>
640407 (Inf.) PA, a member of "A" Co., 14IB, 5ID, PA who died x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> due to Gun Shot Wound as a
result of an accidental fire (sic) committed by <span class="SpellE">Dft</span>. <span class="SpellE">Nicomedes</span> <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span> 085-5009 (<span class="SpellE">Inf</span>) PA x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
After receiving and deliberating on the Investigation Report dated <st1:date year="1985" day="11" month="8">11 August 1985</st1:date> together with the
sworn statements of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span>, <span class="SpellE">Clavo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Besas</span>, and after some
further questioning of Capt. <span class="SpellE">Besas</span>, the Line of Duty
Board reached the following conclusion and recommendation:</p>

<blockquote>"Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> was then the
designated Detachment Commander of <span class="SpellE">Capintalan</span>
detachment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On or about 011300H August
1985 <span class="SpellE">Dft</span> <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span> invited
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> and Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Clavo</span>
to his home to celebrate at <span class="SpellE">Aritao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They asked permission to go on overnight and
to allow them to carry their firearms with them because the place where they
were going is critical.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were given
such permission verbally by their Commanding Officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The death of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>
was purely accidental as the Investigation Report presented here proved beyond
reasonable [doubt] the fact that <span class="SpellE">Dft</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span> had no grudge either [against] Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Clavo</span> or Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The recommendation written by the Chairman and unanimously voted
for by the members contain the following:</blockquote>

declares that the Death of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lemick</span> <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> 640407 (<span class="SpellE">Inf</span>) PA is <u>in
Line of Duty</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Board recommend further that all benefits due the legal
dependents of the late Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lemick</span> <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> be given."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in March 1986, petitioner filed his claim for
compensation benefits under P.D. No. 626 (as amended), claiming that the death
of his son was work-connected and therefore compensable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was denied<a style="mso-footnote-id:

by the GSIS on the ground that petitioner's son was not at his work place nor
performing his duty as a soldier of the Philippine Army at the time of his
death.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration which Motion was,
however, denied by the GSIS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This denial
was confirmed by the Workmen's Compensation Commission ("WCC") in a
Decision dated 24 May 1988 which stated that:</p>

therein [we found it] very difficult for us to perceive where the
work-connection of the events that led to appellant's son's death lies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the law, death resulting from injury is
considered compensable if it arise out of and in the course of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Definitely, <u>the death of <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> did not arise out of employment</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the facts showed that <u>he was not

<p class="BODY">The sole issue to be resolved in this case is whether or not the
death of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Lemick</span> <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>
is compensable under the applicable statute and regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> died on <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="8">7 August 1985</st1:date>, the applicable law is to
be found in Book Four, Title III of the Labor Code, as amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be noted at the outset that under
Article 167 (g) of the Labor Code, as amended and Section 4 (b) (1) of Rule I
of the Amended (Implementing) Rules on Employees' Compensation, the term
"employee" includes a "member of the Armed Forces of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
Rule XIII entitled "Death”, of the Amended (Implementing) Rules provides
in part as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Conditions
to Entitlement</u>. -- (a) The beneficiaries of a deceased employee shall be
entitled to an income benefit if all of the following conditions are satisfied:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employee had been
duly reported to the System;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He died as a result of
injury or sickness; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The System has been
duly notified of his death, as well as the injury or sickness which caused his
death.</blockquote>

<blockquote>His employer shall be liable for the benefit if such death occurred
before the employee is duly reported for coverage of the System.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Article 167 (k) of the Labor Code as amended
defines a compensable "injury" quite simply as "any harmful
change in the human organism from any accident <u>arising out of and in the
course of the employment</u>.” The Amended (Implementing) Rules have, however,
elaborated considerably on the simple and succinct statutory provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rule III, Section 1 (a) reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Grounds</u>.
-- (a) For the injury and the resulting disability or death to be compensable,
the injury must be the result of an employment accident satisfying all of the

been injured <u>at the place where his work requires him to be;<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employee must have
been <u>performing his official functions</u>; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the injury is
sustained elsewhere, the employee must have been <u>executing an order for the
employer.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Underscoring

<p class="BODY">It will be seen that because the Amended (Implementing) Rules are
intended to apply to all kinds of employment, such rules must be read and
applied with reasonable flexibility and comprehensiveness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The concept of a "work place"
referred to in Ground 1, for instance, cannot always be literally applied to a
soldier on active duty status, as if he were a machine operator or a worker in
an assembly line in a factory or a clerk in a particular fixed office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously, a soldier must go where his
company is stationed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant
case, <span class="SpellE">Aritao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span> was not, of course, <span class="SpellE">Carranglan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, <span class="SpellE">Aritao</span> being approximately 1-1/2 hours away from the latter
by public transportation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>, Cpl. <span class="SpellE">Clavo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Dft</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span> had permission from
their Commanding Officer to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Aritao</span>, and it
appears to us that a place which soldiers have secured lawful <u>permission</u>
to be at cannot be very different, legally speaking, from a place where they
are <u>required</u> to go by their commanding officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note that the three (3) soldiers were on
an overnight pass which, notably, they did not utilize in full.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were <u>not</u> on vacation leave.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Morever</span>, the were
required or authorized to carry their firearms with which presumably they were
to defend themselves if NPA elements happened to attack them while en route to
and from <span class="SpellE">Aritao</span> or with which to attack and seek to
capture such NPA elements as they might encounter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, if the three (3) soldiers had in fact
encountered <span class="SpellE">NPAs</span> while on their way to or from <span class="SpellE">Aritao</span> and been fired upon by them and if Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> had been killed by an NPA bullet, we do not
believe that respondent GSIS would have had any difficulty in holding the death
a compensable one.</p>

<p class="BODY">Turning to the question of whether Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>
was performing official functions at the time he sustained the gunshot wound,
it has already been pointed out above that the Line of Duty Board of Officers
of the 14<u><sup>th</sup></u> Infantry Battalion Headquarters had already
determined that the death of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> had
occurred "in line of duty." It may be noted in this connection that a
soldier on active duty status is really on 24 hours a day official duty status
and is subject to military discipline and military law 24 hours a day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is subject to call and to the orders of
his superior officers at all times, 7 days a week, except, of course, when he
is on vacation leave status (which Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> was
not).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, we think that the
work-connected character of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin's</span> injury
and death was not effectively precluded by the simple circumstance that he was
on an overnight pass to go to the home of <span class="SpellE">Dft</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span>, a soldier under his own command.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span> did
not effectively cease performing "official functions" because he was
granted a pass.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While going to a fellow
soldier's home for a few hours for a meal and some drinks was not a specific <u>military</u>
duty, he was nonetheless in the course of performance of official
functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, it appears to us that
a soldier should be presumed to be on official duty unless he is shown to have
clearly and unequivocally put aside that status or condition temporarily by,
e.g., going on an approved vacation leave.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">7</span></span></a> Even vacation leave may, it should
be remembered, be <span class="SpellE">preterminated</span> by superior orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">More generally, a soldier in the Armed Forces must accept certain
risks, for instance, that he will be fired upon by forces hostile to the State
or the Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is not, of
course, the only risk that he is compelled to accept by the very nature of his
occupation or profession as a soldier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Most of the persons around him are necessarily also members of the Armed
Forces who carry firearms, too.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other
words, a soldier must also assume the risk of being accidentally fired upon by
his fellow soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is reasonably
regarded as a hazard or risk inherent in his employment as a soldier.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold, therefore, that the death of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Hinoguin</span>
that resulted from his being hit by an accidental discharge of the M-16 of <span class="SpellE">Dft</span>. <span class="SpellE">Alibuyog</span>, in the
circumstances of this case, arose out of and in the course of his employment as
a soldier on active duty status in the Armed Forces of the Philippines and
hence compensable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be well to add that what we have written above in respect
of performance of official functions of members of the Armed Forces must be
understood in the context of the specific purpose at hand, that is, the
interpretation and application of the compensation provisions of the Labor Code
and applicable related regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is commonplace that those provisions should, to the extent possible, be given
the interpretation most likely to effectuate the beneficent and humanitarian
purposes infusing the Labor Code.</p>
