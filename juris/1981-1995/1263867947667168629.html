happened on June 4, 1987 and June 5, 1987 and not on June 4, 1989 and June 5,
1989, as reflected in the original <span class="SpellE">informations</span> due

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SO ORDERED.”</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> version of the
facts of this case was summarized by the trial court, as follows (pp. 21-22, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On June 3, 1987, Rowena <span class="SpellE">lbañez</span>,
who was living with her <span style="">aunt </span>was
fetched her mother, Lilia <span class="SpellE">Hije</span>, and was brought to <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Silang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City to stay with the rest of her brother and
sisters at the house of the common-law husband of her mother, the herein
accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On that same day, their mother went to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> to work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At early dawn, between 4:00 to 5:00 in the morning of the following day,
when their brother Ron-<span class="SpellE">ron</span> went out to sell bread ‘<span class="SpellE">pandesal</span>’, the accused placed himself on top of Rowena
while poking a knife ‘<span class="SpellE">pisaw</span>’ at her neck; that he
took off her panty and inserted his private part into her private part and
started pumping, moving his body up and down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When she went to urinate, she noticed a yellowish sticky mucous-like
fluid attached to her panty and her private part was slippery when washed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was repeatedly raped in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span></st1:place></st1:city>, until (sic) when her
mother stopped working and stayed at the house since the latter got
pregnant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rowena further testified that she
saw how her sister <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span>
was raped <span style="">by </span>the accused; that
she even begged to spare her since she was still very young but accused did not
heed nor listen to her; <span class="SpellE">afterwhich</span> (sic), both
sisters just talked and cried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused used to spank Rowena and oftentimes scolded (sic) without any reason at
all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these she kept to herself, for
fear that once she told it to her mother they would all be killed as threaten
(sic) by the accused, until one day while she w<span style="">as </span>at the custody of her aunt in Project 3, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City when she related to her aunt her <span style="">sad
</span>experiences.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The other complainant, <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span> was then seven (7) years old when her stepfather
sexually abused her in the presence <span style="">of </span>her
sister, Rowena, who was begging for mercy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rape first happened on June 5, 1987, the accused, while naked lie
down <span style="">(sic) </span>on top of her, holding
a knife ‘<span class="SpellE">pisaw</span>’ poked at her neck; then he started to
undress her and inserted his private part inside her private part and started
pumping, <span class="SpellE">afterwhich</span> (sic) her private part ached;
that this was done to her twice in <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> <span class="SpellE">Silang</span> and once in <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">She
also </span>testified that she saw how her sister Rowena was raped by the
accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“<span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span>,
the aunt of both complainants, testified that it w<span style="">as </span>on May 8, 1989 when she visited them at <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> and upon
arrival, Rowena insisted <span style="">that </span>she
go with her to Project <span style="">3, </span><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City; at first, she refused however when her mother
gave assent, she brought Rowena along with her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A few days later, she went back to <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, this time, she took Rosalie, another sister and <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they
were staying in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>,
Rowena <span style="">told </span>her about the <span class="GramE">rape, that</span> she couldn’t tell her mother since the accused
threatened to kill them; that <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> was raped three
times and whenever accused feels the urge, he would order the complainants to
play with his private parts during his rest time at <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon <span class="GramE">advise</span> of her brothers, she sought help from <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A complaint was filed before the Special Operations Group

respective sworn statements were taken, and immediately CIS men from the
Special Operations Group conducted the investigation and arrested the accused
on August 4<span style="">, </span>1989 at St.
Catherine St., Provident Village, <span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant’s different account of the facts of this
case was also summarized by the trial court, as follows (p. 23, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):</p>

<blockquote>“The defense presented Lilia <span class="SpellE">Hije</span>, the
mother of the two complainants and she testified on the controversy over the
house in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>,
which is allegedly owned by her and presently occupied by <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span>
<span class="SpellE">Romualdo</span>, that it was the cause why such complaints
were filed and that her children were being brain-washed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The accused adduced that he met Lilia <span class="SpellE">Hije</span>
on <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="8">August 9, 1987</st1:date>, and that
after a lapse of one week they lived together.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="11">November 1, 1987</st1:date>,
they moved to <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
due to misunderstanding between his mother and his wife; that the children had
to stop schooling because of such transfer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There were occasions that he had to whip Rowena, since she kept on
fighting back and became hard to discipline.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He denied having raped the complainants and asserted that such complaints
were filed based on a personal grudge against him.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, the trial court
convicted the accused-appellant of rape in both cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the present appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused-appellant
assigns as errors committed by the trial court the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) it allowed the amendment of the <span class="SpellE">informations</span> after he had pleaded not guilty to the
original <span class="SpellE">informations</span>; 2) it found that the evidence
for the prosecution is sufficient to establish his guilt; 3) it found that the
victims testified in a logical manner; 4) it found that there was absence of
motive on the part of the victims in testifying against him; and 5) it did not
give weight to his evidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the first
assignment of error, the accused-appellant alleges that when the trial court
allowed the amendment of the <span class="SpellE">informations</span>, he should
have been re-arraigned under th</span><span style="">e</span><span style=""> amended <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
and evidence adduced anew.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch as
the trial court </span>failed to do so, he was denied due process of law.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the rest of the assignment of errors, the
accused-appellant alleges simply that the prosecution’s evidence suffers from
inconsistencies and improbabilities, namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>1) in Criminal Case No. 33326:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>a)
<span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span> was only
seven (7) years old on the alleged date of the rape incident whereas he
(accused-appellant) was twenty five (25) years old, therefore, she should have
suffered heavy damage on her sexual organ but Exhibit <span style="">E </span>showed only a shallow laceration; and b) her testimony that
after she was <span style="">raped, he
(accused-appellant) went back to sleep indicates that he has not done anything
wrong; and 2) in Criminal Case No. 33327:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a) Rowena <span class="SpellE">lbañez</span>’ testimony that he
(accused-appellant) was able to insert his private part into her private part
is contradicted by the testimony of Dr. Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Aranas</span>
who stated that at the time of Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>’
physical examination, she was still a virgin, which fact is embodied in the
medical report; b) her testimony that the rape took place inside a one-room hut
which accommodates only about six (6) persons who sleep side by side and that
she was in-between her older brother and <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> </span><span style="">who </span><span style="">was then awake, renders improbable the commission of the crime; and c) <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio’s</span> testimony
that after raping Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>, he
(accused-appellant) went back to sleep is not a natural reaction of one who has
just committed a heinous crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appeal lacks merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It has not escaped the attention of the Court that when a party
either aims at winning <span class="GramE">Our</span> compassion or runs out of
arguments (or never had any to begin with), he usually adopts the stratagem of
pleading denial of due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The plea
may impress at first glance, what with all its plaintive invocation of the Bill
of Rights, but it does not often succeed upon closer examination especially
after considering the contentions of the opponent (see Bautista, et al. <span style="">v. </span>Hon. Secretary o<span style="">f </span>Labor and Employment, et al., G.R.
No. 81374, <st1:date year="1991" day="30" month="4">April 30, 1991</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The observations made by the Solicitor
General, which conform <span class="GramE">with</span> the records of this case,
convinced Us to ignore said plea of the accused-appellant (pp. 80-81, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>“Appellant <span style="">is </span>now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from objecting to the amendment of the complaints
(<span class="SpellE">informations</span>) because he has already (sic) waived
such objection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that
while appellant’s counsel made an initial objection to the motion of the fiscal
to amend the complaints (<span class="SpellE">informations</span>), on the ground
that the amendment is substantial (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, 8/31/89, p.
16), the said objection however was not pursued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If appellant really believes (sic) that the
lower court committed error in allowing the amendment of the complaints (<span class="SpellE">informations</span>) but (sic) without re-arraigning appellant
anew, why did he not raise that issue early on before the appellate Court in a
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, for example?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, appellant not only kept silent afterwards about his
alleged objection, but he also participated actively during the rest of the
trial of the cases after the amendment was effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, appellant’s counsel even cross-examined
the complainants regarding certain circumstances which happened on the amended
dates of the incidents, or on June 4 and 5, 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, appellant himself testified as to
his whereabouts in June 1987, to establish his alibi that he could not have
committed the crimes charged <span style="">on </span>June
4 and 5, 1987.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these facts
indubitably show that the amendment of the complaints (<span class="SpellE">informations</span>)
did not prejudice nor violate appellant’s right to due process.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Medico-Legal examinations which revealed “shallow, healed
laceration at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5 o’clock</st1:time>” (Exhibit
“E”) of the hymen, in the case of <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span> and “in virgin state physically” (Exhibit “D”),
in the case of Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> do not negate the fact
established by the prosecution’s evidence that they were raped by the
accused-appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the crime of rape,
complete or full penetration of the complainant’s private part is not
necessary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is the <span style="">rupture </span>of the hymen essential.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is fundamental is that the entrance, or
at least, the introduction of the male organ into the labia of the pudendum is
proved (People v. Castillo, G.R. No. 84310, May 29, 1991 citing People v. Cruz,
G.R. No. 82121, December 29, 1989, 180 SCRA 765 and People v. <span class="SpellE">Basas</span>, G.R.

</span>Within the level of their understanding, Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span>
described to the court the manner by which the accused-appellant fulfilled his
savage desire on them:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It is possible that the accused-appellant
was not able to make a total penetration of the sexual organs of the
complainants due to the latter’s youth (Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>
was then 12 years old whereas <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span> was then 7 years old) when the rape was
committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rape can be committed inside a house or a small space where there
are other occupants (People v. <span class="SpellE">Indaya</span>, G.R. No.

is no respecter of place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears
that Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>’ testimony that her older brother
was sleeping beside her at the time of the commission of the rape was only her
impression.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Solicitor
General that considering the circumstance that Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>
was roused from her sleep by the accused-appellant (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
September 1, 1989, pp. 5-6) who even made threats on her life by poking a knife
on her neck (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, August 31, 1989, pp. 14, 18; <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, September 1, 1989, pp. 8, 10) she could not have
observed accurately the persons who were beside her at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable that Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> failed to realize that at the time of the rape, her
older brother was not actually in the house.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span>,
who witnessed the rape committed against Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>,
their older brother was not present at that time because he already left to
sell <span class="SpellE"><u>pandesal</u></span> (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1989</st1:date>, pp. 11, 16).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span> was awake at the time Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>
was being raped by the accused-appellant, she was a helpless witness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We take into account the following
circumstances which rendered <span class="SpellE">Queenie</span> <span class="SpellE">Artificio</span> subservient to the accused-appellant’s excessive
sexual appetite:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>her age, the moral
ascendancy of the accused-appellant, the threats that he will kill her should
she report the incident (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, October 13, 1989, p. 3)
and a knife was poked on the right side of Rowena <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span>’
neck (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, October 12, 1989, p. 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of complainants that after they were raped by the
accused-appellant, the latter went back to sleep is not <span style="">difficult </span>to believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused?appellant must have felt safe in the thought that he had
succeeded in instilling fear in the hearts of both <span class="GramE">complainants,
that</span> is why he did not bother to escape.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the guilt of the accused-appellant for the crime of
rape in both cases has been proven beyond reasonable doubt and, therefore,
sustain his conviction based on the same ratiocination of the trial court which
stands on its owns merits (pp. 23-26, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="">):</span></p>

<blockquote>“In determining the guilt or innocence of the accused, the Court
made use of the following well-known principles regarding prosecution of rape
cases, to wit: </blockquote>

<blockquote>“a) <span class="GramE">That</span> the accusation for rape can be made with facility; it
is difficult to prove it but more difficult for the person accused, though
innocent to disprove it;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b) That in view of
the intrinsic nature of the crime of rape where only two persons are usually
involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme
caution; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“c) That the
evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own merits, and cannot
be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the evidence for the defense
[People vs. Quintal, 125 SCRA 734 (1983); People vs. <span class="SpellE">Villarosa</span>,
161 SCRA 72 (1988)].</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As to the first quoted principle, the Court believes that although
one could charge without much difficulty a person of the crime of rape however,
for her to substantiate her charge right before the eyes of the Court is not
only a delicate and sensitive task but also scandalous and humiliating as well.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The Court noted that both complainants despite their tender age
testified in a logical and straight forward manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They sounded sincere and appeared candid and
honest not only while at the witness stand but also while in the courtroom
attending the proceedings of this Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Both complainants identified the person who raped them in a solid and
convincing manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, they could
not possibly commit a mistake of identity <span style="">as
</span>to the person of the accused because the latter was intimately related
to their mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘What is decisive in
rape cases is complainant identified the accused.’ <span class="GramE">[People <span style="">vs. </span><span class="SpellE">Romilo</span>,
146 SCRA 258 (1986)].</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Moreover, in the absence of malicious motive on the part of the
complainants to falsely charge accused of this grave offense, the presumption
is that they were not actuated by improper motive and consequently their
testimonies are entitled to full faith and credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘Unless motivated by her desire to bring to
justice the culprit who had grievously wrong (sic) her, it is hard to believe <span class="SpellE">thata</span> (sic) woman of unsullied reputation (sic) to publicly
disclosed (sic) that she has been raped’ (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Gargoles</span>,
83 SCRA 282 (1978)]; ‘Complainant’s willingness and courage to face
interrogation and judicial examination is a mute and eloquent testimony of the
truth of her charge against her father’ [People vs. Ramos, 167 SCRA 476
(1988)].</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The contention of the accused that the charges were precipitated
by the feeling of resentment the complainants are <span class="SpellE">harbouring</span>
against him aggravated by the misunderstanding between the mother of the
complainants and the sister of the complainants’ mother, who is now the present
(sic) guardian of the complainants, is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it was (sic) true that the mother and the
aunt of the complainants are fighting for their respective interests regarding
a house, the expected reaction <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> is for the
complainants to side with their mother.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Further, evidence to be credible must not be inconsistent with
human experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘Evidence must not
only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it’ must be credible in
itself such as common experience and observation of mankind can approve as
probable under the circumstances’ [People vs. <span class="SpellE">Patog</span>,
144 SCRA 429 (1986)].</blockquote>

<blockquote>“With<span style=""> </span>regard to the second
quoted principle, the rule is that the presence of an eyewitness to corroborate
the testimony of complainant can be dispensed with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, complainants’ sole testimony if
positive and credible is sufficient to justify conviction therefore with more
reasons (sic) that the testimony of complainants herein be given weight because
each of them corroborated each other’s testimony in a believable and convincing
manner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here it must be noted that the
presence of Rowena when <span class="SpellE">Queenue</span> (sic) was being raped
and vice versa was well explained by the fact that both of them live in the
same residence, a small one-room house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In discussing the third quoted principle, it suffices to state <span style="">that </span>the prosecution thru the evidence
adduced was able to convince the Court that it was the complainants who were
telling the truth.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘It is unthinkable
for an unmarried teen girl to file rape complaint if it were not true’ [People
vs. Reyes, 137 SCRA <span style="">99 </span>(1985)];
‘It is hard to believe that a woman would undergo the expense, trouble and
inconvenience of a public trial not to mention the scandal, <span class="SpellE">embarassment</span>
and humiliation it inevitably entails, and allow <span style="">an </span>examination of her private parts, if her motive was not to
bring to justice the persons who had abused her’ [People vs. <span class="SpellE">Detuya</span>, 154 SCRA 410 (1985)]; and, ‘No woman of tender age
will concoct a story of defloration’ [People vs. Derpo, 168 SCRA 447 (1988)].</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The accused, to free <span class="GramE">himself</span> from
criminal liability denied having raped the complainants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the defense of denial cannot assume
importance in the cases at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
general rule, ‘a bare denial of guilt is insufficient to overcome the <span class="SpellE">postive</span> testimony of the culpability of an-accused’ (sic)
[People vs. <span class="SpellE">Sinau</span>-ay, 138 SCRA 221 (1985)].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, the defense of denial cannot prevail
over explicit identification of the offended rape victims <span style="">(sic).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Furthermore, the contention of the accused, that it will be quite
impossible for him to have the opportunity to rape the complainants because he <span style="">has </span>not yet met the mother of the
victims at the time the alleged crimes happened, is weak.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here it must be remembered that the reason
why complainant Rowena was fetched by her mother was for the former to
celebrate her birthday in her mother’s house and at that point in time her <span style="">mother was already </span>having an affair
with the accused and were already cohabiting in the same abode.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Lastly, the fact that complainants concealed for sometime the
sexual assaults on their virtues does not in any manner affect their cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘Delay in reporting the rape is not fatal and
does not show consent to the sexual intercourse’ [People. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cariño</span>, 167 SCRA 285 (1988)].<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, complainants justified their
delay <span style="">in </span>reporting the matter to
the authorities that <span class="GramE">is,</span> they were afraid due to death
threats made against them <span style="">by </span>the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The failure of a fourteen year
(sic) victim to immediately reveal her harrowing experience does not affect her
credibility.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One should not expect a
young girl to act like an adult or mature and experienced woman who would know
what to do under difficult circumstances <span style="">and
</span>who would have the courage and intelligence to disregard threat on her
life and the members of her family and complain immediately that she had been
forcibly deflowered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not uncommon
for young girls to conceal for sometime the assaults on their virtue because of
the rapists’ threat on their lives’ [People vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>,
159 SCRA 192 (1988)].”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The sexual violence inflicted upon the <span style="">complainants was extremely vicious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is disheartening that the incidents happened at the time complainants
were </span><span style="">no </span><span style="">longer in that “age of amnesia,” thereby
leaving indelible marks in their memories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
