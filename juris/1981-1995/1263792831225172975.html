				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> which seeks to
set aside (a) the decision of the Court of Appeals dated June 30, 1986 in
CA-G.R. No. 06502 which reversed the decision of the Regional Trial Court,
Fourth Judicial Region, Branch 71, <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in Civil Case No. 395-A and, (b) respondent court's
resolution dated August 25, 1986 denying the petitioners' motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts on record are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="4" month="5">May 4, 1972</st1:date>,
the spouses, Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> and Lolita M. <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>, predecessors-in-interest of the private
respondents, secured from petitioner Community Savings and Loan Association,
Inc. (CSLA), then known as <span class="SpellE">Taytay</span> Savings and Loan
Association, a loan in the sum of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="6">June
 6, 1972</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">Esguerras</span> obtained an
additional loan of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These were secured by a real estate mortgage
and amendment of real estate mortgage over Transfer Certificates of Title Nos.
217509 and 161966, and duly registered with the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The loans matured on <st1:date year="1976" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="5"><u>May</u> <u>25,</u> <u>1978</u></st1:date>,
Antonio C. <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>, debtor-mortgagor died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to his death, no action whatsoever was
taken by petitioner CSLA to collect the loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No demand or collection letters were sent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But in March 1979, CSLA, through counsel
allegedly sent a demand letter addressed to the <u>deceased</u> informing him
that the loan was long overdue and giving him five (5) days from receipt
thereof to settle his account.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1979</st1:date>,
CSLA filed a petition for extra-judicial foreclosure of real estate mortgage
under Act No. 3135, before the Office of the Sheriff, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="GramE">Metro</span>
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, a Notice of
Sheriff's <st1:city><st1:place>Sale</st1:place></st1:city> dated <st1:date year="1979" day="3" month="10">October 3, 1979</st1:date> was issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="11">November
 5, 1979</st1:date>, the disputed realties were sold to CSLA as the highest
bidder, and the corresponding Sheriff's Certificate of Sale issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sale was subsequently registered with the
Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> on <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="12">December 19, 1979</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in October 1980, the private respondents as heirs of the
deceased debtor-mortgagor Antonio <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Esguerra</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> inquired from CSLA about the status of the mortgage
indebtedness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>CSLA instead of informing
them about the foregoing <span class="GramE">developments,</span> simply assured
them not to mind the loan as the same was of a very minimal amount, not yet due
and demandable, and that the same could easily be paid as the collateral was
very much bigger in value.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to these assurances, CSLA executed on <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1980</st1:date> an affidavit of
consolidation adjudicating to itself the full ownership of the properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The affidavit of consolidation was thereafter
registered with the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 161966 cancelled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In lieu thereof, Transfer Certificate of
Title No. 503459 was issued in the name of CSLA.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="14" month="2">February 14, 1981</st1:date>,
CSLA sold the foreclosed property to its co-petitioner <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> for ONE HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND (P140<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) PESOS.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Transfer Certificate of Title 503459 was subsequently cancelled and a
new one issued in <span class="SpellE">Mendiola's</span> name.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1981</st1:date>,
the aggrieved private respondents filed a verified complaint for cancellation
of foreclosure sale, and damages with prayer for writ of preliminary attachment
alleging among others that:</p>

<blockquote>"13.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the foreclosure
pro­ceedings as well as all transactions attendant immediately prior and/or
subsequent thereto, are all void and of no force and effect; the same having
been done contrary to law on the matter, and perpetrated with fraud, collusion,
breach of trust and confidence on the part of the Bank and its ac­complices.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"14.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sale in favor
of the defendant Bank was in excess of authority granted Bank and for a
consideration disproportionate to the actual fair market value of the mortgaged
properties and there inadequate, sufficient to shock the conscience of man;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"15.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The defendants as
hereinabove shown, deliberately in bad faith and with malice, withheld any
information from the plaintiffs, despite the <span class="SpellE">latters</span>
request and through the use of stealth and strategy allowed the loan to ma­ture,
foreclosed the mortgage with­out benefit of notice, adjudicate the property
unto itself and even failed to turn over excess of amount realized from sale to
the defendant all of which acts preven­ted the plaintiffs from exercising their
right of redemption;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>"16.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Plaintiffs learned
of the fact of sale, consolidation of title and resale to defendant, NARCISO
MENDIOLA, only recently and immediately thereafter confronted the Bank about it
but the Bank officially refused to entertain them and even refused to furnish
the plaintiffs of the documents pertinent to the mortgage and its foreclosure;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decisive issue to be determined in this case is whether or
not the extrajudicial foreclosure, consolidation of ownership, and resale of
the subject property were perpetrated with fraud by the petitioners on the
private respondents so as to justify the annulment of the foreclosure and
resale and to entitle the private respondents to damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">A thorough review of the records shows that the findings and
conclusions of the Court of Appeals are amply supported by the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">As found by the respondent Court of Appeals.</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, it
appears from the evidence that the President of the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">motgagee</span> bank himself
admitted that he was aware of the death of debtor-mortgagor Antonio <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., November 5, 1980,
p. 21-23), and yet despite this knowledge, the alleged demand letter was still
addressed to the deceased debtor-mortgagor and not to his widow or to his
heirs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, the alleged demand letter
was dated <st1:date year="1979" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1979</st1:date>
while the person to whom the same was addressed died on <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1978</st1:date>." (p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellate court also found that the private respondents even
went to CSLA and inquired from it about the status of the mortgage loan and the
balance remaining if any.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner
bank assured respondents that it was going to furnish them the appropriate
statement of accounts, not to worry because the mortgage indebtedness is not
yet due, that it was minimal and that they would be allowed to redeem the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The private respondents
justifiably and in good faith relied on these assurances and commitments of
CSLA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for these
representations, the private respondents could have <span class="GramE">effected</span>
a seasonable redemption of the property, if not seasonable payment of the
mortgage indebtedness (p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span>
was obviously a buyer in bad faith based on the following circumstances:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He never bothered to investigate the property
which he supposedly bought before purchasing it; even after his purchase of the
property in question, he never made any attempt to visit the same; he did not bother
to inspect nor ask for the title and other documents evidencing the sale from
the bank (see p. 43, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>); he never bothered to
inform the persons occupying the land which he bought for P140,000.00, that he
was the new owner; after spending the sum of P140,000.00, he never showed any
interest in occupying the lot; he admitted that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tamayo</span>, Jr. the president of petitioner bank is his
known acquaintance; and he never made any attempt to employ the legal services
of his own counsel; instead he simply entrusted his defense to the petitioner
bank's counsel (see p. 44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the respondent appellate court correctly ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>" x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>,
the buyer of a parcel of land who could not have failed to know or discover
that the land sold to him was in the adverse possession of another, is a buyer
in bad faith (St. Peter Memorial Park, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Cleofas</span>,
92 SCRA 389).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar,
defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span>
could not have failed to know or discover that the subject property sold to him
was in the adverse possession of the plaintiffs-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such case his knowledge is equivalent to
registration and taints his purchase with bad faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence he does not come under the protective
mantle of the Land Registration Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, in <u>Serrano</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>
(139 SCRA 179), the Supreme Court noted the following circumstances in finding
the petitioner therein as having acted in bad.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(1) That the supposed buyer in good faith and current owner never showed
the slightest interest in the litigation involving the cancellation of his title
and the reversion of the lot he purchased from <span class="SpellE">Macaraya</span>
to the original vendor; (2) That while the purchaser lives in San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, <span class="SpellE">Talisay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, he has never been to <span class="SpellE">Mati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Oriental (where the land was situated) nor has he
seen the land sold to him by <span class="SpellE">Macaraya</span>; and (3) the
purchaser never bothered to find out what was sold to him for P20,000.00 in
1969, whether or not the land was really worth that much or that it even
existed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Similar to the case at bar, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> never showed any interest in the litigation
in that he never made any attempt to employ the legal services of his own
counsel and simply entrusted his defense to his co-defendant bank's counsel (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., November 12, 1984, pp. 25-36).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> never made any attempt to visit the property
which he allegedly bought up to this date (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>.,
November 20, 1984, p. 3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor did he
bother to investigate the property whether the land really existed or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Mendiola</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span>
never bothered to inspect the accompanying documents of the sale nor did he ask
for the title of the land for inspection before or after the sale (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span>., November 12, 1984, pp. 19-20)." (p. 43, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing facts on record, <span class="GramE">We</span>
cannot but agree with the conclusions of respondent court that:</p>

<blockquote>"All the foregoing circumstances are badges of fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If taken collectively, they show an ulterior
motive and a grand design on the part of the defendant-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
mortgagee bank to acquire the property in question through that unwarranted
foreclosure proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To deprive the
plaintiffs-appellants of their property in the light of the facts obtaining in
the case at bar would be the height of injustice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> (p. 38, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The extrajudicial foreclosure in the case at bar having been
tainted with fraud, we hold the same to be null and void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>initio</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that the consolidation of ownership of subject properties to
petitioner bank as highest bidder, and its subsequent resale to <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span> <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> are also without
legal force and effect, and that private respondents are entitled to the
equitable remedy of redemption granted by the respondent appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the petitioners' arguments, the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Amparo</u></span> <u>G.</u> <u>Perez</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Philippine</u>
<u>National</u> <u>Bank</u> (17 SCRA 833) is applicable to the instant
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>Perez</u> <u>v.</u> <u>PNB</u>
the widow of the deceased debtor-mortgagor inquired from PNB about the status
of her late husband's loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite said
inquiry and willingness to redeem, the bank without notice caused the mortgaged
properties to be extra-judicially foreclosed and was itself the highest bidder.</p>

<p class="BODY">In allowing the heirs of the deceased debtor-mortgagor to redeem
the foreclosed properties, the Supreme Court held that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nevertheless, while upholding the validity of the appellant
Bank's foreclosure, We cannot close our eyes to the fact that the Bank was
apprised since 1947 of the death of its debtor, Vicente Perez, yet it failed
and neglected to give notice of the foreclosure to the latter's widow and
heirs, as expressly found by the court a quo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such failure, in effect, prevented them from blocking the foreclosure
through seasonable payment, as well as impeded their effectuating a seasonable
redemption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of these circumstances,
it is our view that both justice and equity would be served by permitting
herein <span class="SpellE">appellees</span> to redeem the foreclosed property
within a reasonable time, by paying the capital and interest of the
indebtedness up to the time of redemption, plus foreclosure and useful
expenses, less any rents and profits obtained by the Bank from and after the
same entered into its possession.</blockquote>

entitled to redeem the property in question by paying or tendering to the Bank
the capital of the debt of Vicente Perez, with the stipulated interest to the
date of foreclosure, plus interest thereafter at 12% per annum; and reimbursing
the Bank the value of any useful expenditures on the said property but
deducting from the amounts thus payable the value of any rents and profits
derived by the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> National Bank from the

<p class="BODY">In a similar case, <u>Philippine</u> <u>National</u> <u>Bank</u> <u>v.</u>
<u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u> (94 SCRA 357), where the bank manager
assured the heirs of the debtor-mortgagor that they will be allowed to pay the
mortgage obligations, and that they acted on these representations, the Supreme
Court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"On equitable principles, particularly on the ground of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>,<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>we must
rule against petitioner Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'The
doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> is based upon the grounds of
public policy, fair dealing, good faith and justice, and its purpose is to
forbid one to speak against its own act, representations, or commitments to the
injury of one to whom they were directed and who reasonably relied
thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> springs from equitable principles and the equities
in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is designed to aid the
law in the administration of justice where without its aid injustice might
result.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been applied by this
Court wherever and whenever special circumstances of a case so demand.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>Perez justifiably and reasonably relied upon the assurance of the
Bank's Manager that he would be allowed to pay the remaining obligation of his
deceased parents and he acted on that basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even fair dealing alone would have required the Bank to abide by its
representations, but it did not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, the equities of the case are with Perez."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Fraud and bad faith having been duly established on the part of
petitioners, it follows that private respondents are necessarily entitled to
the minimal damages awarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find the
assessment by the Court of Appeals to be fair and just.</p>

<p class="BODY">One other important point that militates against the petitioners'
first ground for this petition is the fact that no notice of the foreclosure
proceedings was ever sent by CSLA to the deceased mortgagor Antonio <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span> or his <span class="GramE">heirs</span> <span class="SpellE">inspite</span> of an express stipulation in the mortgage agreement
to that effect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said Real Estate
Mortgage provides, in Sec. 10 thereof that:</p>

<blockquote>"(10)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><u>All</u> <u>correspondence</u>
<u>relative</u> <u>to</u> this mortgage, including demand letters, summons,
subpoenas, or <u>notifications</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u> <u>judicial</u> <u>or</u>
<u>extrajudicial</u> <u>actions</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>sent</u> <u>to</u>
<u>the</u> <u>Mortgagor</u> <u>at</u> <u>the</u> <u>address</u> <u>given</u> <u>above</u>
or at the address that may hereafter be given in writing by the Mortgagor to
the Mortgagee, and the mere act of sending any correspondence by mail or by
personal delivery to the said address <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>valid</u> <u>and</u>
<u>effective</u> <u>notice</u> <u>to</u> <u>the</u> <u>Mortgagor</u> for all
legal purposes, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."
(Underscoring supplied) (p. 50-51, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals, in appreciating the foregoing provision
ruled that it "is an additional stipulation between the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, it is the law between them and as it
is not contrary to law, morals, good customs and public policy, the same should
be complied with faithfully (Article 1306, New Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, while publication of the foreclosure
proceedings in the newspaper of general circulation was complied with, personal
notice is still required, as in the case at bar, when the same was mutually
agreed upon by the parties as additional condition of the mortgage
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Failure to
comply with this additional stipulation would render illusory Article 1306 of
the New Civil Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span class="GramE">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span class="GramE">" (p. 37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of whether or not CSLA notified the private
respondents of the extrajudicial foreclosure sale in compliance with Sec. 10 of
the mortgage agreement the Court of Appeals found as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As the record is bereft of any evidence which even impliedly
indicate that the required notice of the extrajudicial foreclosure was ever
sent to the deceased debtor-mortgagor Antonio <span class="SpellE">Esguerra</span>
or to his heirs, the extrajudicial foreclosure proceedings on the property in
question are fatally defective and are not binding on the deceased
debtor-mortgagor or to his heirs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p.
37, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, even on the premise that there was no attendant fraud in
the proceedings, the failure of the petitioner bank to comply with the
stipulation in the mortgage document is fatal to the petitioners' cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is that "findings of facts of the Court of Appeals
are binding on the Supreme Court" (De Gala­-<span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Manalo</span>, 8 SCRA 595; <span class="SpellE">Goduco</span>
v. Court of Appeals, 14 SCRA 282; Ramirez Telephone Corporation v. Bank of
America, 29 SCRA 191; Chan v. Court of Appeals, 33 SCRA 737).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This case illustrates our ruling that a
question of non-compliance with notice and publication requirements of an extrajudicial
foreclosure sale is a factual issue binding upon the Supreme Court (Reyes v.
Court of Appeals, 107 SCRA 126).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the petition is hereby
