which affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the decision of
the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>, Branch XX in Civil
Case No. CEB-1215 and the denial of petitioner’s Motion for Reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1983</st1:date>,
private respondent Lawrence Fernandez insured his car for “own damage” under
private car Policy No. 50459 with petitioner Zenith <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

figured in an accident and suffered actual damages in </span>the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,640.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
allegedly being given a run around by Zenith for two (2) months, Fernandez
filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
for sum of money and damages resulting from the refusal of Zenith to pay the
amount claimed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was
docketed as Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">CEB-1215.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside from actual damages and interests,
Fernandez also prayed for moral damages in the amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
exemplary damages of P5,000.00, attorney’s fees of P3,000.00 and litigation
expenses of P3,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="9">September 28, 1983</st1:date>,
Zenith filed an answer alleging that it offered to pay the claim of Fernandez
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the contract which, the private
respondent rejected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the issues
had been joined, the pre-trial was scheduled on <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="10">October 17, 1983</st1:date> but the same was moved to <st1:date year="1983" day="4" month="11">November 4, 1983</st1:date> upon petitioner’s
motion, allegedly to explore ways to settle the case although at an amount
lower than private respondent’s claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1983</st1:date>,
the trial court terminated the pre-trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, Fernandez presented his evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Zenith, however, failed to present
its evidence in view of its failure to appear in court, without justifiable
reason, on the day scheduled for the purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court issued an order on <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="8">August 23, 1984</st1:date> submitting the case for decision without

<p class="BODY">The Motion for Reconsideration of the decision of the Court of

was denied on <st1:date year="1988" day="29" month="9">September 29, 1988</st1:date>,

jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issues raised by
petitioners in this petition are:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>a) The legal basis of respondent Court of Appeals in awarding moral
damages, exemplary damages and attorney’s fees in an amount more than that
prayed for in the complaint.</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) The award of actual damages of P3,640.00 instead of only
P1,927.50 which was arrived at after deducting P250.00 and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">P274.00 as deductible franchise and 20%
depreciation on parts as agreed upon in the contract of insurance.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that while the complaint of private
respondent prayed for P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> moral damages, the
lower court awarded twice the amount, or P20,000.00 without factual or legal
basis; while private respondent prayed for P5,000.00 exemplary damages, the
trial court awarded P20,000.00; and while private respondent prayed for
P3,000.00 attorney’s fees, the trial court awarded P5,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The propriety of the award of moral damages, exemplary damages
and attorney’s fees is the main issue raised herein by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The award of damages in case of unreasonable delay in the payment
of insurance claims is governed by the Philippine Insurance Code, which
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SEC. 244.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In case of any litigation for the enforcement of any policy or contract
of insurance, it shall be the duty of the Commissioner or the Court, as the
case may be, to make a finding as to whether the payment of the claim of the
insured has been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">unreasonably denied or
withheld; and in the affirmative case, the insurance company shall be adjudged
to pay damages which shall consist of attorney’s fees and other expenses
incurred by the insured person by reason of such unreasonable denial or
withholding of payment </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">plus </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">interest of twice the ceiling prescribed by
the Monetary Board of the amount of the claim due the insured, from the date
following the time prescribed in section two hundred forty-two or in section
two hundred forty-three, as the case may be, until the claim is fully
satisfied; Provided, That the failure to pay any such claim within the time
prescribed in said sections shall be considered prima facie evidence of
unreasonable delay in payment.”</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear that under the Insurance Code, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>case of unreasonable delay in the
payment of the proceeds of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an insurance
policy, the damages that may be awarded <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>1) attorney’s fees; 2) other expenses
incurred by the insured person by reason of such unreasonable denial or
withholding </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">payment; 3) interest at twice the ceiling
prescribed by the Monetary Board of the amount of the claim due the injured;
and 4) the amount of the claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the award of moral and exemplary damages, the rules
under the New Civil Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall govern.</p>

<p class="BODY">“The purpose of moral damages is essentially indemnity or
reparation, not punishment or correction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moral damages are emphatically not intended to enrich a complainant at
the expense of a <span class="GramE">defendant,</span> they are awarded only to
enable the injured party to obtain means, diversions or amusements that will
serve to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">alleviate the moral suffering
he has undergone by reason of the defendant’s culpable action.” (J. <span class="SpellE">Cezar</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sangco</span>, Philippine Law
on Torts and Damages, Revised Edition, p. 539) (See also R and B Surety &amp;

11.0pt">pecuniary loss is necessary in order that moral damages may be
adjudicated, the assessment of which is left to the discretion <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>the court according to the
circumstances of each case (Art. 2216, New Civil Code), it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">equally true that in awarding moral damages in case of breach of
contract, there must be a showing that the breach was wanton and deliberately
injurious or the one responsible acted fraudulently or in bad faith </span>(Perez

14 SCRA 887).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">case, there was a finding that private
respondent was given a “run-around” for two months, which is the basis for the
award of </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">damages granted
under the Insurance Code for unreasonable delay in the payment of </span>the
claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the act of petitioner of
delaying payment for two months cannot be considered as so wanton or malevolent
to justify an award of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral damages,
taking into consideration also the fact that the actual damage on the car was
only P3,640.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the pre-trial of the
case, it was shown that there w<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">as </span>no
total disclaimer by respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">reason </span>for petitioner’s failure to
indemnify private respondent<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> within the
two-month period </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that the parties </span>could not come to an
agreement as regards the amount of the actual damage on the car.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amount of P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
prayed for by private respondent as moral damages is equitable.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, exemplary or corrective damages are imposed,
by way of example or correction for the public good (Art. 2229, New Civil Code
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Noda v. Cruz-<span class="SpellE">Arnaldo</span>, G.R.

awarded at the insurance company had not acted in wanton, oppressive or
malevolent manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same is true in
the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The amount of P5,000.00 awarded as attorney’s fees is justified
under <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">the </span>circumstances of this

P274.00 as deductible franchise and 20% depreciation on parts, respectively
claimed by petitioners as agreed upon in the contract, had no basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Under its second assigned error, defendant-appellant puts forward
