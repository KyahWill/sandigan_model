				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">"United we stand, divided we fall," could very well
have been the motto of the Philippine Transport and General Workers
Organization (PTGWO).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Founded in the
1950's by one of the Philippine labor movement's leading pillars, the late
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>, <span style="">Sr.,
the labor organization encompasses a good number of affiliate unions and is one
of the founding members of the Trade Union Congress of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But
just like good things and good times, good organizations also come to an
end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This case chronicle's <span class="SpellE">PTGWO's</span> story.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">During the 11th PTGWO national convention held on <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1979</st1:date>, herein private
respondent Andres L. <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, Jr. was elected
National President while herein petitioner Roberto M. <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Oca</span></span><span style="">, </span>Jr. was elected National Executive Vice President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their terms of office were both for three (3)
years.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1982</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> convened an executive board meeting to
thresh out the mechanics of the national convention of PTGWO for that
year.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the thirty three (33) voting
members of the board, thirty one (31) were present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, before the body could agree on the
date of the convention, a number of participants questioned the qualifications
of some members to sit on the board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To
cut the heated argument then ensuing, the meeting was adjourned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, <span class="SpellE">Oca</span> and
some members of the board <span style="">left </span>the
conference hall.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Nonetheless, the nineteen
(19) members who remained asked <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> to
reconvene the meeting, which he did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This body passed, among others, a resolution to hold the national
convention o</span><span style="">n </span><st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="4"><span style="">April
 18, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>

 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">; thereby
prompting <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> and his group in their board
meeting of </span><st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="4"><span style="">April 1, 1982</span></st1:date><span style=""> to advance their convention date also to </span><st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="4"><span style="">April 4,
 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Hence, on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="4"><span style="">April 4,
 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">, the </span><span style="">groups </span><span style="">of <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>
held their respective conventions at different venues and elected their own set
of officers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1982" day="15" month="4"><span style="">April
 15, 1982</span></st1:date><span style="">, PTGWO and <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> filed a petition with the Bureau of Labor
Relations to declare the convention and election of officers held by the <span class="SpellE">Oca</span> group as illegal, null and void.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pending resolution of the
dispute, PTGWO-III, a group of fifteen (15) </span><span style="">local unions </span><span style="">headed by
Carlos T. <span class="SpellE">Rullamas</span> and identified with the <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> faction, moved </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">intervene for the
reason that its members had allegedly already "seceded" from the camp
of <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> prayed that it be permitted to use the name
PTGWO or, in the alternative, to allow the three fac­tions to operate
independently of each other.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

respondent Director <span class="SpellE">Cresenciano</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> rendered a decision, declaring both conventions of
doubtful validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finding that the rift
between the two (2) factions had become unbridgeable so that a convention to
unify them might not be a workable solution, respondent Director concluded that
there was no other alternative but to recognize the "sad fact that the
PTGWO, once a monolithic labor federation, has to be split into two:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>PTGWO-<span class="SpellE">Oca</span></u>

requirements of registration under the Labor Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO DECIDED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Feeling aggrieved by the decision, all the parties filed their
respective motions for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="7">July 22, 1986</st1:date>,
Director <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> issued an Order denying the motion

The record does not indicate whether the motions for reconsideration filed by <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, Jr. and the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
were resolved.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alleging grave abuse <span style="">of </span>discretion
amounting to lack of jurisdiction on the part of the BLR Director, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>, Jr., et al. and PTGWO-<span class="SpellE">Oca</span>
are now before Us by way of this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners and private respondents both assail the conclu­sion
reached by respondent BLR Director that PTGWO has ceased to exist as
PTGWO.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each side, however, insists on
the validity of its convention, and consequently, its right to continue using
the name PTGWO and to operate under <span class="SpellE">PTGWO's</span>
Registration Permit No. 1194-MM-IP with all the privileges and benefits
appurtenant thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crux of the petition hinges on the validity of either group's
election of officers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
the latter depends upon the validity of the respective Executive Board Meetings
and National Conventions called.</p>

<p class="BODY">Elementary is the rule that the Constitution and By-laws of an
organization serve as a contract that binds its members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this instance, the pertinent provisions of
the Constitution and By-Laws are as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">ARTICLE VII - NATIONAL CONVENTION</p>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>Section 24.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>DATE AND PLACE OF CONVENTION- The National
Convention shall hold (sic) every three years at a time during the first half
of April, the inclusive dates, time, place to be fixed by (sic) National Execu­tive
Board which shall be at least sixty (60) days before its holding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 34.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>SPECIAL
CONVENTIONS- On fifteen (15) days notice, special conventions may be called by
the National Executive Board, or upon petition of affiliates whose combined
membership represent majority of the entire membership of the organization as
evidenced by the reports of the National Secretary to the last Convention.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">ARTICLE VIII- THE NATIONAL EXECUTIVE BOARD</p>

<blockquote>Section 38.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INTERIM
AUTHORITY- Between Conven­<span style="">tions, </span>supreme
authority, subject to the general policies (sic) down by the Convention, shall
be exercised by the National Executive Board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 39.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>COMPOSITION- The
National Executive<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Board shall be
composed of the National President, 1st National Executive Vice President for
General Workers, 2nd National Executive Vice President for Transport, four (4)
National Vice Presidents for General Workers, four (4) National Vice Presidents
for Transport, a National Secretary, National Treasurer, ten (10) Nation­al
Executive Board (sic) for General Workers, ten (10) National Executive Board
(sic) for Transport, and all the appointive officers which shall, however, have
no vote.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MEETINGS AND
QUORUM- The National Executive Board shall normally meet immediately after the
close of the regular convention and at least once every quarter thereafter, or
upon call of the National President, at his initiative or upon petition of at
least one-fourth (1/4) of its members, for a special meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A majority of the members of the National
Executive Board shall constitute a quorum to transact business.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 46.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>APPOINTIVE
OFFICERS- The officers to be appointed by the National President subject to con­firmation
by the National Executive Board shall be:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a) Two National
Assistant Secretaries, one each for <span style="">Transport
</span>and General Workers;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The presence of a quorum <span style="">during
</span>petitioner <span class="SpellE">Oca’s</span> and respondent <span class="SpellE">Dinglasan's</span> respective Board meetings is questionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the public respondent Director<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> In
both meetings the quorum requirement (majority of the members of the national
executive board (Section 40, Article VIII, PTGWO Constitution) --33, elective
and approximately 36, appointive (Section 39, Article VIII in relation to
section 46, Article IX, PTGWO Constitution) has not been met."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Oca’s</span> Board
Meeting and subsequent Convention were tainted with invalidity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The call for "a special Board meeting to
fix the special convention" made by the National Secretary, Johnny <span class="SpellE">Oca</span>, was anomalous since only the National President of the
Union was empowered to call a special Board Meeting, "at his own
initiative or upon petition of at least one fourth (1/4) of the Board
members."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner argues that section 40 <span style="">of </span>the By-Laws provides alternately and successively for:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.35pt; text-indent: -18.75pt;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">a.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

for a special meeting.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner has apparently misread section 40.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An analysis of the cited section shows that
what alternates are the instances when the Board shall meet, not the authority
as to who can call for such meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
would seem that petitioner has confused this discretionary power properly
lodged in the President with that of the Secretary's ministerial duty to
"call" or inform the Board members of a forthcoming meeting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering the anomalous "call"
for a special meeting made by the National Secretary, matters taken up during
said special meeting, such as the calling of a national convention, are
likewise tainted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Still further, both Conventions were in violation of the
sixty-day requirement imposed by section 24 of the By-Laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said section clearly provides that the
National Convention's dates, time and place shall be fixed by the National
Executive Board <u>which</u> <u>shall</u> <u>be</u> <u>at</u> <u>least</u> <u>sixty</u>
<u>(60)</u> <u>days</u> <u>before</u> <u>the</u> <u>holding</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
As succinctly found by the public respondent Labor Director<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> On
this score alone, the validity of the conventions called by petitioner and
respondents on 4 April 1982 is subject to question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group headed by petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>) fixed the final date of the convention barely
three (3) days before the holding, while respondents (<span class="SpellE">Oca</span>)
did so only sixteen (16) days prior to their convention."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The word used in the underscored phrase is "shall."
According to Webster's Third International Dictionary of the English Language
-- the word "shall" means "ought to, must, xxx obligation --
used to express a command or exhortation, used in laws, regulations or
directives to express what is mandatory."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, it was imperative for both petitioners and private respondents to
strictly follow the command therein with respect to the period for calling a
National Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is apparent that respondent Labor
Director's refusal to declare the validity of the election of officers of
either parties is not tainted with abuse of discre­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, that part of the decision which
ordered the parties to "secure new registration certificates as Philippine
Transport and General Workers Organization (PTGWO)-<span class="SpellE">Oca</span>
and Phil­ippine Transport and General Workers Organization (PTGWO)-<span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span>, <span style="">within</span>
thirty (30) days from receipt of this decision" is without basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No provision in the Labor Code sanctions such
an act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For the cancellation of a labor
union's certificate of authority under Article 239 of the Labor Code, the
causes provided therein must be substantially proved, with the requisite
notices given and hearings held.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this
case, such elementary elements of due process were not observed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In lieu thereof, reliance should have been made on the Union
Constitution and By-laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sections 38
and 47<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
provide:</p>

<blockquote>Section 38.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>INTERIM
AUTHORITY - Between conventions, supreme authority, subject to the general poli­cies
down (sic) by the Convention, shall be exercised by the National Executive
Board.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Section 47.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TERMS OF OFFICE
- The elective officers shall be installed at the Convention at which they were
elected <b><span style="">and shall serve until their </span>successors
</b><b><span style="">shall have been elected and
qualified and duly installed at the next National Convention</span></b><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
tenure of office of appointive officers shall expire with each national
convention and may be removed only under the provisions of Section 41, Article
VIII of this Constitution.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since we have ruled that the Conventions/Board Meetings of both
petitioners and private respondents are tainted, then it necessarily follows
that the incumbent officers constituting the National Executive Board are
entitled to remain in office, until their successors have been elected,
qualified and duly installed at a National Convention.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the manifestations filed by the parties that
pending resolution of this case, the two (2) factions had been able to
negotiate collective bargaining agreements with various companies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Considering that these <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span>
were entered into in good faith, each faction acting in the honest belief that
it is entitled to operate as the legitimate PTGWO and so as not to disturb the
rights, benefits and privileges accorded by the <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span>
to the parties therein, the <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span> entered into by
PTGWO-<span class="SpellE">Dinglasan</span> and PTGWO-<span class="SpellE">Oca</span>
are recognized as valid and binding until their<span style="">&nbsp;
