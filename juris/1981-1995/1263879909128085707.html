				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Rosendo Ralla had two sons, Pablo and Pedro.  The father apparently loved the former but
not the latter.  Pablo and his family
lived with Rosendo, who took care of all the household expenses.  Pablo administered part of the family
properties and received a monthly salary of P250.00 plus part of the produce of
the land.  Pedro lived with his mother,
Paz Escarella, in another town.  He was
not on good terms with his father.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paz Escarella died <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">in </span>1957 and the two brothers partitioned 63
parcels of land she left as her paraphernal property.  The partition was sustained by this Court in G.R. Nos. 63253-54
on April 27, 1989.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Meanwhile, on December 22, 1958, Rosendo executed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>will disinheriting Pedro and
leaving everything he owned to Pablo, to whom he said he had earlier sold a
part of his property for P10,000.00.  Rosendo himself filed for the probate of the will but <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">pendente</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span><u>lite</u> died on October 1, 1960.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 3, 1966, the probate judge converted SP 564 into an
intestate proceeding.  On February 28,
1978, a creditor of the deceased filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>petition for the probate of Rosendo's will
in SP 1106, which was heard jointly with SP 564.  On August 3, 1979, the order of November 3, 1966, was set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY">The last will and testament of Rosendo Ralla was allowed on June
7, 1982,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>October 20, 1982, the
disinheritance of Pedro was disapproved.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> This
order was elevated to the Court of Appeals in AC-G.R. Nos. 00472, 00489.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a decision dated July 25, 1986, the Court of Appeals<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
reversed the trial court and reinstated the disinheritance clause <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">after </span>finding that the requisites of a
valid disinheritance had been complied with in the will.  The appellate court noted that Pedro had
threatened to kill his father, who was afraid of him and had earlier sued him
for slander and grave oral defamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision was assailed before this Court in G.R. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Nos. </span>76657-58,
which was dismissed in our resolution of August 26, 1987, reading <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>follows:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">x
x x </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Assuming that, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as claimed, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the petitioners' counsel received </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">copy of the </span>questioned
decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">only </span>on August 15, 1986
(although it should have been earlier because it was mailed to him at his
address of record on July 28, 1986), they had 15 days, or until August 30,
1986, within which to move for its reconsideration or appeal therefrom by <i>certiorari</i>
to this Court.  Instead, they filed on
August 28, 1986, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>motion for
extension of time to file a motion for reconsideration, which was not allowed
under our ruling in Habaluyas Enterprises, Inc. v. Japson, 142 SCRA 208, and so
did not interrupt the running of the reglementary period.  Indeed, even if the period were to be
counted from October <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">7, </span>1986, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">when notice of the denial of the motion for
extension was received by the petitioners, the petition would still be 30 days
late, having been filed on December 8, 1986.  Moreover, the petitioners have not shown that the questioned decision is
tainted with grave abuse of discretion or that it is not in accord with law and
jurisprudence.  For these reasons, the
Court Resolved to DISMISS the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The motion for reconsideration was denied with finality in the
following resolution dated October 26, 1987:</p>

<blockquote>x x x The Court, after deliberation, Resolved to DENY with finality
the motion for reconsideration, wherein the petitioners pray that they be
relieved from the effects of our ruling in Habaluyas Enterprises, Inc. v.
Japson, 142 SCRA 208, under which the petition was denied for tardiness.  Counsel are expected to be abreast of
current developments in law and jurisprudence and cannot plead ignorance
thereof <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as an </span>excuse for
non-compliance with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">the same.  As earlier observed,
the petition </span>was filed extremely late, and, moreover, it was inadequate
even on the merits, same having failed to show that the questioned decision was
tainted with grave abuse of discretion or reversible error.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What is involved in the present petition is the correctness of the
decision of the respondent court annulling the deed of sale executed by Rosendo
Ralla in favor of Pablo over 149 parcels of land.  Pedro had filed on May 19, 1972, a complaint to annul the
transaction on the ground that it was simulated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> The
original decision of the trial court declared the sale null and void.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In the resolution of the motion for reconsideration, however, Judge Jose F.
Madara completely reversed himself and held the deed of sale to be valid.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This order was in turn set aside by the respondent court, which reinstated the
original decision invalidating the deed of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indeed intriguing that the trial judge should, in resolving
the motion for reconsideration, make a complete turnabout on the basis of the <u>same</u>
evidence and jurisprudence that he considered in rendering the original
decision.  It is no less noteworthy that
the respondent court, after studying the two conclusions reached by him, saw
fit to sustain his original findings as the correct appreciation of the
evidence and the applicable law.</p>

<p class="BODY">But we find that, regardless of these curious resolutions, the
petition must nevertheless be sustained albeit not on the ground that the deed
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">sale </span>was indeed valid.  The Court is inclined to support the
findings of the respondent court.  However, we do not and cannot make any decision on this matter because
of one insuperable obstacle.  That
obstacle is the proper party personality of Pedro Ralla to question the
transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals in AC-G.R. Nos. 00472, 00489
approved the disinheritance of Pedro Ralla.  That decision was appealed to this Court, but the petition for review
was dismissed as above related.  The
decision has long since become final.  Since then, Pedro Ralla no longer had the legal standing to question the
validity of the sale executed by Rosendo in favor of his other son Pablo.</p>

<p class="BODY">The real party-in-interest is the party who stands to be
benefited or injured by the judgment or the party entitled to the avails of the
suit.  "Interest" within the
meaning of the rule means material interest, an interest in issue and to be
affected by the decree, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>distinguished from mere interest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">in </span>the question involved, or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a mere </span>incidental interest.  As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>general rule, one having no right or interest
to protect cannot invoke the jurisdiction of the court as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>party-plaintiff
in an action.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As the sole heir, Pablo Ralla had the right to inherit the
totality of his father's estate after payment of all its debts.  Even if it be assumed that the deed of sale
was indeed invalid, the subject-matter thereof nevertheless devolved upon Pablo
as the universal successor of his father Rosendo.  In his will, Rosendo claimed the 149 parcels as '"part of my
property" - as distinguished from the conjugal estate - which he had
earlier sold to Pablo.  Significantly,
Pedro did not deny this description of the property in his Comment to the
present petition, confining himself to assailing the validity of the sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court must note the lackadaisical attitude of the heirs of
Pedro Ralla, who substituted him upon his death.  They seem to have lost interest in this litigation, probably
because of the approval of their father's disinheritance by the respondent
court.  When the parties were required
to submit their respective memoranda after we <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">gave </span>due course to this petition, the
petitioners did but not the private respondents.  Although the period to do so had already expired, the Court
relaxed its rules to give the private respondents another opportunity to comply
with the requirement.  When the
resolution of August 22, 1990, could not be served upon the private
respondents' counsel, we directed that it be served on the private respondents
themselves.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
On January 18, 1991, the heirs of Pedro Ralla informed the Court that they were
retaining another counsel and asked that they be furnished a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">copy </span>of the petition and given 30 days
within which to file their memorandum.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> This
motion was granted.  The records show
that they received a copy of the petition on February 26, 1991, but their
memorandum was never filed.  On May 29,
1991, the Court, noting this omission, finally resolved to dispense with the
memorandum and to decide this case on the basis of the available records.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our decision is that as a validly disinherited heir, and not
claiming to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>creditor of
his deceased father, Pedro Ralla had no legal personality to question the deed
of sale dated November 29, 1957, between Rosendo Ralla and his son Pablo.  Legally speaking, Pedro Ralla was <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>stranger to the transaction as he
did not stand to benefit from its annulment.  His disinheritance had rendered him <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">combat</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the respondent court dated
January 23, 1987, is set aside and another judgment is hereby rendered
