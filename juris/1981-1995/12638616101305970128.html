by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, numbering forty-six (46) in all, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">worked as </span>security guards and/or
janitors under individual contracts with petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were assigned to firms and offices where
petitioner had contracts providing <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">security
</span>and janitorial services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
service period and last rates of salary are stated in the decision of the labor

Their individual contracts of employment provide, among others, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"3.d. That the
security guard, agrees to temporary suspension of his employment completely to
include such changes in his employment status with the Agency, in case of
termination of contract between the Agency and its Client, or reduction in
force of same;"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the early part of 1986, petitioner's service contracts with
various corporations and government agencies to which private respondents were
previously assigned had been terminated generally due to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sequestration </span>of the said offices by
the Presidential Commission on Good Government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, many of the private respondents <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">were </span>placed on "floating <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">status" </span>on <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A number of them
had been put on that status even earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Floating status" means an indefinite period of time when
private respondents do not receive any <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">salary
or financial </span>benefit provided by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A number of them later obtained employment in other security agencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On account of the uncertainty of their employment with the
petitioner, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">July 25,
 </span>1986</st1:date>, private respondents filed a complaint for illegal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">dismissal in </span>the Arbitration Branch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the Department of Labor and
Employment against petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
sought the payment of their respective separation pay, 13th month pay for 1986
and service incentive leave pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After
due proceedings where the parties were required to submit their position papers
and stipulation of facts, the respondent labor arbiter ruled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>favor of the private respondents
whose decision as above-related was affirmed by the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the herein petition alleging that the petitioner was
denied due process of law by the NLRC and it committed a grave abuse of
discretion in considering <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">private </span>respondents
as employees of petitioner, in ruling that the "floating status” of
private respondents amounted to an illegal dismissal, and in causing the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">execution of </span>the
judgment pending a complete and full adjudication of the issues.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forthwith, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">It </span>is clear, therefore,

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged illegal dismissal of private respondents, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">records show that
they filed their </span>complaint against petitioner on <st1:date year="1986" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">they filed their
complaint, </span>most of them were still on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">job or on assignments and it was only in September 1986 when most of
them were placed on "floating status."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, the filing of the complaint was premature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently, this issue was not raised at all
and so it is deemed waived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when
the labor arbiter rendered his decision, he considered those <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">who have been </span>out <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of work or </span>"floating status"
for a period exceeding six (6) months to have been terminated from the service
without just cause thus entitling them to the corresponding benefits for such
separation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We agree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 286 of the Labor Code it is provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 286.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>deemed
terminated. - The <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">suspension of the operation of a business or undertaking for a period
not exceeding six months, or the fulfillment by the </span>employee of a
military or civic duty shall not terminate employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In all such cases, the employer shall
reinstate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the employee to his former
position without loss of seniority rights if he </span>indicates his desire to
resume his work not later than one month from the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">resumption of operations of his employer or from his relief from the
military or </span>civic duty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">F</span>rom
the foregoing it is clear that when the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bonafide</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>suspension of the operation of a
business or undertaking exceeds six (6) months then the employment of the
employee shall be deemed terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By
the same token and applying the said rule by analogy to security guards, if they
remained without work or assignment, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that
</span>is in "floating status" for a period exceeding six (6) months,
then they are in effect constructively dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor arbiter disagreed with the representations of
petitioner that the private respondents who accepted assignments in other
security agencies without previously resigning should be considered to have
been dismissed with just cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
stipulation of facts, the parties admitted that the disciplinary rules
promulgated by petitioner for its employees provide that acceptance by an
employee of other employment without first resigning from the agency is a cause
for dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, it appears that twenty-seven (27) of the private
respondents violated this rule by accepting employment in other security
agencies without previously resigning from employment with petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No doubt, this is a just cause for
termination of their services and as such they are not entitled to any
separation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">pay.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the other seventeen (17) private respondents, they
admittedly remained in "floating status" for more then six (6)
months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a "floating
status" is not unusual for security guards employed in securi<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">t</span>y agencies as their assignments
primarily depend o<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">n </span>the contracts
entered into by the agency with third parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such a stipulated status is, therefore, lawful.</p>

<p class="BODY">The "floating status" of such an employee should last
only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">for </span>a reasonable time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, respondent labor arbiter
correctly held that when the "floating status" of said employees
lasts for more than six (6) months, they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">may
</span>be considered to have been illegally dismissed from the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they are entitled to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">corresponding </span>benefits for their
separation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED insofar as the
twenty-seven (27) private respondents are concerned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
