				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is an appeal interposed
by the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> from the decision of
the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>, Branch XX, sentencing him to serve the penalty of </span><u><span style="">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></span></u><span style="">, </span><span style="">to indemnify the heirs of the late <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
and to pay the costs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The information filed
against the accused alleged:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The undersigned Acting Provincial Fiscal accuses Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> and <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> of the crime of Murder, committed as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"That on or about September 12, 1976, in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, Province of Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said
accused conspiring, confederating together and mutually helping each other,
armed with a knife and with intent to kill, did then and there <span class="SpellE"><span style="">wil</span>fully</span>,
unlawfully and feloniously, with treachery and evident premeditation, attack,
assault, and stab with the use of the aforementioned instrument one <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span>, thereby inflicting
upon the latter a mortal stabbed wound, pene­trating his right lung, which
directly caused his death several days thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"CONTRARY TO LAW, particularly Article 248 of the Revised
Penal Code with the aggravating circumstances of superior strength and <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> which facilitated the commission of the crime,
and that the crime was committed at the residence of the victim."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The trial court found the
following facts and circumstances clearly and duly established:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The families of the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span>

1976.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These <span class="SpellE">Malvar</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span> Streets run paral­lel to each other, as
shown in Exhibit '1'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1976</st1:date> there was a report to
the Police of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, Sultan <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Kudarat</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span> on <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1976</st1:date> there was a
tumultuous affray involving rela­tives of the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> against a relative and helpers of the victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some of them with Aida <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span>
wife of the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> were injured in
this tumultuous affray.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This tumultuous
affray case was<i> </i>settled amicably by the parties with the agreement that
the medical or hospital bills shall be paid by those involved in the tumultuous
affray includ­ing the hospital expenses incurred by Aida <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span>
for the injuries she suffered while trying to pacify.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On September 12, 1976 while the victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span>, his wife Socorro <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> and their driver Alejandro Gonzales were having a
conversation in the veranda of their house located at <span class="SpellE">Lapu-Lapu</span>
Street, <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>
the accused <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Uldarico</span></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Prado</span>
arrived and asked the victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> why was his brother-in-law the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> be the one to pay the hospital bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span>
suddenly appeared and without saying a word to anyone immediately stabbed the
victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> on the
right chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> held the por­tion
of the knife which was not embedded on his chest with his left hand to prevent
further penetration of the knife <span style="">in hi</span>s
body thereby sustaining also a wound on his left hand.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> tried to remove the hand of the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> which held the knife by hitting the same with his
right hand making the handle of the knife separated from its blade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> pulled the blade of the knife from his body with his
left hand and thereafter fell down from the rail­ings of the terrace in a
crawling position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> also fell to the ground and he tried to regain
possession of the blade of the knife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span>
con­tinuously struck the ground with the blade of the knife to prevent or stop
the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> to get near him but at
that time the accused <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>
rode on him and strangled him with his two hands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alejandro Gonzales pulled away <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> from the victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> and boxed him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> ran
away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Alejandro Gonzales brought the
victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> to the
<span class="SpellE">Tamondong-­Eugenio</span> Hospital at <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>,
Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span> for medical assistance and treat­ment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> was treated for his injuries described as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Stab wound, deep penetrat­ing at right lungs, right side,
chest with <span class="SpellE">concomittant</span> pneumonia, massive and <span class="SpellE">Hemothorax</span>, wound, <span style="">in</span>cised,
palm left.</p>

<blockquote>"The stab wound was caused by a sharp bladed instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The victim <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> died in the hospital on <st1:date year="1976" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1976</st1:date> after being treated by Dr.
Soledad <span class="SpellE">Tamondong-Eugenio</span>." (pp. 99-101, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The lower court rendered
its decision against Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> only, as <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> remained at large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">Narajos</span> raised the following
assignments of errors in this appeal:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ALLOWING JUDGE VALENTINO G. TABLANG TO
RENDER THE DECISION INSTEAD OF JUDGE MACARIO C. CAMELLO WHO HEARD ALL THE
TESTIMONIES OF THE WITNESSES FOR THE PROSECUTION AND THE DEFENSE.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ACCEPTING THE VERSION OF THE PROSECUTION
AND REJECT­ING OUTRIGHT THE DEFENSE <span class="GramE">INTERPOSED BY THE
ACCUSED-APPELLANT.</span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN ITS APPRECIATION AND EVALUATION OF THE
ENTIRE EVIDENCE OF RECORD.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">IV<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The central issue raised by these assigned errors is whether or
not the trial court erred in determining the value and credibility of the
evidence presented.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, the appellant contends that the trial court made a faulty
assessment of the evidence presented because the judge who rendered the
decision did not fully hear the case from its inception.</p>

<p class="BODY">The change of judges was a result of the judiciary reorganization
which transferred jurisdiction over cases in that area from the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Isulan</span>, Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>,
<span class="GramE">Branch</span> IV to the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Tacurong</span>, Sultan <span class="SpellE">Kudarat</span>, Branch
XX.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, when the case was trans­ferred
to the latter court, its presiding judge heard only the rebuttal testimony of
Socorro <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> and the appellant's <span class="SpellE">sur</span>-rebuttal.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the contention is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A judge may <span style="">validly </span>render a decision although he has only partly heard the
testimony of witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As held in the case of <u>Villanueva
v. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span></u> (64 </span><span style="">SCRA </span><span style="">407):</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As early as <u>Ortiz v. <span class="SpellE">Aramburo</span>,
et al</u> case, (8 Phil. 98), We ruled that there is no provision of law which would
preclude a Judge of the Court of First Instance from deciding a case on the ba­sis
of the oral and documentary evidence presented before the first judge who re­signed
from the service without deciding the case, which oral evidence was taken by a
stenographer and was produced before the second judge.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This rule is rooted in practical con­siderations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes it is <span class="GramE">an impossi­bility</span>
for the judge who tried the case to be the same judicial officer to decide
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judge who tried the case may
die, resign or retire from the bench before he could render judgment
thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case, <span class="GramE">We</span> find no legal impediment to his successor's continuing
with the trial or rendering judgment on the basis of the evidence submitted if
the trial has been terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
sufficient that in such circumstances the judge, in deciding the case, must
base it completely on the cold record before him, in the same manner as
appellate courts when they review the evidence of the case raised to them on
appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant points out
that the judge made mention of only one (1) documentary exhibit with
sub-markings of the defense when there were actually thirteen (13) exhibits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the
Solicitor General's observation when he said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"We are in accord, however, with appellant on one point, i.e.,
that Judge <span class="SpellE">Tablang</span> seems to have erred in declaring
in the Preliminary Statement of his Decision that the defense sub­mitted only
Exhibits "1" to "1-M" (p. <span style="">4, </span>Decision).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The records
show that there were thirteen (13) documents presented by the defense, namely
Exhibits "1" to "13", with sub-markings ('Written Offer of
Evidence', p. 599, Records), all of which were admitted in evidence by Judge <span class="SpellE">Tablang</span> in his Order dated October 12, 1983 (p. 655,
Records).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This error is apparently due
to mere <span class="GramE">inadvertence,</span> because in his subsequent
discussion of the evidence for the defense, Judge <span class="SpellE">Tablang</span>
made reference to Exhibit "13" (medical certificate dated <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1976</st1:date> issued in
appellant's favor)." (pp. 10-11, <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span>
Brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As a matter of fact, the
thirteen (13) exhibits were submitted to Judge <span class="SpellE">Tablang</span>
and not to his predecessor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second, the appellant
contends that the trial court erred in the appreciation of the evidence
presented because the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were fraught
with inconsistencies and contradictory with the other testimonies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">There were alleged
testimonial inconsistencies regarding the mortal wound inflicted on the victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant alleges
that the testimony of Dr. Soledad <span class="SpellE">Tamondong-Eugenio</span>
that there was no exit wound at the back of the victim contradicted the
testimonies of Socorro <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> and Alejandro Gonzales
that the whole length (12 inches) of the murder weapon embedded itself in the
victim's body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> testified that the blade created a short horizontal
line wound while in <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> and Gonzales' testimonies
it could be gathered that the manner of infliction by the assailant would have
produced a vertical line-wound.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution
witnesses' testimonies <span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> <span class="SpellE">Eugenio's</span>
testimony are not actually contradictory.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Eugenio's</span></span><span style=""> testimony corroborates <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span>
and Gonzales' testimonies that the appellant was not able to thrust the whole
length of the knife into the victim's right chest because the victim held the <span class="SpellE">unembedded</span> portion of the blade with his left hand and then
with his right hand struck or twisted the appellant's hand causing the handle
which was being held by appellant to be detached from </span>the blade (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Oct. 14, 1977, pp. 2, 4; April 24, 1978, pp. 5-6).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">When these two witnesses
testified that the assail­</span>ant swung the fatal weapon at the victim by
raising it <span style="">above his head and bringing
it downwards, the wound created could well have been a horizontal line rather
than verti­cal, depending on the victim's position.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant also
pointed out that the small wound on the victim's body could not have been
caused by the </span>bolo exhibited as the murder weapon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="">the contrary, the
small wound corroborates the above-mentioned prosecution witnesses' testimonies
that the victim held unto the <span class="SpellE">unembedded</span> portion of
the </span>weapon.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We agree with the
Solicitor General that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There is nothing incredible about the declaration of Socorro <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> and Alejandro Gonzales that after <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> took possession of
the bladed weapon from appellant, Alejandro Gonzales got it from him and threw
it away while <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>
and appellant were still fighting him (<span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be
remembered that after pulling the blade of the knife from his body with his
left hand, the victim fell to the ground in a crawling position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant also fell to the ground and tried
to regain possession of the blade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a
while the victim managed to keep appellant from getting the blade by
continuously striking the ground with it but then accused <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Prado</span> rode on him and strangled him with his two
hands (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., July 15, 1977, p. 5; Nov. 28, 1977, pp.
3-7; April 24, 1978, pp. 8-10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
when Alejandro Gonzales had the chance, he grabbed the blade from the victim
and threw it away.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If he had not done
so, appellant could have retrieved it from the victim, considering that the
latter was getting weaker due to loss of blood which was spurting from his
chest wound, not to mention the fact that he was being strangled by <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, once in possession again of the
bladed weapon, appellant <span style="">would </span>have
used it immediately against the victim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Exhibit "13" (medical certificate issued on <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="9">September 20, 1976</st1:date> which shows
certain injuries suffered by appellant during the incident) and the testimonies
of Socorro <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span> and Alejandro Gonzales are not
incongruous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both witnesses did not rule
out the possibility that appellant was hit with the knife when the victim
repeatedly struck the ground with it to prevent appellant, who was then also in
a crouching position, from regaining possession thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."</span> (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1977" day="29" month="11">Nov. 29, 1977</st1:date>, pp. 4 &amp; 6; and <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="9">Sept. 29, 1978</st1:date>, p. 5).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant questions
the credibility of <span class="SpellE">Garzon</span>, wife of the deceased and
Gonzales, driver of the deceased by virtue of the fact that they were not able
to give their sworn statements to the police immediately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The delay </span>he <span style="">alleges, gave them enough time to concoct their stories.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As held in the case of </span><u>People
v. Canada</u>, <span style="">G. R. No. 63728, Sept.
15, 1986:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When there is no showing of im­proper motive on the part of
witnesses for testifying against the accused, the fact that they are related to
the victim does not render their clear and positive testimony less worthy of
full faith and credit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary,
their natural interest in serving the conviction of the guilty would deter them
from implicating persons other than the culprits, for <span style="">otherwise, the latter would thereby gain immunity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Radomes</span>, 141 SCRA 548; People v. <span class="SpellE">Jabequero</span>,<span style=""> </span>125 SCRA 144; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, <u>supra</u>).</span><u><o:p></o:p></u></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The flight of <span class="SpellE">Uldarico</span> <span class="SpellE">Prado</span>, a co-accused may be indicative of <span class="SpellE">Prado's</span> guilt but such action cannot be taken to mean that
it is only <span class="SpellE">Prado</span> who is guilty and, therefore,
exculpates the appellant from liability.</p>
