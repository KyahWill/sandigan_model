				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">An election protest was filed in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> on February 5,
1988, by <span class="SpellE">Amadeo</span> <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Jeremias</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span> in
connection with the local elections held on January 25, 1988, where they were
both candidates for councilor of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, with <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span> having been
proclaimed by the Board of Canvassers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as
</span>the 8th member of the <span class="SpellE">Sanggunian</span> (Case No.
07-88).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A petition for<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>intervention was filed by Ramon D. <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span>, Mercedes D. Barnes and Rosita Valle, all defeated
candidates for the same office, not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only
</span>against <span class="SpellE">Jeremias</span> <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span>
but also against four other candidates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually, those petitions for intervention were dismissed.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The grounds of <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span>' protest were:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>that fraud and irregularity tainted the
counting of ballots by the Board of Election Inspectors in Precincts Nos. 3, 6,
12, 14, 15, 17, 17-A and 19 (total of eight [8] precincts) for said Boards <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">illegally </span>read, counted and credited
respondents with more than 300 ballots which if recounted, including those
illegally excluded and not credited to petitioner, the latter would receive
more votes than respondent <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span>; and</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> 203 voters in
precinct 14 were not allowed to vote.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dayo</span> denied the material allegations of
the petition and, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>affirmative
defenses, averred that <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Gaasis</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">' </span>watchers never protested the minutes
of the board of election inspectors, which they in fact signed, and, during the
canvass of the votes, they did not register any protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">As counter-protest, <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span> alleged that
he could have garnered more votes had not his followers been intimidated by <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Gaasis</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>and his leaders during the campaign
and on <span class="GramE">election day</span>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The protest of <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Gaasis</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>against
<span class="SpellE">Dayo</span> (Case No. 07- 88) was, by order of the trial
court, consolidated with the protest of Rodolfo S. <span class="SpellE">Obnamia</span>
against Agnes <span class="SpellE">Devanadera</span> over the <span class="SpellE">mayorship</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> (Case
No. 06-88) "because the two (2) cases raise identical issues emanating
from the same set of facts" (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">did </span>not oppose the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="6">June 15, 1989</st1:date>,
the trial court issued a summary judgment dismissing the protests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It held:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under the circumstances, this Court must sustain the motion
of the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To begin with, the
mere fact that there is admission of the fact that the petitioner had watchers
in each of the contested precincts and yet did not record any objection in the
Minutes of the Voting and Counting of Votes is reason enough to sustain the
respondent because it has been held that objections should not only be written
but should be made before the votes reflected in the returns are tallied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guiao</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 137 SCRA 356.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then we have the fact that petitioner never did question the genuineness
and due execution of the Minutes of Voting and Counting of Votes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the minutes were made in the
performance of official duties, the contents therein are sufficient evidence of
the facts therein stated (<span class="SpellE">Geromo</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 118 SCRA 165).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The foregoing being clear from the records and have arisen from the <span class="SpellE">availment</span> of a discovery device which this Court is
ordained to maximize pursuant to Circular Order No. 13 of the Supreme Court dated
July 1, 1987, this Court has sufficient basis to render summary judgment
against petitioner." <span class="GramE">(pp. 43-44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span> appealed
to the COMELEC (EAC No. 41-89) which reversed the trial court and reinstated
the protest (Case No. 07-88) filed by <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span> against <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter
filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i> alleging that the COMELEC gravely
abused its discretion and acted in excess of its jurisdiction -<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>in failing to consider
the interrogatories in Protest Case No. 07-88 for being <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">due </span>process, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">in</span>
setting aside the trial court's summary judgment dismissing <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span>'
election protest.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition for review has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The COMELEC did not abuse its discretion in holding that
admissions made by <span class="SpellE">Obnamia</span> in his answers to the interrogatories
addressed to him by <span class="SpellE">Devanadera</span> in Protest Case No.
06-88 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">(in </span>which neither <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span> nor <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span> was a party),
could not be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">used as </span>basis for a
summary judgment dismissing Protest Case No. 07-88 filed by <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span>
against <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule on the use of interrogatories is provided in Section 1,
Rule 25 of the Rules of Court which reads as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Section 1.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Interrogatories to parties;
Service thereof.</span> ? Under the same conditions specified in Section
1 of Rule 24, any party may serve upon any adverse party written
interrogatories to be answered by the party served x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Based on the foregoing rule, public
respondent correctly observed "<span class="GramE">that</span>
interrogatories may be used only as between parties to a case" (p. 67, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Agnes T. <span class="SpellE">Devanadera</span>, respondent in Case No. 06-88 and author of the
interrogatories, and herein private respondent <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span>,
protestant in Case No. 07-88, were not <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">adverse</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>parties, despite the consolidation of
their cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, there is no
showing in the records that private respondent either agreed to the adoption
of, or was given opportunity to answer, <span class="SpellE">Devanadera's</span>
interrogatories.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The summary dismissal
of <span class="SpellE">Gaasis</span>' election protest against <span class="SpellE">Dayo</span>, based merely on interrogatories where both of them
had no participation, clearly constitutes a violation of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">That an election protest may not be disposed of by summary <span class="GramE">judgment,</span> is inferable from the following provision of the
Election Code.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Where the allegations in a protest x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">warrant,
or </span>whenever in the opinion of the court the interest of justice so
requires, it shall immediately order x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that the ballots be examined and the votes counted."
(Sec. 255, Omnibus Election Code.)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Summary judgment applies only to ordinary civil actions for the
recovery of money claims (Remedial Law Compendium by <span class="SpellE">Regalado</span>,
Vol. <span class="GramE">I, 1986 Edition, p. 209, citing the case of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span>, et al., 50
O.G. 4193).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rules on summary
judgment have no application to election protests for "beyond the narrow
personal stakes of the opposing candidates, the rights of the electorate, or
the people, are involved" (<span class="SpellE">Ong</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 22 SCRA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">241;
</span><span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de Mesa vs. <span class="SpellE">Mencias</span>,
18 SCRA 533; De Leon vs. <span class="SpellE">Guadiz</span>, 104 SCRA 591).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Expediency is not an excuse for not pursuing
to the maximum the efforts necessary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in
</span>the ascertainment of the real and actual winner in the election, by
examining the best evidence available - the ballots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By rendering a summary judgment, the trial
court denied itself the chance to directly scrutinize and appreciate the
primary evidence of the true will of the voters - the ballots.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, in an election protest, the trial
court may not make a finding that there is no genuine issue to be resolved
until and unless it shall have given the protestant a chance to substantiate
his protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">When fraud and irregularities are alleged in the protest and the
court believes the interest of justice so <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">requires,
</span>it should order that the ballots be examined and the votes counted (Sec.
255 Omnibus Election Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the court
is not satisfied that the allegations of the protest are sufficient, it should
give the protestant an opportunity to prove his allegations, instead of
dismissing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the protest on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>basis of interrogatories taken in
another case involving other parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Allegations of fraud and irregularities are sufficient grounds for
opening the ballot boxes and examining the questioned ballots (<span class="SpellE">Moguis</span> Jr. vs. CA &amp; <span class="SpellE">Bisnar</span>,
G.R. No. 66547, May 7, 1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evidence
of irregularities is not necessary to justify the revision of ballots (<span class="SpellE">Jaguros</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Villamor</span>, 134 SCRA
553).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To require parole and other
evidence on the alleged irregularities before opening the ballot box, would
only give the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span> time and opportunity to delay
the settlement of the controversy through lengthy presentation of testimonial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">evidence </span>and cross-examination (<span class="SpellE">Astorga</span> vs. Fernandez, 19 SCRA 331).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

General in his Comments on the petition:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
