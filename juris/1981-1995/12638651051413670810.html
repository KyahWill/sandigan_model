Manchester Development Corporation vs. Court of Appeals (L-75919, May 7, 1987,

petitioner's Complaint below (in Civil Case No. Q-52489), for reconstitution of
a savings account, and payment of damages and attorney's fees, be expunged; and
(2) that the case be dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also

aforesaid savings account of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> Bun Yaw by
forging his signature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This has to be

<p class="BODY">For the filing of the above Complaint, petitioner paid the sum of
P3<span class="GramE">,600.00</span> as docket fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Billie <span class="SpellE">Gan</span> and the Bank,
respectively, moved for the dismissal of the Complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, respondent <span class="SpellE">Gan</span>,
joined by the Bank, moved to expunge the said Complaint from the record for
alleged non-payment of the required docket fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="8">11 August 1988</st1:date>,
respondent Judge issued the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">questioned
Order granting the "Motion to Expunge Complaint." He explained:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It can thus be seen that while it can <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">be </span>considered at best as impliedly specifying the amount (namely,
P900,000.00, more or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">less) </span>of
what is referred to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>its par.
11 as 'missing money' (which apparently is the main part of the alleged actual
damages), the body of the complaint does not specify the following, to
wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the amount of the rest of the
alleged actual damages; the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
the alleged moral damages; the amount of the alleged exemplary damages; and,
the amount of the alleged attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As regards the alleged attorney's fees, in particular, the clause 'the
amount equivalent to twenty percent payable to her' is vague and
indefinite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It leaves to guesswork the
determination of the exact amount relative to which the 'twenty percent' shall
be reckoned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it the amount of P900<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, more </span>or less?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or is it the total amount of all the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">actual damages?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or is it the grand total amount of all the
damages -- actual, moral, and exemplary -- 'payable to her'?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As regards the prayer of the complaint, while it may be
regarded as specific enough as to the principal sum of P900,000.00 as actual
damages, it cannot <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">be </span>so regarded
with respect to the amount of moral and exemplary damages (no. 2 of the prayer)
and attorney's fees (no. 3 of the prayer); for, evidently, the phrase 'not less
than P50,000.00' in each of nos. 2 and 3 of the prayer merely fixes the minimum
amount, but it does not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">mean that
plaintiff is not praying for an unspecified sum much higher than said
minimum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And, again, the clause
'equivalent to twenty percent of all amounts reconstituted or payable to </span>her'
in no. 3 of the prayer is as vague and<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">
indefinite as</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the similar clause found </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the complaint's body referred to
earlier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What exactly is the amount
relative to which the 'twenty percent' shall be determined?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Is it the amount of P900<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
more or </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">less?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Or
is it the total amount of all the actual damages?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or is it the grand total amount of all the
damages -- </span>actual, moral, and exemplary -- 'payable to her'?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the great difference between any
of these amounts, on the one hand, and the amount of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">P50,000.00 in the phrase ‘not less than P50,000.00’ in no. 3 of the
prayer, on the other hand, is quite too obvious to need underscoring.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"Needless to state,
implicit in the </span>obligation to specify is the duty to be clear and
definite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A purported specification
which is vague and indefinite obviously is no specification, at all; indeed, it
will serve no purpose other than to evade the payment of the correct filing
fees by misleading the docket clerk in the assessment of the filing fees.</blockquote>

denies plaintiff's aforesaid ‘URGENT OMNIBUS MOTION (ETC.)' and 'OPPOSITION

plaintiff's complaint herein is hereby deemed EXPUNGED from the record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, being rendered moot and academic as

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's Motion for the reconsideration of the said Order
having been denied, she asks for its review, more properly for a Writ of <i>Certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Petition is anchored on two grounds, namely:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is true that </span><u>Manchester</u>

the body of the complaint but also in the prayer; that said damages shall be

pleading that fails to comply with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">such
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">requirement </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">shall </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

record.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">While it may be that the
body of petitioner's Complaint below was silent as to the exact amount of moral
and exemplary damages, and attorney's fees, the prayer did specify the amount
of not less than P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral and exemplary
damages, and not less than P50,000.00 as attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These amounts were definite enough and
enabled the Clerk of Court of the lower Court to compute the docket fees
payable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, the principal amount sought to be recovered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as "missing money" was fixed at
P900<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The failure to state the rate of interest demanded was not fatal not
only because it is the Courts which ultimately fix the same, but also because
Rule 141, Section 5(a) of the Rules of Court, itemizing the filing fees, speaks
of "the sum claimed, exclusive of interest." This clearly implies
that the specification of the interest rate is not that indispensable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Factually, therefore, not
everything was left to "guesswork" </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">respondent Judge has
opined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sums claimed were
ascertainable, sufficient enough to allow a computation pursuant to Rule 141,
section 5(a).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Furthermore, contrary to
the position taken by respondent Judge, the amounts claimed need not be
initially stated with mathematical precision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The same Rule 141, section 5(a) (3rd paragraph), allows an appraisal
"more or less." Thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In case the value of the property or estate or the sum
claimed is less or more in accordance with the appraisal of the court, the
difference of fee shall be refunded or paid as the case may be."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In other words, a final
determination is still to be made by the Court, and the fees ultimately found
to be payable will either be additionally paid by the party concerned or
refunded to him, as the case may be.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
above provision clearly allows an initial payment of the filing fees
corresponding to the estimated amount of the claim subject to adjustment as to
what later may be proved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
there is merit in petitioner's claim that the third paragraph of Rule 141,
Section 5(a) clearly contemplates a situation where an amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">is </span>alleged or claimed in the complaint
but is less or more than what is later proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If what is proved is less than what was claimed, then a refund will be
made; if more, additional fees will be exacted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

pattern in </span><u>Manchester</u> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
