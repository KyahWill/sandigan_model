On November 12, 1981, WE rendered a decision in this case finding that 
"Luna's discharge was discrimina­tory and constituted unfair labor 
practice . . . . He is therefore entitled to reinstatement with back 
wages. . ." (p. 223, rec.) and accordingly ordered respondent Republic 
Bank (now Republic Planters Bank)
<blockquote>
  <p> ". . . . TO IMMEDIATELY REINSTATE COMPLAINANT NORBERTO LUNA TO HIS
 FORMER POSITION WITHOUT LOSS OF SENIORITY RIGHTS AND OTHER BENEFITS AND
 INCREASES RECOGNIZED BY LAW OR GRANTED BY PRIVATE RESPONDENT DURING THE
 PERIOD OF HIS ILLEGAL DISMISSAL, WITH BACK WAGES EQUIVALENT TO THREE 
(3) YEARS WITHOUT QUALIFICATION . . ."
  </p>
  <p>
  WE even ordered that
  </p>
  <p> "THIS DECISION IS HEREBY MADE IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On November 17, 1981, upon receipt of a copy of the said decision, 
complainant Luna presented himself to the Republic Planters Bank for 
reinstatement to his former position as San Juan Branch Manager.  The 
Republic Planters Bank refused to take him back, claiming that the 
decision was still under study by the counsel of the said bank (pp. 
251-252, rec.).
</p><p>
On December 1, 1981, the Republic Planters Bank sought leave to file a 
motion for reconsideration and/or clarification (pp. 225-228, rec.).
</p><p>
On January 15, 1982, the Republic Planters Bank begged leave to forego 
the filing of a motion for recon­sideration and/or clarification, and in
 lieu thereof, submit manifestation and motion where the "immediate and 
primary concern is to bring to the attention of this Honorable Court 
certain facts and circumstances that occurred and transpired during the 
pendency of this case the due consideration of which was not properly 
brought to its attention", summarized as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "a)    The complaint for unfair labor practice was filed as early 
as 1974.  The issues and personality involved were former employees and 
officers of the old management team of the defunct Republic Bank.  Some 
have either resigned, retired and/or terminated when the new management 
of respondent Bank took over its helm in 1978; </p>
  <p> "b)    The Court's findings that the management of Republic Bank 
is guilty of unfair labor practice committed against complainant 
Norberto Luna refers to the old management of the defunct Republic Bank 
and admittedly whatever unfair labor practices committed by the <em>old</em> management to complainant Luna, the <em>present</em> management of Republic Planters Bank has nothing to do with them as they are facts and/or circumstances <em>ante bellum</em>; </p>
  <p> "c)    Likewise, the substantial change in the corporate structure
 of Republic Bank into Republic Planters Bank is not likewise reflected 
in the records of the instant case.  Undoubtedly, the records will show 
that the defunct Republic Bank was one time under receivership by the 
Central Bank of the Philippines and to save the bank from financial 
collapse, an agreement was entered into between the old stockholders of 
said bank, of course with the approval of the Central Bank that the 
Philippine Sugar Commission will buy a substantial portion of the bank's
 equity and such other government entities will also inject fresh 
capital therein to bail out the old Republic Bank from financial 
collapse and ruin.  x x x x; </p>
  <p> "d)    As a necessary consequence of change of corporate 
personality (i.e. controlling stockholders, corporate name, board 
membership, etc.) of the old Republic Bank into the present Republic 
Planters Bank, a restructuring and reorganization of the management team
 of the Republic Planters Bank was effected to give the latter new image
 and impetus as a rejuvenated and growing financial institution capable 
of adequately meeting its banking commit­ment to the public in general 
and the sugar industry in particular; </p>
  <p> "e)    To top it all, the Republic Planters Bank was made and is 
presently the financing arm of the Philippine Sugar Commission vis-a-vis
 crop loans granted to sugar planters of the country and its financial 
exposure thereto, truth to tell, save the sugar industry. </p>
  <p> "f)     Parenthetically, the take over of the Philippine Sugar 
Commission and other allied government agency of the ownership, control 
and management of the defunct Republic Bank saved it from total collapse
 and financial embarrassment; and </p>
  <p> "g)    Sad to tell, the instant case came to surface only when the
 present management of Republic Planters Bank was furnished a copy of 
the decision of this Honorable Court.  The old management did not advise
 the present management of the pendency of the case.  If it were 
accordingly advised the new management of Republic Planters Bank could 
have filed the necessary pleadings and manifestations to advise the 
Honorable Court of the foregoing changes in the corporate and management
 structure of the defunct Republic Bank" (pp. 239-241, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The following grounds were also interposed:
</p><blockquote>
  <p align="center"> "<span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx.</p>
  <p> "3.  While it can be argued that there is continuity of the 
corporate life of the defunct Republic Bank notwithstanding a change in 
its corporate name into Republic Planters Bank; nevertheless it can be 
said that in fairness and in equity to the present management of 
Republic Planters Bank it should not be made to bear and be made to 
suffer the consequence of the unfair labor practices committed by the 
former management as found by this Honorable Court against complainant 
Norberto Luna; </p>
  <p align="center"> "<span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx.</p>
  <p> "5.  The decision orders the reinstatement of Norberto Luna to his
 former position as Branch Manager of San Juan.  On this point, Republic
 Planters would like to manifest that pursuant to the organizational set
 up of the present management of Republic Planters Bank, they have to 
inject new personality, talented and professional managers enjoying its 
trust and confidence and to substitute Norberto Luna to the present 
incumbent will necessarily cause an undue disturbance in the chain of 
command under the present management vis-a-vis branch operation, and the
 incumbent branch manager thereof will himself be dislocated if the 
decision of this Honorable Court will be pursued without exception.  A 
new form of injustice and violation of security of tenure will thus be 
committed by Republic Planters Bank; </p>
  <p> "6.  Respondent Republic Planters Bank respectfully submits that 
subject order be qualified by allowing respondent Republic Planters Bank
 to reinstate Norberto Luna if still possible to his old position, and 
if not, he be given an equivalent position.  xxxx. </p>
  <p> "7.  On the second portion of the decision which requires 
respondent bank and I quote, "without loss of seniority rights and other
 benefits or increases required by law or granted by respondent during 
the period of his illegal dismissal with backwages of three years 
without qualification." Again, respondent Bank begs leave to manifest 
that while it will not contest the payment of backwages equivalent to 
three years without qualification, it will nonetheless appeal to the 
kind indulgence of this Honorable Court to harmonize its decision with 
equity and fairness.  The new management of Republic Planters Bank 
sincerely feels that to allow the grant of benefits and increases 
granted during the period of illegal dismissal will again constitute an 
undue imposition and punishment to the present management of the 
Republic Planters Bank for an injustice they have no participation 
whatsoever. </p>
  <p align="center"> "<span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx.</p>
  <p> "Secondly, it will go against accepted management principle that 
promotions and salary increases shall be based only on merit and fitness
 of subject employee.  Subject employee has to prove during his tenure 
of office that his qualification for promotion and salary increase is 
deserved.  In other words, promotion and salary increases and other 
increases cannot be presumed; it is earned by subject employee.  To our 
mind, complainant Norberto Luna does not deserve said benefits.  The 
records do not show" (pp. 241-243, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Consequently, the respondent Republic Planters Bank prayed that "the 
resolution of the Honorable Supreme Court dated November 11, 1981 be 
harmonized with the present circumstances obtaining in the instant case 
as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.    That respondent Republic Planters Bank be allowed to 
reinstate complainant Norberto Luna to an equiv­alent position without 
loss of seniority from the time of his illegal dismissal up to actual 
reinstatement; </p>
  <p> "2.    That respondent Republic Planters Bank be exempted from the
 payment of salary increases and other benefits granted by it or by law 
from date of his illegal dismissal up to actual reinstatement; </p>
  <p> "3.    That if paragraph 2 is not allowable, respondent Bank be 
allowed to deduct the income derived by complaint from other sources 
during his illegal dismissal until reinstatement.  The deduction will 
apply to both salary and wages; </p>
  <p> "4.    And finally, respondent be allowed to pay only the three 
years salary of complainant from date of dismissal without 
qualification" (pp. 243-244, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On May 25, 1982, the Solicitor General, in behalf of the respondent 
Secretary of Labor filed a manifesta­tion and motion wherein it was 
prayed that public respondent be excused from filing the corresponding 
comment referred to in the resolution of this Court dated May 10, 1982 
on the ground that "the issues being raised therein only affect the 
private interest of said bank and hence it may not be proper for public 
respondent to make a comment" (pp. 302-303, rec.).
</p><p>
On July 8, 1982, the respondent Republic Planters Bank submitted its 
sur-rejoinder to petitioner's rejoinder to private respondent's reply to
 petitioner's comment (pp. 319-322, rec.).  The Republic Planters Bank 
in its sur-rejoinder has shown that it has already paid the com­plainant
 Norberto Luna his backwages equivalent to three (3) years without 
qualification.
</p><p align="center">

</p><p>
In its generally accepted sense, reinstatement is a restoration to a 
state from which one has been removed or separated.  It is the return to
 the position from which he was removed (San Miguel Brewery, Inc. v. 
Santos and CIR, 112 Phil. 986) and assuming again the functions of the 
office already held (Abeto v. Rodas, 82 Phil. 67).
</p><p>
Reinstatement pre-supposes that the previous position from which one had
 been removed still exists, or that there is an unfilled position more 
or less of a similar nature as the one previously occupied by the 
employee (Philippine Engineering Corporation v. CIR, L-27880, September 
30, 1971, 41 SCRA 102).  In this case, reinstatement was erroneously 
ordered for the petitioner's shop was already closed, the machineries 
were dismantled and transferred to a bodega and some of the machineries 
were sold.  The Court held that "there being no more positions in the 
machine shop to which the dismissed employee, mostly welders, drill 
press operators, lathemen, tinsmith and carpenters, could be returned, 
reinstatement is not possible . . ."
</p><p>
Here in the case before US, there was no closure of shop notwithstanding
 that the respondent Republic Bank was almost at the brink of financial 
ruin.  Despite the widespread restructuring and reorganization following
 the substantial change in the corporate structure of the former 
Republic Bank into the present Republic Planters Bank, to offset the 
impending financial collapse, the position previously held by the 
complainant Norberto Luna was not abolished, but is now held by the 
incumbent manager who replaced Luna.  Although the position formerly 
held by the herein complainant is now held by another, there is every 
reason for the Republic Planters Bank to reinstate him because there is 
an "unfilled position more or less of a similar nature as the one 
previously occupied by the employee" (Philippine Engineering Corporation
 v. CIR, <em>supra</em>).  And, Section 4, Rule 1, Book VI of the implementing Rules and Regulations of the Labor Code states, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "An employee who is separated from work without just cause should be re-instated to his former position, <em>unless
 such position no longer exists, at the time of reinstatement, in which 
case he shall be given a substantially equivalent position</em> in the same establishment without loss of seniority rights" (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In Diwa ng Pagkakaisa-PAFLU v. Filtex International Corporation (L-23960
 and L-23961, February 26, 1968, 22 SCRA 739), the Court held:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Dismissal of strikers' replacements, due to court's reinstatement
 order of strikers, is not only legal but their hiring was subject to 
the outcome of the present suit or subject to the herein order.  Said 
workers must be deemed to have accepted their employment as replacements
 with the knowledge that the same is subject to the consequences of the 
labor dispute between the strikers and the company" (Norton and Harrison
 Co. and Jackbilt Concrete Blocks Co., etc., et al., L-18461, February 
10, 1967, 19 SCRA 310). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The respondent Republic Planters Bank contends that inasmuch as the 
herein case involves managerial level, the ruling in the case of Diwa ng
 Pagkakaisa - PAFLU v. Filtex International Corporation, <em>supra</em>,
 which involves rank and file employees is not in point.  The Bank 
argues that such a distinction is significant in that "the position of a
 Branch Manager relates to one of trust and confidence and therefore the
 incumbent manager of San Juan Branch who has won the trust and 
confidence of the management by reason of his capability and probity 
should not be dismissed in favor of one whose competence and integrity 
the management has not tested."
</p><p>
WE find merit in said contention.  Although there is no denying the fact
 that the complainant Norberto Luna has served the respondent Republic 
Bank for 22 years, as pointed out in the decision:  "Forgotten were his 
almost 22 years of service to the respondent Bank without any showing of
 any irregularity in the performance of his duties", the fact that he 
served "without any showing of any irregularity in the performance of 
his duties" does not prove that he has the trust and confidence of the 
Republic Planters Bank which are requisites for the position of a 
manager.  And lack of irregularities in the service does not necessarily
 prove superior competence, efficiency and integrity.
</p><p>
It must be remembered that the respondent Bank reached the point of 
almost complete financial ruin were it not for the rehabilitation 
progress initiated by the government necessitating widespread 
restructuring and reorganization of the Bank.  At that time of economic 
crisis of the respondent Bank, the herein petitioner was the manager of 
the San Juan Branch.  It cannot be said that he did not contribute, 
directly or indirectly, to the downhill economy of the respondent Bank.
</p><p>
Clearly, the respondent Bank, after surviving said crisis, and emerging 
therefrom as Republic Planters Bank, should be given the best managers. 
 Managers who can contribute to its struggle to survive.  Managers who 
have not only the capacity and efficiency but likewise they must also 
have the "proven" skill that is essential for the respondent Republic 
Planters Bank to go on and weather these times of economic difficulties.
</p><p>
The Labor Code provision on reinstatement, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Art. 280.  An employee who is unjustly dismissed from work shall 
be entitled to reinstatement without loss of seniority rights and to his
 backwages computed from the time his compensation was withheld from him
 up to the time of his reinstatement."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
is aimed to restore the situation as nearly as possible to status quo 
ante the unfair labor practice.  This requires that those deprived of a 
recognized and protected interest by violations of the law should be 
made whole so as to prevent the violator from profiting from his 
misdeeds (N.L.R.B. v. Coats and Clark, Inc. 241 F2d 556; N.L.R.B. v. J. 
H. Rutter-Rex Manufacturing Co., 245 F2d 594).  Yet the reinstatement 
remedy must always be adapted to economic-business conditions (N.L.R.B. 
v. R.C. Can Co.,, 328 F2d 974, 980; N.L.R.B. v. American Aggregate Co., 
305 F2d 599, 563-565).
</p><p>
There is no question that the Republic Planters Bank is the successor of
 the Republic Bank.  This is not disputed by the respondent Republic 
Planters Bank as can be shown in its reply to petitioner's comment, as 
follows:
</p><p>
"While respondent does not dis­pute the fact that the corporate 
personality of the old Republic Bank is continued by the present 
Republic Planters Bank, yet, as a matter of equity, it feels that it 
should not be made to bear the consequences of an unfair labor practice 
committed by the old management against complainant Luna."
</p><p>
But, in order to keep the respondent Republic Planters Bank on its feet 
once again, it had to undergo innovations to ensure recovery.  The 
respondent Republic Planters Bank actually changed its methods of 
operation and this change was motivated by economic factors.
</p><p>
Considering these "economic-business conditions" together with the 
economic crisis WE are in now, it is inevitable that these be reflected 
in the desire for efficient and productive management.  This honest 
intention can only be effectuated if the complainant Norberto Luna is 
reinstated to a substantially equivalent position without loss of 
seniority rights and the incumbent manager who is now holding the 
position formerly held by herein complainant be allowed to continue with
 his "tested" competence and integrity in the management of the San Juan
 Branch of the Republic Planters Bank.
</p><p align="center">
II
</p><p>
Furthermore, the complainant Norberto Luna who is known to be "active 
and militant in the defense of union rights" should have informed the 
management of the Republic Planters Bank of the pendency of the herein 
case.  Aware as he is of the distressed condition of the then Republic 
Bank being at that time a manager of the said Bank, it is most unlikely 
that the complainant closed his eyes to whatever developments there 
might be regarding the Republic Planters Bank.  It cannot be said that 
he was ignorant of the take-over by the government of the defunct 
Republic Bank to "save it from total collapse and financial 
embarrassment" in 1978.
</p><p>
From 1978 to November 17, 1981, the herein com­plainant remained passive
 and silent.  He did not go to the Republic Planters Bank and inform 
them of the herein case.  Neither did he, through his counsel, inform 
this Court of the take-over and change in the management of the Republic
 Planters Bank.  The complainant herein remained complacent and just 
waited for this Court's decision.  It was only on November 17, 1981 that
 the complainant Norberto Luna acted, upon receipt of this Court's 
decision.  He must then face the consequences of his inactivity.
</p><p align="center">
III
</p><p>
WE find meritorious the contention of the Republic Planters Bank that 
"increases and benefits are to be earned; they do not attach 
automatically to the length of service of subject employee."
</p><p>
Although backwages are compensation to which an employee is entitled, by
 reason of his continued status as an employee (N.L.R.B. v. Killoren 
[CA8 Mo] 122 F2d 613, 137 ALR 510) since an illegally dismissed employee
 is considered as not having left his office (Cristobal v. Melchor, 
L-43203, December 29, 1980, 101 SCRA 857), mere continuance as an 
employee does not qualify him for benefits and increases.  Benefits and 
increases are allowed because of outstanding performance of duties and 
not solely because of length of service.
</p><p>
The rule that an employer cannot be heard to assert that wages are 
ordered to be paid for services which were not performed, for it was the
 employer's own unlawful conduct which deprived the employee of his 
opportunity to render service (Mitchell v. Robert De Mario Jewelry, Inc.
 361 US 288, L ed. 2d 323, 80 SCt 332), does not apply in the herein 
case for it was the management of the old Republic Bank which caused the
 unlawful discharge of Norberto Luna and not the new management of the 
successor and rehabilitated Republic Planters Bank.  It would be 
inequitable for this Court to order the Republic Planters Bank to grant 
increases to herein complainant Norberto Luna for the Republic Planters 
Bank had no hand in the illegal discharge of Norberto Luna.  And, to do 
so would unduly burden the newly rehabilitated Republic Planters Bank 
which, were it not for the take-over by the government, there would be 
no bank, Republic Bank or Republic Planters Bank to speak of.  And there
 would be no job for Norberto Luna to go back to.
</p><p>
However, WE cannot allow the Republic Planters Bank to make deductions 
from the three (3) year back­wages it has already paid to the 
complainant Norberto Luna.  Equity must operate in favor of the employee
 equally as it favors the employer.
</p><p>
The Court may set fixed amounts of backwages without any reference to 
deduction (Radio Communications of the Philippines v. Philippine 
Communications Electronics and Electricity Workers Federation [FCWF], 
L-37662, July 15, 1975, 65 SCRA 82).  The rationale behind this has been
 enunciated in a long line of cases, to reiterate:
</p><p>
"This formula of awarding reasonable net backwages without deduction or 
qualification relieves the employee from proving or disproving their 
earnings during their lay-off and the employers from submitting 
counterproofs, and obviates the twin evils of idleness on the part of 
the employee who would 'with folded arms remain inactive to the 
expectation that a windfall would come to him' (Itogon Suyoc Mines, Inc.
 v. Sangilo­-Itogon Workers Union, 24 SCRA 873 [1968], cited in Diwa ng 
Pagkakaisa v. Filtex International, 43 SCRA 287 [1972] per Makalintal, 
now C.J.) and attrition and protracted delay in satisfying such award on
 the part of unscrupulous employers who have seized upon the further 
proceedings to determine the actual earnings of the wrongfully dismissed
 or laid-off employees to hold unduly extended hearings for each and 
every employee awarded backwages and thereby compel the employee to 
agree to unconscionable settlements of their backwages award in order to
 satisfy their dire need" (Feati University Faculty Club [PAFLU] v. 
Feati University, L-31503, August 15, 1974, 53 SCRA 395, 418 cited in 
Air Manila, Inc. v. CIR, L-39742, June 9, 1978, 83 SCRA 588; see also 
Bachrach Motor Co., Inc. v. CIR, 86 SCRA 27, Visayan Stevedore 
Transportation Co. v. CIR, 7 SCRA 271).
</p><p>
An employer is entitled to deduct from what the Court orders to be paid 
as backwages, privileges, etc., whatever an employee has earned 
elsewhere during the period for which backwages are supposed to be paid.
  Such qualification must be considered implied in all judgments 
ordering reinstatement, unless otherwise expressly ordered for reasons 
the Court may deem justified (Cruz v. Philippine Association of Free 
Labor Unions, [PAFLU], 42 SCRA 68; Philippine Fiber Processing Co., Inc.
 v. CIR, 52 SCRA 110) as in the decision herein dated November 12, 1981,
 where WE ordered:
</p><p>
"He is therefore entitled to reinstatement with back wages pursuant to 
the policy to decree back wages not exceeding three (3) years <em>without
 requiring the parties to submit proof of compensation received from 
other sources at the time of illegal dismissal until actual 
reinstatement, in order that judgment in favor of an employee or laborer
 can be executed without delay </em>(Luzon Stevedoring Corp. v. CIR, 61 SCRA 162)" [Italics supplied, p. 223, rec.].
</p><p>
This policy must be decreed to ensure that the employee would be 
protected, not merely in the exercise of their right of 
self-organization, collective bargaining, security of tenure and just 
and humane conditions of work, but likewise against the economic 
consequences of a legitimate assertion of these rights.
</p><p>
    WHEREFORE, INASMUCH AS THE REPUBLIC PLANTERS BANK HAS ALREADY PAID 
THE COMPLAINANT NORBERTO LUNA HIS BACKWAGES EQUIVALENT TO THREE (3) 
YEARS WITHOUT QUALIFICATION, RESPONDENT REPUBLIC PLANTERS BANK IS HEREBY
 ORDERED:
  </p>
<blockquote>
    <p>
      1.  TO IMMEDIATELY REINSTATE THE COMPLAINANT NORBERTO LUNA TO AN 
EQUIVALENT POSITION WITHOUT LOSS OF SENIORITY RIGHTS FROM THE TIME OF 
HIS ILLEGAL DISMISSAL UP TO ACTUAL REINSTATEMENT; AND
    </p>
    <p>
      2.  NOT TO MAKE ANY DEDUCTIONS FROM THE THREE YEARS BACKWAGES ALREADY PAID TO NORBERTO LUNA.
    </p>
    <p>
      THIS RESOLUTION IS HEREBY MADE IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY.
    </p>
    <p>
      SO ORDERED.
