two employees of Building Care Corporation, which provides janitorial and other
specific services to various firms, to compel Far East Bank and Trust Company
to recognize them as its regular employees and be paid the same wages which its
employees receive.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Building Care Corporation
(BCC, for brevity), in the proceedings below, established that it had
substantial capitalization of </span><s>P</s>1 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Million or a stockholders equity of </span><s>P</s>1.5 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Million.  Thus the Labor Arbiter ruled that BCC was only job contracting and that
consequently its employees were not employees of Far East Bank and Trust
Company </span>(FEBTC, for brevity).  On
appeal, this factual finding was affirmed by respondent National Labor
Relations Commission (NLRC, for brevity).  Nevertheless, petitioners insist before us that BCC is engaged in
"labor-only" contracting hence, they conclude, they are employees of
respondent FEBTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners Virginia G. Neri and Jose Cabelin applied for
positions with, and were hired by, respondent BCC, a corporation engaged in
providing technical, maintenance, engineering, housekeeping, security and other
specific services to its clientele.  They were assigned to work in the Cagayan de Oro City Branch of
respondent FEBTC on 1 May 1979 and 1 August 1980, respectively, Neri as
radio/telex operator and Cabelin as janitor, before being promoted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to </span>messenger on 1 April 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 June 1989, petitioners instituted complaints against FEBTC
and BCC before Regional Arbitration Branch <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">No. </span>10 of the Department of Labor and Employment to compel the
bank to accept them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>regular
employees and for it to pay the differential between the wages being paid them
by BCC and those received by FEBTC employees with similar length of service.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 November 1989, the Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint
for lack of merit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent BCC was considered an independent contractor because it proved it
had substantial capital.  Thus,
petitioners were held to be regular employees of BCC, not FEBTC.  The dismissal was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">appealed to NLRC which on 28 September 1990 affirmed the decision on
appeal.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

reconsideration of its affirmance,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> prompting petitioners to seek redress from
this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioners vehemently
contend that BCC is engaged in "labor-only" contracting because it
failed to adduce evidence purporting to show that it invested in the form of
tools, equipment, machineries, work premises and other materials </span>which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">are necessary in the conduct of its
business.  Moreover, petitioners argue
that they perform duties which are directly related to the principal business
or operation of FEBTC.  If the
definition of "labor-only" contracting</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> is to be read in conjunction with job
contracting,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> then the only logical conclusion is that BCC
is a "labor-only" contractor.   Consequently, they must be deemed employees of respondent bank </span>by
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">operation of law since BCC is merely an
agent of FEBTC following the doctrine </span>laid down in<i> Philippine </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Bank of </span>Communications v. </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">National Labor </span>Relations Commission</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
where we ruled that where "labor-only" contracting exists, the Labor
Code itself establishes an employer-employee relationship between the employer
and the employees of the "labor-only" contractor; hence, FEBTC should
be considered the employer of petitioners who are deemed its employees through
its agent, "labor-only" contractor BCC.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot sustain the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent BCC need not prove that it made investments in the
form of tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, because it
has established that it has sufficient capitalization.  The Labor Arbiter and the NLRC both
determined that BCC had a capital stock of <s>P</s>1 million fully subscribed
and paid for.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
BCC is therefore a highly capitalized venture and cannot be deemed engaged in
"labor-only" contracting.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well-settled that there is "labor-only"
contracting where:  (a) the person
supplying workers to an employer does not have substantial capital <u>or</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>investment in the form of tools,
equipment, machineries, work premises, among others; <u>and</u>, (b) the workers
recruited and placed by such person are performing activities which are
directly related to the principal business of the employer.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 106 of the Labor Code defines "labor-only"
contracting thus -<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Art. 106.  <i>Contractor or
subcontractor</i>.  - x x x x There is
"labor-only" contracting where the person supplying workers to an
employer does not have substantial capital <u>or</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>investment in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">form </span>of
tools, equipment, machineries, work premises, among others, <u>and</u> the
workers recruited by such persons are performing activities which are directly
related to the principal business of such employer x x x x (underscoring
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Based on the foregoing,
BCC cannot be considered a "labor-only" contractor because it has
substantial capital.  While there may be
no evidence that it has investment in the form of tools, equipment,
machineries, work premises, among others, it is enough that it has substantial
capital, as was established before the Labor Arbiter as well as the NLRC.  In other words, the law does not require </span><u>both</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">substantial capital and investment in
the form of tools, equipment, machineries, etc.  This is clear from the use of the conjunction
"or".  If the intention was to
require the contractor to prove that he has both capital and the requisite
investment, then the conjunction "and" should have been used.  But, having established that it has
substantial capital, it was no longer necessary for BCC to further adduce
evidence to prove that it does not fall within the purview of
"labor-only" contracting.  There
is even no need for it to refute </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, the Court has already taken judicial notice of
the general practice adopted in several government <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

nevertheless, they are not necessary in the conduct of the principal business
of the employer.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In fact, the status of
BCC as an independent contractor was previously confirmed by this </span>Court
in <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Associated Labor Unions-TUCP v.

<p class="BODY">Even assuming <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ex
argumenti</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> that petitioners
were </span>performing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">activities
directly related to the principal business of the bank, under the "right
of control" test they </span>must still be considered employees of
BCC.  In the case of petitioner Neri, it
is admitted that FEBTC issued a job description which detailed her functions as
a radio/telex operator.  However, a
cursory reading of the job description shows that what was sought to be
controlled by FEBTC was actually the end-result of the task, e.g., that the
daily incoming and outgoing telegraphic transfer of funds received and relayed
by her, respectively, tallies with that of the register.  The guidelines were laid down merely to
ensure that the desired end-result was achieved.  It did not, however, tell Neri how the radio/telex machine should
be operated.  In the <i>Shipside </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">case,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>we ruled -</p>

occasionally issued instructions to them, that alone does not in the least
detract from the fact that only STEVEDORES is the employer of the private
respondents, for in legal contemplation, such instructions carry no more weight
than mere requests, the privity of contract being between SHIPSIDE and
STEVEDORES x x x x</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Besides, petitioners do
not deny that they were selected and hired by BCC before being assigned to work
in the Cagayan de Oro Branch of FEBTC.  BCC likewise acknowledges that petitioners are its employees.  The record </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">replete with evidence disclosing that BCC maintained supervision and
control over petitioners through its Housekeeping and Special Services
Division:  petitioners reported for work
wearing the prescribed uniform of BCC; </span>leaves of absence were filed
directly with BCC; and, salaries were drawn only from BCC.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As a matter of fact, Neri even secured a certification from BCC
on 16 May 1986 that she was employed by the latter.  On the other hand, on 24 May 1988, Cabelin filed a complaint for
underpayment of wages, non-integration of salary adjustments mandated by Wage
Orders Nos. 5 &amp; 6 and R.A. 6640 as well as for illegal deduction<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
against BCC alone which was provisionally dismissed on 19 August 1988 upon
Cabelin’s manifestation that his money claim was negligible.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, under the terms and conditions of the contract,
it was BCC alone which had the power to reassign petitioners.  Their deployment to FEBTC was not subject to
the bank's acceptance.  Cabelin was
promoted to messenger because the FEBTC branch manager promised BCC that two
(2) additional janitors would be hired from the company if the promotion was to
be effected.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, BCC was to be paid in lump sum unlike in the situation in <i>Philippine
Bank of Communications</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
where the contractor, CESI, was to be paid at a daily rate on a per person
basis.  And, the contract therein
stipulated that the CESI was merely to provide manpower that would render
temporary services.  In the case at bar,
Neri and Cabelin were to perform specific special services.  Consequently, petitioners cannot be held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">to </span>be employees of FEBTC as BCC
"carries an independent business" and undertakes the performance of
its contract with various clients according to its "own manner and method,
free from the control and supervision" of its principals in all matters
"except as to the results thereof.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, the facts in <i>Philippine Bank of Communications</i> do
not square with those of the instant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">case.  </span>Therein, the Court ruled that CESI
was a "labor-only" contractor because upholding the contract between
the contractor and the bank would in effect permit employers to avoid the
necessity <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">of </span>hiring regular or
permanent employees and would enable them to keep their employees indefinitely
on a temporary or casual basis, thus denying them security of tenure in their
jobs.  This of course violates the Labor
Code.  BCC has not committed any violation.  Also, the former case was for illegal
dismissal; this case, on the other hand, is for conversion of employment status
so that petitioners can <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">receive </span>the
same salary being given to regular employees of FEBTC.  But, as herein determined, petitioners are
not regular employees of FEBTC but of BCC.  At any rate, the finding that BCC is a qualified independent contractor
precludes us from applying the <i>Philippine Bank of </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Communications</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>doctrine to the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The determination of employer-employee relationship involves
factual findings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Absent any grave abuse of discretion, and we find none in the case before us,
we are bound by the findings of the Labor Arbiter as affirmed by respondent
NLRC.</p>
