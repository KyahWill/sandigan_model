				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>BELLOSILLO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The doctrine is undisputed that no court has the power to
interfere by injunction with the judgments or orders of another court of
concurrent jurisdiction <span style="">having the
power to grant the </span>relief sought by injunction.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> But
this has not dissuaded respondent Judge Julito B. Valenciano from issuing the
controversial restraining order of 21 October 1992 for which he is now
administratively charged.</p>

<p class="BODY">The factual antecedents:  On 19 October 1992, complainant Renato V. Aquino filed an amended
complaint for robbery before the Municipal Trial Court of Buhi, Camarines Sur,
against Romeo Matias, Jim Boquiron, Aniano Lascano and several John Does.  He alleged therein that the accused except
Lascano, in conspiracy with one another, with intent to gain and by means of
violence and intimidation, unlawfully took ninety-six (96) fish cages belonging
to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aniano Lascano was impleaded as an accessory because he was
purportedly found to be in possession and control of said cages.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the day the amended complaint was filed, Judge Jacinto J.
Peñaflor conducted the requisite preliminary investigation and thereafter
issued a search and seizure order commanding any peace officer "to make an
immediate search <span style="">x x x </span>of (Lake Bato) and forthwith seize and take possession of
the following personal property <span style="">x x x x
</span>96 fish cages with a combined measurement of 10 x 15 x 4 meters and 8 x
17 x 4 meters made of plastic nylon and bring said property to the undersigned
to be dealt with as the law directs."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 October 1992, while the law enforcement officers were about
to finish implementing the order, respondent Judge Jullito B. Valenciano of the
Municipal Circuit Trial Court of Polangui-Libon, Albay, granted an urgent <i style=""><span style="">ex-parte</span></i><span style=""> </span>petition
for the issuance of a restraining order and/or writ of preliminary injunction
filed by Romeo Matias as an incident to a complaint for grave coercion<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
against herein complainant Renato V. Aquino and others directing the accused
"to desist from uprooting and gathering the fish cages belonging to Romeo
Matias located within the territorial jurisdiction of Libon, Albay (of Bato
Lake), upon receipt of this order.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
However, the order was not successfully implemented because the act sought to
be restrained had already been accomplished.  The fish cages were already placed in the possession of the Police
Station at Bato, Camarines Sur.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In Crim. Case No. 7124-L, Matias alleged that the accused
compelled him to leave Lake Bato so that they could freely seize the fish cages
installed in his fishing concession.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> On 3
November 1992, he filed two (2) additional cases against complainants Rafael
Aquino, Sr., Renato V. Aquino and several John Does:  Crim. Case No. 7127-L for robbery on 20 October 1992 of five (5)
fish cages owned by him,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> and
Crim. Case No. 7128-L for robbery on 21 October 1992 of fifty (50) fish cages
likewise owned by him.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> On 26
November 1992, warrants of arrest were issued in these last two (2) cases by
respondent Judge.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the foregoing circumstances, complainants now
charge respondent Judge with gross ignorance of the law, abuse of authority,
bias and malicious attempt to hinder, delay and frustrate the administration of
justice.  They assert that in his order
dated 21 October 1992, respondent Judge already knew of the existence of the
search and seizure order issued on 19 October 1992 by Judge Peñaflor over the
same fish cages.  The pertinent portion
of the order of respondent Judge reads –</p>

<blockquote>x <span style="">x
x x </span>After the testimony of the petitioner (Matias) and his witnesses
wherein it was alleged among other things that the petitioner is the owner of
some 200 fishing cages in Bato Lake and within the territorial jurisdiction of
Buga, Libon Albay, which fishing nets x <span style="">x
x </span>are being uprooted and taken away by the accused Renato Aquino,
Avelino Enriquez, and several other Peter Does <u>by virtue of an alleged  search and seizure warrant issued by the
Honorable  Municipal Judge of Buhi,
Camarines Sur x x x x </u><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Notwithstanding such knowledge of the
order of Judge Peñaflor, respondent Judge directly interfered with and countermanded
the same by issuing his restraining order in question.  Also, he should not have taken cognizance of
and acted favorably on the aforementioned three (3) criminal cases because no
grave coercion or robberies were perpetrated by complainants herein (accused
therein) on 20 and 21 October 1992.  The
fish cages were seized by police authorities by virtue of a lawful search and
seizure order.  Assuming that respondent
Judge actually believed that complainants were innocent of the charges, his
persistence in taking cognizance thereof manifested his bias in favor of
Matias.  This conclusion is supported by
his remarks in Bicolano to complainant Renato V. Aquino after the latter's
arrest:  "<i>ARAM CO MAN AN TUNGKOL
SA INDO NA DOWA, KAYA AREGLOHON </i><i><span style="">NA
LANG NINYO YAN</span></i><span style="">" </span>(I know what is between the two of you [referring to
Renato V. Aquino and Romeo Matias], so you better settle it).<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, complainants have verified that Matias and respondent Judge are <i style=""><span style="">compadres</span></i><span style="">.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment and answer, respondent Judge contends that on 21
October 1992 he issued two (2) other orders in Crim. Case No. 7124-L:  one requiring Aquino, et al. to show cause
within ten (10) days from receipt thereof why the petition for the issuance of
a writ of injunction should not be granted,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> and
another, directing them to appear and submit counter-affidavits on 3 November
1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
On 22 October 1992, Renato V. Aquino filed a motion to quash the restraining
order and set the same for consideration on 3 November 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
However, neither Renato V. Aquino nor his counsel appeared.  Consequently, the promise of Aquino's
counsel to furnish the trial court with copy of the alleged search and seizure
order did not materialize and respondent Judge was never given a chance to <span style="">see </span>and
know the existence of said order except in the present case.  Furthermore, considering that the
complainants could not be served with summons/subpoena, respondent Judge was
persuaded to archive the grave coercion and robbery cases and to issue warrants
of arrest against them on 26 November 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Renato V. Aquino and Avelino Enriquez were finally subpoenaed on
17 December 1992.  However, despite the
lapse of the period for the filing of their counter-affidavits in the robbery
cases, they failed to do so.  Consequently, in his resolution of 29 December 1992, respondent Judge
forwarded the records of Crim. Cases <span style="">Nos. </span>7127-L and 7128-L to the Office of the
Provincial Prosecutor of Albay for appropriate action after finding probable
cause <span style="">for </span>the crime charged and
for the reason that the crime of robbery was cognizable by the Regional Trial
Court<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
It is thus clear that he was not aware of the filing and pendency of Crim. Case
<span style="">No. 494 </span>and the issuance of the
search and seizure order at the time the three (3) criminal cases were filed
and the restraining order issued.  The
allegation that he manifested partiality in favor of Matias is baseless and a
mere conclusion of complainants.</p>

<p class="BODY">Investigating Judge Rafael P. Santelices of the Regional Trial
Court of Legazpi City resolved the contentions of respondent Judge in this
manner -</p>

<blockquote>Respondent alleged that he does not know that a search and seizure
order was issued by Judge Peñaflor because he was not shown a copy
thereof.  However, in his temporary
restraining order <span style="">x x </span>x there
was mentioned an alleged search warrant issued by Judge Peñaflor.  Even if respondent was not shown a copy
thereof, he has knowledge about a supposed search warrant issued by a court of
coordinate and equal rank.  Prudence
should have dictated respondent to act with caution, verify and be sure whether
or not there really was issued such a process or order <span style="">x x </span>x <span style="">x<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Likewise, ‘the doctrine is undisputed that no court has the power
to interfere by injunction with the judgment or orders of another court of
concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction, having the power to grant the relief
sought by injunction’ <span style="">(</span><i style="">Investors’ Finance Corp. v. Ebarle, et al.,
163 SCRA 60</i><span style="">;</span><i style=""> Cojuangco v. Villegas, et al., G.R. No.

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Judge Santelices concluded that
respondent Judge "in a way committed the infractions as charged in the
complaint" and therefore recommended that he be fined an amount equivalent
to his one month salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Court Administrator on the other hand, through
Deputy Court Administrator Reynaldo L. Suarez, recommends a fine of P5,000.00
"for respondent Judge's attempted act of interference with the proceedings
of a court of co-equal jurisdiction."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge cannot invoke lack of knowledge of the existence
of the search and seizure order simply because of the alleged absence of
concrete evidence to that effect by complainants at the time he issued the
restraining order.  The fallacy of this
argument is readily discernible as the complainants were not given any chance
to establish that concrete evidence prior to the issuance of the restraining
order.  Moreover, it was explicitly
stated in the restraining order that the fishing cages allegedly owned by
Matias were being uprooted and taken away by Aquino and his group <u>by virtue
of an alleged search and seizure order issued by the Municipal Judge of Buhi,
Camarines Sur</u>.  This information was
conveyed to respondent Judge through the testimonies of Matias himself and his
witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are in conformity with the observation of the Investigating
Judge that prudence should have prompted respondent Judge to act with caution
and verify the existence of the search and seizure order, instead of
precipitately issuing the restraining order.  The explanation proffered by respondent Judge, i. e., to protect the
interest of Matias over the fish cages without anybody unjustly enriching
himself because of the continuation of the action which may turn out to be
unlawful, is not a sound justification for doing so.  Precisely, the allegation of Matias on the existence of the
search and seizure order has sufficiently cast doubt on his alleged
interest.  We have already ruled that
only in case of probable irreparable injury to the applicant may such a
restraint without <span style="">a </span>hearing be granted.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent Judge should have likewise taken into account the consequence of
issuing a restraining order in the event a search and seizure order emanating
from a co-equal court actually exists, that is, he would be interfering with
the order of another court of equal jurisdiction.  The rule is that no court <span style="">has
the power to interfere by injunction with the judgments or orders of another
court of concurrent or coordinate jurisdiction possessing equal power to grant
injunctive relief.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, in issuing the restraining order, respondent Judge not
only gravely abused his discretion but also interfered with the order of a
co-equal court albeit frustrated by late implementation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainants do not dispute the assertions of respondent Judge
that they did not appear in the scheduled hearing on 3 November 1992; that
since they could not be served with summons/subpoena, respondent Judge was
persuaded to issue the warrants of arrest against them; and, that when Renato V.
Aquino and Avelino Enriquez were finally served the subpoena and copy of the
criminal complaints against them, still they did not file any
counter-affidavits.  In this regard,
respondent Judge was not at fault when he relied solely on the evidence of Matias
in finding the existence of probable cause against complainants in the three
(3) cases.  As in fact, Sec. 3, par.
(d), Rule 112<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure requires the investigating officer to
base his resolution on the evidence presented by the complainant if the
respondent cannot be subpoenaed, or if subpoenaed, does not submit
counter-affidavits within the ten-day period.  Renato V. Aquino may have stated in his motion to quash the restraining
order:</p>

<blockquote>3.  That the uprooting and
gathering of fish cages were done in compliance with an order of the Hon. Court
of Buhi, Camarines Sur dated October 19, 1992 in connection with Crim. Case No.
494 for Robbery filed by Renato Aquino against Romeo Matias, et. al. x x x x<span style=""> </span><a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">however, since he and his counsel failed
to appear in the scheduled 3 November 1992 hearing, this is nothing but a bare
allegation which was properly disregarded by respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other alleged facts constituting bias in favor of Matias and
malicious attempt to hinder, delay and frustrate the administration of justice
by respondent Judge, for want of substantial basis, do not deserve any
consideration.  Mere suspicion is not
enough.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Equally baseless is the common perception that respondent Judge
took cognizance of the robbery cases (Crim. Case Nos. 7127-L and 7128-L)
despite the indubitable fact that the P200,000.00 value of the assorted fish
cages was beyond the jurisdiction of the MTC.  In fairness to Judge Valenciano, he only conducted the preliminary
investigation over the robbery cases and upon a finding of "a probable
cause for the crime charged x <span style="">x x </span>and
for the reason that the <span style="">said </span>crime
is cognizable by the Regional Trial Court <span style="">x </span><span style="">x x" </span>forthwith issued a resolution forwarding the <span style="">case </span>to the Regional Trial Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The disputed restraining order he issued was in connection with the grave
coercion case (Crim. Case <span style="">No. 7124-L).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, for issuing in grave abuse of discretion the
subject temporary restraining order that would interfere with or frustrate the
implementation of <span style="">an </span>order of
another court of co-equal jurisdiction, respondent Judge Julito B. Valenciano
should be as he is hereby FINED P15,000.00 with WARNING that a commission of
