				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The principal issue raised in the special civil action of
prohibition at bar is whether or not a writ of possession issued by a Court of
First Instance (Regional Trial Court) in accordance with Act 3135, to give
possession of property sold at an extra-judicial foreclosure sale to the
purchaser thereof, may be enforced against persons other than the mortgagor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The property in question consists of two (2) parcels of land and
the apartment and commercial building thereon standing, located at <st1:street><st1:address>R.
  <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>,
Sta. Mesa, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A mortgage was constituted over this property
by its owner then, Universal Ventures, Inc., in favor of <span class="SpellE">Banco</span>
Filipino Mortgage &amp; Savings Bank, as security for the payment of a loan of
P350<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a> The mortgage deed authorized the
extra-judicial foreclosure of the property in the event of default in the
repayment of the loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was later
amended to extend to and cover an additional and total consolidated loan of
P400<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a> Universal Ventures, Inc. failed to
repay the loan. Consequently, <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> Filipino caused
the extra-judicial foreclosure of the property by the City Sheriff of
Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The foreclosure sale took place
in due course; the mortgaged property was struck off to the bank, as highest
bidder; and the bank registered the sheriff’s certificate of sale with the
Register of Deeds of Manila and on July 27, 1976 obtained a certificate of
title in its name, numbered 122496, in lieu of that of the mortgagor, which was
accordingly cancelled.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the same day that title was issued to it, <span class="SpellE">Banco</span>
Filipino filed a petition for a writ of possession with the Court of First
Instance of Manila.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
The petition recited the foregoing facts and the additional circumstances that
(1) the mortgagor, Universal Ventures, Inc., had failed to redeem the property
within the one-year period allowed by law, and (2) the mortgagor was still in
possession of the property, as well as certain other persons claiming rights
under said mortgagor although said rights had not been recorded in the Register
of Deeds, and prayed -</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"
...</span> that after due notice and hearing, ** (the) Court forthwith issue in
accordance with Section 7 of Act No. 3135, as amended by Act No. 4118, a writ
of possession of the property in favor of the petitioner and against the
respondent and all persons claiming under it, to vacate the premises** covered
by and embraced in (the mortgagor's title,) Transfer Certificate of Title No.
67992 of the Register of Deeds of Manila."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Among the persons named in the petition
as "claiming (rights) under" Universal Ventures, Inc. were
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span>,
Barbara Brown, and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> Monzon.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
The petition contained a "Notification" addressed to the Clerk of
Court to set the hearing thereon on <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="7">July
 30, 1976</st1:date> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time>

persons alleged to be claiming rights under it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After hearings were had on the petition, Judge <span class="SpellE">Herminio</span> Mariano issued the order now assailed, under date
of September 20, 1979, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, let the corresponding Writ of Possession be issued

other persons claiming under said respondent.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The writ of possession issued on <st1:date year="1980" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1980</st1:date> and on the strength thereof, the Sheriff of
Manila attempted to evict the persons in occupancy of the property.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">6</span></span></a></p>

<span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span>, Barbara Brown, and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Monzon</span>, filed suit against <span class="SpellE">Banco</span>
Filipino and the City Sheriff in the same Court of First Instance of Manila
seeking to perpetually restrain the enforcement of the writ of possession
against them, and to recover damages resulting from the defendants' attempts to
enforce it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>
The action was docketed as Civil Case No. 132075.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In their complaint, they alleged that they
were occupying their respective premises in the foreclosed property "by
virtue of a verbal lease contract with Universal Ventures, Inc.," that <i>"there
being no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case filed against them neither
were they made a party to the Petition for Writ of Possession of defendant
BANCO FILIPINO **," </i>they were entitled to remain in possession and
could not be ousted under the writ of possession; moreover, <i>"under
Presidential Decree No. 20 and Batas<b> </b><span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 25, transfer of ownership whether by virtue of sale or

<p class="BODY">Fourteen (14) days later, these same persons -- <span class="SpellE">Enrico</span> <span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span>, Barbara Brown and
<span class="SpellE">Bonifacia</span> <span class="SpellE">Monzon</span> -- and <span class="SpellE">Enrico's</span> wife, <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Malonzo</span>, instituted a second action, this time, a special
civil action for prohibition, commenced in this Court by petition dated <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Named respondents were the same defendants in
Civil Case No. 132075 -- <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> Filipino and the City
Sheriff of Manila -- as well as Judge Mariano, who had issued the writ of
possession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petition recited
substantially the same facts as those set out in the complaint in Civil Case
No. 132075, and submitted the same thesis, that they could not be evicted from
the premises <i>"there being no <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case
filed against them neither were they made a party to the petition for writ of
possession filed by respondent Bank," </i>and <i>"under Presidential

**.”<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Section 7 of Act 3135, as amended by Act 4118, grants to the
purchaser at an extra-judicial foreclosure sale, an absolute right to
possession of the property sold during the one-year period of redemption and <i>a
fortiori, </i>after<i> </i>the lapse of said period without any redemption
being made.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
Possession may be obtained under a writ which may be applied for <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></i>Section 7
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 7.</span> In any sale made under the
provisions of this Act, the purchaser may petition the Court of First Instance
of the province or place where the property or any part thereof is situated, to
give him possession thereof during the redemption period, furnishing bond in an
amount equivalent to the use of the property for a period of twelve months, to
indemnify the debtor in case it be shown that the sale was made without
violating the mortgage or without complying with the requirements of this Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such petition shall be made under oath and
filed in form of an <i>ex <span class="SpellE">parte</span> </i>motion in the
registration or cadastral proceedings if the property is registered, or in
special proceedings in the case of property registered under the Mortgage Law
or under section one hundred and ninety-four of the Administrative Code or of
any other real property encumbered with a mortgage duly registered in the
office of any register of deeds in accordance with any existing law, and in
each case the clerk of the court shall, upon the filing of such petition,
collect the fees specified in paragraph eleven of section one hundred and
fourteen of Act Numbered Four hundred and ninety-six, as amended by Act
Numbered Twenty-eight hundred and sixty-six, and the court shall, upon approval
of the bond, order that a writ of possession issue, addressed to the sheriff of
the province in which the property is situated, who shall execute said order
immediately.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">There being no dispute about the fact
that no redemption had been made within one (1) year from registration of the
extra-judicial foreclosure sale, there can be no question about the absolute
right of <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> Filipino, as purchaser, to a writ of
possession<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a>,
or stated otherwise, the ministerial duty of the Court to issue the writ,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
upon mere motion, without need of instituting a separate action for the
purpose.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a>
The question is whether or not that writ of possession -- which is the final
process to carry out or consummate the extra-judicial foreclosure of the
mortgage -- may be enforced by the sheriff against persons other than the
mortgagor who are in occupancy of the foreclosed property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To this question this Court has already had
occasion to give an affirmative answer, grounded particularly on the provisions
of Section 35, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court which are <i>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span> </i><span class="SpellE">suppletory</span> to Act 3135.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">4</span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Under section 6 of Act No. 3135 and Sections 29 to 31 and
section 35 of Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court, in case of an
extra-judicial foreclosure of a real estate mortgage, the possession of the
property sold may be given to the purchaser by the sheriff after the period of
redemption had expired, <i><u>unless a third person is actually holding the
property adversely to the mortgagor</u>.</i><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An ordinary action for the recovery of possession is not necessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no law in this jurisdiction whereby
the purchaser at a sheriff’s sale of real property is obliged to bring a
separate and independent suit for possession after the one-year period for
redemption has expired and after he has obtained the sheriff's final
certificate of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Tan <span class="SpellE">Soo</span> <span class="SpellE">Huat</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ongwico</span>,
63 Phil. 746, 749).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same rule was
followed in a judicial foreclosure of mortgage and in an execution sale (Rivera
vs. Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, 61 Phil. 201 and Republic vs.<i> </i><span class="SpellE">Nable</span>, L-4979, April 30, 1952).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the court can issue a writ of possession
during the period of redemption there is no reason why it should not also have
the same power after the expiration of that period.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">1</span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners cannot be deemed third parties "actually
holding the property adversely” to the mortgagor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They derive their rights to the possession of
the property exclusively from the mortgagor, in virtue of verbal agreements of
lease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were lessees at the time
that the property occupied by them was mortgaged by their <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
to respondent <span class="SpellE">Banco</span> Filipino.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And of that mortgage they were charged with
constructive knowledge upon its registration in the Registry of Property, if
they did not indeed, actually know of it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The right pertaining to them in this situation was that of being
notified of the application for a writ of possession and of being accorded an
opportunity at a hearing to oppose the same, as by showing that they were
"actually holding the property adversely" to the mortgagor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That right was duly accorded to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were served with copies of the motion or
petition for issuance of the writ of possession and had ample opportunity to
oppose the same, to persuade the Court that the writ should not issue or be
executed against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proceedings
showed that, by their own assertions, they were not holding the property
adversely to the mortgagor, but were exercising rights under, derived from,
said mortgagor, who was their <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the cessation of their <span class="SpellE">lessor's</span> rights over the property, their own also ceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writ of possession was therefore properly
enforceable against them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The situation is not significantly different from that
contemplated by Section 49 (b) of Rule 39, declaring a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment or order conclusive and hence enforceable
not only against the parties but also "their successors in interest by
title subsequent to the commencement of the action or special proceeding."
Pursuant to this provision, a judgment <i>in <span class="SpellE">personam</span>
</i>directing a party to deliver possession of property to another is binding
not only against the former but also against his successors in interest by
title subsequent to the commencement of the action, i.e., those whose <span class="SpellE">possessory</span> rights are derived from him,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">2</span></span></a>
e.g., lessees, possessors by tolerance, assignees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As regards the latter, it is not required
that a separate action be instituted against them to litigate the issue of
possession; due process is satisfied by holding a hearing, with notice to them,
on the nature of their possession, and thereafter denying or acceding to the
enforcement of a writ of possession against them as the findings at said
hearing shall warrant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">3</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">,</span>
the petition is DISMISSED for lack of merit, and the case is remanded to the
Court <i>a quo </i>with instructions to forthwith issue in favor of respondent
