				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Subjected to frustrations were the dreams of thirty-two (32)
squatter families to own the land of approximately 50 square meters each on
which their respective homes were built.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To vindicate their rights they have aired their plight before this
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thwarted, too, was the
benevolence shown by the original owner of the land which parted with its
property at a give-away price thinking that it was accommodating the landless
squatters.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts follow:</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span> de <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Jose</st1:place></st1:city>, a Jesuit corporation, (<span class="SpellE">Colegio</span>,
for short) used to own <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>parcel
of land at the <st1:street><st1:address>Seminary Road</st1:address></st1:street>,
Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bathala</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Quezon</span></span> City</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Through its administrator, Father Federico <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span>, it sold said land to the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City Government as the site for the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City General</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
but reserved an area of 2,743 square meters <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">as </span>a possible development site.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Squatters, however, settled in the area <span class="GramE">since</span>
1965 or 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1970, the <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span>, through
Father <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span> gave permission to Congressman Luis R.
<span class="SpellE">Taruc</span> to build on the reserved site a house for his
residence and a training center for the Christian Social Movement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Seeing the crowded shanties of squatters,
Congressman <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span> broached to Father <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span> the idea of donating or selling the land cheap to
the squatters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Congressman <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span> then advised the squatters to form an organization
and choose a leader authorized to negotiate with Father <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Following that advice, the squatters formed
the "<span class="SpellE">Samahang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagkakaisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> Barrio <span class="SpellE">Bathala</span>" (<span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>, for brevity), with <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span>
Martin as President (Exhibit "24", <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span>),
who was entrusted with the task of negotiating on their behalf for the sale of
the land to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">But instead of working for the welfare of the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>,
Martin went to one <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Rivera, a realtor, with
whom he connived to obtain the sale to the exclusion of the other <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="3">28 March 1971</st1:date>, the land was
ultimately sold to Rivera at P15 per square meter or a total consideration of
P41<span class="GramE">,961.65</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
prevailing price of the land in the vicinity then was P100 to P120 per square
meter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was evident that Father <span class="SpellE">Escaler</span> had been made to believe that Rivera represented
the squatters on the property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
same date, <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="3">28 March 1971</st1:date>,
Rivera obtained TCT No. 175662 to the property in his name alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">In 1972, thirty-two heads of families of the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>
filed Civil Case No. Q-16433, Branch IV, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Celedonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Quilban</span>, et al.,
Plaintiffs, vs. <span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Rivera, et al., Defendants,"
with the principal prayer that said defendants be ordered to execute a deed of
conveyance in favor of said plaintiffs after reimbursement by the latter of the
corresponding amount paid by Rivera to the <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, however, dismissed the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">To prosecute the appeal before the Court of Appeals, the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> members hired as their counsel Atty. Santiago R. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> for which the latter was paid P2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>

(Exhibit "1").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> was also to be given by the members a part of the
land, subject matter of the case, equal to the portion that would pertain to
each of them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What was initially a

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>Administrative Case No.
2144<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 April 1980 the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> officers
filed this Administrative Complaint before this Court requesting the
investigation of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> for refusal to return
the P75,000.00 and praying that the Court exercise its power of discipline over
members of the Bar unworthy to practice law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The details of their Complaint were embodied in their Joint Affidavit
executed on <st1:date year="1980" day="14" month="4">14 April 1980</st1:date>
describing what had transpired between them and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> maintains
that he was hired by Complainants to appeal their case to the Court of Appeals
after they had lost in the lower Court; that their agreement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>to attorney's fees was on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>contingent basis - if he obtains a
reversal of the lower Court Decision, they will give him a portion of the
property subject matter of the litigation equal to the portion that will
pertain to each of the 32 plaintiffs in Civil Case No. Q-16433; that he did not
receive P70,000.00 from Complainants on 18 May 1979 but only P56,470.00; that
he prepared and signed the receipt dated 18 May 1979 showing that he received
P70,000.00 only to save Complainants from embarrassment and shame should their
co-plaintiffs ask for proof that they (Complainants) have paid their shares,
which they have not; that the correct amount in his possession is only
P62,470.00 - it would really be P75,000.00 had the five Complainants paid their
shares in the amount of P12,500,00 at P2,500.00 each and one Fortunate Ramirez
paid his balance of P30.00; that he had the right to hold the money in is
possession as guarantee for the payment of his attorney's fees - instead of
getting a portion of the property that will pertain to each of the plaintiffs,
he wants his portion converted to cash, and the cash equivalent of his portion
is P50,000.00 (2,743 square meters divided by 32 plaintiffs equals 85 square
meters for each plaintiff, multiplied by P500.00 up per square meter); that
considering that P50,000.00 is even less than one-half (1/2) per cent of the
total value of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">property, </span>which
is more than a million pesos, such amount is not unreasonable; that he is ready
to give back the amount of P12,470.00, representing the difference between P50,000.00
and the amount of P62,470.00 in his possession; that complainants cannot make
this Court a collection agency and that while this Court has the exclusive
disciplinary power over members of the Bar, it is equally true that the Court
cannot pass judgment on Complainants' plea that the amount deposited by
respondent be returned to them as this prayer should be ventilated in an
ordinary action; that he does not have the slightest intention to appropriate
the money in his possession (P62,470.00) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">for
</span>himself, but he is holding it until his attorney's fees are satisfied
there being no guarantee for its satisfaction because of Complainants' adamant
refusal to pay him; that there was no previous notice to him of his discharge;
and that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> accepted the case without
his (<span class="SpellE">Robinol's</span>) formal withdrawal and conformity.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="text-align:justify"><u>Administrative Case No.

<p class="BODY">Pursuing that tack, on 29 July 1980, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span>
filed a complaint for Disbarment against Atty. <span class="SpellE">Anacleto</span>
R. <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> for alleged gross unethical conduct unbecoming

<p class="BODY">For his part, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> denied
that the attorney's fees agreed upon by plaintiffs and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> were purely on a contingent basis, the truth being

by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> (Annex "1"), plus whatever
amount is adjudicated as attorney's fees by the Court of Appeals; that the
contingent fee referred to by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> was the
result of his insistent demand after the Court of Appeals Decision in Civil
Case No. Q-16433 was already final, as shown by the date of the agreement
(Annex "2"); that twenty [20] out of thirty-two [32] members of the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> signed the agreement to discharge Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> and hire a substitute counsel <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>shown by Annex "3", which
is a majority of the membership and, therefore, a valid consensus; that he
agreed to act <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>counsel if only
to arrest the growing belief of the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> that most
members of the Philippine Bar are unprincipled; that although there was no
formal Motion for substitution, there was substantial compliance with Sec. 26,
Rule 138 of the Rules of Court, as shown by the formal entry of appearance in
Civil Case No. Q-16433 (Annex "8"), the written consent of the
clients (Annex "9"), notice to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span>
of his discharge and substitution (Annexes "10" and "11"),
non-objection by <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> of his appearance as counsel
(Annex "12'), and implied consent of the Court to the substitution as
shown by its Order of 29 May 1980 (Annex "13"); that his professional

discharge </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His clients had lost confidence in him for he had obviously engaged in
dilatory tactics to the detriment of their interests, which he was duty-bound
to protect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, even if there were
no valid ground, he is bereft of any legal right to retain his clients' funds
intended for a specific purpose - the purchase of land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stands obliged to return the money
immediately to their rightful owners.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The principle of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quantum</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>meruit</u></span> </span>applies
if a lawyer is employed without a price agreed upon for his services in which
case he would be entitled to receive what he merits for his services, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>much as he has earned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case, however, there was an express
contract and a stipulated mode of compensation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The implied <span class="SpellE">assumpsit</span> on <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quantum</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>meruit</u></span>, </span>therefore, is
inapplicable.</p>

<p class="BODY">But Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> seeks to impress upon
the Court that he had received only the sum of P62,470.00 and not P75,000.00
claiming that five (5) officers of the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span> had
not yet paid their shares <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P12,500.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Solicitor General that complainants' evidence
on this score is the more credible and that he had, in fact, received the total
sum of P75<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> inclusive of the share of P12,500.00
of the five (5) officers of the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For, in the pleadings filed by Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> himself in the civil case below, namely, the Motion
for Execution on 5 June 1979; the Motion for Postponement on 31 August 1979;
and the Motion to Set Hearing of Motion for Execution on 10 March 1980, he made
mention of seven (7) persons, who, as of that time, had not yet submitted their
corresponding shares which list, however, did not include any of the five (5)
officers of the <span class="SpellE">Samahan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Inevitable, therefore, is the conclusion that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span> has rendered himself unfit to continue in the
practice of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has not only
violated his oath not to delay any man for money and to conduct himself with
all good fidelity to his clients.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He has
also brought the profession into disrepute with people who had reposed in it
full faith and reliance for the fulfillment of a life-time ambition to acquire
a <span class="SpellE">homelot</span> they could call their own.</p>

<p class="BODY">In so far as Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montemayor</span> is,
concerned, we agree with the findings of the Solicitor General that he has not
exposed himself to any plausible charge of unethical conduct in the exercise of
his profession when he agreed to serve as counsel for the plaintiffs in Civil
Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-16433.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Of the thirty-two (32) plaintiffs in said civil case, twenty-one
(21) had signed the first consensus of <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="3">6
 March 1980</st1:date> expressing their resolve to change their lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In as much as Atty. <span class="SpellE">Robinol</span>
sought to exclude seven (7) of the plaintiffs (out of 32) for non-payment of
their shares, only twenty-five (25) of them should be considered in determining
the majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, twenty-one
(21) out of twenty-five (25) is sufficient to make the said consensus
binding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is more than a simple
majority.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the following developments <span class="SpellE">estop</span>

by plaintiffs of the termination of his services (Exhibit "5").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That was followed by another letter of <st1:date year="1980" day="31" month="3">31 March 1980</st1:date> of the same tenor
(Exhibit "6").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his

</span>had stated that he had no objection to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Montemayor's</span>
appearance in Civil Case Q-16433.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the latter did enter his appearance, therefore, on <st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="3">20 March 1980</st1:date> it was only after assuring himself
that Atty.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE">Robinol's</span>
