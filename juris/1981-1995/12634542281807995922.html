				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span> appealed from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Cavite</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tagaytay</span>
City Branch IV, finding them guilty of murder, sentencing them to <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> and ordering them to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to the heirs of Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>
an indemnity of P12,000 (Criminal Case No. <span class="GramE">TG-181-73).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The withdrawal of the appeal of Ricardo and <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>
was allowed in this Court's resolution of <st1:date year="1981" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence shows that Mayor Rafael <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span> of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>General <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
(<span class="SpellE">Bailen</span>), <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Cavite</span></st1:place></st1:city>
wanted to liquidate his political enemy, Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>,
55, whom he suspected of having fed armed men or lawless elements during the
1969 election.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mayor allegedly
instructed Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>, a policeman functioning as a
security guard in his residence, to kill Mauricio.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same order was given to his other
security guards, Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span>, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> and Rodolfo
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>, 26, a farmer and a
nephew of Mauricio, testified that late in the afternoon of Decem­ber 9, 1970,
when the sun was about to set and while he was near his hut located at Barrio
Batas Dao, General <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>, he saw his uncle
Mauricio (<span class="SpellE">Kakang</span> Uri) with his hands tied behind his
back (<span class="SpellE"><u>gapos</u></span>) being led away by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>, followed by Sergeant Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Baybay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were going southward.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were all armed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rodolfo followed the group at a discreet distance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He saw that his uncle Mauricio was taken to
the land of a man named <span class="SpellE">Pio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There, <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span>
hacked Mauricio on the back and neck (to decapitate him), causing him to
collapse on the ground, bleeding profusely.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Baybay</span> then handed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the </span>bolo to Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> who gave Mauricio the <u>coup</u> <u>de</u> <u>grace</u>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. E)<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span> four malefactors left Mauricio's
body on <span class="SpellE">Pio's</span> land and returned to Mauricio's hut
where they took his horse, two <span class="SpellE">carabaos</span> and two
cows.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They fled northward.</p>

<p class="BODY">Witness Rodolfo was so unnerved and horrified by the gruesome
tragedy that when he reached his hut he slumped on the floor ("<span class="SpellE">nalugmok</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">sahig</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">kubo</span>").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He fell asleep until morning without having
eaten supper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Hermosura</span>,
another alleged security guard of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span>,
corroborated Rodolfo's testimony.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He (<span class="SpellE">Hermosura</span>) declared that he was an unwilling witness to
Mauricio's assassination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although Jorge
<span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> warned <span class="SpellE">Hermosura</span> to
keep silent about the killing, he (<span class="SpellE">Hermosura</span>),
nevertheless, apprised Mau­ricio's relatives about the <span class="GramE">circumstances</span>
surrounding the cold-blooded liquidation of Mauricio.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rodolfo's testimony is further confirmed by the postmortem
examination which revealed that Mauricio had two hack wounds, one
twelve-centimeter long wound in the scalp or occipital region, running horizontally
on the mastoid bone, and a thirteen-centimeter long wound on the neck, injuring
the esophagus and the thyroid cartilage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He had also incised wounds on the shoulder and chest (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span>, his brother <span class="SpellE">Privado</span> (the chief of police), Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>,
Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span> were
charged with murder qualified by treachery and evident premeditation.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the trial, Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>, 35,
interposed an alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified that
when the alleged killing took place he was on duty as desk sergeant in the
municipal building as shown on page 75 of the police blotter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3) and as testified by Constabulary Sergeants Vicente <span class="SpellE">Alcaraz</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gumersindo</span> <span class="SpellE">Rojales</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That defense
was disbelieved by the trial court which, however, acquitted the <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span> brothers for insufficiency of evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> contends that the trial
court erred in finding that there was conspiracy to kill <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>,
a contention which is based on the acquittal of Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span>
who, according to the prosecution's version, instigated the killing.</p>

<p class="BODY">That argument cannot be upheld because the trial court's
exoneration of the <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span> brothers is not binding
and conclusive on this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is
controlling is the probative value of the prosecution's evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">The eyewitness-testimony of
Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span> that his uncle was ruthlessly killed
by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span>
in the presence of Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> is the crux of the
prosecution's evidence.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Jorge was no mere kibitzer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was he who was primarily entrusted with the mission to kill <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
presence at the scene of the crime could only mean that he wanted to make sure
that the mayor's order was carried out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, he had community of design with Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His actions disclosed that he acted in concert with his co-accused to
encompass <span class="SpellE">Glorioso's</span> death.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it is incontrovertible that he was a
co-conspirator.</p>

<p class="BODY">His counsel also contends that the trial court overlooked certain
circumstances which negative his criminal liability and that his guilt was not
proven beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One such
circumstance is the entry in the police blotter that Jorge was the <span class="SpellE"><u>sargento</u></span><u> de mesa</u> at the police station at the
time the killing was perpetrated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
certifications of Constabulary Lieutenant Angeles <span class="SpellE">Opena</span>
and Sergeant <span class="SpellE">Alcaraz</span> that Jorge was physically
present in the muni­cipal building at that time (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1 and 2) are likewise relied upon to cast doubt on his guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the trial court did not err in regarding as
untrustworthy those pieces of evidence supporting Jorge's alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The entry in the police blotter was made by
Jorge's co-accused, <span class="SpellE">Privado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span>,
the chief of police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Opena's</span>
certification is hearsay because he did not testify and he was not, therefore,
cross-examined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Alcaraz's</span>
certification was based on the police blotter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His testimony appears to be unreliable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the trial court erred in not giving weight to
the statements of <span class="SpellE">Sofronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>,
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Melania</span> <span class="SpellE">Encognito</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 6, 7, 8-A and 8-B) which did not identify Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span> as a <span class="SpellE"><u>particeps</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>criminis</u></span> in the killing of Mauricio <span class="SpellE">Glorioso</span> has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is unmeritorious because those statements were taken by the
frequently mentioned Chief of Police <span class="SpellE">Privado</span> <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">X
and 8), one of the accused in this case.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As aptly observed by the Solicitor General, <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span>
had an ulterior motive in getting those statements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He would use, as he in fact used, those
statements to exculpate himself and his co-accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant assails the probative value of the testimonies of
Jacinto Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Hermosura</span> with respect to Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dalusag's</span> criminal liability as a co-principal by
inducement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They testified on collateral
matters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since Mayor <span class="SpellE">Dalusag</span>
was acquitted, any discussion of his criminal liability in this appeal is
uncalled for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The vital and decisive
testimony is that of Rodolfo Glorioso whose credibility is well-nigh
indisputable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He categorically
identified the Golfos and <span class="SpellE">Baybay</span> as Mauricio's
assassins.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant regards it as unbelievable that Rodolfo should remember
the circumstances surrounding the killing considering that he testified more
than five years after its commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is not a strain on one's credulity that Rodolfo should recollect an
extraordinary episode after the lapse of five years.</p>

<p class="BODY">The horrible killing of his uncle was <span class="SpellE">unerasably</span>
stamped in his memory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he
testified, he was still in full possession of his mental faculties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, his recollection of that event, which
he must have recounted many times to his relatives and acquaintances, remained
vivid and clear.</p>

<p class="BODY">A painstaking perusal of the record convinces us that Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo's</span> guilt was established beyond shadow of doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crime committed is murder since the hap­less
victim was first bound and then mercilessly hacked to death while in that
helpless state.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance
constitutes treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The penalty of <u>reclusion</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span> was properly imposed by the trial
court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the trial court's judgment is affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against appellant
Jorge <span class="SpellE">Golfo</span>.</span></p>
