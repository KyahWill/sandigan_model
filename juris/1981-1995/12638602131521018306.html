<p class="BODY">The Court finds that the third assigned error as to whether or
not the cause of action of private respondent has prescribed deserves prior
attention.</p>

<p class="BODY">In disposing of this issue, the appellate court held that
prescription had not yet set in by holding -</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defendants-appellants
also contend that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> claim is barred
by prescription, inasmuch as the Deed of Sale sued upon was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">executed in </span>November 1961, while plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> complaint was filed only on <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1974</st1:date> (thereafter), or more than ten
years, in violation of Article 1144 of the Civil Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Article 1144 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Civil </span>Code
provides that an action upon a written contract must be brought within 10 years
from the time the right of action accrues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In order to have a good cause of action, the following essential
elements must coexist: legal right in the plaintiff, with a corresponding legal
duty in the defendant, and a violation or breach of that right or duty with
consequential injury or damage to the plaintiff, for which he may maintain an
action for appropriate relief (Ma-<span class="SpellE">ao</span> Sugar Central
Co. vs. Barrios, 79 Phil. 666).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
no actionable wrong, that is, no cause of action, unless there has been a
breach of such duty either by means of the defendant's failure to perform some
contractual obligation which he has undertaken, or by means of some <span class="SpellE">tortious</span> or illegal act which violates or infringes some
right of the plaintiff with respect to which a duty or obligation is owing,
resulting in an injury to plaintiff (1 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. p.
420).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>action accrues from the moment there occurs a breach of right
or duty, for from that moment the action can be legally instituted; from that
moment, therefore, the period of prescription of action begins to run.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, the Deed of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">Sale of </span>November 1961, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'A',
provides that defendants-appellants agree to transfer, cede and convey unto
HOWARD WEBER whatever rights and interests we may have over 250 square meters
of land located at San Juan, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">being </span>a portion of Lot No. 7 and
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 29457 issued by the Register of
Deeds for <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is clear therefore that plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
has no legal right to demand the transfer, cession or conveyance of a portion
of 250 square meters of Lot 7 until defendants-appellants' rights <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">and </span>interests thereto shall have been
definitely determined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said rights were
definitely determined only upon the termination of the Intestate proceedings,
No. 3899 of <st1:country-region><st1:place>Br.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
I, CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, of the deceased Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alvir</span>, Sr., which, according to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Sotelo</span>,
was on December 28, 1968 (TSN, Aug. 13, 1976, p. 100).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
cause of action, therefore, did not accrue in November 1961, as contended by
defendants-appellants, but not earlier than <st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

 29, 1974</st1:date> was not barred by prescription.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Moreover, defendants-appellants are <span class="SpellE">estopped</span>,
under the facts of this case, to plead the limitation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>action as a defense.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The record shows that defendants-appellants assured repeatedly
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appelleee</span> that they would work for the
segregation of the subject lot and transfer the same to plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> name as soon as the estate of the late Antonio <span class="SpellE">Alvir</span>, Sr. was settled; That there would be no trouble
segregating the lot; that a claim or suit by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">plaintiff </span>would only delay the proceedings and consequentially
the segregation of the lot; and that they allowed plaintiff to occupy the lot
and build his house therein are the things that lulled plaintiff into not
filing a claim in the intestate proceedings or a separate action in court;
plaintiff being then a friend and business associate of defendants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> relied and acted in
good faith on these misrepresentations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A defendant who intentionally or negligently misleads a plaintiff by his
misrepresentations, and causes him to delay suing until the statutory bar has
fallen, will be <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from pleading the statute of
limitations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Tucker v. Owen, (CA4) 94 F

<p class="BODY">We disagree.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that under Article 1144 of the Civil Code an action
upon a written <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contract </span>must be
brought within 10 years from the time the cause of action accrues.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">contract </span>in this case, the balance of
P2,000.00 for the sale must be paid by private respondent within 30 days from

balance on <st1:date year="1963" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1963</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the obligation of petitioners, except
Douglas <span class="SpellE">Alvir</span>, "to transfer, cede and
convey" to private respondent "whatever rights and interests"
petitioners may have over the property accrued when private respondent
completed payment of the consideration of the sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The opinion of the appellate court is that the cause of action
accrued only when the rights and interest of said petitioners had been
definitely determined.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The terms of the
contract do not support this conclusion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What it simply provides is that upon full payment of the consideration,
said petitioners are bound to transfer, cede and convey to private respondent
whatever rights and interest they have over the property, no more no less.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, private respondent's cause of action is barred by
prescription.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The cause of action

<p class="BODY">The Court is not persuaded that it was due to alleged
misrepresentation of petitioners that private respondent failed to file the

himself asserts that on <st1:date year="1973" day="12" month="2">February 12,

an unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case against his in-laws over
