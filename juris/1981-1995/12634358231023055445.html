in the name of Manuela Bobiles on June 30, 1932.  The spouses Agaton Boragay and Manuela Bobiles had only one child
named Gregoria Boragay.  When the
parents died, the property passed on to Gregoria who stayed on the land
together with her husband, Alejandro Alcera, and their three children.  When the Alcera children got married, they
left the property and lived with their respective husbands.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

1977, Bonifacio Bobiles and Rosalina Base also built their house on the said
lot.  In the same year, OCT No. RO-3334
was canceled and TCT No. T-50318 in the name of the private respondents was
issued.  In 1981, two more houses were
erected on the land by Buenaventura Jacob, Ledita Burce, Edilberto Bonto and

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">For their part, the

1948, Cabida sold the land to Emilio Bonto, husband of Rosario Burce.  On October 31, 1956, Emilio Bonto executed a
Deed of Absolute Sale in favor of Ricardo Burce and Consolacion Burce Elaco
covering 595 square meters of the said lot.  Emilio Bonto retained the 199 square meters.  In 1980, Consolacion Burce Elaco, with the conformity of the
heirs of her brother Ricardo, verbally ceded to her niece Ledita Burce Jacob
the 595-square meter portion of the subject property.  This was confirmed and ratified by Consolacion in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

averred that they had been in actual and physical possession of the property
under claim of ownership for more than 51 years.  Taxes on the property had been paid since 1948 by their
predecessors-in-interest.  It was only
in 1976 that the private respondents came to know of the subject lot.  When Consolacion </span>Burce <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Elaco worked for the registration of the
595-square meter portion of the lot, she was informed by the Registrar of Deeds
that Lot No. 2365 had a title in the name of Manuela Bobiles on file with the
Office of the Municipal Treasurer of Tabaco, Albay.  She went to that office and was advised to secure </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">waiver from the heirs of Agaton Boragay.  Accordingly, she sent a letter to Rosario Alcera Falcon asking
her to execute a document ratifying and confirming the sale of the lot by their
grandparents in favor of Leon Cabida.  Falcon asked for an additional amount of </span>P6,000.00 as purchase
price of the subject property, but Consolacion refused to pay the same.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

when it declared:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">x x x  </span>It is a fundamental principle in Land
Registration that the Certificate of Title serves as evidence of an
indefeasible title to the property in favor of the person whose name appears
therein.  After the expiration of the
one-year period from the issuance of the decree <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">of registration </span>upon which it is based, it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">becomes incontrovertible </span>(Pamintuan <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">vs. San Agustin, 43 Phil. </span>558; Reyes

2186, April 15, 1957; Bruzuela, et al. vs. Ciriaco vda. de Vargas, 53 O.G.
2822, May 15, 1957).  Furthermore, a
title, once registered under the Torrens System of land registration, cannot be
defeated, even by adverse, open and notorious possession, neither can it be
defeated by prescription.  A certificate
of title, once registered, is notice to the world and as such all persons are
bound by such notice and no one can plead ignorance of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">registration (Legarda vs. Saleeby, 31 Phil.
590).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Defendants-appellees in this case claimed that
plaintiffs-appellants came to know of the property only in 1975.  Consolacion Burce Elaco, the alleged former
owner of the property prior to the defendants-appellees, tried to seek waiver
from herein plaintiffs-appellants in order to transfer the property under the
former's name.  The property was
transferred in the name of herein plaintiffs-appellants in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">November, 1977.  The Land Registration Act provides for judicial hearing before
the issuance of a certificate of title.  In such proceeding, any person claiming title over the property involved
is given the opportunity to oppose the issuance of said title.  In the case at bar, herein
defendants-appellees never filed any opposition to the issuance of said
Certificate of Title, hence, they are forever barred to contest the validity of
such title.  Thus, in De los Reyes vs.
Paterno, 34 Phil 420, it was held that claimant having failed to present his
answer or objection to the registration of a parcel of land under the Torrens
System or to question the validity of such registration within a period of one
year after the certificate of title of registration had been issued, had
forever lost his right in said land, even granting that he had any right
therein.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">By their own admission,
Rosario Alcera Falcon was approached by Consolacion Burce Elaco in 1976 for a
waiver when she sought to have the subject lot registered in her name.  This request was refused, allegedly because
she was unwilling to pay the petitioners an additional amount of P6,0</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">00.00 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">as part of the purchase price for the lot.  If this be true, then the petitioners should have been on their
guard against whatever action the private respondents would take to secure
their claim to the land.  Forewarned
that the private respondents were intending to hold on to the property, the
petitioners should have taken steps to prevent the latter from registering it
in their name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As might be expected, it was so registered, in 1977.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt"> </span>Yet, although the registration
proceedings were <b>in rem</b> and there is no dispute as to the proper
publication of the required notices, the petitioners did not file any
opposition.  Thereafter, TCT No. T-50318
having been issued in the name of the private respondents, the petitioners did
not move for its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">annulment </span>on
their alleged ground of fraud until the prescribed period of one <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">year expired.  To repeat, it was only in 1984, when the complaint against them
was filed, that the petitioners </span>bestirred themselves.</p>

<p class="BODY">As they were actually in possession of the disputed lot, the
petitioners should have been especially vigilant against any adverse claim that
might be made thereto, especially from the private respondents.  Yet, although <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">they were aware of the private respondents' original registration, the
petitioners made no effort to have the registration transferred in their name
after the sale of the land to their predecessor-in-interest.  In fact, there was no change of registration
when, as they alleged, the land passed from Agaton Boragay and Manuela Bobiles
to Leon Cabida in 1933; then to Emilio Bonto in 1948; then to Ricardo Burce and
Consolacion Burce Elaco in 1956; then to Ledita Burce Jacob in 1985.  All this time, the property remained </span>in
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the name of Manuela Bobiles under OCT
No. RO-3334.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The c</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ontention </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that the private respondents knew about the property only in 1976 is an
irrelevant argument.  Even </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">assuming </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">this allegation to be true, we fail to see how this </span>would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">affect the ownership of the disputed
land.  Title </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">registered land is not lost by ignorance.  The simple fact is that the subject property
was in the name of the private respondents' ancestors under an original
certificate </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">title when they
secured the issuance of a transfer certificate of title in their name.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court of Appeals
erred when it disregarded the </span><b>Escritura de Venta con Pacto de Retro</b>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as a mere scrap of paper.  In fact, it was an important piece of
evidence that it should not have dismissed out of hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rule 132, Section 22, of
the Rules of Court provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Sec. 22.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence of execution
not necessary. - Where a private writing is more than thirty years old, is
produced from a custody in which it would naturally be found if <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">genuine, and is unblemished by any
alterations or circumstances of suspicion, no other evidence of its execution
and authenticity need be given.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <b>Escritura</b> complied with all the requisites laid down
in the above provision.  It was more
than 51 years old when it was presented in court; it was produced by the proper
custodians thereof who were the heirs of the person who would validly keep it;
and there is no question <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">it was
unblemished by any suspicious alteration or erasure.  It was therefore unnecessary to prove its execution and
authenticity as evidence of the transfer </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the disputed property
to Leon Cabida, the petitioners' predecessor-in-interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even so, that document cannot prevail against the transfer
certificate of title in the name of the private respondents, who remain and are
recognized as the registered owners of the disputed land.  That title is good as against the whole
world.</p>

<p class="BODY">And then there is laches.  Laches is defined as such neglect or omission to assert a right taken in
conjunction with the lapse of time and other circumstances causing prejudice to
an adverse party, as will operate as a bar in equity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The petitioners invoke laches against the private respondents for their failure

the protection of the Torrens system.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">If anyone is guilty of
laches, it is the petitioners themselves for their failure to register the land

and to oppose the registration of the land in the name of private respondents
in 1976.  And if, as they now say, such
registration was made fraudulently, what they should have done was file a

Section 38 of the Land Registration Decree.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Sec. 38. If the court after hearing
finds that the applicant or adverse claimant has title as stated in his
application or adverse claim and proper for registration, a decree of </span>confirmation
and registration shall be entered.  Every decree of registration shall <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bind
the land, and quiet title thereto, subject only to the exceptions stated in the
</span>following section.  It shall be
conclusive upon and against all persons, including the Insular Government and
all the branches thereof, whether mentioned by name in the application, notice,
or citation, or included in the general description "To all whom it may
concern."  Such decree shall not be
opened by reason of the absence, infancy, or other disability of any person
affected thereby, nor by any proceeding in any court for reversing judgments or
decrees; subject, however, to the right of any person deprived of land or of
any estate or interest therein by decree of registration obtained by fraud to file
in the competent Court of First Instance <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a
</span>petition for review within one year after entry of the decree, provided
no innocent purchaser for value has acquired an interest.  Upon the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">expiration of said term of one year, every decree or certificate of title
issued in accordance with this section shall be incontrovertible.  If there is any such purchaser, the decree
of registration shall not be opened, but shall remain in full force and effect
forever, subject only to the right of appeal hereinbefore provided:  <b>Provided, however</b>, That no decree or
certificate of title issued to persons not parties to the appeal shall be
cancelled or annulled.  But any person
aggrieved by such decree in any case may pursue his remedy by action for
damages against the applicant or any other person for fraud in procuring the
decree.  Whenever the phrase
"innocent purchaser for value" or an equivalent phrase occurs in this
Act, it shall be deemed to include an innocent lessee, mortgagee, or other
encumbrancer for value.</span></p>
