Instance of Rizal with the crime of Homicide, under an information which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“That on or about the 7th day of April, 1976 in Quezon City,
Philippines, the above-named accused, without any justifiable motive, did, then
and there wilfully, [sic] unlawfully and feloniously, with intent to kill,
attack, assault and employ personal violence upon the person of one MARCIANO
SORIA y POSEDIA, by then and there, stabbing him on his chest, thereby
inflicting upon his person serious and mortal wounds which were the direct and
immediate cause of his death, to the damage and prejudice of the heirs of said
MARCIANO SORIA y POSEDIA, in such amount as may be awarded to him under the
provisions of the Civil Code.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the evidence adduced by the prosecution,
petitioner was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime charged.  The dispositive portion of the decision
reads:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused ANGEL SAMPAGA Y DE LOS

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 9:30 in the evening of April 7, 1976, the deceased
Marciano Soria, cousin of herein petitioner, Angel Sampaga together with Carlos
Eduque, Herminigildo Soria (brother of the deceased) and Eduardo de Castro had
a drinking spree at the residence of Angel Sampaga.  In the course of their drinking, Marciano Soria and Angel Sampaga
came to a heated argument.  Sensing that
the two would resort to violence, Eduardo de Castro left.  Carlos Eduque, fearing that violence might
ensue, also left and stayed at the nearby Jack’s Restaurant.  After a few minutes, the daughter of Angel
Sampaga called Carlos Eduque for assistance because Marciano Soria was
stabbed.  Upon arrival of Carlos Eduque
at the scene of the crime, the victim, Marciano Soria was being rushed to the
hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">Marciano Soria succumbed at the Quirino Memorial Hospital and the
medico-legal necropsy report<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
reveals that the cause of death is cardiorespiratory arrest due to shock and
intra-abdominal hemorrhage as a result of a stab wound on the trunk.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 21, 1976, a patrolman assigned with the Criminal
Investigation Division, Integrated National Police, Quezon City Police station
conducted an investigation on the death of Marciano Soria.  Petitioner-accused Angel Sampaga was
informed of his constitutional rights, more particularly, his right to remain
silent and to the assistance of counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> Angel
Sampaga made a voluntary statement admitting the killing which was reduced to
writing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Likewise, he revealed where the weapon used in killing Marciano Soria can be
found.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Three witnesses namely, Carlos Eduque, Eduardo de Castro and Herminigildo Soria
were also investigated and their respective statements were reduced into
writing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
They were not however presented during trial, hence, their respective
statements have no probative value.  Even then, their statements say that they were not present during the
stabbing incident.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only evidence then left against the accused-petitioner is his
extra-judicial confession.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the facts, was the extra-judicial confession of
the accused petitioner admissible in evidence or was the same acquired in
violation of his constitutional rights?</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the investigation, Detective Joy Diaz orally informed
petitioner of his constitutional rights to remain silent and to counsel.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The warning was repeated in the course of the investigation and embodied in the
sworn statement which reads:</p>

<blockquote><u>Exhibit “B”, “B-1”</u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The law in point is Section 20, Article IV of the 1973
Constitution, as the extrajudicial confession of accused-appellant was executed
in 1976.  Said provision states:</p>

<blockquote>“No person shall be compelled to be a
witness against himself.  Any person
under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to
remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.  No force, violence, threat, intimidation, or
any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him.  Any confession obtained in violation of this
section shall be inadmissible in evidence.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact is petitioner was warned prior to his interrogation that
he has the right to remain silent; that any statement he does make may be used
as evidence against him; and that he has the right to the presence and
assistance of an attorney.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner admitted in his sworn statement his participation in
the killing of his cousin Marciano Soria which reads:</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also the petitioner who showed the police authorities
where he kept the fatal weapon by taking them to his house and thereafter
surrendered the weapon he used in killing Marciano.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Having admitted the killing, it is incumbent upon him to establish his claim of
self-defense by clear and convincing evidence.  This he failed to do by refusing to adduce evidence in his defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals agreed fully with the findings of the trial
court in this regard, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“Assuming the accused’s statement Exhibits “B” and “B-1”, to be
true, there would be present [sic] unlawful aggression.  There would be unlawful aggression because
according to him, while the accused’s brother Benigno Sampaga was inquiring
from the deceased about the “Texas” cock which he had asked him to buy and the
accused intervened also making the same inquiry, twenty minutes thereafter,
after Benigno Sampaga had left, the deceased suddenly drew out his knife and
gave a thrust to the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On the same assumption that his statement is true, there would
also be lack of sufficient provocation because the intervention of the accused
in making the same inquiry is not a provocative act.  It does not constitute an act adequate to arouse the victim to
deliver the stab blow.  But there would
be no reasonable necessity of the means employed to repel the unlawful
aggression of the deceased.  On this
point, the accused alleged in his statement:</blockquote>

<blockquote>‘15.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>T:  Isinadya
mo bang ipatama kay MARCIANO SORIA ang kutselyo?</blockquote>

<blockquote>S:  Hindi po dahil lang sa pagaa­gawan namin tumama sa kanya.’</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In other words, the accused claimed that the knife hit the deceased
in the process of their struggle to prevent it from hitting him.  This claim is unbelievable.  It is unbelievable because according to the
postmortem findings of Dr. Desiderio Moraleda, the stab wound sustained by the
deceased was so deep that the stab blow must have been intentionally inflicted
and with great force.  Thus, he
described the wound as:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Stab wound through and through, right hypochondriac region,
measuring, 7 by 3 cm., 18 cm. deep, 7 cm. from the anterior midline, directed
anteriorwards, slightly upwards and to the left, fracturing the 8th rib,
lacerating the mesentery, liver and gall bladder, passing through the 8th
intercostal space along the posterior axillary line with a point of exit at the
right infrascapular region, measuring 0.5 by 0.2 cm., 9 cm. from the posterior
midline.’</p>

<blockquote>“It is incredible that if the wound was inflicted in the process of
their struggle, it would attain such depth of 18 centimeters, would fracture the
8th rib, lacerate the mesentry, [sic] liver and gall bladder, and would reach
up to the right infra-scapular region.  The only reasonable conclusion from such finding is that the accused
must have wrested the knife from the deceased and in turn delivered a
resounding thrust to the deceased causing him to sustain said stab wound.  This is again on the assumption that there
was struggle as claimed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“If the accused was able to wrest the knife from the deceased, his
life was no longer in peril and there was no longer necessity to take the life
of the latter.  In so doing, the accused
became the aggressor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The prosecution proved the killing by the sworn statement of the
accused.  There is evidence of the <i>corpus
delicti</i>.  The knife Exhibit “I” used
in the killing was recovered by Detective Joy Diaz.  It was recovered because it was pointed to by the accused
himself.  The cause of death, according
to the necropsy report of Dr. Desiderio Moralda is ‘cardiorespiratory arrest
due to shock and intra-abdominal hemorrhage as a result of a stab wound of the
trunk’ which was inflicted by the accused.  The accused refused to present evidence against the inculpatory evidence
of the prosecution.  His conviction
becomes in order.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, other than informing petitioner of his right
to remain silent and to counsel, petitioner was not provided with a counsel or
given an opportunity to secure one, lulled perhaps by Section 20, Article IV of
the 1973 Constitution which merely provides the right to counsel of the accused
unlike Section 12 of the 1987 Constitution which specifies in detail how the
right to counsel shall be exercised to preclude constitutional objections.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in the light of the recent case of <i>People vs.
Dacoycoy et. al.</i>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

-- that the waiver by a suspect of his rights while under custodial
investigation to be valid, must be made in the presence of and with the
assistance of counsel -- to confessions given by suspects during custodial
investigations prior to April 26, 1983 (the date the doctrine was laid down in <i>Morales
vs. Ponce Enrile, et al.</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> and <i>Moncupa

petitioner is entitled to acquittal as his extra-judicial statements were taken
without the presence of counsel.  Said
the court:</p>

<blockquote>“In Galit and Pecardal, it must be stressed, the principle was made
to apply to confessions given by suspects during custodial investigations prior
to April 26, 1983.  In Galit, the
extrajudicial confession was executed sometime in 1977; in Pecardal, 1982.  The Court then saw no impediment,
constitutional or otherwise, to the application of the doctrine to confessions
made before April 26, 1983.  The Court
sees none at this time.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <i>People vs. Pecardal</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
the court made the following observation:</p>

<blockquote>“It is true that the original requirement laid down in Morales vs.
Enrile (121 SCRA 538) was not supported by the majority of eight required by
the Constitution.  Nonetheless, the
doctrine announced therein was later affirmed in <i>People</i> <i>vs</i>. <i>Galit</i>,
(135 SCRA 465) with fourteen members of the Court voting in favor and only one
not taking part.  The same rule was only
recently reiterated in the case of People vs. Sison (G.R. No. 70906) decided
last May.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Be that as it may, the present rules on extra­judicial confession
under the 1987 Constitution require that waiver of the right to be informed of
one’s right to remain silent or to have competent and independent counsel must
be made through the assistance of a counsel and in writing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">PADILLA <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the Court's decision penned by Mr. Justice Nocon, petitioner Angel
Sampaga is acquitted of the crime charged as his extra-judicial statements were
taken without the presence of counsel, applying the ruling in People vs.
Dacoycoy, et al. (G.R. No. 71662, May 8, 1992).  In said case, this Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x, even before the effectivity of the 1987 Charter, the
need of assistance of counsel as a pre-requisite for according validity and
effect to a waiver of rights in custodial investigation laid down by the 1973
Constitution, was already existent.  Since appellant Latoga's extra­judicial confession was admittedly given
by him without the assistance of counsel, it should not have been admitted in
evidence against him, and since that confession constitutes his only link to
the felony of robbery with homicide with which he is charged, no finding of
guilt thereof may be made against him."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The right to counsel attaches upon the start of an investigation,
i.e., when the investigating officer starts to ask questions to elicit
information and/or confessions or admissions from the respondent/accused.  At such point or stage, the person being
interrogated must be assisted by counsel to avoid the pernicious practice of
extorting false or coerced admissions or confessions from the lips of the
person undergoing interrogation, for the commission of an offense.  (Christopher Gamba vs. Hon. Alfredo Cruz,
etc., No. 56291, June 27, 1988, 162 SCRA 642).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the following cases, the Court also disregarded the
extrajudicial confessions obtained from the accused, result­ing in their
acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People vs. Edgardo Lim, et al.</u> (G.R. No. 90021, May 8,
1991, 196 SCRA 809), it was held that:</p>

<blockquote>"As to appellant Rodolfo Ramirez, no prose­cution witness
identified him to be among the kidnappers.  The only evidence presented against him is his alleged extrajudicial
confession dated September 1, 1981 which was taken by Sgt. Alfredo
Miranda.  While said appellant admits
his signa­ture thereon, he denies the truth therewith alleging he was only
forced into signing the same without knowing its contents and that he was then
blindfolded, manhandled and threatened.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To the mind of the Court what is
decisive is the fact that the extrajudicial confession of appel­lant Ramirez
was taken without the assistance of counsel and his alleged waiver of the
assistance of counsel was not also made in the presence of counsel.  This fatal omission renders the said
extrajudicial confession inadmissible as evidence against appellant
Ramirez."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People vs. Arsenio Caponpon</u> (G.R. No. 7 145 November
21, 1991, 204 SCRA 116) this Court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The incontrovertible fact alone that the confession was made
during custodial investiga­tion in the absence of counsel renders that par­ticular
piece of evidence totally inadmissible and the lower court gravely erred in not
dismissing the same."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Based on the above-mentioned decisions, it would seem that a
confession is invalid when it was taken without the assistance of counsel or
when an alleged waiver by the accused of the assistance of counsel was not made
in the presence of counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the above rule is not without exception.  Where there is <u>independent</u> <u>evidence</u>,
apart from the accused's uncounseled confession, that the accused is truly
guilty, the latter faces a conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Justice Teehankee, in a Concurring Opinion in <u>People vs.
Manalang</u> (No. L-47136-39, July 25, 1983, 123 SCRA 583), stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx the extrajudicial confession obtained by the police from
the accused on August 12, 1977 (one day after the commission of the crimes)
without the assistance of counsel nor a clear and intelligent waiver thereof is
patently inadmissible under the mandate of section 20 of the Bill of Rights
(Article IV) of the Constitution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>Even disregarding the invalid confession, however, the
record clearly establishes the guilt of the accused as stated in the Court's
decision (at page 11), the accused subsequently made a judicial confession of
his guilt and entered a plea of guilty, with the due assistance of counsel de
oficio, followed by the taking of evidence to establish beyond reasonable doubt
the circum­stances surrounding the killings and the authorship thereof</u>."
(Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court also ruled in <u>People vs. Enrique</u> (G.R. No.
90738, December 9, 1991, 204 SCRA 674), that:</p>

<blockquote>"We note however that, during the investigation, the
accused-appellant, unassisted by counsel, wrote his name on the rolled
marijuana cigarettes.  Pat. Quebalayan
testified that the accused affixed his name thereon voluntarily and that this
gesture was intended as a security against substitution (TSN, July 6, 1989, p.
24).  Yet, he and the other arresting
officers exerted no efforts to inform the accused-appellant of his rights under
custodial investigation.  In effect,
appellant's act amounted to an admission of his culpability in violation of the
Constitution.  Such admission is
therefore inadmissible as evidence (see People v. Peralta, G.R. No.  86172, March 4, 1991 and People v. dela
Marinas, G.R. No. 87215, April 30, 1991).  <u>Notwithstanding this setback for the prosecution, appellant cannot be
acquitted because his conviction did not rest solely on his admission.  He has completely failed to rebut by
contrary evidence the testimonies and documentary evidence presented by the
prosecution</u>." (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The only question in this case is whether or not such independent
evidence exists.  It has been pointed
out that the petitioner-accused himself revealed where the weapon used in
killing the victim could be found and he subsequently surrendered it to the police.  Does this constitute <u>independent</u> <u>evidence</u>
or was it embraced in the custodial interrogation?</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People vs. Marcos P. Jimenez, et al.</u> (G.R. No. 82604,
December 10, 1991, 204 SCRA 719), the Court held that:</p>

<blockquote>"The interrogation of Marcos Jimerez having been conducted
without the assistance of counsel, and no valid waiver of said right to counsel
having been made, not only the confession but also any admission obtained in
the course thereof are inadmissible against Marcos Jimenez.  This, too, is the explicit mandate of the
Constitution:  any confession or
admission obtained in violation among others of the rights guaranteed in custo­dial
investigations shall be inadmissible in evidence against the person making the
confession or admission.  This is so
even if it be shown that the statements attributed to the accused were
voluntarily made, or are afterwards confirmed to be true by external
circumstances."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It can be argued for the prosecution that petitioner-accused
would not have revealed where the fatal weapon was if he did not have anything
to do with the killing of the victim.  It would be unlikely for an innocent person to admit the killing of
someone and even go to the extent of surrendering the crucial weapon to the
police.</p>

<p class="BODY">But it would still appear that the admission made by the
petitioner-accused is excluded by the Constitution being an admission during a
custodial interrogation, without the assistance of counsel.  And it could be said, as field in <u>People
vs. Marcos</u>, that the voluntariness of said admission does not affect the
fact that it was obtained in violation of constitutionally guaranteed rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the absence of independent evidence apart from
petitioner's extrajudicial confession, the Court has no choice but to acquit
the petitioner for failure to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
