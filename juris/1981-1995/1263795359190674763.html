				<BR><STRONG>FELICIANO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In anticipation of an increase in student enrolment for the
academic year 1970-1971, respondent Jose <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
College, sometime in August of 1969, issued invitations to bid for the
construction of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>five-storey
school building (Building H, Phase II) within the College's compound in <span class="SpellE">Mandaluyong</span>, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Of the four bids submitted, respondent College accepted that of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> Corporation (hereafter "<span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>") which, for the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,196,000.00</span>,
proposed to complete the project within <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>period of two hundred (200) working days.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="16" month="9">16 September 1969</st1:date>,
prior to the execution of a formal written agreement between the parties,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> mobilized its labor force and began
delivery of construction materials and equipment to the project site.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>
commenced excavation work on the project site, it discovered that the ground at
the site was not solid and stable enough to support the foundation of the
proposed building.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A depression in the
soil surface was <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">also </span>discovered
which likewise posed some technical difficulties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These matters were immediately brought to the
attention of respondent College, which subsequently agreed to conduct
sub-surface exploration tests at the project site and to have the costs of the
same -- amounting to P80<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> -- added on to
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen's</span> original bid price.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="30" month="10">30 October 1969</st1:date>,
a Building Contract with a contract price of P1<span class="GramE">,276,000.00</span>
was formally executed by the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, in November of 1969, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>
posted Surety Bond No. <span class="GramE">G(</span>16)0068 issued by the
Imperial Insurance Company, Inc. in the amount of P255,200.00 to serve <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>its performance bond.</p>

<p class="BODY">As work on the project progressed, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>
was able to overcome the problems posed by the condition of the sub-soil and
completed its excavation work in mid-December of 1969.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was at this point in time that the costs
of construction materials dramatically increased as a result of the devaluation
of the Philippine peso due to the adoption <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of </span>a floating rate of exchange between the Philippine peso <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span>the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region> dollar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding this development, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> proceeded with the project, billing respondent
College periodically for the work accomplished with respect thereto in
accordance with petitioner's view of paragraph 8 of the Building Contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">From each of the billings sent by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>,
however, Mr. Fernando <span class="SpellE">Abad</span>, the Supervising Architect
of respondent College, deducted certain substantial amounts before certifying
the same for payment. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The result was
that after four billings, only the amount of P210<span class="GramE">,716.00</span>
had been approved for payment -- allegedly P92,681.40 less than what had been
originally billed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> requested respondent College to explain the
deductions made by Architect <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> and to promptly pay
the amounts deducted but, <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> said, no response
was forthcoming.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In April of 1970,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> unilaterally ceased all work on the
project.</p>

<p class="BODY">Letters were exchanged between the parties but to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inability of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> and respondent College amicably to settle their
differences led to the mutual filing of civil suits against each other on 29
July 1970 with Branch 26 of the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The separate
complaints filed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> and respondent
College <span class="GramE">were</span> docketed as Civil Case No. 13698 and
Civil Case No. 13697, respectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Civil Case No. 13698 was subsequently dismissed and incorporated <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as a </span>counterclaim in Civil Case No.
13697.) The surety company, upon being <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span>,
filed a third-party complaint against the officers of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> who had apparently signed the indemnity agreement in
their personal capacities.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Believing that the
substantial aspects of the dispute involved technical matters, the parties
agreed during pre-trial to refer such matters to an independent Commissioner

owner P210<span class="GramE">,716.00</span> which represented 16.51% of the
contract price of P1,276,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has failed to adduce any compelling reason why we should
overturn these findings of facts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
difference of P130<span class="GramE">,614.00</span> between P341,330.00 (the
"value" of the work actually accomplished as found by the
Commissioner) and P210,716.00 (the amount already paid by the project owner)
must have represented the increase of the costs of reaching the percentage
(14.5%) of completion of the project actually reached by <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">as of April 1970</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>As
such, that increase of P130<span class="GramE">,614.00</span> could not have been
included in the total increase of the costs of completing the project, i.e.,
P603,160.00, since that total increase of costs of completion was arrived at
(correctly) by taking the Commissioner's figure of P1,879,160.00 which was the
cost of carrying forward to completion the project <u>from where petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> left off in April 1970</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is clear from the terms of reference
given to the Commissioner by the trial court:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It
follows that respondent project owner did <u>not</u> owe to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> the amount of P130<span class="GramE">,614.00</span>
and that that amount should <u>not</u> be deducted from the total increase of
costs for which <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> is responsible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent project owner estimated the adjusted cost of the
completed building <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>P3<span class="GramE">,863,600.00</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
This estimate of cost, however, was made <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as </span>of </u><st1:date year="1978" day="21" month="4"><u>21 April
 1978</u></st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
We believe that this adjusted 1978 estimated cost cannot be used for
determining the damages petitioner <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> is liable
for, having been made too long after the actual abandonment of the project by <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the
other hand, it appears to us reasonable to use in this connection the <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="5"><u>30 May 1973</u></st1:date> figure given by
the Commissioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>his report,
P1<span class="GramE">,879,160.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other element of damages for which the respondent appellate
court held petitioner liable, was the penalty of liquidated damages in the
amount of P200.00 stipulated in the Building Contract for each day of delay.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The trial court would have held petitioner liable for P200.00 per day until
(apparently) the building was actually constructed and completed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals, on the other hand,
limited the maximum period of the delay for which petitioner contractor could
be held liable to 200 days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It may be
noted that the Building Contract itself did not put a limit upon the length of
the delay for which the contractor could be held liable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, however, the terms of the
relevant section of the Building Contract indicate that the
liquidated-damages-for-delay clause was intended to be operative <u>where the
contractor actually completed the project, though beyond the stipulated
completion date</u>; in other words, <u>where the contractor in delay did not
abandon the project uncompleted</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 7 read in part:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
<u>failure of the CONTRACTOR to complete</u> the erection and construction of said
Project, <u>and deliver</u> the said building to the OWNER for use and
occupancy <u>within the date given</u> shall entitle the OWNER <u>to deduct
from the contract price herein stipulated as part of the liquidated damages</u>
the sum of P200.00 for each day of delay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is understood by the parties that the completion and delivery to the
OWNER of the said building within the stipulated time is imperative in view of
the purpose and use intended for said building, namely, for the holding of
classes beginning the 1970-1971 school <span class="GramE">year</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Since the OWNER is an educational institution and time is of the
essence of this contract, the OWNER shall have the right to take possession of
and use any completed or partially completed portions of the work after the
expiration of the Contract Time; but said taking possession and use <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">shall not be deemed an acceptance of any work
not completed in accordance with the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither shall it be deemed a waiver by the OWNER of its right to claim
for damages due to </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">delays in
the completion of the work</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">."
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(Underscoring supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In
this case, however, <span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> did not merely incur delay
in completing the project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Baylen</span> abandoned the project which therefore had to be
taken over by either the project owner or another contractor and
completed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we do not
believe that here, the liquidated damages for delay should be awarded to
respondent College on top of the award of the total increase in costs of
completing the project, </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">there
