<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="10">October 23, 1973</st1:date>,
petitioner executed a deed of mortgage in favor of private respondent to secure
the payment of any and all obligations, damages and liabilities the latter may
incur by reason of the principal obligation, the bulk of which was used to

<p class="BODY">Sometime in January 1982, the plant of petitioner, which was
previously insured, was completely burned and the insurance proceeds thereof
were paid to private respondent as beneficiary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 17, 1985, petitioner received notice of the extrajudicial
foreclosure and scheduled sale of its mortgaged properties, based on an alleged
unpaid obligation in favor of private respondent in the amount of P43<span class="GramE">,602,245.51</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner protested, claiming that the amount did not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reflect the true and accurate amount of its
obligations and demanded that foreclosure be suspended until a reconciliation
of the accounts shall have been arrived at.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent agreed to the suspension of the foreclosure
sale but required petitioner to issue, as it did in fact issue, six postdated
checks in the total amount of P3<span class="GramE">,000,000.00</span> or
P500,000.00 for each check, subject to the result of the reconciliation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Three of these checks were <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">encashed</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> by private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, after allegedly realizing that it
had overpaid private respondent, petitioner issued a stop payment order on the
remaining three checks.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, or on September 27, 1985, petitioner filed the
hereinbefore stated Civil Case No. 11819 for injunction with prayer for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction and/or restraining order in the
aforementioned trial court, to enjoin private respondent from proceeding with
the foreclosure proceedings.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent, in opposition thereto, alleged that said
foreclosure was initiated under the provisions of Presidential Decree No. 385;
that petitioner had not paid 20% of the outstanding arrearages; and that the
issue raised by petitioner in its complaint is only one of accounting.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Finding petitioner's case impressed with merit as one not falling
within the ambit of Presidential Decree No. 385, there being a
"significant and tremendous" discrepancy between the accounting
records of petitioner and private respondent, and taking note of the payment of
the insurance proceeds and other payments made by petitioner such that it had
allegedly overpaid private respondent, the trial court on November 5, 1985
issued an order with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, let <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

enjoining the defendant from proceeding with the foreclosure of the mortgaged
properties of the plaintiff upon the latter's filing and approval of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a bond in the amount of P300<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to answer for all and any damages which the
defendant may suffer by reason of the issuance of the writ."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's motion for reconsideration having been
denied, it filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 with respondent
Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent court, in
its decision dated September 26, 1986,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
set aside the questioned orders noting that there was no allegation nor was
there evidence to show that petitioner has paid at least 20% of its arrearages
after the filing of the foreclosure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, it ruled that no injunction
should have been issued to restrain the foreclosure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Anent petitioner's contention that the
substantial discrepancy between its computation and that of private respondent
removes its case from the ambit of Presidential Decree No.385, respondent court
stated that there are no portions in the decree indicating an intention to give
it a restricted or limited <span class="GramE">application.</span></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In amplification of its position, petitioner posits that
Presidential Decree No. 385 constitutes an incursion into the domain of
judicial power vested by the Constitution in courts established by law, in the
sense that it deprives the courts of their inherent and supposedly <span class="SpellE">undiminishable</span> power to issue injunctions and/or
restraining orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Further, petitioner
asseverates that the decree is <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the due
process clause enshrined in the Constitution in that government financial
institutions are given the power to <span class="GramE">effect</span> foreclosure
outright on the sole basis of their own financial records.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a complementary issue, petitioner argues that granting that
Presidential Decree No. 385 is constitutional, it nevertheless does not apply
to the present case, the discrepancy in its accounting records <span class="SpellE">vis</span>-a-avis those of private respondent being very
significant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It contends that <u>Filipinas</u>
<u>Marble</u>, although not on all fours with the present case, is authority
for the holding that "Presidential Decree No. 385 cannot automatically be
applied where the extent of the loan actually received by the borrower still
has to be determined."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The relevant portion of Presidential Decree No. 385 reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 2.</span> No restraining order,
temporary or permanent injunction shall be issued by the court against any
government financial institution in any action taken by such institution in
compliance with the mandatory foreclosure provided in Section 1 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">hereof, whether such restraining order,
temporary </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">or </span>permanent
injunction is sought by the borrower(s) or any third party or parties, except
after due hearing in which it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>established
by the borrower and admitted by the government financial institution concerned
that twenty percent (20%) of the outstanding arrearages has been paid after the
filing of the foreclosure proceedings."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span></span>The provision, therefore, contemplates
the instance where the borrower has sought a writ of injunction, in a principal
action <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> or as an ancillary remedy in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">another case or proceeding, to enjoin the
foreclosure of its properties by the government financial institution
concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consistent with the procedural
requirements set forth therein, a hearing should first be had to determine
whether or not 20% of the outstanding arrearages <span class="GramE">has</span>
been paid, as a </span>prerequisite for the issuance of a temporary restraining
order or a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">This cannot, however, be logically and plausibly arrived at
unless the court, on the basis of the evidence then in its possession, makes a
determination itself, provisionally at the very least, on the matter of the
actual existence of arrearages and the amount thereof on which 20% shall be
computed or reckoned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, we note that the above-stated procedure was
not followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the trial court
only went so far as to find that there was a significant discrepancy between
the financial records of petitioner and private respondent and concluded on the
basis thereof that Presidential Decree No. 385 was not applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">showing whatsoever that the trial court attempted to resolve the
discrepancy by ascertaining the factual existence of any arrearage and the
amount thereof if there really was such a default.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Although respondent court held that there was no evidence
presented to show that petitioner had paid at least 20% of the alleged
arrearages, it does not appear<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>that
a hearing had been held in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> for such purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The finding that there was no allegation in
the complaint to the same effect flies in the face of petitioner's allegation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">that it even overpaid private
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such a situation, the
court must perforce conduct a hearing to</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">determine the primal
requirement, that is, the existence of arrearages, if any, and thereafter
whether or not 20% thereof has been paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such facts must </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">ascertained
not only for purposes of the formulistic allegations in the complaint for
injunction, but because these are contemplated or required by the decree itself
as the bases </span><u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">non</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> for the issuance
of the writ.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Since the attendant circumstances call for prior determination of
requisite facts, we find no necessity to rule upon the constitutional issues
raised by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides we have
consistently adhered to the doctrine that the constitutionality of a law will
be passed upon only if, and to the extent that, it is directly and necessarily
involved in a <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversy and is
essential to afford <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">relief to the party

<p class="BODY">Apropos of petitioner's claim that Presidential Decree No. 385
does not apply in the present case under the authority of <u>Filipinas</u> <u>Marble</u>,
suffice it to state that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">cited case
cannot be a complete basis of the desired reliance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said case involved the issue of
misappropriation of the proceeds of the loan which was imputed to the officials
of private respondents, the government lending institutions therein, which took
over the management of petitioner pursuant to one of the conditions for the
loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the liability of the
petitioner therein for the loan, the non-payment of which was the basis for the
foreclosure of the mortgage, was not yet settled, prompting this Court to allow
the issuance of a writ of injunction against the foreclosure sale, because -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Pending the outcome of such litigation, P.D. 385 cannot
automatically be applied for if it is really proven that respondent DBP is
responsible for the misappropriation of the loan, even if only in part, then
the foreclosure of the petitioner's properties under the provisions of P.D. 385
to satisfy the whole amount of the loan would be a gross mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would unduly prejudice the petitioner, its
employees and their families."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The present case does not present such a situation, although it
may also be observed that one of petitioner's significant contentions is that
it has even overpaid its obligation to private respondent, an issue that
likewise demands proof and determination before Presidential Decree No. 385 can
be automatically applied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears
mention, in passing, that respondent court, while citing <u>Filipinas</u> <u>Marble</u>,
would limit the non-application of the decree to only two
"scenarios," the one of relevance to the case at bar being
"where the extent of the loan actually received by the borrower still has
to be determined." By the same token then, if not more so, the decree
should not likewise apply <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">where the
existence of any balance, arrearages or any obligation still due from the
borrower is precisely disputed and has also still to be determined.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
