<blockquote>"That the deceased (<span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Hayson</span>) was employed by the respondent Luzon Stevedoring
Corporation as a Gang Boss or <span class="SpellE">capataz</span> with a daily

in the evening, he was on duty as such <span class="SpellE">capataz</span> on
board the M/V President <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the deceased and his co-workers,
Segundo "<span class="SpellE">Nonoy</span>" Catalan, <span class="SpellE">Felimon</span> <span class="SpellE">Caparas</span>, Francisco <span class="SpellE">Toralba</span> and another laborer were waiting for the cargoes
and telling stories to pass the time, the 3rd Officer of the M/V President <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> approached them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since there was a party on board the boat at that time and since it was
a cold night, the deceased asked for something to drink from the 3rd
Officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So, the 3rd Officer left them
for a while and when he returned the <span class="GramE">latter</span> gave them
a half-filled bottle of pocket-size <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> <span class="SpellE">Rhum</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The group then
took turns in drinking from the said bottle with the deceased taking the first
drink.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his co-workers drank from
the supposed bottle of <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> <span class="SpellE">Rhum</span>
they found out that the contents of the said bottle was not liquor but oil of
wintergreen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About an hour after that
the late <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Hayson</span>
complained of stomach pain and he was immediately brought to the San Pedro
Hospital where he died on February 17, 1970 at around 4:40 A.M. due to
poisoning according to the findings of the attending physician, Dr. Alex <span class="SpellE">Panuncialman</span>, and which was confirmed by the autopsy
performed by Dr. Juan M. <span class="SpellE">Abear</span>, Jr., Medico Legal
Officer, City of Health Office, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City (Exhibit
"E").</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Respondent (now herein
petitioner) filed on March 9, 1971 a motion for reconsideration of the
Referee's decision </span><span style="">raising </span><span style="">as sole ground the allegation that <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Hayson</span> was notoriously

record of the case was thus elevated to the Workmen's Compensation Commission
for review.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the decision dated </span><st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="7"><span style="">July 16,
 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, the Workmen's

<p class="BODY">Resolving the sole issue raised by respondent Luzon Stevedoring
Corporation that the deceased was notoriously negligent for which reason his
death falls outside the compensatory coverage of the Workmen's Compensation
Act, the WCC defined the concept and degrees of negligence, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"In the case of <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Gulf Lumber Corporation, WCC Case No. 84, this
Commission had the occasion to construe notorious negligence as something more
than a simple or contributory negligence<span class="GramE">. "</span>By
notorious negligence is meant such entire want of care as to raise a
presumption that a person at fault is conscious of the probable consequences of
his carelessness and is indifferent to the danger of injury to <span class="GramE">himself</span> and other persons.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The negligence necessary to exempt an employer must amount to reckless
disregard of the safety of persons and property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notorious negligence is practically equivalent
to the doing of an intentional wrong."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the WCC held that the deceased could not have been
notoriously negligent because he was unaware of the probable consequences of
his act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nowhere was there an iota of
proof evidencing his intent to put an end to his life. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>If at all, his attitude constituted simple
negligence which thus brings this claim within the compensatory coverage of the
<span class="SpellE">beneficient</span> provisions of the Workmen's Compensation
Act, as amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the <span class="SpellE">WCC's</span> stamp of <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> on <span style="">the award made by Referee Martinez in favor
of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Hayson's</span> widow
and children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the WCC decision, Luzon Stevedoring
Corporation on <st1:date year="1973" day="8" month="9">September 8, 1973</st1:date>
sought reconsideration thereof but the WCC, failing to find sufficient
justification to warrant reversal or modification of its decision, denied on <st1:date year="1973" day="11" month="10">October 11, 1973</st1:date> the motion for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the instant
recourse to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue now before <span class="GramE">Us</span> for
resolution is whether this claim for compensation benefit on account of <span class="SpellE">Pantaleon</span> <span class="SpellE">Hayson's</span> demise due to
accidental poisoning when he mistook oil of wintergreen for <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rhum</span> falls within the coverage of the Workmen's
Compensation Act, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner insists that the deceased was notoriously negligent
because he drank from the bottle containing oil of wintergreen not only once
but continued to do so despite the unanimous opinion of his companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree, however, with the ruling of the WCC
which is fully justified and supported by clear, competent, and substantial
evidence, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Quoting from the testimony of the companions of the deceased,
respondent pointed out that the deceased drank the contents of the bottle of <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> <span class="SpellE">Rhum</span>, knowing well that
it contained oil of wintergreen, hence his attitude constituted notorious
negligence that brought out his death from the coverage of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This pretense of respondent is far from being
tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, it was
established that the deceased was not a heavy drinker and at the time they
asked something to drink from the 3rd Officer of the boat, the deceased or his
companions were not shown to have drunk any liquor or anything that could have
affected the mental state of the deceased at the time he asked a drink from the
said Officer. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Nor was it shown that
previous to the incident, the deceased was so despondent that there was an
intention on his part to end his life.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that they did in asking for a drink from the Officer is what
ordinary persons would do under the circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a cold night on board the boat and
they were waiting for work, then, it was but natural that they want to do
something to alleviate the cold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
nature of their job, occasional drinking is quite ordinary and does not in any
way violate standard rules and regulations, unless of course the same is done
to the extent of causing drunkenness.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Being not a drinker as he was, the deceased could not be expected to
know the different tastes of wines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
what he drank contained oil of wintergreen made no difference to him because as
stated, he was not a drinker and could not have distinguished the taste of the
kind of wine, so much so, that when his companions tasted the wine later, and
told him that it contained oil of wintergreen, he <span style="">even bragged that it was stateside, an act which projected his
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And even if he drank after he
was told that the bottle contained oil of wintergreen, still the same could not
constitute notorious negligence on his part, because there was no showing that
he admitted knowledge that the contents of the bottle was oil of wintergreen,
nor was there a warning made by his companions that drinking the same could be
fatal to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To constitute notorious
negligence, it must be shown that the act of the deceased entirely wants in
care as to raise a presumption that he was conscious of the probable
consequences of his careless</span>ness and indifferent to the danger of injury
<span style="">to himself and other persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be equivalent to the doing of an
intentional wrong.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, this
Commission cannot consider the attitude of the deceased in the case at bar to </span>constitute
<span style="">notorious negligence, </span>because he
was not aware of the probable consequences <span style="">of his act, nor was it shown that there was an intent on his part to
end his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If at all, his attitude simply
constitutes simple negligence, which is well within the compensatory coverage
of the </span><span style="">Act."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the matter of
notorious negligence, this Court in the case of </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Paez</u></span><u>
v. </u><u><span style="">WCC, et al</span></u><span style="">., L-18438, </span><st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="3"><span style="">March 30, 1963</span></st1:date><span style="">, 7 SCRA 588, 594, </span><span style="">said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"It </span>is finally
contended that the <span style="">res­</span>pondent <span style="">WCC </span>erred in not finding that the
accident was caused through the notorious negligence of the deceased (Sec. 4 of
Act No. 3428).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">That</span> defense should be
proven by the party invoking it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Notorious negligence is something more than mere or simple negligence,
or contributory negligence; it signifies a deliberate act of the employee to
disregard his own personal safety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the case at bar, there is no showing at all that deceased <span class="SpellE">Barawid</span>
had deliberately disregarded his safety; no intention was attributed to him to
end his life or that he wantonly courted <span style="">death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The deceased wanted to return home as
it was getting late, and even helped in the loading and unloading of the <span class="SpellE">palay</span> to the <span class="SpellE">banca</span> and truck, to
finish the work that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is claimed
that the deceased wanted to return home, because he was to drive the new truck
of his brother-in-law, and he was in such a hurry that he unheeded the suggestion
of his companion not to embark anymore, as it was dark and the <span class="SpellE">banca</span> was fully loaded.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Conceding this to be true, for the purpose of argument, (<span class="SpellE">Barawid</span> can no longer contradict it, <span style="">his </span>lips having been sealed by death),
still the disregard of the warning cannot be considered as notorious
negligence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disobedience to rules,
orders and/or prohibition does not in itself constitute notorious negligence,
if no intention can be attributed to the injured to end his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if in the case at bar, there was any
negligence at all, the case cannot be considered notorious or evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The deceased did not act with the full
knowledge of the existence of a danger that ordinary prudence would counsel him
to avoid such a case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above doctrine is clearly applicable to the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="">In </span><u>A.
L. <span class="SpellE">Ammen</span> Transportation Co., Inc. v. WCC, et al</u>.,
<span style="">No.</span></span><span style=""> L-20219, </span><st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="9"><span style="">September 28, 1964</span></st1:date><span style="">, 12 SCRA </span>27, <span style="">30, the Supreme Court set down the conditions for compensability of
death claims, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Considering the philosophy behind the requirement that to be compensable
the death must occur while the worker is performing some work in the course of
his employment, the authorities are to the effect that to come within the
purview of such requirement, three things must concur:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the injury must be received during the period
covered by the employment; the worker must be shown to have been injured at the
time and place where the performance of his work requires him to be; and the
worker must have been doing something in pursuance of his work."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold and rule
that the above conditions have been established and met.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, acts reasonably necessary to health and comfort of an
employee while at work, such as satisfaction of his thirst, hunger, or other
physical demands, or protecting himself from excessive cold, are incidental to
the employment and injuries sus­tained in the performance of such acts are
compensable as arising out of and in the course of the employment (58 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. sec. 236, p. 742, citing numerous cases).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">And further reviewing the
decision appealed from in the light of the rule emphasized </span>in <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuyno</u></span><u>, Jr. vs. WCC, et al</u>., <span style="">No. L-44271, September 22, 1977, 79 SCRA </span>100,
106, declaring that when an employee dies in line of duty, or when actually at
work as in this case, his death is presumed to be service-connected and is
compensable and that when doubts on the cause and/or aggravating factors of
illness of the claimant arise, they must be resolved in favor of the claimant
and his heirs, the <span class="SpellE">affirmance</span> of the respondent
Commission's judgment is clearly inevitable and justifiable.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law presumes that a claim is compensable, absent substantial
evidence to the contrary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So this Court
has consistently and resolutely adhered to the doctrine that even where the
cause of death is unknown, the right to compensation subsists, the underlying
philosophy being that the Workmen's Compensation Act is a social legislation
formulated in obeisance to the social justice guarantee of the Constitution,
its <u>raison <span class="SpellE">d'etre</span></u> being to alleviate and
ameliorate the plight of the workingman, and thus uplift the quality of life of
the laboring class.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so, it has been
reiterated in a long chain of workmen's compensation cases elevated to and
resolved by this Court that the Workmen's Compensation Law should be construed
fairly, reasonably and liberally in favor of and for the benefit of employees
and their dependents and all doubts as to the right of compensation as well as
all presumptions resolved in their favor.</p>
