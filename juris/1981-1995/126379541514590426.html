<p>In this petition for <em>certiorari</em>, petitioner Firestone Tire and 
Rubber Company of the Philippibne [Firestone for brevity] assails the decision 
of public respondent National Labor Relations Commission which ordered the 
reinstatement without backwages of Carlos Lariosa, a dismissed tire builder of 
petitioner, as having been rendered with grave abuse of discretion amounting to 
lack of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>The facts are as follows:</p>
<p>Carlos Lariosa started working with Firestone on January 3, 1972, as a 
factory worker. At the time of his dismissal, he was a tire builder.</p>
<p>At around 2:00 o' clock in the afternoon of July 27, 1983, as he was about to 
leave the company premises, Lariosa submitted himself to a routine check by the 
security guards at the west gate. He was frisked by Security Guard Ambrosio Liso 
[Lizo} while his personal bag was inspected by Security Guard Virgilio Olvez. In 
the course of the inspection, sixteen [16] wool flannel swabs, all belonging to 
the company, were found inside his bag, tucked underneath his soiled 
clothes.</p>
<p>As a result of the incident, Firestone terminated Lariosa's services on 
August 2, 1983, citing as grounds therefor: "steeling company property and loss 
of trust."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> Firestone also filed a 
criminal complaint against him with the Rizal province fiscal for attempted 
theft [I.S. No. 83-436-M].<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p>Lariosa, on the other hand, sued Firestone before the Ministry of Labor and 
Employment for illegal dismissal, violation of Batas Pambansa Blg. 130 and its 
related rules and regulations, and damages. The Labor Arbiter, in his decision 
dated May 8, 1984, found Lariosa's dismissal justified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3] </sup>However, on appeal, the National Labor 
Relations Commission on December 28, 1984 reversed the decision of the Labor 
Arbiter [with one commissioner voting the affirmance] and held that the 
dismissal of Lariosa was too severe a penalty. It therefore ordered Lariosa's 
reinstatement but without backwages, the period when he was out of work to be 
considered a suspension.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </p>
<p>Petitioner Firestone, in this special civil action <em>certiorari</em>, 
contends that the NLRC erred in not dismissinf Lariosa's appeal for being late, 
in finding that Lariosa was not accorded due process and in reversing the Labor 
Arbiter.</p>
<p>We shall deal first with the timeless on the appeal. It is admmitted that 
Lariosa filed his appeal on June 7, 1984 or after the lapse of fourteen days 
from notice of the decision of the Labor Arbiter. Article 223 of the Labor Code 
clearly provides for a reglementary period of ten days within which the appeal a 
decision of the Labor Arbiter to the NLRC. The ten-day period has been 
interpreted by this Court in the case of <em>Vir-jen shipping and Marine 
Services, Inc. vs, NLRC</em>, G.R. Nos. 58011-12, July 12, 1982, 115 SCRA, 347, 
361, to mean ten "calendar" days and not ten "working" days. However, the 
"Notice of Decision" which Lariosa's lawyer received together with a copy of the 
arbiter's decision advised them that an appeal could be taken to the NLRC within 
ten "working" days from receipt of the said decision.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </p>
<p>Mindful of the fact that Lariosa's counsel must heve been misled by the 
implementing rules of the labor commission and considering that the shortened 
period for appeal is principally intended more for the employees's benefit, 
rather that that of the employer, We are inclined to overlook this particular 
precedural lapse and to proceed with the resolution of the instant case.</p>
<p>A review of the record shows that Lariosa was indubitably involved in the 
attempted theft of the flannel swabs. Durinf the investigation called by the 
company's industrial relations manager Ms. Villavicencio on July 28, 1983, or 
one day after the incident, Security Guards Liso and Olvez contradicted 
Lariosa's bare claim that he had simply overlooked that he had earlier placed 
them inside his bag after they were given to him by his shift supervisor while 
he was busy at work. Guard Olivez stated that they were for "home use". And when 
he requested Lariosa to stay behind while he reported the matter to the 
authorities, Lariosa refused and hurridely left the premisses and boarded a 
passing jeepney.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> </p>
<p>From the records, it is likewise clear that Firestone did not act arbitarily 
in terminating Lariosa's services. On the contrary, there are transcripts to 
prove that an investigation of the incident was promptly conducted in the 
presence of the employee concerned, the union president and the security guards 
who witnessed the attempted asportation. Records also belie the allegation that 
Lariosa was shown his walking papers on the very day of the incident. The latter 
Ms. Villavicencio to Lariosa dated August 1, 19833 informing the latter of his 
dismissal effective August 2, 1983 conclusively shows that he was discharged 
only August 2, 1983, <em>after</em> an investigation was held to ventilate the 
truth about the July 27 incident.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
Thus, we cannot agree with the NLRC's conclusion that even if Firestone had 
found substantial proof of Lariosa's misconduct, it did not observe the 
statutory requirements of due process.</p>
<p>There is no gainsaying that theft committed by an employee consititutes a 
valid reason for his dismissal by the employer. Although as a rule this Court 
leans over backwards to help workers and employees continue with their 
employment or to mitigate the penalties imposed on them, acts or dishonesty in 
the handling of company property are a differrent matter.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </p>
<p>Thus, under Article 283 of the Labor Code, an employer may terminate an 
employment for "serious misconduct" or for "fraud or willful breach by the 
employee of the trust reposed in him by his employer or representative."</p>
<p>If there is sufficient evidence that an employee has been guilty of a breach 
of trust or that his employer has ample reasons to dustrust him, the labor 
tribunal cannot justify deny to the employer the authority to dismiss such an 
employee.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </p>
<p>As a tire builder, Lariosa was entrusted with certain materials for use in 
his job. On the day in question, he was given two bundles of wool flannel swabs 
[ten pieces per bundle} for cleaning disks. He use four swabs from one pack and 
kept the rest [sixteen pieces] in his "blue travelling bag."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> Why he placed the swabs in his personnal 
bag, which is not the usual receptacle for company property, has not been 
satisfactorily explained.</p>
<p>If Lariosa, by his won wrongdoing, could no longer be trusted, it would be an 
act of oppression to compel the company to retain him, fully aware that such an 
employee could, in the long run, endanger its very viability.</p>
<p>The employer's obligation to give his workers just compensation and treatment 
carries with it the corollary right to exopect from the workers adequate work, 
diligence and good conduct.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p>In view of the foregoing, We rule that Firestone had vaild grounds to 
dispense with the services of Lariosa and that the NLRC acted with grave abuse 
of dicretion in ordering his reinstatement. However, considering that Lariosa 
had worked with the company for eleven years with no known previous bad record, 
the ends of social and compassionate justice would be served if he pai full 
separation pay not reistatement without baskwages as decreed by the NLRC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </p>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the petition is granted. The decision of the 
National Labor Relations Commission dated December 28, 1984 is reversed and set 
aside. Petitioner Firestone Tire and Rubber Company of the Philippines is 
directed to pay its dismissed worker Carlos Lariosa the separation pay to which 
he may be entitled under the law, or any collective bargaining agreement or 
company rules or practice, <em>whichever is higher</em>. </p>
<p><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>. </p>
<p><em>Alampay, Gutierrez, Jr., Paras, Padilla, </em>and<em> Bidin, JJ. , 
</em>concur.</p>
<p><em>Cortes, J.</em>, no part, was not yet in the Supreme Court when this case 
was deliberate upon. <br><br><br></p>
