<blockquote>"That the certificate of title which was issued was valid and
existing but the same was lost and/or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">destroyed
by reason of the operation of the last World War and despite </span>diligent
and repeated endeavors to locate them could not be found even up to the present;</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Thus, the only issue is
whether there is a title to be reconstituted. "That is the only purpose of
the law (Republic Act No. 26).  If there
is, then it is the duty of the court to comply with its mandate.  Whether the petitioner has the right to
acquire the land or not, is beyond the province of this proceeding.  That should be threshed out in a proper
action (Director of Lands vs. Gan Tan, 89 Phil. 184, 187)." And, as
properly </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">observed by the
Solicitor General in his comment to the petition, "[i]n the case at bar,
the evidence could not justify reconstitution.  Proof </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the certificate of title allegedly lost was
wanting.  The court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

dismissed the petition </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">its Decision dated August 24, 1973.  But when it reconsidered said decision by
ordering the registration of the property per its order dated November 29,
1973, it patently transcended its jurisdiction and overlooked the doctrine
above reproduced.  It was an error to do
so.  For, as stated, the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">was limited to
resolving whether reconstitution was proper or not." (pp. 178-179, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Records of the Land
Registration Commission show that Decree No. 687556 was issued on November 3,
1938, for Lot No. 4673 of the Cadastral Survey of Cebu, Province of Cebu.  As aptly stated by the court <u>a</u> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"It cannot be denied however that there has been no original
certificate of title which has been issued by the Register of Deeds of Cebu <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">covering the aforestated property, and thus
all subsequent dealings affect­ing such property could not be registered as
provided by law.  To declare that there
has been no decree of registration would be to brush aside the certifica­tion
of the Land Registration Commis­sion that Decree No. 687556 was issued on
November 3, 1938 covering Lot 4673.  This affirmation of the office in charge of the duties of issuing
decrees of registration must be given weight and credibility.  Hence, such decree of registration No.
687556 prevents this Court, by the principle of res judicata, from adjudicating
the case anew because the aforestated decree of 1938 has already become
conclusive upon all persons and against the whole world effective as of
November 3, 1939 or thereabouts.  The
resultant effect of such decree was to bring the land under the Torrens Act
which is an agreement running with the land, theoretically binding upon the
appli­cant and all persons claiming title or an interest therein at the time of
the original hearing of the registration proceedings.  (See Nidlack, Analysis of the Torrens System, Sec. </span>60, p.
101; see also Section 45, Act No. 496).  In the final legal analysis, this Court has no further authority or
jurisdiction to adju­dicate the case anew because the original decision and
decree have already become final and conclusive.  (Reyes vs. Borbon, 50 Phil. 791).  To declare the non-existence of a decree which in fact was issued
would moreover result in long drawn out confusion, multiplicity of suits,
uncertainty of the statue of the lot in question, especially with respect to
the persons who are at present claim­ing possessory or proprietary rights over
the same." (pp. 48-49, Rollo)</blockquote>
