Appellate Court denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy involved in this case is Lot No. 150 of the
Cadastral Survey of <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said lot is covered by two (2) certificates
of title in the name of different owners - <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>
reconstituted TCT No. RT-331 (476) in the name of Carlos Rodriguez, the
predecessor-in-interest of herein petitioner Leonardo <span class="SpellE">Montinola</span>,
et al. (MONTINOLAS, for short); and judicially reconstituted OCT No. RO-265
(N.A.) in the name of Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Cardoniga</span>, the
predecessor-in-interest of herein private respondents <span class="SpellE">Silveria</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. <span class="GramE">de</span> <span class="SpellE">Cardoniga</span>,
et al. (CARDONIGAS, for short).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Possession of the said lot is with <span class="SpellE">Nasipit</span>
Lumber Company, Inc. (NLCI, for short) <span style="">as
</span>lessee of MONTINOLAS since 1946.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">The predecessor-in-interest of respondent
CARDONIGAS, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Cardoniga</span>, <span style="">having </span>been declared the owner of </span><st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style="">Lot</span></span></st1:place><span class="GramE"><span style=""> 150 (June 3, </span>1929
decision of the Cadastral Court of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, Record on
Appeal, pp. 70-74), demanded payment <span style="">of
</span>rentals from petitioner NLCI who had occupied the property since 1946.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>NLCI, however, refused and demanded that the
certificate of title to the land be shown.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lorenzo <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cardoniga</span></span> who
lost his title to the land during World War II, took steps to reconstitute the
same and after acquiring the reconstituted title, he again demanded from
petitioner NLCI, but the latter again refused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, on February 15, 1960, he filed Civil Case <span style="">No. </span>770 with the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>, but the same was dismissed without prejudice
because petitioner <span style="">NLCI set </span>up
the defense that it was leasing the lot in question from petitioner MONTINOLAS.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 16, 1972, respondent CARDONIGAS filed a <span style="">second </span>complaint against petitioner <span style="">NLCI, </span>docketed as Civil Case No. 1455
in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span> del
Norte (Record on Appeal, pp. 1-5), wherein it is alleged, among others, that
they are the <span style="">owners of </span>Lot 150
and that in 1946 petitioner NLCI took <span style="">pos</span><span style="">s</span><span style="">ession
</span>of <span style="">the </span>same without their
knowledge and without <span style="">paying </span>rentals
thereon despite demand <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span style="">NLCI, in </span>its
Answer with Counterclaim (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 6-9), admits possession <span style="">of the </span>said land since 1946, but
claims that the same is being leased by it from the spouses <span class="SpellE">Calixto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Montinola</span> and Dolores Rodriguez, now both deceased,
and later from their successor-in-interest up to the present.</p>

<p class="BODY">After respondent CARDONIGAS had filed their Answer to
Counterclaim (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 15-17), petitioner NLCI, with leave of court,
filed a Third Party Complaint against petitioner MONTINOLAS for satisfaction of
all claim for damages and attorney's fees of respondent CARDONIGAS (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 17-19).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner MONTINOLAS, in their Answer with Counterclaim (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 27-30), claim that they are the true and lawful owners of the land in
question as evidenced by Transfer Certificate of Title No. <span class="GramE">RT
1491 in their names.</span></p>

dismissed the complaint -</p>

</span>(pp. 23-24, 30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> in G.R. No. 65584)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant petitions are devoid of merit.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not the Court of
Appeals erred in holding that the <span class="SpellE">CARDONIGA's</span> title
to the lot in question prevails over the title of the MONTINOLAS.</p>

<p class="BODY">The answer is in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the petitioners that the MONTINOLAS'
title to the lot in question, TCT No. RT-331 (476) was issued on <st1:date year="1953" day="4" month="3">March 4, 1953</st1:date>; while that of the
CARDONIGAS' title, OCT No. RO­-265 (N.A.) was issued six (6) years after, <span style="">or </span>on <st1:date year="1959" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1959</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, they alleged that the Court of Appeals erred in holding
that in point of priority of <span class="GramE">issuance,</span> the CARDONIGAS'
title prevails over the MONTINOLAS' title.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners' allegation is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the MONTINOLAS' title to the questioned lot was
reconstituted ahead than that of the CARDONIGAS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it must be stated that the title of
MONTINOLAS' predecessor-in-interest was originally registered on <st1:date year="1927" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1927</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
II, Record on Appeal, p. 59).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the
other hand, <span style="">in </span><span style="">a </span>cadastral
decision dated <st1:date year="1925" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1925</st1:date>,
penned by Judge M. <span class="SpellE">Buyson</span> <span class="SpellE">Lampa</span>,
the questioned lot was awarded to the CARDONIGAS predecessor-in-interest:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"LOTE NO.</span> 150, con <span class="SpellE">las</span> <span class="SpellE">mejoras</span> <span class="SpellE">existentes</span>
en el, a favor de Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Cardoniga</span> <span class="SpellE">exclusivamente</span>, <span class="SpellE">casado</span> con <span class="SpellE">Silveria</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"> </span><span class="SpellE">Namukatkat</span>." (p. 49, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear, therefore, that in time of priority of issuance, the
CARDONIGAS' title to the questioned lot is ahead of that of the <span style="">MONTINOLAS.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, petitioners claim that the said decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Buyson</span> is inadmissible in evidence <span style="">until </span>the same is presented in new trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such claim is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be stated that the said decision is a
part of the records in the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its authenticity was even admitted by the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, it is evident that
the remand of this <span style="">ca</span>se to the
lower courts for reception of evidence as <span style="">ruled
</span>by this <span class="GramE">Court,</span> is not necessary if the
appellate court could resolve the dispute on the records before it (Group
Developers and Financiers, Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span>, G.R.
73421, <span style="">November 29, </span>1988).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, as aptly stated by the Court of Appeals, the title <span style="">of the </span><span style="">MONTINOLAS' predecessor-in-interest </span>is of doubtful
validity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>TCT No. <span style="">476, dated </span><st1:date year="1940" day="13" month="12"><span style="">December 13, 1940</span></st1:date><span style="">, was the </span>source of <span style="">the administratively </span><span style="">reconstituted title, dated </span><st1:date year="1953" day="4" month="3"><span style="">March </span>4,

918 which </span><span style="">was </span>recorded
as originally registered on <st1:date year="1927" day="5" month="9">September
 5, 1927</st1:date> and reflected therein in the titles of their
predecessors-in-interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the
original date of the decree of registration was in reality <st1:date year="1927" day="8" month="3">March 8, 1927</st1:date>, and not <st1:date year="1927" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1927</st1:date> (Certificate of <span class="SpellE">Godofredo</span> R. <span class="SpellE">Villasnor</span>, Chief
