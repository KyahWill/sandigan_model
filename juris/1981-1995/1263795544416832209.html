<p class="BODY">The accused, Carlo LAGRANA, appeals from the judgment of the 
Regional Trial Court, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span> (<span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>), Branch 39, convicting him, as principal, of 
Murder, sentencing him to <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs 
of the deceased, Benito <span class="SpellE">Adarlo</span>, in the amount of 
P8<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>
<p class="BODY">The other accused, <span class="SpellE">Frangeline</span> SALAZAR, 
who was found guilty as an accomplice and sentenced to suffer an indeterminate 
penalty, did not appeal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution discloses that at around 
<st1:time minute="0" hour="20">8:00 P.M.</st1:time> on <st1:date year="1981" day="3" month="12">3 December 1981</st1:date>, Benito <span class="SpellE">Adarlo</span> (the Victim, for short) was seated along the road 
near the store of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> de Villa in Dao, <span class="SpellE">Naujan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, with the 
accused SALAZAR.<span>&nbsp; </span>The latter was holding one of the Victim's right 
<span class="GramE">arm</span> under the armpit.<span>&nbsp; </span>While thus 
positioned, LAGRANA, who is an uncle of <span class="GramE">SALAZAR,</span> 
arrived.<span>&nbsp; </span>LAGRANA focused the lighted flashlight he was then 
carrying at the face of the Victim <span>and forthwith hit the latter on the 
head with a piece of wood ("<span class="SpellE"><em>kakawati</em></span>"), about 
one meter in length.<span>&nbsp; </span>As a result, the Victim <span class="GramE">fell</span> face downward, unconscious.<span>&nbsp; </span>He never 
regained consciousness until he died in the provincial hospital on 
</span><st1:date year="1981" day="6" month="12"><span>6 December 
1981</span></st1:date><span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">The autopsy findings disclosed the cause of death as "shock 
secondary to severe intracranial hemorrhage secondary to skull fracture 
secondary to head trauma".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The Victim's brother, Nestor <span class="SpellE">Adarlo</span>, who 
was nearby, ran to the succor of his brother only to be challenged by 
LAGRANA.<span>&nbsp; </span>Nestor, however, ignored the challenge and carried his 
brother to their house, which was not too distant from the scene of the 
incident.</p>
<p class="BODY">In addition to Nestor, another eyewitness to the incident was 
<span class="SpellE">Pio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sigalat</span>, who happened 
also to be on his way to the store of <span class="SpellE">Eladio</span> de Villa, 
behind LAGRANA, at a distance of about five (5) meters.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sigalat</span> saw LAGRANA carrying a flashlight and a piece of 
wood and ultimately hitting the Victim on the head.</p>
<p class="BODY">LAGRANA and SALAZAR were summoned by the police authorities the 
following morning of <st1:date year="1981" day="4" month="12">4 December 
1981</st1:date> for investigation, but were initially released.</p>
<p class="BODY">Subsequently, however, they were both charged with Murder.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Trial proceeded only against LAGRANA initially, while SALAZAR stood trial 
only after his arrest in 1983.</p>
<p class="BODY">LAGRANA invoked self defense claiming that the Victim, who was 
then drunk, chased him with a knife for which reason he hit the Victim with a 
piece of "<span class="SpellE"><em>kakawati</em></span>" when the latter thrust 
the knife at him.</p>
<p class="BODY">SALAZAR, for his part, claimed that he and the Victim drank liquor 
before the incident and that, because the Victim was challenging him, he left 
the latter behind as he was afraid.<span>&nbsp; </span>Continuing, he recounted that 
the following morning when informed by his mother that policemen were looking 
for him, he and LAGRANA went to the police station to report but that they were 
both sent home.</p>
<p class="BODY">The Trial Court gave no credence to the defense of <span class="GramE">either accused and</span> convicted LAGRANA as principal and 
SALAZAR, as accomplice of Murder, with the qualifying circumstance of treachery, 
unattended by any generic aggravating or mitigating circumstance.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the Decision 
reads:</p>
<blockquote>"ACCORDINGLY, the Court finds accused Carlo <span class="SpellE">Lagrana</span> and <span class="SpellE">Frangeline</span> Salazar 
guilty beyond reasonable doubt, as principal and accomplice, respectively, of 
the crime of Murder, punishable with <em>reclusion temporal</em> in its maximum 
period to death, as regards the principal, under Article 248 in relation to 
Article 46 of the Revised Penal Code, and with <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><em> mayor</em> in its maximum period to 
<em>reclusion temporal</em> in its medium period, as regards the accomplice, 
under Article 248 in relation to Article 52 of the said code.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Considering that there is neither generic aggravating nor mitigating 
circumstance, the penalty should be imposed in its medium period.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The Indeterminate Sentence Law is not applicable to accused Carlo <span class="SpellE">Lagrana</span>, considering the penalty imposable on him, but 
applicable to accused <span class="SpellE">Frangeline</span> Salazar.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Accused Carlo <span class="SpellE">Lagrana</span>, as principal, is 
hereby sentenced to suffer <em>reclusion perpetua</em> (life imprisonment), 
together with the accessory penalties provided for by law, while accused <span class="SpellE">Frangeline</span> Salazar, as accomplice, is sentenced to suffer 
imprisonment of SIX (6) YEARS, ONE (1) MONTH and ELEVEN (11) DAYS of <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><em> mayor</em>, as minimum, to TWELVE (12) 
YEARS, FIVE (5) MONTHS and ELEVEN (11) DAYS of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, as 
maximum, together with the accessory penalties provided for by law.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Both accused are ordered to indemnify the legal heirs of the deceased 
Benito <span class="SpellE">Adarlo</span> in the amount of P12<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>, by way of actual damages, P8,000.00 to be paid by 
accused Carlo <span class="SpellE">Lagrana</span> and P4,000.00 by <span class="SpellE">Frangeline</span> Salazar, the same to be enforced in accordance 
with the provisions of Article 110 of the Revised Penal Code, without subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>"The accused shall be credited with the full term of their 
preventive imprisonment, if they have any to their credit, pursuant to the 
provisions of Article 29 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act 
No. 6127, provided that the accused shall have agreed to abide with the 
disciplinary rules imposed upon convicted <span>prisoners, </span>otherwise, 
they shall be entitled to only four-fifths (4/5) of the preventive 
imprisonment."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Only LAGRANA has appealed, who does not question his conviction 
nor the characterization of the crime, but merely raises as the lone assignment 
of error that</p>
<blockquote>"The Court erred in brushing aside the mitigating circumstance of 
voluntary surrender and imposing upon accused-appellants penalties that are over 
and above those that they deserve."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Indeed, <span class="SpellE">LAGRANA's</span> guilt has been proven 
beyond reasonable doubt.<span>&nbsp; </span>Two credible prosecution eyewitnesses 
identified him as the main culprit.<span>&nbsp; </span>His plea of self-defense, 
uncorroborated as it is, fails to overcome the clear and direct testimony of 
these witnesses.<span>&nbsp; </span>The crime is Murder, attended by treachery, 
considering the method by which LAGRANA attacked the Victim without risk to 
himself arising from any defense which the Victim might have made.</p>
<p class="BODY">The evidence on record does not support voluntary surrender, as 
contended.<span>&nbsp; </span>As aptly pointed out by the Trial Court:</p>
<blockquote>"Although both accused reported to the police authorities the 
following day after the commission of the crime, it was not for the purpose of 
submitting themselves unconditionally.<span>&nbsp; </span>Accused Carlo <span class="SpellE">Lagrana</span> claimed self-defense when interrogated, while 
accused <span class="SpellE">Frangeline</span> Salazar did not give any statement, 
either verbal or written.</blockquote>
<blockquote>"Accused did not go to the police authorities to surrender but 
merely to report the incident.<span>&nbsp; </span>Indeed, they never evinced any 
desire to own the responsibility for the killing of the deceased (<em>People vs. 
Rogales</em>, 6 SCRA 830)."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Indeed, wanting in this case are the following requisites for 
voluntary surrender to be <span>considered mitigating:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"A surrender to be voluntary must be spontaneous, showing the intent 
of the accused to submit <span class="GramE">himself</span> unconditionally to the 
authorities, either (1) because he acknowledges his guilt, or (2) because he 
wishes to save them the trouble and expenses necessarily incurred in his search 
and capture."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> </blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment appealed from is hereby affirmed, 
with the modification that LAGRANA shall indemnify the heirs of the deceased, 
Benito <span class="SpellE">Adarlo</span>, in the amount of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> with costs.</p>
