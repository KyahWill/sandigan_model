<blockquote>"The complainant, Lolita Avila, who was then 24 years of age,
and living at <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Burauen</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>, finished her teaching
course sometime in 1969 at the Divine Word University of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant began teaching on <st1:date year="1969" day="1" month="8">August 1, 1969</st1:date> in a public school at
Bo. <span class="SpellE">Matinao</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>

and thereafter to <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Lusad</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Elementary School</st1:placetype></st1:place> at the <span class="SpellE">poblacion</span> of <span class="SpellE">Burauen</span> (p. 11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, September 18, 1973).</blockquote>

<blockquote>While assigned at <span class="SpellE">Taboanon</span>, which is
about 3 kilometers from <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Burauen</span>, where she resided, complainant brought along her '<span class="SpellE">baon</span>' and ate her lunch at <span class="SpellE">Taboanon</span>
in the house of <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> and Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span>, parents of the accused <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tismo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant left <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span> at <st1:time minute="45" hour="18">6:45</st1:time> in the morning riding a motorcycle and
reached <span class="SpellE">Taboanon</span> at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7
 o'clock</st1:time> in time for her classes which started at <st1:time minute="30" hour="7">7:30 a.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant returned home to <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>, <span class="SpellE">Burauen</span> by the same means of transportation after her
classes end at <st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00 p.m.</st1:time>, but since
the last week of November, 1972, she had been taking a jeep together with her
co-teacher, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Brosas</span> (pp. 11-13, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="9">Sept. 18,
 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1972</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30 p.m.</st1:time>, complainant was
at the house of <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span>
fetching the container of her '<span class="SpellE">baon</span>' and at the same
time seeking shelter from a slight rain.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The jeep was parked in front of the house of <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tismo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mr. and
Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Brosas</span>, together with Mrs. Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span>, were conversing at the kitchen while complainant was
at the <span class="SpellE">sala</span> sitting on a bench waiting for the <span class="SpellE">Brosas</span> couple to come out for her to join them in going
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this juncture, accused <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> approached
complainant demanding that she reciprocate his love for her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She answered him in the negative, telling the
accused that she does not want to get married yet (pp. 13-14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="9">Sept. 18,
 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant then stood with the intention of going ahead to the
parked jeep, but accused took hold of her <span class="SpellE">leftwrist</span>
(sic) and kissed her, covered her mouth and dragged her towards the dining room
(p. 15, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Sept. 18, 1973), and touched her left breast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant could not shout as her mouth was
covered by the hand of the accused who continued dragging her towards the
dining room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to hold onto
everything her hands could lay on but to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She squeezed (sic) at the stomach of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this time, the people inside
the kitchen had already sneaked out thru the kitchen door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused forced complainant to sit and lie
down on the bench in the dining room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(pp. 16-18, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Sept.18, 1973).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused twisted and pinned around the bench the left wrist of
complainant who, however, managed not to lie straight on the bench by bending
her knees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the accused straddled and
sat on top of her, kissed her and touched her private parts, including her
vagina and its immediate perimeter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused even pulled her hair down to prevent her from rising up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She struggled to free herself by whatever
means she could muster, <span class="SpellE">bitting</span> or pulling away at
the accused but her efforts were not enough.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused continued touching her breasts and vagina alternating his hands
in the process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even tried to remove
complainant's underwear consisting of her shorts and panty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant bit accused with all her might which
caused the latter to release her momentarily, thus frustrating his attempts at
removing her shorts and panty (pp. 19-24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="9">Sept. 18, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Just as soon as complainant sat up, Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span>
appeared and sat at complainant's left side while accused sat at complainant's
right side, <span style="">with </span>his left hand
over her shoulder and his right hand holding unto her dress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused placed his thigh over complainant's
legs to prevent her from standing up.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant struggled with and pushed accused and Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> but complainant was not able to free herself from
their clutches.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant could not
shout because she had chest pains as a result of her struggle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A week before the incident, she was treated
at the <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> TB Pavilion for enlarged lungs as
evidenced by a medical certificate (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B", p. ___, record) signed by Gerardo C. de Guzman, Chief of the <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span> TB Pavilion Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She attempted to run outside the kitchen door
but the accused grabbed and dragged her back to the kitchen (pp. 25-28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span> <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="9">Sept. 18, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>At around <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 p.m.</st1:time>,
Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> ordered the driver of the jeep to go
ahead and leave complainant behind <span style="">as </span>the
latter would be staying with the former.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It <span style="">was at </span>this juncture
that <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span>
arrived, and who (sic) closed and locked the doors and windows of the house
except the kitchen door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> then joined the accused and <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
in convincing complainant to marry the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Without saying anything complainant tried to run away but was foiled by <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
who shoved and pulled complainant by the latter's dress (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"C") which was torn (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "C-1"),
(pp. 32-37, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="9">Sept. 18, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Accused's</span> younger brother, <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> arrived and stationed himself at the main
door.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After three or four minutes, Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span> with a flashlight entered thru the kitchen door and
joined the others in convincing complainant to marry the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant could not answer because of the
pain in her chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> tore a page from complainant's lesson plan (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G") and instructed her to write that she
was staying in their house of her free will, and to sign the same by writing
her name therein (pp. 55­-57, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="10">Oct. 16, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Complainant refused to write and Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>
instructed her to just sign her name at the bottom as he will be the one to
take care of writing above it (pp. 66-67, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="16" month="10">Oct. 16, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> then
placed a yellow <span class="SpellE">ballpen</span> on her hand and guided it
while <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> was at
her back persuading her to sign and for her to agree to a civil marriage with
the accused so that everything would be alright.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant complimented them with her
initials on the assurance that she would be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> took
hold of the piece of paper saying 'alright we are in possession of the
evidence' (pp. 67-72, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were not contented with the initials so
they made complainant sign for the second time on the same piece of paper (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "G-8").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She obliged but with the same initials (p. 74, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Ibid).</blockquote>

<blockquote>They did not comply with their promise to release complainant but
instead told her to sit down on a dining bench <span style="">(p. </span>4, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, Oct. 22, 1973).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>, <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> conversed behind a wall.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant heard them say that she should be
transferred to the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While complainant was being dragged outside
the house she tried to hold on to anything but they would disentangle her
hold.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was dragged by the
accused with the help of Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> from their
kitchen door to the kitchen of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara's</span>
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>
opened the door for them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused
while holding complainant, entered first followed by Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> who was pushing complainant at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> followed suit (pp. 6-10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="10">Oct. 22, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Once inside Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara's</span> house, the
accused helped by his mother dragged complainant to the second floor of said
house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Hospicio</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> and Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>
stayed at the ground floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
second floor the accused and his mother <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> were
convincing complainant to marry the accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant remained silent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
left the accused and complainant on the second floor and went downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused pointed a pistol at complainant and
asked her whether she would agree to a marriage or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant answered in the negative,
preferring death.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Frustrated, the
accused dragged complainant to the bedroom (pp. 10-14, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
<st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="10">Oct. 22, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant resisted and held the doorframe
but the accused succeeded in pulling her into the bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She sat on the bed at the same time holding
the side bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused removed
complainant's hands from the side bar and twisted her arms to weaken her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then accused threw her flat on the bed but
she crossed her legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused sat on her
belly then straightened and <span class="SpellE">layed</span> (sic) on top of
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He tried to open the zipper of
complainant's dress and pull down her shorts and panty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant tried very hard to prevent the
accused from removing her undergarments but her efforts proved futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her shorts and panty were lowered to the middle
part of her thigh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused then unzipped
his pants, lowered the same, took out his private part and tried to have sexual
intercourse with complainant, who however, struggled and resisted but
thereafter discovered that her vagina was wet with sticky fluid so she
immediately put on her shorts and panty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused was then at the door guarding and resting (pp. 15-24, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="10">Oct. 22,
 1973</st1:date>).<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>At this juncture, <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> mother
Trinidad <span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> entered the room carrying food, eggs,
and milk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
sat on the right side of complainant while the accused sat on her left
side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>
coaxed complainant to eat the food the former brought along but the latter
refused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant was forced to drink
the milk by forcibly inserting the spoon between her teeth but the milk just
dripped down her neck.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused and
his mother <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> reiterated their 'unfriendly
persuasion' but complainant did not answer them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because they could not get complainant to
agree to their proposal of marriage, <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> left and
went downstairs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the accused
forcibly threw complainant down flat on the bed after pulling and twisting her
arm in the process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although she crossed
her legs, accused straddled over (sic) her, touched her private parts and
kissed her (pp. 25-27, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="22" month="10">Oct. 22, 1973</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accused by this time was only wearing his nylon briefs as he had removed
his pants after his mother went downstairs (p. 30, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
Ibid).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accused then inserted his knees
between complainant's legs, touched her vagina and kissed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to free herself from his clutches
by biting and pushing him but her struggle was not enough as she felt pain (pp.
31-32, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="10">Oct.
 30, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused then tried again to open the zipper of the
complainant's dress but was prevented by complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused shifted his hands to her <span class="SpellE">underwears</span> (sic) and was able to push down anew her shorts
and panty by tugging at them with an upward and downward motion, tearing the
same in the process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When her shorts and
panty were down to her knees accused kicked them off after he had inserted his
knees between her legs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused then
raised her dress above the waistline exposing her organ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He seized the zipper of her dress and which
was halfway down, then unlatched the hook and eye of her bra and grabbed the
shoulder straps tearing the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
this time, complainant was biting and pinching the accused whenever she could
get her hands free (pp. 33-47, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="10">Oct. 30, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused tried again to have sexual intercourse with the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made the push and pull
movement -- his penis directed towards the vagina of complainant who kept
moving her body so that <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> penis was only
brushing the top of complainant's organ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The accused hugged complainant tightly while performing the push and pull
movement and after sometime she felt a sticky fluid on her vagina after he
trembled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After that, accused sat down
on the bed and rested on her side.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
short time later, <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place> entered the room bringing
eggs and milk (pp. 48-53, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="30" month="10">Oct. 30, 1973</st1:date>)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused and his mother, <st1:place>Trinidad</st1:place>, forced
complainant to eat but she did not partake of anything.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again they asked her to agree to marriage
with the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant told them
that she doesn't want to get married yet.<span style="">&nbsp;

her back (pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="11">Nov. 2, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

crossed moved her body from side to side in order to prevent accused from
inserting his penis into her vagina.<span style="">&nbsp;

inserting his knees between her thighs and twisting her arms (pp. 26-28, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <st1:date year="1973" day="2" month="11">Nov. 2, 1973</st1:date>).</blockquote>

tried moving her body but she could only move her hips as accused was very
heavy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a while, accused trembled

<p class="BODY">Questioned in the first two (2) assigned errors are the findings
of fact of the trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In holding
that appellant and the complainant were not sweethearts and that rape was
indeed committed, the trial court made the following findings and conclusions:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Thus, it can be readily seen that the main questions to be resolved before the
main question of rape itself are whether the complainant and the accused are or
were sweethearts at the time of the incident and whether the complainant
voluntarily or of her own free will went with the accused to the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span> to spend the night with him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As <span style="">stated </span>above,
relevant and material to the solution of the main question of rape in view of
the disparity in the versions offered by the complainant and the accused is
whether they were sweethearts at that time.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant maintains that she and the accused were not sweethearts
although she admitted that the accused courted her by sending her a letter of
love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the accused
contends that he and the complainant were sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused declared in support of his claim
that he and Lolita became sweethearts in March; that he wrote Lolita Avila a
letter which he personally gave to her in their (<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>)
house and said letter was received by Lolita Avila; that Lolita Avila accepted
his offer of love but he cannot remember the month; that he says that they are
sweethearts because he kissed Lolita Avila and she allowed herself to be kissed
by him; that Lolita Avila continued to eat in their (<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>)
house after accepting his love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although
Lolita Avila admitted the fact that the accused sent her a love letter she
denied that she answered him and accepted his love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After carefully scrutinizing the testimonies
of the complainant and the accused on this point, the Court is inclined to
believe the claim of the complainant that she and the accused were not sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The proof shown by the accused is too
unconvincing to be believed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even
the testimonies of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calavara</span> who expressed the
conclusion that as far as his observation is concerned he believed that the
accused and the complainant were sweethearts, and Mrs. Cristina <span class="SpellE">Brosas</span> who expressed the same view as Jose <span class="SpellE">Calavara</span>, can prop up the unconvincing evidence presented
by the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused cannot even
tell or remember when Lolita Avila accepted his love.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He merely stated that he concludes that they
were sweethearts because he kissed her and she allowed herself to be kissed
yet, again he did not say when he made his first kiss on her and where.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it cannot be denied that memory is more
tenacious on facts than on dates, yet, the occasion in a man's life of having
been successful in the pursuit of his lady love is one event that registers
most vividly and indelibly, most especially his first kiss, that it is just
difficult to believe that a man would brush this away and cannot (sic) remember
this singular and pleasurable event in his life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the accused could not and did not
present even a single <span class="SpellE">momento</span> (sic) or any concrete
evidence of their love or their being sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He does not know the birth date of Lolita
Avila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is for these reasons that the
Court finds itself <span class="SpellE">unpersuaded</span> by the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> claim that he and Lolita Avila were sweethearts,
more so that Lolita Avila had denied said fact likewise.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As to whether Lolita Avila was forcibly
taken to the bedroom in the second floor of the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span> at <span class="SpellE">Taboanon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Burauen</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> that evening of
December 12, 1972 as claimed by her or whether she of her own free will
accompanied the accused as claimed by the latter, a rigorous and impartial
scrutiny of the evidence presented by the prosecution and the defense on the
matter would show that Lolita Avila did not voluntarily go with the accused to
the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first reason to support this view would
be the fact or finding that Lolita Avila and <span class="SpellE">Salustiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Tismo</span> the accused are not or were not
sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It would be the height of <span class="SpellE">naivete</span> on the part of the Court to believe that a lady
public school teacher such as the complainant would readily spend the night
with a man not her sweetheart in the house of a third person and with the full
knowledge of the parents of the man and the owner of the house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, what the Court cannot understand is
why the accused would bring Lolita Avila to the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span> in order to spend the night there when his house is
just very near to (sic) the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>, if
his claim, that they were sweethearts was true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court cannot buy the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> argument
that they went to the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span> because
they were afraid Lolita Avila's brothers might come to their (<span class="SpellE">accused's</span>) house because her brothers do not like him he
being from a poor family, because if the claim of the accused that Lolita Avila
voluntarily agreed to spend the night with him, then there was no need to fear
for the brothers of Lolita Avila as the latter can just tell them that she
wants to stay with the accused as she is in love with him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Lolita Avila, then being of age already can
say so and there was no need to hide therefore in the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
attempt to hide from the brothers of the complainant betrays the claim of <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> on the part of Lolita Avila in spending the
night with the accused at the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is further bolstered by the fact that
Lolita Avila was not allowed to attend to her classes the following
morning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it were true that Lolita
Avila voluntarily went with the accused to the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>, she would have been free to go out of the house
and the accused would have nothing to fear because then he could just say that he
did not force Lolita Avila to be with him and Lolita Avila herself could say
so, but as it was, when Lolita Avila asked the accused to be allowed to go to
her classes when she heard the school bell ring, the accuse (sic) did not allow
her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of fact Lolita Avila
and the accused stayed the entire morning in the same room they spent the night
together, with the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> brother and parents
staying outside as if guarding them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, if it was the intention of the accused and the complainant to leave
the following morning as what Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span> testified
in trying to justify the defense's claim that Lolita Avila voluntarily spent
the night with the accused why was it that they did not leave but instead
stayed in the same room until the brother of Lolita Avila and companions
forcibly took her away?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
circumstances simply negates (sic) the claim of the defense that Lolita Avila
stayed with the accused in the house of Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span>
that night of <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1972</st1:date>
of her own free will.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As to the main question of the rape, the accused has presented the
defense of denial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused denied
having or trying to have sexual intercourse with Lolita Avila that whole night
of <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="12">December 12, 1972</st1:date> when
they were alone together in the bedroom at the second floor of the house of
Jose <span class="SpellE">Calvara</span> at <span class="SpellE">Taboanon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Burauen</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said he did not have sexual intercourse
with her because Lolita Avila said that they would have their sexual
intercourse only after the wedding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All
they did the whole night therefore was kissing and romancing (sic).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Again the Court finds itself unconvinced by this pretension of the
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court finds it highly
incredible and contrary to common experience and observation that the accused a
healthy and well developed male of 18 or 19 years, alone the whole night in a
room with the woman he loves, would just content himself (sic) with kissing and
romancing (sic) her and not try to have sexual intercourse simply because he
was told to wait until the wedding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, this claim of the accused is disputed by the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant Lolita Avila has pictured in
stark details how the accused succeeded in having sexual intercourse with her
despite her efforts to defend herself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is more reason to believe the complainant's assertion because
there is simply no motive on the part of the complainant to charge the accused
with such a serious crime if it were not true.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is very hard to imagine that a woman such as the complainant herein
who is a public school teacher would 'willingly expose herself to the
embarrassment of a public trial, allow her private parts to be examined by a
doctor, and narrate publicly the details of the violation of her person if
indeed such were not the case.' It is noteworthy at this instance to state that
the Court has closely observed the conduct of the complainant on the witness
stand and the Court has noted her firm, categorical and straightforward
testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the long and
searching questions propounded on (sic) her during which time she would now and
they (sic) cry when she reaches that part of her testimony regarding the
violation of her person, the complainant stuck to her claim that the accused
succeeded in forcibly having sexual intercourse with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court is convinced of the sincerity of
her testimony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court in the
case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Royeras</span>, L-31886, <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1974</st1:date> ruled that 'When a
woman testifies that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is
necessary to show that rape has been committed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the testimony is not improbable, the defendant may be convicted on
the basis of such uncorroborated testimony' (<st1:country-region><st1:place>U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Ramos, 1 Phil. 81).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is what the
complainant has done in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
addition to her testimony she has likewise shown her clothing and intimate
garments, ripped and torn, mute witnesses to the futile resistance she put up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court has seriously considered the testimony of Dr. Jose P. <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span>, the physician who conducted the internal examination
on Lolita Avila who in addition to his findings that the external genitalia of
the complainant at the time of his examination was normal; that there was
slight congestion but no lacerations seen at the <span class="SpellE">introitus</span>
and hymen; that the vagina barely admits two fingers with difficulty (sic) and <span class="SpellE">interse</span> (sic) pain; that whitish and viscous discharge was
seen at and taken from the vagina and that microscopic examination showed that
it was negative for spermatozoa, declared that he cannot categorically say that
the victim was raped.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a thorough
analysis of said testimony, the Court is of the considered view that said
opinion of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> does not change the conclusion
reached by the Court in view of the pertinent rulings of the Supreme Court on
the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of People vs. <span class="SpellE">Cañete</span>, L-340491, <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="1">Jan.
 21, 1972</st1:date>, the accused were convicted or (sic) rape notwithstanding
the absence of laceration (sic) in the complainant's vagina at the time of her
medical examination in an effort to show that her testimony was <span class="SpellE">incrdible</span> (sic).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
that case, the vagina of the victim also admitted two fingers but 'very
tightly' and with some pain.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In brushing
aside the claim of the accused, the Supreme Court citing 3 Wharton and <span class="SpellE">Stille</span> Medical Jurisprudence, mentioned of 'the case of a
girl 18 years of age, whose vagina was notably enlarged by coition, although
the hymen was uninjured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This membrane
was <span class="SpellE">cresentic</span>, thick and fleshy, but as elastic as <span class="SpellE">india</span> rubber.' This may be applied here although it was
unfortunate that the matter of the complainant's lack of laceration (sic) in
her vagina was not raised by the defense in view of their stand that there was
no sexual intercourse.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The finding of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Rosal</span> that microscopic

prove some ill-motive on her part, for her immediate denunciation of the act

satisfactory, yet it is a sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt upon this
material question in the case, to the benefit of which the defendant is

other evidence of this character would have been much more satisfactory to the

where the trial court rejected the claim of the accused that he was but 16

said ruling in this wise:</p>
