				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of the then Intermediate Appellate Court in AC-G.R. CV No. 02901
entitled "<span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span>,
et al., plaintiffs-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span> v. <span class="GramE">The
Heirs of the Deceased Spouses Pedro de Castro and Francisca Barron, et el<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">., </span>defendants-appellants."</span>
Penned by the Hon. <span class="SpellE">Abdulwahid</span> A. <span class="SpellE">Bidin</span>,
now a distinguished member of this Court, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">decision reversed </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Bacoor</span>, </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Cavite</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> which had earlier decreed that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">petitioners still have a participation in the
three </span>lots under dispute. The petitioners had inherited an undivided
portion of the realties with respondents and although they had sold their
interest therein to the latter the lower court pronounced the sale to be
void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The decision under review
upheld the validity of the sale and denied partition of the lots and its <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to the petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The three lots under consideration were owned either by Pablo de
Castro as his exclusive properties or by him and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Romana</span>
Lopez, as their conjugal property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
spouses had a daughter, Maria de Castro who bore them two grandchildren, <span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span> and Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span>,
the herein petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Romana</span> Lopez' demise Pablo de Castro re-married.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From his second wife, Francisca Barron, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">he </span>had five children, three of whom
are now the respondents while the others, now deceased, are represented by
their children also as respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In 1943 Maria </span>de
Castro died.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">was </span>followed by her father, Pablo, about three months thereafter,
and the administration of the three parcels of land, which remained
undistributed up to that time, was passed to Francisca Barron, who together
with respondents, possessed the lots, to the exclusion of the petitioners, up
to the present time.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1945" day="8" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">September
 8, 1945</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, the
petitioners sold to </span>Francisca Barron for one thousand eight hundred (P1<span class="GramE">,800.00</span>) pesos "<u>the</u> <u>portion</u> <u>corresponding</u>
<u>to</u> <u>[their]</u> <u>deceased</u> <u>mother,</u> <u>Maria</u> <u>de</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u>Castro</u> <u>of</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><u>the</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span><u>three</u> <u>(3)</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">
</span><u>parcels</u> <u>of</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> <u>l</u></span><u>and</u>
<u>described</u> <u>therein</u>." The document was never registered with
the Register of Deeds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After Francisca
Barron's death sometime in 1950, her heirs, alleging succession and adverse
possession, caused the registration of the lands and consequently, Original
Certificates of Title Nos. (3154) 0-S-172, 0-273 and 106753 were issued in
1962, 1963 and 1966, respectively, in the names of the respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1978</st1:date>,
respondents sold the lot covered by OCT (3154) 0-S-172 to <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span>
Development Corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The corporation
paid half of the purchase price to the vendors while the balance is now
deposited with the Philippine National Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It should be noted that the corporation was not named as party
respondent in this petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Recovery of
the land bought by that entity, therefore, is not the issue but rather the
petitioners' share in the purchase price.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1978</st1:date>
the petitioners filed an action for "Partition, <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>
and Damages" against the respondents where they claimed, among other
things, that the deed of sale they had executed in favor of Francisca Barron
was null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was
twice amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the proceeding,
Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span> manifested his disinterest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">in </span>pursuing the case by filing <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>verified "Motion to
Dismiss" praying that the case be dismissed as far as he is
concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court denied the
motion and ruled, as <span class="GramE">aforementioned,</span> that the sale <span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span> and Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span>
entered into with Francisca Barron was void on the grounds of minority,
vitiated consent and lack of consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The appellate court, in
reversing the decision of the trial court, reasoned that the defects of the
sale between the petitioners and respondents' predecessor-in-<span class="GramE">interest,</span>
rendered the transaction merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> and not
void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then it decreed that Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span> could not now defeat the validity of the sale on
the ground of his minority during its execution because he failed to contest it
within 4 years after reaching majority in 1950, having filed the complaint only
in </span>1978.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Also, it rejected the
trial court's finding that the petitioners were victims of fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court had accepted the allegation
of <span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span> that </span>she
and her brother, Fernando, were misled into believing that the document they
were signing was for them to receive their share in the fruits of the disputed
properties, and that in fact no consideration was given them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unable to read English, they signed the deed
not knowing that it was in fact a sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the appellate court pointed to the testimonies of the attorney who
notarized the document and that of one of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">subscribing witnesses, who both stated that the contents of the deed of
sale were explained to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">petitioners, and that the latter were in fact
paid the purchase price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Coupled with
the presumption of the regularity of a public document, the appellate court </span>rejected
any notion of fraud.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, the
court argued, more than ten years had elapsed from the dates of the
registration of the lots before the petitioners filed their complaint, and
thus, an action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> based on
constructive trust is no longer available.</p>

<p class="BODY">For preliminary consideration is petitioners' argument that the
appellate court erred in not taking note of the fact that the action they had
filed with the lower court was not one for annulment of the sale but for
partition which kind of action does not prescribe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We believe the appellate court was correct in
identifying the crucial issue as to whether or not the petitioners<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span>are still co-owners of the disputed
lands, and to resolve the question, in passing on the validity of the sale
under consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no
controversy on the point that an action for partition is <span class="SpellE">imprescriptible</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, "an action for partition among
co-heirs <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ceases </span>to be such, and
becomes one for title where the defendants allege exclusive ownership"
(Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, Vol. 3 pp. 294-­95, 1980 ed., citing
Rodriguez v. <span class="SpellE">Ravilan</span>, 17 Phil. 63, etc.) as in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then it becomes necessary to
determine if a state of co-ownership still <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">exists </span>which brings <span class="GramE">Us</span> to the question of
whether the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sale </span>between
petitioners and Francisca Barron is valid.</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no doubt as to the correctness of the pronouncement
of the appellate court that Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span>
forfeited his opportunity to question the sale on the ground of his
minority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is supported by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">last paragraph of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">Art. </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">1391 of the New Civil </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Code.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">on this point since the statement of the
appellate court summarized earlier is sufficient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Neither
may petitioners now have the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">sale
annulled on the ground of vitiated consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The four-year period within which an action for annulment must be
brought begins to run, in case of mistake or fraud, from the</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">time

is to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">be </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">remembered that the

petitioners' complaint was filed only in 1978.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In view of the foregoing,
petitioners cannot even </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">say </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that there was any defect </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">cause is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the realties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, for all legal
purposes the amount mentioned is the purchase price for the lots.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The petitioners insist,
however, that the contract is not <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> but void
because they were never paid the purchase price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They cite the case of <span class="SpellE">Ladanga</span>
v. Court of Appeals, No. L-55999, </span><st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="8"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">August 24, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, 131 SCRA 361, where <span class="GramE">We</span>
reiterated Our pronouncement in <span class="SpellE">Mapalo</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Mapalo</span>, 123 Phil 979, that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"A contract of purchase and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">sale </span>is null and void and produces no effect whatsoever where the
same is without cost or consideration in that the purchase price, which appears
thereon as paid, has in fact never been paid by the purchaser to the
vendor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But as mentioned earlier, this case does not involve a contract
without consideration as to render the agreement void under Articles 1352 and
1409 (3) of the New Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
indeed petitioners were not paid the purchase price then that merely entitled
them to the remedies of an unpaid seller.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But even those remedies, unfortunately, are no longer available to
petitioners because an action based on a written contract prescribes in ten
(10) years (Art. 1144 [1], New Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even if <span class="GramE">We</span> were to count the period from 1945,
the date of the execution of the document, or from 1950, the year Fernando <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span> became of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">age,
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the conclusion would remain the
same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">One last point on the matter of prescription.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners invoke Article 1456 of the New

</span>Assuming the law's applicability, the equitable remedy it provides is no

v. Intermediate Appellate Court, G.R. No. 71110, November 22, 1988).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the appellate court that the document of sale was
not tainted with any irregularity at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As against the self-serving statements of <span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span>, We give more credence to that of the notary
public and the subscribing witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, it is highly inconsistent of <span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span> to say that what she thought she signed was for
her to receive her share in the income of the disputed lots yet, she did not
assert her right from that time in 1945 up to the filing of the instant case in
1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was only in the latter year
when respondents sold to <span class="SpellE">Casimiro</span> Development
Corporation one of the lots for a little less than a million pesos did <span class="SpellE">Teodosia</span> <span class="SpellE">Lebrilla</span> suddenly wake
up claiming her interest on the realties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the conclusion that the petitioners had already
sold their interest on the disputed lots to the respondents, it is no longer
necessary to discuss their other assignment of errors which primarily asserts
their right as co-heirs.</p>
