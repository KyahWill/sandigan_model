				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">In the original action
which has given rise to the proceedings at bar</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> -- instituted in 1975 by the plaintiff Jose
Balde (private respondent herein) principally for the recovery of damages
resulting from the allegedly illegal termination of his employment from the</span>
so-called "Fernandez Companies"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
effected by herein petitioners -- one of the defendants, Jose P. Fernandez,
denominated the "principal" one, died before final judgment of the
Trial Court.  The legal consequences of
that party's death are what are now chiefly in issue.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint filed in the Court <i>a quo </i><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> n</span>amed as defendants the six (6)
petitioner corporations herein, as well as (1) Jose P. Fernandez "in his
own personal capacity and/or as Chairman of the Board, President, or
Director" of said firms; (2) Redentor R. Melo, "in h<span style="">is own personal capacity and/or as Chief
Legal Counsel of Pier 8 Arrastre &amp; Stevedoring Services, Inc.;" and
(3) Eliodoro C. Cruz, "in his own personal capacity and/or as a legal
assistant" in the same company.  It
alleged that Balde was "summarily ousted and dismissed" from his job
as "Chief Accountant and Credit &amp; Collection Manager of Pier 8
Arrastre and Stevedoring Services ** (since) 1973 and Chief Accountant of
Western Pacific Corporation ** (since) 1974."</span><span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the
Court had no jurisdiction over the nature of the action, which was essentially
a "'money claim' arising from an employer?<span style="">employee relationship" exclusively cognizable by the National
Labor Relations Commission, and that no official decision had yet been reached
regarding termination of Balde's employment.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The defendants also filed a supplemental
motion urging dismissal of the action because venue had been improperly laid.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> After oppositions were filed to both
motions, the Court issued an Order holding "in abeyance the resolution **
(thereof) until pre-trial is conducted and evidence is presented ** without
prejudice to dismissing the case when the ground for dismissal becomes apparent."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants thereafter presented their "Answer with
Compulsory Counterclaim," which contained specific denials and qualified
admissions of the averments of the complaint; alleged as affirmative defenses
the same grounds alleged in their motions to dismiss, and the fact that they
had acted entirely in accordance with law and in all good faith in discharging
Balde from employment, he having "done acts prejudicial and inimical to
their interests and (which) have caused damage;" and seeking recovery of
moral, actual and exemplary damages resulting from Balde's "completely
unfounded and baseless action.”<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Pre-trial and trial ensued after Balde filed his answer to the counterclaim and
a reply to the answer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Balde's presentation of his evidence-in-chief was concluded upon
the admission by the Court of his exhibits over the defendants’ objections, by
Order dated October 21, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">Some two weeks afterwards, or more precisely on November 7, 1987,
defendant Jose P. Fernandez died.  Notice thereof was given to the Court by his counsel, through a
manifestation dated November 16, 1987.<span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As intimated in the opening paragraph of this Decision, the death
of Fernandez brought up the question of the legal consequences of that demise,
and the action that the Trial Court should properly take in view thereof.  For the sake of clarity, and the better to
gauge the propriety of the action actually taken by Trial Court, the narration
of the material facts is interrupted at this point, so that a brief exposition
of the applicable law may be made.</p>

<p class="BODY">The effects of the death of a defendant in a civil suit are
dependent upon the nature of the action:  whether (a) the action is a <span style="">personal
one for "recovery of money, debt or interest thereon,"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or (b) is not for said purpose,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> i.e., it is a real action,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> or one for recovery of personal property
"or to enforce a lien thereon, and actions to recover damages for an
injury </span><span style="">to person or property,
real </span>or personal."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> The
effects of the defendant's death are dependent, as well, on the time of his
demise.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law says that "(w)hen the action is for recovery of
money, debt or interest thereon, and the defendant <i>dies <u>before</u> final
judgment </i><span style="">in the Court of First
Instance (now Regional Trial Court), </span><i>it shall be dismissed to be
prosecuted in the manner especially provided in these rules."</i><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">The "especial" manner of the prosecution of said money
claims against the decedent is set forth in Rule 86 of the Rules of Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
in connection with the judicial proceedings for the settlement of the estate of
a deceased person.  "The reason for
the dismissal of the ordinary action," as a noted commentator stresses,
"is that upon the death of the defendant a testate or intestate proceeding
shall be instituted in the proper court wherein all his creditors must appear and
file their claims which shall be paid proportionately <span style="">out </span>of the property left by the deceased.  It is, therefore, to avoid useless duplicity
of procedure that the ordinary action <span style="">must
</span>be wiped <span style="">out </span>from the
ordinary courts."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">If the defendant <i>dies <u>after</u> final judgment </i>of the
Regional Trial Court, the action (for money, debt or interest thereon) is not <span style="">dismissed, and an appeal may be taken by or
against the administrator;</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> but <span style="">if that judgment against the deceased becomes
</span><i>final and executory, </i><span style="">it shall
be enforced, not by execution under Rule 39, but in accordance with Section 5
of Rule 86,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> i.e., by presenting the same as a claim
against the estate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If, on the other hand, the claim against the defendant is <i>other
than for "money, debt or interest thereon" -- </i>i.e., it is a real
action,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
or one for recovery of personal property "or to enforce a lien thereon,
and, actions to recover damages for an injury to person or property, real or
personal," <i>supra</i><a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> --
and the defendant dies, the claim against him is not thereby extinguished, and
the action will not be dismissed but continue against the decedent's legal
representative.  Section 17, Rule 3
specifies the procedure to be followed, <i>viz</i>.</p>

<blockquote><span style="">" </span>* *.  After a party dies and the claim is not
thereby extinguished, the court shall order, upon proper notice, the legal
representative of the deceased to appear and to be substituted for the deceased
within a period of thirty (30) days, or within such time as may be
granted.  If the legal representative
fails to appear within said time, the court may order the opposing party to
procure the appointment of a legal representative of the deceased within a time
to be specified by the court, and the representative shall immediately appear
for and on behalf of the interest of the deceased.  The court charges involved in procuring such appointment, if
defrayed by the opposing party, may be recovered as costs.  The heirs of the deceased may be allowed to
be substituted for the deceased, without requiring the appointment of an executor
or administrator and the court may appoint guardian <i>ad litem </i>for the
minor heirs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The record discloses that the Court did not dismiss the action as
against the deceased defendant, Fernandez, conformably with Section 21, Rule
3.  What it did was:  (a) to require the defendants' new counsel,
former Supreme Court Justice Arsenio P. Dizon, by Order dated November 21,
1987, "to effect the substitution of said deceased defendant within thirty
(30) days **,"<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> (a
requirement it reiterated in another Order dated October 4, 1988); and (b) on
later learning that said Justice Dizon was the Administrator of the Fernandez
Estate, to require the latter, by Order dated January 2, 1989, to appear before
it on February 4, 1989 (later reset to March 6, 1989) <i>"to be substituted
as party defendant for and in behalf of the deceased Jose P. Fernandez"</i>.  The Trial Judge was obviously proceeding in
accordance with Section 17, Rule 3; and it was doing so quite erroneously,
since the action against the deceased and his co-defendants was clearly one for
the <i>"recovery of money, debt or interest thereon" </i>which, by
direction of Section 21 of the same Rule, should "be <i>dismissed to be
prosecuted in the </i><i><span style="">manner
especially provided in these rules," </span></i><span style="">at least in so far as concerned the deceased defendant.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Dizon was unable to appear at the hearing of March 6,
1989, on account of the poor state of his health at the time.  This he alleged in a telegram to the Court,
and in a subsequent formal motion, seeking on that account a resetting of the
hearing to "either April 17, 18 and 28/89 or May 1, 2 and <span style="">3/89."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Unfortunately, neither the telegram
nor the motion was received by the Trial Court in time.  Hence, by Order dated March 6, 1989, the
Court directed plaintiff Jose Balde to formally move in writing to have the
case submitted for decision by reason of the defendants’ failure to appear
despite notice.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the defendants received notice of the Order of March 6,
1989, they promptly moved for reconsideration through Atty. Rafael Dizon, under
date of March 18, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> By
Order dated March 31, 1989, the Trial Court, without referring to its earlier
Order of March 6, 1989, re-scheduled the hearing on April 24, 1989, but
required that "if and when Atty. Arsenio Dizon shall still be indisposed
during the next hearing, one of the associates of the law firm shall appear for
the defendants in order to avoid further delay in the disposition of this case
** (considering that) this case was filed since 1975 and this case could not be
disposed of because of continuous postponement by the parties."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, notice of the Order of March 31, 1989 -- resetting the
hearing on April 24, 1989 -- sent from Ligao, Albay, was not received by the
defendants in Metro Manila until the very day of the hearing, April 24,
1989.  Atty. Rafael Dizon immediately
dispatched a telegram to the Court that same day, reading as follows:  "RECEIVED COPY MARCH 31, 1989 ORDER
SETTING HEARING OF CIVIL CASE, 528 APRIL 24 ONLY TODAY APRIL 24, 1989.  REQUEST RESET TO MAY 2,14, 25, 31, JUNE 1,
2, 1989.  FORMAL MOTION TO FOLLOW."
The telegram evidently came too late.  What the Court had before it when the case was called at the <span style="">appointed hour on April 24, 1989 was Atty.
Dizon's motion dated March 18, 1989 for reconsideration of the Order of March
6, 1989, which had already been granted (the Court having on March 31,1989,
reset the hearing on April 24, 1989).  The Court then proceeded to declare said motion of April 18, 1989 </span><span style="">"moot </span><span style="">and academic" and, in view of the defendants’ absence at the hearing
of </span><span style="">April 24, 1989, </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">consider the case submitted for decision.  These dispositions </span><span style="">it
made in the </span><span style="">following Order, </span><span style="">to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"When this case was called for hearing this morning, the court
received the Motion seeking for reconsideration of the order dated March 6,
1989 considering this case submitted for decision, for failure of counsel for
the defendants to appear on the said setting.  The record shows that the order sought to be reconsidered by defendants
has already been reconsidered by this court, when the court ordered on March
31, 1989 to set this case for today.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Motion for Reconsideration filed by Atty. Rafael S. Dizon, now
appearing as counsel for the defendants, is hereby considered moot and
academic.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view, however, of the fact that the defendants and counsel
failed to appear today without justifiable cause, on motion of plaintiff, this
case is hereby ordered submitted for decision based on the evidence so far
presented."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioners, notices of the Orders of April 24,
1989 and March 31, 1989 were never served on them or their counsel.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
This is why, under date of October 19, 1989, they filed a "Motion to
Resolve Motion for Reconsideration dated March 18, 1989 and to Set Case for
Hearing."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
This last motion was resolved by the Trial Court -- now presided over by Hon.
Protacio C. Sto. Tomas -- in an Order dated October 17, 1989.  In said Order the Court quoted <i>verbatim </i>the
Order of April 24, 1989 of "Hon. Salvador D. Silerio, then Presiding Judge
of this Court;" pointed out that said order of April 24, 1989 "has
not been reconsidered and set aside;" and directed the immediate
transmittal, "pursuant to an existing Administrative Order issued by the
Supreme Court, ** (of) the records ** ** to Judge Salvador D. Silerio,
Presiding Judge of RTC, Branch 8, Legazpi City for him to render the
corresponding decision."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners received copy of the Order of October 17, 1989 on
November 7, 1989.  On the same day, they
also received a copy of another Order of the same Court dated October 25, 1989,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>

<blockquote>"The records disclosed that the Motion to Resolve Motion for
Reconsideration dated March 18, 1989 and to Set Case for Hearing filed by Atty.
Rafael S. Dizon dated October 19, 1989 has already been resolved and acted
upon, in the sense, that this case was already submitted for decision as of
April 24, 1989 signed by Hon. Salvador D. Silerio, presiding Judge, copy of
which was furnished Atty. Rafael Dizon.  Atty. Dizon appears not to have a fixed address as the order of the
court sent to him addressed at 5th Floor, Strata Building, Emerald Avenue,
Ortigas Commercial Complex, Pasig, Metro Manila has not been claimed by said
counsel.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Examining the instant motion, we find that it does not conform with
the mandatory requirements of Sections 4, 5 and 6 of Rule 15 of the Rules of
Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Wherefore, the motion is denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 21, 1989, the petitioners once again filed a motion for
reconsideration, this time directed against the Orders of April 24, October 17,
and October 25, 1989.  In that motion,
denominated "Motion for Reconsideration with Motion to Dismiss,"<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>

of the Rules of Court."</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners set the motion for hearing on December 6, 1989 at
8:30 A.M., furnishing copy thereof on adverse counsel by registered mail.  In anticipation of his attendance at the
hearing of his motion, Atty. Rafael Dizon booked passage on the PAL flight from
Manila to Legazpi City on December 5, 1989 and from Legazpi to Manila on
December 6, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Events however made it impossible for Atty. Dizon to appear at
the <i><span style="">sala </span></i>of Judge Sto.
Tomas on December 6, 1989.  These
events, specified by Dizon, were those resulting from the aborted <i><span style="">coup d'etat </span></i>on December 1, 1989,
i.e., "the closure of the Manila Domestic Airport, the indefinite
cancellation of all domestic airline flights and the unavailability of public
transportation going out of Metro Manila." Alleging these as basis, Atty.
Dizon sought a resetting of the hearing on his motion to December 20, 1989,
through a telegram,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a> and
an "Urgent Motion to Reset dated December 4, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court denied the telegraphic request for postponement, in an
Order dated December 6, 1989, <i><span style="">viz.:<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<blockquote>"When the Motion for Reconsideration with Motion to Dismiss
dated November 21, 1989 was called for hearing, the movant Rafael S. Dizon
failed to appear notwithstanding that this is the date set forth by him.  However, a telegram has been received wherein
said movant prays for a postponement of the hearing of said motion alleging
that a formal motion will follow.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Examining the records, we find that the first motion for
reconsideration dated March 18, 1989 was already resolved and denied by this
Court in its order of October 25, 1989.  This being the case, and considering that the rules does not allow a
second motion for reconsideration without first securing leave of court, the
instant motion for reconsideration dated November 21, 1989 is <i>DENIED."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing development, the petitioners felt
constrained to institute, as they did institute in the Court of Appeals a
special civil action of <i><span style="">certiorari </span></i>to
annul and set aside the Trial Court's five (5) Orders just mentioned, of April
24, May 29, October 17, October 25, and December 6, 1989.<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
Their action failed.  The Appellate
Tribunal declared that upon the facts, it was "not prepared to rule that
respondent Court's issuance of the assailed orders is tainted with grave abuse
of discretion calling for the application of the extra-ordinary writ of <i>certiorari</i>,"
and accordingly dismissed their petition.  More particularly, it ruled that -</p>

<p class="NUM">1) "the alleged error committed by respondent Court in not
dismissing the complaint against the deceased defendant Jose Fernandez, if at
all, is merely an error of judgment and not of jurisdiction," and hence,
not correctible by the special civil action of <i><span style="">certiorari </span></i>under Rule 65;</p>

<p class="NUM">2) "even if the claim against the deceased ** Fernandez may
be dismissed, it does not necessarily follow that the complaint in Civil Case
No. 528-LV should be dismissed in toto, considering that there are other
defendants in the case, and considering further that some of the defendants,

to assert, basically, that "there is no showing at all that the Hon. Court

discretion" on the part of the Appellate Court."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The first point raised by petitioners is well taken.  As already stated,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">It was error, too, for the Trial Court to deny Atty. Dizon's
motion dated November 21, 1989 for reconsideration of the Orders of April 24,
October 17, and October 25, 1989, on the ground that it was in effect a second
motion for reconsideration and "the rules does (sic) not allow a second
motion for reconsideration without first securing leave of court ** ."
There is no such rule as regards interlocutory orders like those sought to be
reconsidered.  The Trial Judge might
possibly have had in mind Section 4, Rule 37, of the Rules of Court, governing
a "second motion for new trial, based on a ground not existing nor
available when the first motion was made," but the section clearly applies
only to final judgments, not to interlocutory orders.  The Trial Judge might have had in mind Section 1, Rule 52 pertinently
providing that "(n)o more than one motion for re-hearing or
reconsideration shall be filed without express leave of court," but again,
it is clear that the proviso applies <span style="">only
to final judgments of the Court of Appeals, not to interlocutory orders or
resolutions.  The Trial Judge might have
had in view Section 11 of Batas Pambansa Bilang 129 (Judiciary Reorganization
Act of 1980) which </span><i>inter alia </i><span style="">decrees that "no second motion for reconsideration shall be
entertained," or paragraph 4 of the Interim or Transitional Rules relative
to the implementation of said B.P. Blg. 129, promulgated by this Court,
declaring that "(n)o party shall be </span>allowed a second motion for
reconsideration of a final order or judgment;" but again these provisions
obviously have reference not to interlocutory orders but to final judgments or
orders.  A second motion attacking an
interlocutory order might possibly be denied on the ground that it is a
"rehash" or mere reiteration of grounds and arguments already passed
upon and resolved by the Court; it cannot be rejected on the ground that a
second motion for reconsideration of an interlocutory order is forbidden by
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question that now arises is whether these errors amount to
grave abuse of discretion on the part of the Trial Judge.  The first does.  In adamantly refusing to dismiss the action against the deceased
Fernandez so that the claim against him might be filed in the special
proceedings for the settlement of his estate, it is clear that His Honor was
refusing to apply an explicit mandate of the Rules of Court although well aware
of it, and of the fact that no reason existed in the record for excepting the
case at bar from the operation of the rule.  Such a refusal, in other words, may not be deemed to constitute
"merely an error of judgment and not of jurisdiction," as the Court
of Appeals characterizes it, but as an outright defiance of the plain
provisions of the Rules of Court which had been insistently brought to his
attention; an act therefore, executed without any justification in law,
whimsically, capriciously, and oppressively; an act, in short, done with grave
abuse of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What has just been stated makes inconsequential the failure of
Atty. Dizon to appear before the Court on December 6, 1989, the date set by him
for the hearing of his motion for reconsideration of November 21, 1989 -- in
which he asked that said hearing be reset because fortuitous events precluded
his appearance, and reiterated the prayer that the action be dismissed as
against defendant Fernandez because of the latter's demise.  For even assuming that Atty. Dizon's failure
to receive notices of, and consequent omission to appear at, the hearings of
February 4, 1989, March 6, 1989 and April 24, 1989 were inexcusable, because
the failure to receive said notices was due to his "continuously changing
his address," as the Court of Appeals points out, that circumstance did
not make unmeritorious the motion for dismissal of the suit as against deceased
Fernandez.  It must be mentioned,
however, in fairness to Atty. Dizon, that he had as a matter of fact made
preparations for presenting himself before the Trial Court at the hearing of
December 6, 1989, booking passage on Philippine Airlines on December 5, 1989,
and that the closure of airports and cancellation of domestic flights on
account of the aborted <i>coup d'etat </i>of December 1, 1989 -- of which the
Court takes judicial notice -- had indeed made impossible his intended
appearance before the Trial Court on the appointed day, December 6, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not to be overlooked in this case is the nature of the complaint
instituted by Jose Balde in the Trial Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
which upon sufficient reflection is disclosed as pertaining to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the Labor Arbiters of the Department of Labor and Employment
and not the regular courts of justice.  That complaint alleged that Balde was "summarily ousted and
dismissed" from his job as "Chief Accountant and Credit &amp;
Collection Manager of Pier 8 Arrastre and Stevedoring Services ** (a job he had
held since) 1973 and Chief Accountant of Western Pacific corporation ** (held
since) 1974." It averred that despite his having worked efficiently and
caused an increase in the profitability of the companies, and allegedly on
evidence known by defendant Cruz to be sham -- that he (Balde) was implicated
in some anomaly in the procurement of supplies and spare parts -- said
defendant Cruz unceremoniously relieved him of his duties and sealed and
searched his personal belongings; that on his (Balde's) insistence, an investigation
was eventually conducted by defendant Melo, the Chief Legal Counsel, ostensibly
to ascertain the truth but which was actually nothing but an
"inquisition" characterized by "malice, bias, prejudice and
partiality," at which he was not accorded full opportunity to defend
himself; and that Fernandez, the highest corporate official in the
corporations, turned a deaf ear to Balde's pleas for a "speedy and
impartial investigation." Upon these factual assertions, the complaint
prayed for the payment by the defendants to Balde of actual, moral, and
exemplary damages in the aggregate amount of P1,100,000.00, attorney's fees in
the sum of P100,000.00, and "such other reliefs equitable in the
premises." It did not include reinstatement as a specific relief. </p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint, in other words, set forth claims for money arising
from employer-employee relations.  Now,
at the time that the complaint was filed, in 1975, exclusive jurisdiction over
such "money claims arising from employer-employee relations"<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
as well "all other cases or matters arising from employer-employee
relations,"<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
was vested by the law in the Labor Arbiters of the National Labor Relations
Commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
That jurisdiction remained substantially unaffected by subsequent amendments of
the Labor Code up to 1989,<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a> when
Republic Act No. 6715 became effective, except that for a time, about three (3)
years, Labor Arbiters were <span style="">divested of
competence to "entertain claims for moral or other forms of damages."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 13pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Republic Act No. 6715,<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
embodying the latest amendments to the Labor Code of the Philippines, the
following cases <i>inter alia </i>fall within the "original and exclusive
jurisdiction" of Labor Arbiters, to wit:</p>

<blockquote><span style="font-size: 13pt;">“</span>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2) Termination disputes;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3) If accompanied with
a claim for reinstatement, those cases that workers may file involving wages,
rates of pay, hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4) Claims for
actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising from
employer-employee relations;</blockquote>

<blockquote>* * *</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6) Except claims
for employees compensation, social security, medicare and maternity benefits,
all other claims arising from employer-employee relations, including those
persons in domestic or household services, involving an amount not exceeding
five thousand pesos (P5,000.00) whether or not accompanied with a claim for
reinstatement."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The claims in question do not involve "wages, rates of pay,
hours of work and other terms and conditions of employment." They do
constitute, however, a "termination dispute," and are actually
"claims for actual, moral, exemplary and other forms of damages arising
from employer-employee relations," unaccompanied by a prayer for
reinstatement.  As such they are, as the
law clearly says, within the "original and exclusive jurisdiction" of
Labor Arbiters.  In other words, whether
under the law at present in force, or that at the time of the filing of the
complaint, Jose Balde's cause falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction
of the Labor Arbiters and not of the Regional Trial Court (formerly, Court of
First Instance).</p>

<p class="BODY">To be sure, this jurisdictional defect in the proceedings has not
been explicitly put at issue in the appeal at bar, although references appear
in the pleadings to the various motions filed by Fernandez and his
co-defendants with the Regional Trial Court to dismiss the action for want of
jurisdiction over the nature of the suit instituted by Jose Balde.  This omission is of no moment.  Excepted from the general rule that in
appellate proceedings in the Court of Appeals or this Court, "no error **
will be considered unless stated in the assignment of errors and properly
argued in the brief" (or otherwise raised as an issue), are (1) errors
which "affect the jurisdiction over the subject matter," (2)
"plain errors," and (3) "clerical errors."<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a></p>
