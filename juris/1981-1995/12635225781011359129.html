				<h4>
				G.R. No. L-30256, July 16, 1984</h4>
				<H3>THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. AURELIO ONAROSA, DEFENDANT-APPELLANT. <br><br>A M E N D M E N T   O F <br><br>D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>RELOVA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">
Considering that accused-appellant Aurelio Onarosa died on January 26, 
1984 and the findings of facts and of accused-appellant's guilt by the 
defunct Court of First Instance of Samar were confirmed by this Court in
 its decision of February 29, 1984 (which could not produce any legal 
effect insofar as the accused-appellant's criminal liability is 
concerned by virtue of his prior death), the Court nevertheless resolved
 to exercise jurisdiction over the accused's civil liability (People vs.
 Sendaydiego, 81 SCRA 120) since it has been duly established beyond 
reasonable doubt that said accused-appellant "was the assailant and the 
one responsible for the death of Juan Balagasay" (Decision, page 11), 
and the victim's heirs not having reserved the right to file a separate 
civil action, it would be a superfluity to compel them at this late 
stage to still litigate or file another suit for indemnity for his 
death.
<p>
ACCORDINGLY, in the interest of justice and in fairness to the heirs of 
the deceased-victim, Juan Balagasay, the accused-appellant's estate is 
hereby sentenced to indemnify the heirs of Juan Balagasay in the sum of 
P30,000.00.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p> <em>Teehankee, (Chairman), Gutierrez, Jr., </em>and <em>De La Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
</p><p>
<em>Melencio-Herrera, J.</em>, on leave.
</p><p>
<em>Plana, J., </em>concurs.  It is utterly absurd to require a civil 
suit to prove by mere preponderance of evidence what, as here, has 
already been proved beyond reasonable doubt.
