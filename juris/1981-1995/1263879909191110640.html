<p class="BODY">Private respondent Confederation of Free Laborers (CFL) on behalf
of the twelve (12) individual complainants filed a complaint for illegal
dismissal and non-payment of their vacation and sick leave for 1983 against
petitioners FILCON and EDWARDSON and on <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="4">April
 10, 1984</st1:date>, Labor Arbiter Cornelio L. <span class="SpellE">Linsangan</span>
rendered a decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of which
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the NLRC, the case was remanded to the same labor
arbiter since the petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">were </span>denied
due process when their position paper was not considered in the resolution
thereof (Decision, p. 74, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon re-evaluation of the evidence, the labor arbiter gave
credence to the joint affidavit executed by the twelve (12) complainants
alleging that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the franchise of
EDWARDSON was sold to FILCON to evade liability for retirement benefits due
complainants who are at the <span class="SpellE">retirable</span> age; (2) after
the sale, complainants were made to chose between acceptance of 45% of total
separation pay and shall remain permanent or regular employees of FILCON or to
receive 100% separation pay and shall be considered resigned; (3) the 12
complainants chose the first option and in fact worked with FILCON since April,
1983 up to November 7, 1983 when their services were terminated; (4) the
complainants deny the contents of the Releases and Quitclaims signed by them as
they have not waived their rights to claim the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">balance of separation pay from the agreed 45% and for having signed the
same in blank and believing in good faith that petitioners would make good their
promise from which petitioners later </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">on </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">reneged (p. 75, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, petitioners' documents and the individual affidavits of
Ramon <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> and <span class="SpellE">Gasentin</span> Chan
representing FILCON and EDWARDSON, respectively, denying the sale of <span class="SpellE">EDWARDSON's</span> franchise to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">FILCON; liability to pay the twelve (12) complainants' separation pay,
vacation and sick leave pay inasmuch as the same have already been fully
satisfied as shown in the Releases and Quitclaims; and purported proposals made
upon the union members in order to become regular employees of FILCON were
merely discredited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The labor arbiter thus concluded:</p>

<blockquote>"We take pains in ascertaining the candidness and persistence
of complainants in pursuing this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We find complainants belonging to that breed of common folk whose
temerity to lie cannot in the least be traced (o<span class="GramE">)n</span>
their faces.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, they are
indicative of truth and sincerity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a

in the manufacture of shoes as <span class="SpellE">Filcon</span> is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">so </span>engaged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What is significant and decisive of the issue is the
certification of the Securities and Exchange Commission to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>‘To date, no papers/documents <span class="GramE">has</span> been submitted to this Office showing its dissolution or
cessation of business activity’, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(See

Manufacturing wants us to believe it has ceased operations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An allegation must be proved, not simply
averred.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is also evident that complainants have worked with
respondent <span class="SpellE">Filcon</span> Manufacturing Corporation up to <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1983</st1:date> when they were
terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"> established facts must be destroyed for respondents to escape
liability to complainants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence
of respondents does not satisfy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, there is no necessity to alter our earlier decision.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both appeal and petition for relief from judgment were dismissed
by the NLRC on <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1987</st1:date>
as the appeal was filed two (2) days late and rejecting illness of counsel as

<p class="BODY">Considering the allegations contained, the issues raised and the
arguments adduced in the petition for <i>certiorari</i>, as well as the
comments of the respondents thereon, and the reply, consolidated reply and

<blockquote>The case of the petitioners is quite meritorious and to disregard
the same would be tantamount to willfully closing our eyes in order to avoid

substantial justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, they pray

Jesus, et al. vs. <span class="SpellE">Edwardson</span> Manufacturing Corporation
and <span class="SpellE">Filcon</span> Manufacturing Corporation, et al.
promulgated by the NLRC on July 29, 1986 completely absolving petitioner FILCON

No. 72238 entitled "Virginia de Jesus, et al. vs. NLRC, et al." in
the resolution of May 12, 1986.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents maintain that the labor arbiter's decision of <st1:date year="1985" day="13" month="5">May 13, 1985</st1:date> could no longer be
annulled since the petitioners failed to perfect their appeal within the 10-day

counsel, petitioners’ appeal was filed on <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1985</st1:date> or two (2) days late.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the labor arbiter sought to be annulled has

10-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period within which to
appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is so as perfection of an
appeal in the manner and within the period prescribed by law is not only

<p class="BODY">Grave abuse of discretion implies such capricious and whimsical
exercise of judgment as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The abuse of discretion must be grave as
where the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of
passion or personal hostility and must be so patent and gross as to amount to
an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual refusal to perform the duty
enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law (Producers Bank of the
Philippines v. NLRC, 165 SCRA 281 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The National Labor Relations Commission did not commit grave
abuse of discretion in dismissing petitioners’ appeal which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">was </span>filed way

<p class="BODY">A judgment which has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>

trial court loses jurisdiction over the case except for execution of the final
judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any amendment or alteration
made which substantially affects the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
judgment is null and void for lack of jurisdiction, including the entire
proceedings held for that purpose (<span class="SpellE">Marcopper</span> Mining

<p class="BODY">The doctrine of finality of judgment is grounded on fundamental
considerations of public <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">policy </span>and
