barrio <span class="SpellE">Lanawan</span>, Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte, together with his wife, Miriam <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>, his nephew, <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>, his brother, <span class="SpellE">Misal</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>, and one <span class="SpellE">Madji</span> <span class="SpellE">Ansaw</span> to catch fish and gather river shells for their
supper in a nearby river with the use of a <span class="SpellE">petromax</span>
light. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, pp. 15-16, 22,
23, 25, <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="10">Oct. 26, 1972</st1:date>). After
gathering enough shells, they decided to return home around <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, p. 23, <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="10">Oct.

of his house leading to the kitchen followed behind by his nephew <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, pp. 16-18, 20, 23, <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="10">Oct. 26, 1972</st1:date>). As <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> was about to climb the third step of the stairs
with <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> still on the ground behind him, <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> saw accused <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paculba</span> sitting under the house be­low the kitchen floor
holding a long gun which was pointed at them. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, p. 18, <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="10">Oct.
 26, 1972</st1:date>). Suddenly, the accused fired a shot, hitting <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> at the base of the
neck and killing him, instantaneously. (Id). <span class="GramE">After</span> the
shooting, the accused and his unidentified companion ran away (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, p. 19, <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="10">Oct.

was also wounded on his right leg and tried to go after the assailant but could
not do so because of his injury. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>,

<span class="SpellE">Misal</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>, who was
still in the yard of the house about to take the front stairs lead­ing to the
porch, upon witnessing the shooting, immediately ran to the fallen <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> and held him with
his two hands and, together with his brother <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span>,
brought the victim <span class="GramE">upstairs.</span> (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, pp. 23-24, <st1:date year="1972" day="26" month="10">Oct. 26, 1972</st1:date>). Meanwhile, <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span>
<span class="SpellE">Lantao</span>, a municipal clerk of <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>
and a neighbor of the <span class="SpellE">Ringuits</span>, upon hearing a gun
report followed by screams coming from their house, repaired thereto. Upon
seeing <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>
wounded on the leg, <span class="SpellE">Lantao</span> requested the barrio captain
who was with him to report the matter to the local police authorities. Shortly
thereafter, the Municipal Mayor, the Chief of Police and several policemen and
PC soldiers, arrived at the scene of the crime. (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span>, pp. 31-32, <st1:date year="1972" day="19" month="12">Dec. 19, 1972</st1:date>). After conducting an on-the-spot investigation
of the incident, the peace officers proceeded to the house of the accused some
300 meters away from the house of the deceased and inquired from him if he
owned any firearm. The accused pointed to two home-made guns, one of which was
taken by the peace officers together with three bullets.

building of <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> where he was investigated by the
Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>. His statements given during

wound (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">A, p. 6, rec.).</span> A

<p class="BODY">The appellant's defense is an alibi. He denied that he committed
the offense complained of and assailed the trial court for convicting him of
the charge based upon the evidence of the prosecution which is weak,
insufficient, incompetent and inconclusive. His testimony is summarized by the
trial court, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1972" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1972</st1:date>,
he was the whole day plowing the land of his mother at <span class="SpellE">Lanawan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Salug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> <span class="GramE">del</span> Norte. After his work at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, he proceeded to the house
of his father-in-law at <span class="SpellE">Liguac</span>, <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>,
where he and his family transferred sometime ago, arriving thereat at <st1:time minute="0" hour="19">7:00 o'clock</st1:time> that evening. He took his supper
alone because his wife ate ahead of him. At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00
 o'clock</st1:time> the same evening, he heard two gun reports at an interval
of 30 minutes coming from the direction of the house of the <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>
family. He did not mind what he heard. At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00
 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, he was
awakened by the arrival of a PC soldier and some <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>
policemen who inquired from him whether he has a pistol. He admitted that he
owns two homemade shotguns (<span class="SpellE"><i>pali-untod</i></span><i>)</i>,
one of which was owned by his brother-in-law, which they purchased from a
certain <span class="SpellE">subano</span> for the purpose of self-protection. The
two homemade <span class="GramE">shotgun</span> were taken by the peace officers
and the accused was forthwith arrested and brought to the municipal building of
<span class="SpellE">Salug</span>, <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte.
Upon his inquiry, he was told that he was a suspect of having shot <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>. He was
investigated by the Chief of Police of <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>. The
investigation was re­duced to writing and signed by him. <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">"G", <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No.</span> <span class="GramE">S-122).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant presented his wife, Regina <span class="SpellE">Banglus</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Anatolio</span> Ortiz and his mother <span class="SpellE">Anastacia</span>
<span class="SpellE">Paculba</span> to corroborate his testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Corroborating his theory, his wife, Regina <span class="SpellE">Banglus</span>, testified that her husband (<span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>),
who was out the whole day of July 12, 1972, arrived from the farm at about 7:00
o'clock in the evening. After taking his supper alone, they slept together and
he (<span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>) never left the house that evening. At
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">12:00 o'clock</st1:time> <st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, the policemen arrived and arrested her
husband who was brought to the municipal building of <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>.
Upon her inquiry from the policemen why her husband was being arrested, she was
informed that her husband was the one who shot the <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">muslims</span></span>. She could not believe that <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> did it because he was with her in the house of
her father at <span class="SpellE">Liguac</span>, some 300 meters away from the
scene of the crime. She, however, admitted having heard two (2) gun reports
that evening.</blockquote>

his defense, the accused presented <span class="SpellE">Anatalio</span> Ortiz who

he heard two (2) gun reports coming from the direction of the house of the <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> family. The two gun reports had an interval of 30
minutes. He personally knows that the accused and the deceased never had any
misunderstanding prior to the incident. Their relationship was harmonious.</blockquote>

she heard two (2) gun reports at an interval of 30 minutes each coming from the
direction of the house of the <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> family. The
following morning, when she went to the municipal building of <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> to pay her taxes, she was informed that her son was
in jail. She corroborated the story of her son."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in the appeal. The question raised by the
appellant involves the credibility of witnesses and it is a settled rule that
when the question raised refers to the credibility of witnesses, this Court
will not disturb the findings of the lower court unless there is a clear proof
of <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span> of evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

Such is not the case at bar. The inconsistencies in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> and <span class="SpellE">Misal</span>, witnesses for
the prosecution, pointed out by the appellant in his brief refer to minor
details and do not affect their credibility.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
On the other hand, such inconsistencies are badges of truth for only the
testimony of rehearsed witnesses will tally on every point. Also, the
inconsistencies in the affidavit of <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> and his
testimony in open court do not render his testimony incredible. It has been
ruled that affidavits as species of evidence usually suffer from infirmities,
as shown by judicial experience.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense of alibi cannot be given full faith and credit since
the appellant had been positively identified<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as the one who fired the shot that killed the deceased <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> and wounded <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>. The prosecution witnesses could not have
been mistaken in their identity as the place was illuminated by the <span class="SpellE">petromax</span> lamp carried by <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> and the appellant was well known to them. Besides,
for an alibi to prosper, it is not enough to prove that the appellant was
somewhere else when the crime was committed, but he must, likewise, <span class="GramE">demonstrate</span> that it was physically impossible for him to
have been at the scene of the crime at the time it was committed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, the appellant was allegedly in the house of his
father-in-law at the time the crime was committed. The said house, however, is
only 300 meters away from the house of the deceased so that it was not
physically impossible for the appellant to be at the scene of the crime when it
was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the appellant had not shown any reason why the
witnesses for the prosecution would testify against him and implicate him in
the commission of a grave felony unless the appellant is really guilty thereof.
Witnesses for both the prosecution and the defense testified that there was
never any misunderstanding between the victims and the appellant and their
relationship was harmonious.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Furthermore, the act of appellant in filing an
application for amnesty under P.D.</span> No 206 with the Fifth Amnesty
Commission constitutes an implied admission of guilt. This Court has ruled that
amnesty presupposes the commission of a crime, and when an accused maintains
that he has not committed a crime, he cannot have any use for amnesty. The
invocation of amnesty is in the nature of a plea of confession which means that
the pleader admits the allegations against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed is qualified by treachery, in that appellant
armed with a shotgun suddenly fired a shot at his unarmed victims at close range
as the victims were just about to ascend the stair, taking the victims by
surprise and leaving them with no means to defend themselves.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Evident premeditation, however, cannot be appre­ciated because of
the absence of proof that the appellant had planned the killing of the deceased
and had coolly reflected upon its commission. For evident premeditation to be
appreciated, it must be shown that the accused premeditated the killing; that
he clung to his premeditated act; and that there was sufficient interval of
time between the premeditation and the execution of the crime to allow him to
reflect upon the consequences of his act.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The single shot from a shotgun that appellant aimed at the
victims resulted in the death of <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> and the infliction of mortal wounds on <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> which would have
caused his death were it not for timely medical assistance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The crime committed is a complex crime of Murder with Frustrated
Murder since the death of <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>
and the wounding of <span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>
arose out of the single act of the appellant in firing a shot.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Consequently, only one penalty should be imposed upon the accused. The
indeterminate penalty of four (4) years, two (2) months and one (1) day of <span class="SpellE"><i>prision</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">correccional</span>, </i>as
minimum, to twelve (12) years, five (5) months and eleven (11) days of <i>reclusion
temporal, </i>as maximum, imposed upon the accused for the frustrated murder of
<span class="SpellE">Taricon</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span> (<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. S-123) should be, accordingly, eliminated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Under Art.</span> 48 of the Revised Penal Code,
the penalty to be imposed upon the accused in a complex crime shall be that for
the most serious crime, which is Murder in this case, the same to be applied in
its maximum period or Death. However, for lack of the necessary votes, the
penalty of <i>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i> is hereby
imposed upon the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment appealed from should be, as it is
hereby MODIFIED, and the accused <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span> <span class="SpellE">Paculba</span> is hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of <i>reclusion
<span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></i>, to indemnify the heirs of the <span class="SpellE">decased</span>, <span class="SpellE">Madjid</span> <span class="SpellE">Ringuit</span>, in the sum of P12,000.00, without subsidiary
imprisonment in case of insolvency, and to pay the costs.</p>
