Philippine Constabulary Non-Commissioned Officer with the Narcotics Command,
and that of Sgt. Serrano, a Philippine Marine also connected with the Regional
Unit of the Narcotics Command, may be summarized in the following terms:</p>

found the accused together with one Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Serrano, having been assigned to act as <span class="GramE">poseur-buyer,</span> and the informer proceeded to negotiate with
the accused for the sale of marijuana, while <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Palmero</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lachica</span> positioned
themselves some ten (10) to fifteen (15) meters away from the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused and his companion Jimmy left the
scene and returned some twenty (20) minutes later with the marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>
handed over to Sgt. Serrano about twenty-five (25) grams of marijuana worth
about </span>P50.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At that particular moment, Sgt. Serrano
revealed himself to the accused and <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> as an
agent of the Narcotics Command.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
other members of the team then closed in on the group and arrested the accused
and Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon prodding of the team members to reveal his supplier of marijuana, <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> accompanied the team to his house in </span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Topacio</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> St.</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> where the team found and confiscated an

<p class="BODY">Teresa Ann <span class="SpellE">Bugayong</span> Cid, Forensic
Chemist of the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>Philippine
Constabulary-INP Crime Laboratory, testified that she had examined the contents
of a package (Exhibit "F") seized from the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She stated that said contents consisted of
marijuana and submitted a Chemistry Report (Exhibit "G") and
Certification of Laboratory Result No. D-480-85 (Exhibit "G-1"),
setting forth the results of her laboratory examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused had, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>may
be expected, a different version of the events of <st1:date year="1985" day="24" month="5">24 May 1985</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his
testimony, the accused said that between 1:00 and 2:00 p.m. on that day, he was
waiting for a ride at the corner of Esmeralda and <span class="SpellE">Zobel</span>
Sts. when, all of a sudden, two (2) men whom he did not previously know and who
identified themselves as "persons in authority" approached him and
"frisked him," searching him bodily for a firearm.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failing to find one but still insisting that
he possessed a firearm, the police officers, according to the accused, brought
him to the house of Capt. <span class="SpellE">Paile</span> where the latter
threatened to file charges against him if he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">did </span>not produce his gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused denied that he had been caught selling marijuana leaves and
that he knew or was a friend of Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stated that he did not see Jimmy sell
marijuana to the police officers; and that the police had insisted that he
(accused) had a firearm which he did not.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused impugned the credibility of the prosecution eye
witnesses, <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. Serrano and <span class="SpellE">Palmero</span>,
as doubtful and questionable because of alleged discrepancies in the
testimonies of the two (2) police officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused claimed that Sgt. Serrano testified, on the one hand, that
the accused and <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> were brought to the
Narcotics Command Detachment Office after their arrest, while, upon the other
hand, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Palmero</span> had testified that <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> and the accused had been first brought to <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno's</span> house before they were taken to the Detachment
Office after their arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
discrepancy in the testimony of the two (2) police officers is, however, more
apparent than real.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. Serrano did
testify that he and the other Narcotics Command agents involved had brought the
accused and <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> to their Detachment Office
after their arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His testimony did not,
however, end there for he also testified that he and his companions had gone to
the house of <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> right after the accused and <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> had been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">arrested:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

these two to point to the rest of the marijuana and this Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> accompanied us to his house in <span class="SpellE">Topacio</span>, and told him that in order that others will not be
using the same to bring out the rest, so he brought out some marijuana.</blockquote>

Sanchez, where was he?</blockquote>

Jimmy <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span>."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

the above testimony and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>of
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Palmero</span> which read thus:</p>

<blockquote>Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>What did you do after that when you were able to
arrest accused Sanchez and this alias 'Jimmy'?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We were accompanied by this alias 'Jimmy' to
his house and there we were able to get some marijuana.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">As is so common in criminal cases of this kind, there is here a
direct conflict between the positive testimony of the arresting officers, <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Palmero</span> and Serrano, and
the testimony of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court which had the opportunity to observe the detailed demeanor of the
prosecution witnesses and of the accused on the witness stand, and to listen to
their respective testimonies, gave more credence to the statements of the
arresting officers, <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Palmero</span>
and Serrano.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court pointed out
that these government agents had no known motive or reason falsely to impute a
serious and unfounded charge against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused had been a complete stranger to
the police officers until they encountered him in the course of performance of
their duties as members of the Narcotics Command.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

The testimony of the two (2) police agents carries with it the presumption of
the regularity of the performance of official functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The resulting applicable principle has been
stated in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">People v. <span class="SpellE">Patog</span></span></u><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>Where there is no evidence and nothing to indicate the principal
witness for the prosecution was [moved] by improper motives the presumption is
that he was not so [moved] and his testimony is entitled to full faith and
credit."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The trial court found the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Palmero</span> and Serrano had not
been shaken on cross-examination; that the details of such testimony while
"unsophisticated" were "logical" and "very
plausible." We have carefully examined the records of this case and have
found no substantial basis for overturning and disregarding the conclusions
reached by the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused pleaded, alternatively, the defense of inducement or
instigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The distinction between
inducement on one hand and entrapment on the <span class="GramE">other,</span> is
of course critical in the instant case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused was, however, totally unable to show that the arresting team
had in fact induced him to commit a crime that he would not otherwise have
committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The record shows that the
accused and <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> had a ready supply of marijuana
for sale and disposition to anyone willing to pay the price asked for the
prohibited material.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it appears
that the crime of illegal possession of prohibited drugs had already been
committed by the accused and <span class="SpellE">Mirabueno</span> when the
Narcotics Command agents resolved to entrap them into revealing such possession
and selling the prohibited drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
acts of the arresting officers in the instant case constituted entrapment, a
process or operation sanctioned by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Revised
Penal Code.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The accused also objected to the failure of the prosecution to
submit in evidence the money utilized in the entrapment operation, and to
present as a witness or even to identify the police informer whose report had
triggered off the entrapment operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused also <span class="GramE">complained</span> that it was
"contrary to human experience"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
that a seller of prohibited drugs would agree to sell marijuana to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>person unknown <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span>the seller, and that the
prosecution had not identified the person responsible for negotiation of the
sale of the prohibited drugs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
presentation in evidence of the "buy-bust" money is not indispensable
for conviction of the accused since the sale of marijuana had been adequately
proven by the independent testimony of the two (2) police officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the testimony of the police informer
was similarly not essential for conviction of the accused, his identity may
remain confidential:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>there are strong
practical reasons for such continued secrecy, including the continued health
and safety of the informer and the encouragement of others to report wrong
doing to the police authorities. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> theory that it is "contrary to human
experience" that a drug "pusher" would sell drugs to a total
stranger is not<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>persuasive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In real life, "pushers", especially
small-quantity or retail <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"pushers",
sell their prohibited wares to customers, be they strangers or not, who have
the price of the drug and </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
