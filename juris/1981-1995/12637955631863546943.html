<p class="BODY">This is <span>a </span>petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by 
<span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> J. <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and 
Jose Angelo <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span>, former employees who were 
dismissed by their employer, herein private respondent Hi Marketing Corporation 
(HIMARK), seeking to set aside the decision dated December 10, 1984, promulgated 
by respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) which reversed the 
appealed decision of Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> R. 
Valenzuela, dated April 29, 1983, in this labor case (NLRC-NCR Case No. 
9-5828-82), thus sanctioning as lawful and valid respondent <span class="SpellE">HIMARK's</span> act of terminating the employment of its two 
employees, herein petitioners, and dismissing the latter's complaints for 
illegal dismissal, but ordering "private respondent Corporation to pay <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span>J. </span><span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> 
his unpaid commission of P3,132.00 and Jose Angelo <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> his separation pay."</p>
<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are briefly as follows:</p>
<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span> <span>J. </span><span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and Jose Angelo <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> started as salesmen of respondent company 
<span>HIMARK, </span>a domestic corporation, engaged, among other things, in the 
promotion and sale of HOTSY, a hot water high pressure washer.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Because of their good performance, <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> 
was given a <span>raise in </span>pay while <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> 
was promoted to sales supervisor in the machinery department (Annex "A", 
Petition).<span>&nbsp; </span>As salesman, <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> 
continued to promote and sell the said HOTSY, collect payments from customers, 
and turn <span class="GramE">over</span> said collections to HIMARK.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> supervised salesmen 
under him, among them <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span>, who reported to him 
in connection with his duties and performance as salesman.</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="7">July 22, 
1982</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> presented his claim for 
payment of unpaid third party commissions in the total amount of Two Thousand 
Four Hundred Pesos (P2<span class="GramE">,400.00</span>).<span>&nbsp; </span>One of 
the private respondents, Terre, as manager, recommended the approval of the 
claim, and the other private respondent, <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, as 
president, approved said claim.<span>&nbsp; </span>The next day, however, Terre 
issued a memorandum to <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span>, instructing <span class="SpellE">hin</span> to remind salesmen or representatives to secure prior 
clearance from him (Terre) regarding third party commissions or <span class="SpellE">TPCs</span> and not to quote prices below the company's selling 
price, (Annex "L", Petition).</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="8">August 13, 
1982</st1:date>, without preamble or cause, Terre required petitioners to submit 
their resignations, allegedly upon orders of "top level 
management.<span>"</span> He gave no reason for the order but instructed 
petitioners to see President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span> and to refrain from 
continuing whatever transactions they may have entered into with the customers 
in the field, pending <span>completion </span>of the audit in the machinery 
department (Annex "B", Petition).<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners followed his 
<span>instructions and </span>they wrote the president requesting for an 
appointment with <span>him on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="8">August 16, <span>1982</span></st1:date><span>.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The next day, or on <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="8">August <span>14, 1982</span></st1:date><span>, </span><span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> collected the sum of Six Thousand Pesos (P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>) from Radian International, Inc., which earlier 
purchased on credit two units of HOTSY.<span>&nbsp; </span>That date being a 
Saturday, during which the office of HIMARK was already closed in the afternoon, 
<span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> deposited the collected amount with the 
Family Savings Bank, intending to remit the same to HIMARK on the next working 
day, August 16, <span>1982.<span>&nbsp; </span></span>(Annex "A", Petition) On 
<st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="8">August 16, 1982</st1:date>, however, 
<span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> failed to withdraw the amount of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> from the bank due to their appointment with President 
<span class="SpellE">Puey</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Only <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span>, however, was allowed to see the company 
President.<span>&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> told <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> that their status <span>was 
</span><span>"frozen", pending </span><span>an </span><span>investigation which 
would be conducted by President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Fuentebella</span></span><span> </span><span>submitted a 
written claim to President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, including therein his 
P6,000.00 collection as among the sales he had made for which he was claiming 
unpaid commissions in the total amount of Twelve Thousand Eight Hundred Pesos 
(P12,800.00).<span>&nbsp; </span>(Annex "E", Petition).<span>&nbsp; </span>Then, he 
informed Terre of his (<span class="SpellE">Fuentebellaâ€™s</span>) intention to 
retain the collection of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in the bank until 
his status is cleared and his unpaid commissions are 
settled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On August <span>24, 1982, </span>the company Comptroller, Antonio 
R. Reyes required them to surrender the provisional receipts booklets issued to 
them (Annex "E", Petition) but because in his four (4) years of service, this 
was the first time that this happened, <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> wrote 
said Comptroller to inquire whether this was in connection with Terre's 
instructions, and if so, he would trace said provisional receipts and make the 
necessary report, if it would still be required (Annex "G", Petition) No further 
request, however, was made for the return of the said booklets, nor was there 
any demand for the remittance of the collection withheld by <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>(p. 29, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="8">August 25, 
1982</st1:date>, petitioners wrote President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, 
inquiring about the result of the investigation.<span>&nbsp; </span>Petitioners 
<span>also asked for personal confrontation to enable them to air t</span>heir 
grievances against Terre.<span>&nbsp; </span>Terre and Comptroller Reyes were 
furnished copies of the said letter (copy of which was attached as Annex "H-1", 
Petition) but neither of them replied thereto.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead, 
Comptroller Reyes sent a note to each of the petitioners, for them to have a 
conference with him (Annexes "H-2"-and "H-3", Petition)</p>
<p class="BODY">On August <span>31, 1982, </span><span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> met with 
Comptroller Reyes, who offered them the company's proposition "of one month 
salary for every year of service, plus accrued or unpaid commissions on sales 
made by them to date, in exchange for their respective resignations and return 
of P6<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> collected by <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and not turned over to the company together with 
the provisional receipts booklets issued to them." Petitioners, however, 
declined to accept the offer and instead insisted on an investigation of the 
matter.<span>&nbsp; </span>They also requested to be allowed to discuss the same with 
President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">copy</span> of Reyes' Affidavit, attached as Annex "J", 
Petition)</p>
<p class="BODY">Despite the help of Reyes in trying to arrange for a meeting 
between the petitioners and President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> received 
their letters of termination of service dated <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1982</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1982</st1:date>, respect<span>ively.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>(Annexes </span>"I" and "I-1", Petition)</p>
<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="9">September <span>4, 
</span>1982</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> wrote Terre, 
questioning his <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="8">August 31, 
1982</st1:date> letter of termination. (Annex "L-2", Petition) While President 
<span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, Reyes and the company's counsels, <span class="SpellE">Dy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Tagalo</span>, were furnished 
copies thereof, none of them replied to the said letter.</p>
<p class="BODY">On September <span>7, </span>1982, petitioners filed NLRC NCR Case 
No. 9-5828-82 for illegal dismissal, unpaid wages, commissions and damages, 
alleging that they were dismissed from employment without being heard or 
informed beforehand of the cause or reason for their dismissal; that Terre's 
motive in requiring them to resign was due to <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella's</span> refusal to share with Terre his (<span class="SpellE">Fuentebella's</span>) third party commissions or <span class="SpellE">TPC's</span>; and that since <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> 
was using <span class="SpellE">Llaneza's</span> provisional receipts booklet, 
Terre concluded that <span class="SpellE"><span>Fuentebella</span></span><span> 
was sharing instead his <span class="SpellE">TPCs</span> with <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>(p. 126, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">Respondents, on the other hand, denied the illegal dismissal 
charge, and claimed that <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> were discharged from their employment due to 
dishonesty, <span>fraud and breach of trust reposed upon them by their 
employer.<span>&nbsp; </span>They pointed out:<span>&nbsp; </span>that <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella's</span> act of <span class="SpellE">misaappropriating</span> for himself his collection of P6,000.00 by 
depositing said amount to his own savings account and his refusal to remit the 
same to HIMARK, despite several demands, as well as <span class="SpellE">Llaneza's</span> defiance of a lawful order of his superior to 
surrender his provisional receipts booklet, are acts clearly 
</span><span>inimical </span><span>to the interest of HIMARK; that as a result 
of <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella's</span> dishonesty, a complaint for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> was filed against him; and that <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> is entitled only to P3,152.00 his salesman's 
commission, but not to <span class="SpellE">TPCs</span>, which are payable only to 
non-employees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">On April 29, 1983, the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision, finding 
petitioners' termination illegal, and ordered respondents to reinstate them with 
full <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and accrued benefits, and to pay <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> his commission in the amount of P12,800.00 but 
deducting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> the P6,000.00 collection which 
<span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> purposely withheld.<span>&nbsp; </span>(Labor 
Arbiter's Decision, p. 35, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Respondents appealed to the National Labor Relations 
Commission (NLRC).<span>&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="12"><span>December 10, 1984</span></st1:date><span>, the NLRC reversed 
the appealed decision, and ordered respondents to pay <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella's</span> commission amounting to P3<span class="GramE">,152.00</span>, and to pay <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> his 
separation pay.<span>&nbsp; </span>(NLRC Decision, p. 47, <span class="SpellE"><em>Rollo</em></span>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>Petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration, but same was 
denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In </span><span>this petition, the principal issue raised is 
whether or not the NLRC </span><span>gravely </span><span>abused its discretion 
in setting aside the labor arbiter's decision.</span></p>
<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>
<p class="BODY">As may be gleaned from the narration of facts above, from August 
13, 1982, the day Terre gave petitioners the verbal instruction to submit their 
resignations, up to August 31, 1982 and September 1, 1982, when <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> and <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> 
respectively received their walking papers, Terre and Reyes merely gave both 
petitioners the runaround, and never afforded petitioners the opportunity to 
know the charges against them, and to be heard in their defense.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Even President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, after promising <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> on August 16, 1982, that he would investigate the 
matter of Terre's verbal resignation instruction within 24 to 48 hours, never 
conducted <span>a </span>formal investigation of the charges, if any, against 
the petitioner.<span>&nbsp; </span>The close dates of the issuance of the termination 
letters and the actuations of Terre and President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span>, demonstrate that the management of HIMARK was already 
dead set on dismissing the petitioners, without according them their right to 
due process.</p>
<p class="BODY">As correctly found by the labor arbiter, the proximate cause of 
petitioners' dismissal was the matter of sharing the <span class="SpellE">TPCs</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The evidence clearly shows that when 
Terre became the general manager of the administrative and machinery department 
of the company in January, 1982, with both <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> 
and <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> under his direct super<span>vision, 
</span>he wanted <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> to share with him (Terre) 
the additional income he (<span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span>) was earning in 
big amounts by <span>way </span>of third party commissions (<span class="SpellE">TPCs</span>) from the sales the latter <span>was 
</span>making.<span>&nbsp; </span>That this is so is bolstered by <span class="SpellE">Fuentebellalâ€™s</span> <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> 
explanation that:</p>
<blockquote>"xxx before there was no more need to seek clearance from the 
manager regarding TPC and the net price of the units but Mr. Terre issued a 
memorandum on July 23, 1982 compelling us to secure clearance from him regarding 
TPC and the selling of the unit below the net price <em>to make sure that he 
gets a </em>share from the TPC, because Your Honor, <span>we do not account for 
the TPC that was given to us in full." (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> p. 21, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="2"><span>February 18, 
1983</span></st1:date><span>)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span>Fuentebella</span></span><span> further explained that Terre 
asked him to give him (Terre) also one-half (Â½) share of the TPC, for Terre 
<span>believed </span>it was too big an amount for him and also for allowing 
them to sell below the net price.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> pp. 22-23, 
<em>supra</em>) There being no misdemeanors or infractions shown to have been 
committed by petitioners between January, 1982, when Terre became their manager, 
and August 13, 1982, when Terre told them to submit their resignations, We are 
convinced that their refusal to comply with Terre's demand was the reason for 
asking them to resign.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">While Terre contends that <span class="SpellE">TPCs</span> are given 
only to non-employees, therefore, it would be illogical for him to demand a 
share of the same from the <span class="GramE">petitioners,</span> such 
con<span>tention is </span>belied by <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella's</span> 
claim for his commission on <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="7">July 22, 
1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "E", Petition) which Terre 
himself recommended for approval, and which Nicolas O. <span class="SpellE">Katigbak</span>, the then Company's Officer-In-Charge, approved for 
payment, despite the fact that the bulk of said commission was comprised of 
<span class="SpellE">TPCs</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>The same holds true with respect 
to the claim on <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1982</st1:date> 
of <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span> for his commission (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "E-1", Petition) consisting solely of <span class="SpellE">TPCs</span> and so with another claim of <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> on <st1:date year="1982" day="13" month="5">May 
13, 1982</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "E-5") where out of P1<span class="GramE">,400.00</span> commission, P500.00 was for TPC.</p>
<p class="BODY"><span>With this finding that <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> 
is entitled to his unpaid commissions in the total amount of P12<span class="GramE">,800.00</span> (which is more than double the amount of the 
P6,000.00 collection withheld by <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> after he 
learned that <span>his position was </span>floating), We are inclined to believe 
that <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> acted for self-protection, and the 
filing of a criminal case against him was for leverage purposes.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Moreover, when <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> submitted a formal 
written demand to President <span class="SpellE">Puey</span> on </span><st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="8"><span>August 16, 1982</span></st1:date><span>, 
for payment of accrued </span><span>commissions, </span>he reported the 6,000.00 
collection.<span>&nbsp; </span>Management did not make any demand, verbal or written, 
for <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> to remit the said collection.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The first and only time such a demand <span>was </span>made was on 
<st1:date year="1982" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1982</st1:date>, when <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span> received his termination letter, dated <st1:date year="1982" day="31" month="8">August 31, 1982</st1:date>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Until a 
demand is made <span>by HIMARK, and a </span>refusal thereto is made by <span class="SpellE">Fuentebella</span>, the withholding of said amount cannot legally 
be considered to have ripened into a f<span>elony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Llaneza</span>, despite 
his letter-query to Reyes regarding the latter's directive to surrender the said 
<span>provisional </span>receipts booklets, no further request was made for the 
</span><span>return </span><span>of said booklets.<span>&nbsp; </span>He cannot, 
therefore, be </span><span>held liable for 
</span><span>insubordination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>PREMISES CONSIDERED,</span></b><span> the decision of the
