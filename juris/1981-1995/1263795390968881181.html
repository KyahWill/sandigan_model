in CA-G.R. No. 04741-SP, "<span class="SpellE">Venustiano</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, et al. vs. Hon. Nelly L. Romero <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span>,
et al." ordering the dismissal of Civil Case No. 4454-M; and the March 17,
1977 Resolution of the same Court denying petitioner's motion for
reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case, as can be gathered from the Decision of
the Court of Appeals, are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Eufracia</span> Mendoza had
been a classroom teacher in the Holy Angels' Academy, a general secondary
school in <span class="SpellE">Pandi</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
since its establishment in 1951 until the end of school year 1971-72, when she
was appointed principal of the academy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the start of school year 1973-74, she received a letter dated <st1:date year="1973" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1973</st1:date> from one of the private
respondents herein, <span class="SpellE">Venustiano</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
informing her that the Board of Trustees of the school, composed of the herein
private respondents, passed and approved three (3) resolutions on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first resolution demanded that petitioner
tender her resignation as principal of the school not later than <st1:date year="1973" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1973</st1:date>; the second considered
her automatically terminated as principal on <st1:date year="1973" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1973</st1:date>, should she refuse to resign; and the third
designated one Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Raquepo</span> as teacher-in-charge
to take over the position of petitioner beginning <st1:date year="1973" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Unable to perform her duties as principal because her office was
ordered padlocked by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Venustiano</span> S.
<span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="6">June 17, 1973</st1:date> an administrative complaint (Adm.
Case No. D-2365, <span class="SpellE">Eufracia</span> S. Mendoza vs. <span class="SpellE">Venustiano</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, et al.) with
the Bureau of Private Schools questioning her dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the parties had presented their sides, the Director of
Private Schools rendered a decision dated <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="9">September 3, 1973</st1:date>, declaring that private respondents had
no authority to act for and in behalf of the Board of Trustees, not being
members of the Board, and ordered the reinstatement of petitioner to her
position as principal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondents appealed to the Secretary of Education and Culture, who, on <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="3">March 5, 1974</st1:date>, affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the decision of the Director of Private
Schools.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1974</st1:date>,
private respondents elevated the matter to the Office of the President of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the appeal was pending resolution in the Office of the
President, on <st1:date year="1974" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a complaint for damages and injunction against private
respondents and Alfonso <span class="SpellE">Raquepo</span> with the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Branch I, presided by
Judge Nelly Romero <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was docketed as Civil Case No.
4454-M.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="4">April 5, 1974</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span> issued a temporary restraining order
which enjoined the private respondents from performing and discharging the acts
complained of and set the hearing on the application for preliminary injunction
on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1974</st1:date>,
private respondents filed a Motion to Dismiss the complaint upon the grounds
that (1) the complaint states no cause of action; (2) the appeal with the
Office of the President in Administrative Case No. D-2365 which involved the
same issues and parties had not been resolved; and (3) the filing of the
complaint was premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1974</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span> issued an order holding in abeyance
resolution of the motion to dismiss and at the same time required private
respondents to show in writing within five (5) days that the remedy of appeal
to the Office of the President in the administrative case was specifically
provided for by law.</p>

<p class="BODY">A Motion for Reconsideration of the order holding in abeyance
resolution on the motion to dismiss was filed by the private respondents on <st1:date year="1974" day="18" month="5">May 18, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="24" month="5">May 24, 1974</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span> granted the prayer of petitioner for
a writ of preliminary injunction, and upon filing a bond for P1,000.00,
petitioner re-assumed office as principal on <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents sued for <i>certiorari</i> with public
respondent Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. No. 03082-R, <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>,
et al. vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span>, et al.) questioning the
validity of the issuance of the preliminary injunction by Judge <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span> but the case was dismissed on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1974</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="12">December 17, 1974</st1:date>,
the Office of the President rendered a decision sustaining private respondents'
appeal and reversing the verdict of the Department of Education and
Culture.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion to reconsider was
denied on <st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 8, 1975, petitioner filed with the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
with preliminary injunction (Civil Case No.<b> </b>4644-M) seeking to set aside
and declare of no force and effect the December 17, 1974 Decision of the Office
of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was assigned to
Branch II of the said Court of First Instance.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1975</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span> resolved private respondents' motion
to dismiss filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="15" month="4">April 15, 1975</st1:date>,
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering that the first cause of action contests the
legality of the dismissal of the plaintiff from her position in the Holy
Angels' Academy, and that it was done with evident bad faith, this court
believes there are still issues <span class="SpellE">triable</span> and pending
resolution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, for the reason stated
in the order dated <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="5">May 8, 1974</st1:date>
denying the initial motion to dismiss, the second motion to dismiss is hereby
likewise denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="24" month="10">October 24, 1975</st1:date>,
private respondents filed with respondent Court of Appeals a petition for <i>mandamus</i>
and prohibition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same was docketed
therein as CA-G.R. No. 04741-SP.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Court of Appeals, in a Decision promulgated on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">D</span>ecember 9, 1976, ordered the
dismissal of Civil Case No. 4454-M.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for a reconsideration, but the same was denied
in a Resolution promulgated on <st1:date year="1977" day="17" month="3">March

OF ACTION IN THE DAMAGE SUIT IN CIVIL CASE NO. 4454-M IS BASED ON THE DECISION
OF THE SECRETARY OF EDUCATION AND CULTURE AND, DESPITE THE CLEAR ALLEGATION IN
THE COMPLAINT THAT HER CAUSE OF ACTIONS PREDICATED ON THE ARBITRARY AND ILLEGAL
REMOVAL MADE BY THE PRIVATE RESPONDENTS.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue in this case is whether or not the decision of the
Office of the President in Administrative Case No. D-2365 reversing the
decision of the Secretary of Education and Culture is a valid ground for the
dismissal of an action for damages (Civil Case No. 4454-M) filed by the
petitioner against herein respondents in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents argued that inasmuch as the Court of Appeals
found as a fact that petitioner's action for damages (Civil Case No. 4454-M)
was "primarily anchored on the decisions of the Director of Private
Schools and the Secretary of Education and Culture which have been reversed and
supplanted by that of the Office of the President"; and, as it is well
settled that the jurisdiction of this Court in cases brought to it from the
Court of Appeals is limited to reviewing and revising the errors of law imputed
to the latter, as its finding of fact is conclusive, petitioner cannot assail
in the instant case the finding of the Court of Appeals as to the factual basis
for bringing the action for damages (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
75-76).</p>

<p class="BODY">While it is an established principle that the factual findings of
the Court of Appeals are final and may not be reviewed on appeal to this Court,
there are, however, certain exceptions to the rule which this Court has
recognized and accepted, among which are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>when the judgment is based on a misapprehension of facts and when the
findings of the Appellate Court are contrary to those of the trial court (<span class="SpellE">Manlapaz</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 147 SCRA 238 [1987]; <span class="SpellE">Sacay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, 142 SCRA
609 [1986]; <span class="SpellE">Guita</span> vs. C.A., 139 SCRA 576
[1985]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was held that where findings
of Court of Appeals and trial court are contrary to each other, the Supreme
Court may scrutinize the evidence on record (Cruz vs. C. A., 129 SCRA 222
[1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the Court of Appeals ordering the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> to dismiss herein petitioner's
complaint for damages and injunction is based on the finding and conclusion of
the Office of the President that private respondents can validly terminate
petitioner's contract of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent portion of the decision of the Court of Appeals reads:</p>

<blockquote>"The decision of the Secretary of Education and Culture,
affirming that of the Director of Private Schools which declared that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venustiano</span> <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span>, et al. did not
possess any legal authority to dismiss respondent, was reversed by the Office
of the President because the 'acts of administration by the appellants
(petitioners herein), in their capacity as members of the Board may, in the
absence of the necessary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">certificate </span>of
the Securities and Exchange Commission allowing the conversion, be considered
as valid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Perforce, the termination of
the <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> contract is valid."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted, however, that petitioner, in her complaint for
damages and injunction (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 131) alleges two
causes of action, namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>1) that private
respondents are not members of the Board of Trustees of the Holy Angels'
Academy as shown by the certification of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and as such have no valid and legal authority to terminate the services of the
complainant as principal in said school; and (2) that petitioner was summarily
dismissed from her employment without being informed of the charges against her
and without investigation and hearing at which she could have a chance to be
heard nor any prior clearance and approval of the National Labor Commission.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such causes of action were clearly stated in the complaint and it
is readily apparent that the Office of the President did not pass upon the
issue of lack of due process in the termination of petitioner's employment but
only on the authority of the private respondents to act as members of the Board
of Trustees even without the certification of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While said Board may have
the authority to terminate the employment of petitioner, the dismissal may
still be arbitrary and illegal and, therefore, deserving of payment of damages
under the second cause of action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
it has already been settled by this Court that a trial judge cannot dismiss a
complaint which contains two causes of action where one of them clearly states
a sufficient cause of action against the defendant (Mendoza vs. Bautista, 121
SCRA 760 [1983]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In fact, it is for this reason that in denying both motions to
dismiss filed by private respondents, the trial court considered two causes of
action:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the illegality of the dismissal
and evident bad faith in the execution thereof and expressed the belief that
there are still issues <span class="SpellE">triable</span> and pending resolution
(Order dated May 8, 1974; Order dated June 30, 1975; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">44</span>-<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">46).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is axiomatic that the conclusions of fact of a trial judge are
entitled to great weight (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span>, 128
SCRA 22 [1984]) and should not be disturbed on appeal unless for strong and
cogent reasons because the trial court is in a better position to examine real
evidence, as well as to observe the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying
in the case (Chase v. <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>, Sr., 136 SCRA 365
[1985]; People v. Pimentel, 147 SCRA 25 [1987]; <span class="SpellE">Baliwag</span>
Transit, Inc. v. C.A., 147 SCRA 82 [1987]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, the records show that the findings of fact and the
conclusions of the trial court are supported by substantial evidence and there
appears to be no cogent reason to disturb the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was also pointed out by the Court of Appeals that should the
action for damages be given due course, conflicting judgment of two branches of
the trial court may result.</p>

<p class="BODY">This issue has been laid to rest by this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> v. Felipe (42 SCRA 515, 629 [1971]), where the
remedy appears to be not dismissal of one case, but the consolidation of two
(2) cases in one branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the Court
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Although consolidation of several cases involving the same
parties and subject-matter is a matter addressed to the discretion of the trial
court, joint hearing becomes a matter of duty if two or more cases are tried
before the same judge, or even if filed with different branches of the same
court of first instance, provided one of such cases has not been partially
tried.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(citing, PAL, et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span>, et al., G.R. No. L-6698, <st1:date year="1955" day="30" month="8">Aug. 30, 1955</st1:date>, 97 Phil. 461)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 4454-M (for damages) has not yet been tried, and
to dismiss the same without giving opportunity to petitioner to submit evidence
to substantiate her allegations would be denying her, her day in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the consolidation of the
two cases will achieve the purpose or rationale of a joint hearing authorized
by Rule 31 of the Rules of Court, namely, to avoid duplication of suits, guard
against oppression or abuse, prevent delay, clear congested dockets, simplify
the work of the trial court and save unnecessary costs and expenses, thus
attaining justice with maximum speed and with the least expense and vexation to
the litigants (<span class="SpellE">Raymundo</span> v. Felipe, <u>supra</u>,
citing:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Querubing</span>, G.R. No. L-29510-31, <st1:date year="1969" day="29" month="11">Nov. 29, 1969</st1:date>, 30 SCRA 739, 745).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, private respondents admit that the Court of Appeals in
its resolution dated May 17, 1977 expressly recognized the right of the
petitioner to contest the validity of the decision of the Office of the
President in Civil Case No. 4644-M, yet seek the dismissal of the action for
damages in Civil Case No. 4454-M, as a collateral attack on the validity of
said decision (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 84-86).</p>

<p class="BODY">Not only are the arguments of private respondents inconsistent
but as correctly maintained by the petitioner, such dismissal would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of her right to due process because it would
entail dismissal of her action for damages without any proof having been
submitted by her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Office of the
President did not pass upon the issue of damages (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 131) presumably in recognition of the principle that such is not for
presidential determination but is within the jurisdiction of<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span></b>the courts; in this case, it was
left to the Court of First Instance, now to the Regional Trial Courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the appealed decision of the respondent Court
of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1976" day="9" month="12">December 9, 1976</st1:date>
