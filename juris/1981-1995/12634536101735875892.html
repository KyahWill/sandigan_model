<p class=BODY>On <st1:date Year="1974" Day="9" Month="3">March 9, 1974</st1:date>,
<span class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman donated seven parcels of land located in
<span class=SpellE>Jaro</span>, <st1:City><st1:place>Iloilo</st1:place></st1:City>,
to Alejandro <span class=SpellE>Gronifillo</span>, the petitioner herein.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The lands donated had been held under
leasehold contracts since many years before by the private respondents.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span><span class=SpellE>Valentin</span> <span
class=SpellE>Jancilan</span> had held 3.5314 hectares since 1963; <span
class=SpellE>Apolinario</span> de <span class=SpellE>los</span> <st1:City><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:City>
4.5159 hectares since 1935; <span class=SpellE>Nonito</span> <span
class=SpellE>Gerochi</span> 3.5623 hectares also since 1935; and Pedro <span
class=SpellE>Gerochi</span> 3.3449 hectares since 1965.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>Their leases were confirmed in contracts
which they executed with <span class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman on <st1:date
Year="1975" Day="23" Month="5">May 23, 1975</st1:date>.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>And because they were tenant farmers when
P.D. No. 27 (the Emancipation of Tenants Decree) was promulgated on <st1:date
Year="1972" Day="21" Month="10">October 21, 1972</st1:date>, land transfer
certificates had been issued to <span class=SpellE>Jancilan</span> and <span
class=SpellE>Nonito</span> <span class=SpellE>Gerochi</span> on <st1:date
Year="1976" Day="21" Month="10">October 21, 1976</st1:date>, and to Pedro <span
class=SpellE>Gerochi</span> on <st1:date Year="1977" Day="10" Month="10">October
 10, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class=BODY>In his complaint filed on July 7, 1978, petitioner <span
class=SpellE>Gronifillo</span> alleged that the lands were donated to him on
the occasion of his ordination as a Roman Catholic priest but he was so busy
that he could not see the lands until 1977 when he discovered that they were
occupied by the respondents by virtue of agricultural leasehold contracts which
were executed by <span class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman in 1975.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He claimed that since the contracts were
executed subsequent to the donation made the previous year, they were null and
void.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>He asked that he be declared owner
of the lands, that the respondents be ordered to vacate the same, and that they
render an accounting.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Court of Agrarian Relations rendered judgment &quot;Declaring
the deed of donation executed by <span class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman in
favor of the plaintiff Alejandro <span class=SpellE>Gronifillo</span> as null
and void, the same being contrary to law and public policy and dismissing the
above-entitled complaint.&quot; This judgment was affirmed by the Court of
Appeals.</p>

<p class=BODY>The lower courts were both correct in holding that <span
class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman could not validly donate the lands in question
to the petitioner because when the donation was made she was no longer the
owner of the lands.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>They belonged to the
private respondents by operation of law because as tenant farmers on <st1:date
Year="1972" Day="21" Month="10">October 21, 1972</st1:date>, they were
&quot;deemed owner&quot; of the lands which they were cultivating.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>(P.D. No. 27.) The execution of the contracts
between <span class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman and the private respondents on <st1:date
Year="1975" Day="23" Month="5">May 23, 1975</st1:date>, merely confirmed their
previous status as tenants before the donation was made.</p>

<p class=BODY>However, <span class=GramE>We</span> are not prepared to say that
the pure and simple donation of <span class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman is void
and hence completely without effect.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>In
executing the donation (<span class=SpellE>Rollo</span>, pp. 13-14), <span
class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman obviously intended to give something of value
to Father Alejandro <span class=SpellE>Gronifillo</span> and not to play a
cruel joke on him.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>While the
circumstances made it impossible for her to give the lands <u>per</u> <u>se</u>
to the <span class=SpellE>donee</span>, her act of liberality need not be
completely frustrated; it can be carried out within the law by giving to Father
<span class=SpellE>Gronifillo</span> the cost of the lands which the private
respondents still have to pay.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The part
is included in the whole.</p>

<p class=BODY><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
modified.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>The private respondents shall
pay to the petitioner the cost of the lands which they have acquired pursuant
to P.D. No. 27, less amounts which they may have already paid to <span
class=SpellE>Pilar</span> Guzman.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>  </span>No
special pro­nouncement as to costs.</p>

<p class=SOORDERED><span class=GramE>SO ORDERED.</span></p>
