				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Gotardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Flordelis</span>,
the administrator of the <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span> School of Arts and
Trades at <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span> City, filed this special civil
action of prohibition to restrain the respondents (the city mayor, fiscal and
engineer of <span class="SpellE">Tagbilaran</span> City, an Assistant Minister
and certain officials of the Ministry of Public Works assigned in Central <span class="SpellE">Visayas</span> and the provincial commander of <span class="SpellE">Bohol</span>)
<span style="">from closing the school and inspecting
the building of the said school for the alleged purpose of searching "for
incriminating evidence of violations" of law and harassing the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">City Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Jovencio</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Orcullo</span> (concurrently acting provincial fiscal), in his own
behalf and as counsel for the city mayor, the city engineer and the provincial
commander, explained in his comment on the petition why the petitioner was
charged in Criminal Case No. 2045 with having violated the National Building
Code, why an inspection team (composed of the respondent officials) was created
to investigate the structural stability of the school building and why stop­page
and closure orders were issued.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regional Director Benjamin T. <span class="SpellE">Marcial</span>
of the Ministry of Public Works revealed in his comment the bases of his
impression that the said building might have structural defects and that the
addition of new floors might be unwarranted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He recounted how the investigating team was organized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He showed the unreasonableness of <span class="SpellE">Flordelis</span>' refusal to allow the team to investigate the
construction of the building.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was heard on <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="8">August
 10, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that hearing,
the petitioner agreed to allow the inspection of the building in the presence
of his representatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some Members of
the Court <span class="SpellE">counselled</span> the petitioner to improve his
public relations with the respondents and not to treat his school as an enclave
of which he is the undisputed sovereign and which is off limits to the
respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General, as counsel for respondent officials of the
Ministry of Public Works and the provincial commander alleged in his
manifestation of September 4, 1981 that a team of engineers from the Ministry of
Public Works and the city engineer's office inspected the school building in
the presence of the petitioner's representatives from the Ministry of Education
and Culture.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General observed that the petition had become moot
because its purpose was to restrain the inspection of the building by the
respondents and such inspection was carried out with petitioner's consent on <st1:date year="1981" day="19" month="8">August 19, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> this case is dismissed and considered
closed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining order
is dissolved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, the respondents
are enjoined from carrying out, without petitioner's consent, a "seismic
test" by ramming the building with a bulldozer, as alleged by petitioner's
counsel in his manifestation of <st1:date year="1981" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1981</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
