of the National Labor Relations Commission dated <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1986</st1:date> which affirmed the decision of the labor
arbiter in NLRC RABX Case No. 2-0242, entitled "<span class="SpellE">Casiano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> v. Philippine Packing Corporation", <span class="GramE">the</span> <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which
states:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, judgment is hereby rendered
ordering respondent to issue a written memorandum to effect the transfer of
complainant from <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental General <span class="GramE">Crops</span> operations to pineapple plantation operation(s) in <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant is likewise directed to comply with the written
Memorandum within ten (10) days from receipt thereof otherwise he shall be
considered to have abandoned his employment."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> was hired by respondent Philippine Packing
Corporation on <st1:date year="1960" day="12" month="7">July 12, 1960</st1:date>
as an hourly-paid research field worker at its pineapple plantation operations
in <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in 1970, <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> was transferred to
the general crops plantation operations in <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span>
Oriental.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Four years later or on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="1">January 16, 1974</st1:date>, he was promoted to
the position of a monthly-paid regular supervisor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When research activity was however phased out
in March, 1982, <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> was <u>verbally</u> advised by
respondent company on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="3">March 29, 1982</st1:date>
of his re-assignment to the <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> plantation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was to report there on <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="4">April 1, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of reporting to his new assignment, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> filed successive leave applications, the last of
which was on <st1:date year="1982" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1982</st1:date>
for an indefinite period of time, allegedly "to settle land problem(s) in <span class="SpellE">Surigao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Agusan</span>".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent company disapproved this last application since <span class="SpellE">Sedaya's</span>
leaves of absences had reached the maximum ceiling of forty-five (45) days.</p>

<p class="BODY">While he was on leave, <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> tried to
persuade management to reconsider his transfer and if this was not possible, to
at least consider his position as redundant so that he could be entitled to
severance pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent company
refused, stating that it was not terminating his services and that his position
as supervisor was still there for him to hold.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> persisted in his self-imposed
absences despite their being unauthorized.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1982</st1:date>,
respondent company charged him in writing with abandonment of work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> did not answer
the charge within the five-day period allowed him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he appear at the <st1:date year="1982" day="11" month="5">May 11, 1982</st1:date> hearing scheduled for
him to ventilate his side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
respondent company dismissed him from the service effective <st1:date year="1982" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1982</st1:date> for abandonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Feeling aggrieved, <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> filed on <st1:date year="1983" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1983</st1:date> a complaint for
illegal dismissal and prayed for separation pay with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>,
if any.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He did not ask for reinstatement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor arbiter, in his decision, found that <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> did not abandon his employment but concluded that
both parties were at fault:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span>, for his refusal to work at his new place of
assignment after his application for an indefinite leave was disapproved, and
respondent company, for its failure to issue a written memorandum of
transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the labor arbiter
ordered respondent company to prepare a written memorandum <span class="GramE">effecting</span>
the transfer and gave petitioner a period of ten (10) days from receipt within
which to comply, or else he would be held liable for abandonment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent company did not contest the arbiter's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In compliance therewith, it issued the
required memorandum dated <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="6">June 23,
 1983</st1:date> to petitioner, formally advising the latter of his
reassignment and giving him ten (10) days from receipt to report for work.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner received notice of the above memorandum on <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not report for duty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, he appealed his case to the National
Labor Relations Commission contending that the memorandum order was oppressive.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also questioned the reinstatement because
it did not provide for an award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner demanded reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, or in the alternative, separation pay.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier mentioned, the labor tribunal sustained the decision
of the labor arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, this
present petition which raises the main issue of whether or not petitioner could
be validly dismissed from his employment by reason of his refusal to accept his
new assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has, in a number of cases, recognized and upheld the
prerogative of management to transfer an employee from one office to another
within the business establishment, provided that it does not involve a demotion
in rank or a diminution of his salaries, benefits and other privileges.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a function associated with the employer's
inherent right to control and manage effectively its enterprise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even as the law is solicitous of the welfare
of employees, it must also protect the right of an employer to exercise what
are clearly management prerogatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
free will of management to conduct its business affairs to achieve its purpose
cannot be denied.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's reassignment to <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>
was a legitimate exercise of managerial prerogatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His field research work in <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental had been completely phased out for being
unnecessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But petitioner was
not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So instead of terminating his
employment, respondent company decided to move him back to <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>
where he had been originally assigned and where he could be more useful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This would belie petitioner's claim that there
was illegal constructive dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Surely, respondent company could not be faulted for undertaking means to
maximize its existing labor force by deploying its employees to its various
areas of operations in order to achieve optimum results for the benefit of the
company.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, there is nothing in the records to indicate
that the projected relocation of petitioner was motivated by considerations
other than the exigencies of the service.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the reasons adduced by petitioner to justify his non-acceptance
of the <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> assignment, i.e. his land problems
and the anticipated dislocation of his family, appear unconvincing in the face
of the management's inherent right to lay down policies and rules which the
employee must abide by.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither was the transfer a demotion because petitioner would be
maintaining his status as a supervisor and like all supervisors in the <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> plantation, would likewise be entitled to free
housing with free light and water facilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">If for any reason an employee finds himself in that intolerable
situation where he is unable to sacrifice his personal interests in favor of
the demands of the service, then he has no other option but to separate himself
from his employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the company is
not duty-bound to grant him separation pay for the reason that his removal is
of his own choosing.</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, the transfer should be upheld.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner has sought reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reinstatement to his former post can no
longer be made since that had been abolished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the same time, respondent company cannot be compelled to pay him <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> during the period when he was not actually
working.</p>

<p class="BODY">The labor arbiter, in arriving at his decision, accorded much
weight to the fact that there was only a verbal and not a written instruction
of the transfer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also considered the
very significant fact that in petitioner's twenty-two years of service with the
multinational <span class="GramE">firm,</span> he has never been cited for any
disciplinary infraction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The arbiter's
directive requiring the written memorandum and giving petitioner a reasonable
period within which to comply appears to be the most fair and equitable
solution to break the impasse between petitioner and respondent company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be reiterated if only to give both
parties a final opportunity to rectify their mistakes.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General has recommended the grant of separation pay
to which an employee "laid off due to retrenchment" is entitled under
the law should petitioner no longer wish to remain with the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is not inclined to extract this last measure of
magnanimity from respondent company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
must be stressed that what was considered by the company as unnecessary was
petitioner's research activity in <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental,
and not petitioner's services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
not laid off.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was moved to <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span> precisely because the company still needed his
services.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, the Court finds that respondent
Commission did not gravely abuse its discretion in sustaining the labor
arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the instant petition is DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court hereby directs respondent
Philippine Packing Corporation to issue within ten (10) days from notice
another written memorandum to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Casiano</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sedaya</span> directing his transfer to its <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>
pineapple plantation and to give petitioner a period of ten (10) days from
receipt within which to comply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner has the option to either accept the reassignment without <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> or face dismissal from employment without
severance pay, since termination from employment, at this point, shall be for
cause.</p>
