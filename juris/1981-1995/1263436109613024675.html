COURT OF APPEALS AND FELIX ANGELES, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>QUIASON, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65 of the Revised
Rules of Court to nullify the decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No.
CV-15653 entitled "Felix Angeles v. Filinvest Finance and Leasing
Corporation, represented by its President."</p>

<p class="BODY">The case CA-G.R. No. CV-15653 of the Court of Appeals was an
appeal by Filinvest Finance &amp; Leasing Corporation from the decision of the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 38, San Jose City, in Civil Case No. SJC-279.  <span style="">The </span>Filinvest
Credit Corporation, petitioner herein, was a co-defendant in said civil case
but which <span style="">did </span>not appeal from
the decision.  The Court of Appeals,
dismissed the complaint as against Filinvest Finance &amp; Leasing Corporation
but held Filinvest Credit Corporation liable for all the damages due Felix
Angeles, private respondent herein.  Hence, this petition under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute that, as found by the Court of Appeals,
respondent Felix Angeles purchased from Armark Motor Works and Body Builders an
Isuzu passenger jeepney for P57,408.00, payable at a monthly installment of
P2,392.00.  To secure payment, private
respondent executed a promissory note and a deed of chattel mortgage in favor
of the seller.  The latter assigned the
promissory note and chattel mortgage of respondent Angeles to Filinvest Finance
&amp; Leasing Corporation, which in turn, assigned them to Filinvest Credit
Corporation on December 7, 1983.</p>

<p class="BODY">As respondent Angeles failed to either pay his installment
payments on time or pay the correct amount of the installments, the Filinvest
Credit Corporation filed an action for replevin in the Regional Trial Court,
Branch 42, Pampanga and had the passenger jeepney seized.</p>

<p class="BODY">In turn, respondent Angeles filed on December 14, 1983, an action
for replevin to recover said vehicle with damages against Filinvest Finance and
Leasing Corporation with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 38, San Jose
City.  FiIinvest Finance and Leasing
Corporation moved to dismiss the complaint, alleging, <u>inter ali</u><u><span style="">a</span></u><span style="">,</span> that it had assigned the obligation of respondent Angeles to
Filinvest Credit Corporation and that it was not the party that seized the
vehicle.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the trial court denied the motion to dismiss, respondent
Angeles moved on August 20, 1984 to amend the complaint, by impleading
Filinvest Credit Corporation as defendant and alleging that said party was the
one which committed the tortious act of wrongfully seizing the vehicle subject
of the replevin suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the complaint, as amended, read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That plaintiff had faithfully and religiously
paid his monthly installment/obligation to the defendant <u>Philinvest (sic)
Credit Corporation as directed by the other defendant Philinvest (sic) Finance
&amp; Leasing Corporation, from November, 1981 continuously </u><u><span style="">up </span></u><u><span style="">to </span>December, 1983 as evidenced by receipts of the payment duly
issued by the defendant Philinvest (sic) Credit Corporation</u>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That on December 7, 1983 and without notice
to and/or (sic) knowledge of plaintiff, defendant <u>Philinvest Credit
Corporation acting through its agents,</u> unjustifiably repossessed and/or
seized through force and violence from defendant's driver the aforedescribed
Isuzu passenger jeepney to the <span style="">damage </span>and
<span style="">prejudice of </span>the plaintiff"
(Rollo, p. 32).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After summons was served on Filinvest Credit Corporation, it
filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on the ground of respondent
Angeles' failure to prosecute.  The
motion to dismiss was <span style="">denied.  </span>Filinvest Credit Corporation
thereupon filed its answer with counterclaim.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Regional Trial Court, promulgated its decision
in favor <span style="">of </span>respondent <span style="">Angeles.  The dispositive </span>portion of the decision reads as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this Court hereby renders judgment for the
plaintiff and against the <u>defendant</u> <span style="">finding:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

the plaintiff, and should the turn over of the possession be impossible, to pay
the plaintiff the amount of P55,860.00 representing the amount paid by
plaintiff to the <u><span style="">defendant</span></u><span style="">;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->6.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->To <span style="">pay </span>the cost
of suit" (Rollo, pp. 11-12; underlining supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="">Believing that the decision only
ordered it to pay the sum of P10,000.00 for and as attorney’s fees, Filinvest
Credit Corporation did not appeal therefrom and just paid respondent Angeles
the sum of P10,000.00.  Believing <span style="">that it </span>was the "defendant"
referred to in the decision, Filinvest Finance and Leasing Corporation
appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals adopted the findings of fact of <span style="">the trial court but </span><span style="">it </span>specified that while the promissory
note and chattel mortgage in question were originally assigned to Filinvest
Finance and Leasing Corporation, the latter assigned its rights thereon to
Filinvest Credit Corporation.  The Court
of Appeals also made explicit that it<span style=""> </span>was
Filinvest Credit Corporation that <span style="">unlawfully
seized the </span>vehicle of respondent Angeles.  The dispositive portion of the decision of the Court of Appeals
reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, defendant-appellant, FINANCE,
is pronounced to be without liability under the judgment appealed from.  As to defendant CREDIT, who (sic) did not <span style="">interpose any appeal, the judgment is </span>AFFIRMED
<span style="">with the modification that in case the
subject vehicle cannot be returned to plaintiff-appellee, the amount of
P56,358.00 representing the downpayment </span><span style="">(P18,000.00) </span><span style="">plus the
amount paid on the Promissory Note (P38,358.00, should be paid to
plaintiff-appellee" (Rollo, p. 45).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Filinvest Credit Corporation now comes to us, complaining that
the Court of Appeals cannot increase the amount of damages to be paid by it,
when neither it, as a co-defendant, nor respondent Angeles, as plaintiff,
appealed from the decision of the trial court, particularly the portion thereof
<span style="">ordering </span>"[t]he defendant
Filinvest Credit Corporation to pay the plaintiff P10,000,00 <span style="">and </span>as attorney's fees."</p>

<p class="BODY">The comedy of legal errors started with the careless drafting of
the decision <span style="">of </span>the trial
court.  The ambiguity of the decision,
which spawned the confusion, can be shown by reproducing it in full, as
follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The present (sic) is for recovery of possession of an Isuzu

from Armark Motor Works and Body Builders <span style="">an
Isuzu passenger </span>jeepney at a cost price of P57,408.00 payable in two (2)
years at a monthly installment of P2,392.00, the installment to commence in
November 1981.  To secure payment
plaintiff has (sic) executed a promissory note and a deed of chattel mortgage
in favor of Armark Motor Works and Body Builders executed (sic) a deed of
assignment of plaintiff's obligation in favor of the <u><span style="">defendant</span></u><span style="">; </span>despite
the monthly payments made by plaintiff to the <u>defendant</u>, without prior
notice to and knowledge of the former, the latter seized said jeepney to the
damage and prejudice of the plaintiff; plaintiff <span style="">s</span>eeks to recover not only the possession of the jeepney but also
damages and attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 25, 1984, the Court acting on <u>defendant's</u> motion to
dismiss and the opposition filed thereto, <span style="">has
denied (sic) the </span>former's motion, hence, on May 15, 1984, <u>defendant</u>
filed its answer admitting only paragraph <span style="">3
of </span>plaintiff's complaint and denied the rest thereof; it has set up
(sic) affirmative defenses of improper laying of venue; that <u>defendant</u>
is not the real party in interest and that plaintiff's claim has been waived,
abandoned or has been extinguished.  As
a <span style="">final thrust, </span><u>defendant</u>
<span style="">in its </span>counterclaim seeks for <span style="">damages, litigation </span>expenses and
attorney's fees.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On May 16, 1984, plaintiff filed a reply to <u>defendant's</u>
counterclaim alleging that <u>defendant's</u> claim for damages is baseless.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The pre-trial conference having been terminated, the hearing on the
merits commenced on August 17, 1984 until the submission of the case <span style="">for decision on </span>September 7, 1987.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Running through the gamut of plaintiff's <span style="">evidence </span>are two main propositions:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">First, that the term </span>of
payments expressly stipulated in the promissory note has been waived amounting
to an amendment of the contract thru the acceptance by the <u>defendant</u> of
a lesser amount and <u>defendant</u> had tacitly acquiesced to delayed payments
amounting to a ratification of an amended contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second, that the <u>defendant</u> having acquiesced in accepting
lesser and delayed payments has acted in bad faith when it forcibly took
possession of the mortgaged vehicle and disposed of it, hence, it should be
held accountable for the damages sustained by the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The terms of payments as expressly stipulated in the promissory
note, Exh. A on plaintiff's theory has be been amended because: <span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On three (3) different occasions
particularly in February 1982, April 1982 and May 1982, when the fourth, sixth
and seventh monthly installments became due and payable, instead of the <u>defendant</u>
availing of its right to foreclose the mortgage, have (sic) acquiesced in
accepting the delayed payments of the monthly amortizations as clearly shown by
O.R. No. 128297, Exh. B-1 for the month of January 1982; O.R. No. 060245, Exh.
B-2 for the month of March 1982; and O.R. No. 042685, Exh. B-4 for the month of
June 1982.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That all of the amortizations paid by the
plaintiff and received by the <u>defendant</u> were duly receipted for by the <u>defendant</u>
as evidenced by official receipts, Exhs. B, B-1 to B-25, covering the months of
November 1981 up to December 1983, but for the months of February, April and
May 1982, and the said payments are lesser than what was originally and
expressly stipulated in the promissory note.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Court subscribed to the theory of the plaintiff, otherwise, <u>defendant</u>
would, when the plaintiff failed to pay the first installment which fell due on
November 21, 1981 and when plaintiff made less payments on December 18, 1981
and on January 21, 1982 have foreclosed the mortgage.  The continued acceptance of the plaintiff's payments which were
very much lesser than what was previously and expressly stipulated <span style="">in the </span>promissory note and the number
of delayed payments, all the more, indicate a concrete revelation (sic) that
the contract between the herein parties as regards the manner or mode of
payments which benefited the <u>defendant</u> has been amended, amounting to an
implied ratification of the contract (Acuña vs. Batoc Producers Cooperative
Marketing Association, Inc., L-20333, June 30, 1967, SCRA 526).  The desire of the plaintiff to live up to
and comply with the terms and conditions of the contract is show (sic) by his
payments, Exhs. B, B-1 to B-25 and indicative of the good faith of the
plaintiff in settling his obligations to the <u>defendant</u>.  The acceptance of the partial payments by
the <u>defendant</u> constitutes an implied ratification of the amended terms
of payments which precludes a rejection of the amended terms of payment
(Federation of United Namarco Distributors, Inc. vs. National Marketing
Corporation, L-17819, March 31, 1962, 4 SCRA 867).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The <u>defendant</u> having tolerated and acquiesced in accepting
lesser and delayed payments has acted in utmost bad faith because:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After having implied (sic) amended or
modified the express stipulation in the promissory note amounting to the
ratification of lesser payments without the benefit of notice and demand upon
the plaintiff in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Chattel Mortgage x x x, the
<u>defendant</u> forcibly took possession of the mortgaged vehicle and worst of
all, have sold the same to the damage and prejudice of the plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The forcible taking of the mortgaged vehicle took place on December
7, 1983, by four persons who boarded the jeep being driven by Rolly Alcantara
along España Street in Manila while en route to Vito Cruz.  Reaching the round table, they told
Alcantara that the jeep run (sic) over a child and Alcantara definitely sure
that there was no incident of said nature, has (sic) suggested to the four
persons that they see the owner of the jeep for any possibility that the other
driver could be responsible for it, but instead of heeding to Alcantara's suggestion,
the four persons forced Alcantara to get-off the jeep with one of them poking
his gun against Alcantara and forced him to board the service car of the four
persons (t.s.n. R. Alcantara, October 10, 1985, pp. 16 to 18).  Because of apprehension and nervousness
thinking that what transpired is a case of carnapping and to be the end of the
world for him, Alcantara lost consciousness and regained consciousness only in
San Fernando, Pampanga, where he was handed a piece of paper which he signed
having been asked to; at that point in time, Alcantara did not know the
whereabouts of the jeep (Ibid, pp. 23 and 24); Alcantara handed the document to
the plaintiff three days after the forcible taking of the same (Ibid, p. 19),
of <span style="">which </span><span style="">document, Exh. </span>C, <span style="">purports
to show that the </span>mortgaged <span style="">vehicle
was </span>surrendered to the <u>defendant</u>, when in <span style="">truth </span>and in fact was <span style="">forcibly
taken </span>from Rolly Alcantara.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff unaware of the filing of Civil
Case No. <span style="">6807, </span>Regional Trial
Court, <span style="">Branch </span>XLII, San Fernando,
Pampanga, on June 8, 1983, has made six more payments; P1,000.00 on August 8,
1983 under O.R. No. 034202, Exh. B-20; P1,000.00 on September 22, 1983 under
O.R. No. 002721, Exh. 003026, Exh. B-22; P1,000.00 on November 7, 1983 under
O.R. 003751, Exh. B-23; P2,000.00 on November 23, 1983 under O.R. No. 047722,
Exh. B-­25; and P1,000.00 on December 1, 1983 under O.R. No. 081062, Exh. B-24,
and the <u>defendant</u> in evident bad faith received said payments as shown
by said receipts, the latest of which payment was on December 1, 1983 without
informing plaintiff about the case it has filed.  The total payments made by the plaintiffs amounted to P55,860.00
including the P18,000.00 which he has paid at the time of the delivery <span style="">of </span>the vehicle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Anent this, the Court observes the undue advantage taken of by the <u>defendant</u>
against the plaintiff which is adhored by Article 19 and 22 of the Civil
Code.  The act of receiving amortization
payments, especially to after the <u>defendant</u> has already filed Civil Case
No. 6807 is not consistent with justice and good faith and the principle of
unjust enrichment at the expense of another.</blockquote>

<blockquote>To justify the seizure of the vehicle, the <u>defendant</u> tried
to show that it has filed a replevin case before the Regional Trial Court,
Branch XLVII, San Fernando, Pampanga, docketed as Civil Case No. 6807 where the
Court has issued an Order authorizing the Sheriff or proper officer of that
Court to take custody of the mortgaged <span style="">vehicle
</span>but far short of showing any proof that <span style="">the said </span>order was carried out in compliance with Sections 4 and
8, Rule 60 of the Rules of Court.  This,
to the mind of the Court, reveals the point that the seizure was not clearly
and indubitably shown in the Court's order, Exh. B, <u>defendant</u>, <span style="">and </span>Exh. D, plaintiff:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"xxx it appearing that the issues are not yet joined despite
the fact that the complaint was <span style="">filed
way back </span>on June 8, 1983; let this case be, as it is hereby dismissed
without prejudice and without pronouncement as to costs."</p>

<blockquote>Clear to the Court is the fact <span style="">that </span>the mortgaged <span style="">vehicle
is </span>a passenger <span style="">jeep </span>and
being driven by Rolly Alcantara from 5:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. where the plaintiff
derives a daily net income of P130.00 in what is practiced and known as
boundary paid by Alcantara, aside from the income derived therefrom after 5:00
p.m. when he (plaintiff) purposely drives the vehicle (t.s.n. F. Angeles,
October 10, 1985, pp. 7 and 8).  Evident, likewise, to negate the posture of <span style="">the </span><u>defendant</u> that it has not taken the mortgaged vehicle
by force is a receipt, Exh. 1, <u>defendant</u>, which is Exh. C, plaintiff,
showing clearly and indubitably that the mortgaged vehicle was taken from
plaintiff's driver Rolly Alcantara and not from the plaintiff.  If there is truth in the receipt that the
vehicle was surrendered to the <u>defendant</u>, there is no need for Rolly
Alcantara to be brought to San Fernando, Pampanga.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the foregoing, the Court has come to the following
conclusions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The mortgaged vehicle was forcibly taken
somewhere at the round table while en route to Vito Cruz, Manila, by four
persons one of whom poked his gun at plaintiff's driver, Rolly Alcantara;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiff has been earning a net
income of P130.00 a day for a period of five (5) months when said jeep was
forcibly taken by the four persons who identified themselves as police officers
and has thus deprived the plaintiff of a legitimate earning from said jeepney;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the <u>defendant</u> has acted in
evident bad faith when it took the jeepney by force from the plaintiff's driver
and when it still received the payments fully aware that as of June 8, 1983, it
has already instituted a case against the plaintiff at the RTC in San Fernando,
Pampanga;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the plaintiff having proven that he has
a right to the possession of the mortgaged vehicle must be restored in his
possession by virtue of Article 539 of the Civil Code; corollary thereto, he is
entitled to damages under Articles 19, 20, 23, 2199 and 2208, likewise, of the
Civil Code.  His demand for damages
under Articles 19, 30 and 23 and attorney's fees incidental to the filing of
this action is granted; and</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While there are two defendants in Civil Case No. SJC-279, the

order to identify <span style="">which </span>of the

the witnes<span style="">se</span>s just referred to

however, showed that while the promissory note <span style="">executed by respondent </span>Angeles in favor of Armark Motor Works

(Exh. A; also Exh. 2) the same note was reassigned by Filinvest Finance and

been paying his amortizations to Filinvest Credit Corporation (Exh. B, B-1 to

replevin to recover the passenger jeepney from respondent Angeles in the
Regional Trial Court, Branch 42, San Fernando, Pampanga (Exh. D; also Exh. 1;
Exh. H, also Exh. 5); and that it was said defendant that forcibly seized the

imposed by the trial court on petitioner herein, which was neither an appellant
nor an appellee in the appeal, is untenable.  True, the general rule in appellate procedure is that the reversal of
the judgment on appeal is binding only on the parties in the appealed case and
cannot prejudice or benefit one who did not appeal or was not made a party to
the appeal (Facundo v. Pabalan, 4 SCRA 375 [1962]; Tropical Homes, <span style="">Inc. </span>v. Fortun, 169 SCRA 81 [1989]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Implicit in the general rule is the reversal or modification of
the decision of the trial court by the appellate court.  The rule therefore is not applicable in a
case where the appellate court does not reverse or mod<span style="">i</span>fy the appealed decision but on the contrary, affirms and
clarifies it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the apparent ambiguity of the decision of the trial court,
the remedy of the two defendants was to <span style="">ask
</span>for a clarification from the trial court itself before interposing an
appeal.  The trial court has
jurisdiction to clarify its own decisions even after their <span style="">finality.  (Locsin</span> v. Paredes, 63 Phil. 87 [1936].</p>

<p class="BODY">But inasmuch as the decision was appealed immediately to the
Court of Appeals, the said Court can clarify the ambiguity in the decision in
the course of resolving the assigned errors instead of remanding it to the
court of origin.</p>

<p class="BODY">Where there is an ambiguity, a <span style="">judgment </span>shall be read<span style=""> in
</span>connection with the entire record and construed accordingly.  In such a case it is proper to consider the
pleadings and the evidence (Republic v. Delos Angeles, 41 SCRA 422
[1971]).  This is what we, and
presumably the Court of Appeals, did.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is DISMISSED, there being no grave
abuse of discretion on the part of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
