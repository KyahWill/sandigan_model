				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">A pentel pen was used to intimidate her into having sexual
intercourse with the accused, as testified to by Rosalie Beltran, the alleged
rape victim.  Not true as she and I are
sweethearts, cries the accused-appellant, Melchor Cruz.  He points to Rosalie's mother's affirmation
that the handwriting in the romantic notes Rosalie sent to him was really her
daughter's and that she was no longer interested in pursuing the case.  Meticulous examination of the evidence
reveals merit in accused's allegations.  His acquittal is therefore in order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the People as summarized by the Solicitor
General is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 8:30 o'clock in the morning of December 2, 1978,
Rosalie Beltran, then fourteen (14) years of age, was inside her room located
at the second floor of their house at 84 B. Mariano St., Sta. Ana, San Mateo,
Rizal.  She was lying on her bed as she
was suffering from a headache.  At this
time, the members of her family were out.  Also at the house at the time was appellant Melchor Cruz, the latter
being employed by Rosalie's mother (Leonida Beltran) as shoemaker (tsn, April
15, 1980, pages 6-10).  Taking advantage
of the situation, appellant (Melchor) entered the unlocked room of Rosalie
holding a pentel pen with a pointed end.  When Rosalie inquired what was he doing there, appellant embraced
her.  Rosalie tried to shout but
appellant covered her mouth with his left hand while he embraced her at the
waist with his right hand, which he also used to remove her shorts (tsn, April
15, 1980, pages 11 to 14).  Appellant
succeeded in removing Rosalie's shorts (tsn, April 15, pages 17 to 18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Rosalie continued to resist appellant but he gave her a fistblow
on the stomach which weakened her.  Thereafter, appellant succeeded in forcing Rosalie to lie down on her
bed facing upward, with only a portion of the body above her knees actually on
the bed (tsn, April 15, 1980, page 26), after which appellant left her with the
threat that he would kill her should she tell anyone about the incident (tsn,
April 15, 1980, pages 29 to 30).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Intimidated by the threat, Rosalie did not immediately tell
anyone about the rape committed by appellant upon her.  A week later, however, she related the
incident to her grandmother, Isabel Beltran, and on December 10, 1978, Isabel
Beltran informed Leonida Beltran (Rosalie's mother) of the incident.  Leonida confronted Rosalie who admitted that
indeed she was abused by appellant on December 2, 1978 (tsn, May 7, 1980, pages
21 to 23).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On December 15, 1978, Leonida Beltran took Rosalie to the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) for medical examination.  Rosalie was attended to by Dr. Prospero A.
Cabayanan who issued Living Case Report No. NBI-78- 913 (Exhibits "A"
and “A-1").  Dr. Cabayanan stated
that Rosalie's case is one of false physical virginity, wherein there is no
evidence of any hymenal laceration because the hymen is elastic.  However, the orifice or the opening of her
vaginal canal was big enough as it measured 2.8 cm., enough to admit a male
organ in a state of erection without producing any laceration.  He was presented as witness for the
prosecution and he confirmed that the hymen of Rosalie is elastic and wide
enough to admit a male organ in a state of erection without producing any
genital injury, to show that there had been penetration prior to the
examination (tsn March 3, 1980 pages 4 to 18).<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's version is, however, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Accused testified that he and the private complainant were
sweethearts, she answered him on February 10, 1977, the date of birthday of the
private complainant.  They conversed
with each other and after the lapse of three months, she agreed to go out with
accused to picnics and movies (tsn, dtd. 11-3-81, p. 4).  Sexual intercourse happened one morning when
accused was making shoes in their house, she approached him and they started to
converse and when he asked for one thing, she consented (tsn, p. 4, Ibid.) It
happened at the ground floor of the house (Ibid., p. 5).  When accused testified on February 9, 1988,
he testified that the sexual relation with the complainant was with the consent
of the complainant (tsn, p. 2) and when asked for proof as to his relationship
with the complainant he had produced letters dated January 10, 1977, which were
marked as Exhibits “1" and “2”, respectively, (tsn, dtd. 2-9-88, p. 2).  Those letters were sent to him by the
complainant (tsn, p. 3).”<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court disbelieved the accused's story and forthwith
sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <i><span style="">reclusion
perpetua, </span></i><span style="">with </span>the
accessories provided by law, and to indemnify the private complainant, Rosalie
Beltran, in the amount of P30,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this appeal where accused-appellant faults the trial court
in -</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused presented in court two (2) letters dated January 20,
1977 and February 10, 1977, respectively, which were sent to him by
Rosalie.  The letters read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Mel,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Alam mo n(an)g matanggap ko ang sulat mo ay hindi ako mapalagay
dahil ba sabi ko sa iyo noong tayo ay magkausap ay sa birthday ko na lang kita
sasagutin kaya kung pupuwede ay maghintay ka na lang tutal mga ilang araw na
lang mula ngayon.  Siya nga pala salamat
sa gift mo hindi ko(,) hindi ko(,) malaman kung paano kita magagantihan.  Tungkol naman sa sinasabi mo sa akin na
manonood tayo ng sine ay papayag naman ako kapag sinagot na kita.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Hanggang dito na lamang
at <span style="">maraming salamat<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Just me </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rosalie Beltran (Sgd.) Nene"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and,</p>

<blockquote>“Mel,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Siguro kapag natanggap mo ang liham kong ito at iyong mabasa ang
nilalaman nito ay baka sabihin mo na sa iyong sarili na ikaw na ang
pinakamasayang nilalang sa ibabaw ng mundo dahil ang sulat na ito ay magsasabi sa
iyo na sinasagot na kita ng OO kaya simula ngayon ikaw ay akin at ako naman ay
sa iyo, pero kung puwede gusto ko ay tayong dalawa lamang ang makaalam nito
dahil baka malaman sa amin ay pagagalitan ako at baka paalisin ka pa sa trabaho
kaya ililihim natin ang mga bagay na ito.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Love,</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Sgd.) Nene</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Rosalie Beltran"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private complainant's mother, Leonida Beltran, was presented as a
defense witness by the accused and she affirmed, on the witness stand, that the
love letters were indeed written by her daughter.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> This
is perhaps why, upon seeing for herself said love notes, Leonida testified as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
that in this case, of your daughter Rosalie Beltran, you are no longer
interested to prosecute the same?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ATTY. CRUZ:</blockquote>

<blockquote>We have no further
questions, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Cross examination?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“PROS. QUILATAN:</blockquote>

<blockquote>No cross, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“COURT:<span style=""> </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
what other name is your daughter known?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nene,
Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"ATTY. CRUZ:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
that this Nene appearing in these two letters, Exhibits '1' and '2', is actually
your daughter?</blockquote>

sir.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, mention is made of the fact that aside from the
complainant, who was then 15 years old, her mother Leonida also signed the
complaint charging the accused <span style="">with </span>rape,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
although it was no longer necessary to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> The
fact that she did file the complaint, indicates that she was more after the
vindication of her honor rather than to right an alleged wrong committed on her
daughter, as the records will later show.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of Rosalie's love notes, together with Leonida
Beltran's statement that she is no longer interested in pursuing the case, the
seemingly immaterial inconsistencies in the complainant's testimony as to how
the actual rape <span style="">was committed, </span>had
assumed momentous significance, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Having testified that the room where she was allegedly raped was
right beside a store where many people "buy foodstuffs" and where
"you can overhear but cannot understand" their conversation,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
complainant in one part of her testimony stated that:</p>

<blockquote>“Q:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Will
you tell how this happened?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
incident happened like this.  While I
was resting inside my bedroom, the accused suddenly went inside.  When I inquired what was he doing he just
embraced and forced me to lie down, ma'am.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will
you describe how the accused embraced you and forced you to lie down, will you
describe?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
placed his <span style="">left hand </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">cover my mouth </span>and he used his right hand in embracing me, ma'am.</blockquote>

you step down and assuming that this lady is the accused, will you describe?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A <span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(Witness
demonstrated by placing the right hand of the accused on her mouth and the
right hand on the waist and took off her shorts and opened it.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
he was holding you, by what means did he force you to lie down?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
succeeded in forcing me to lie down because he gave me fistblow on the stomach,
ma'am."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">(Emphasis
supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">while in another part of her testimony,
she not only contradicted herself but also revealed her seemingly puissant
response to the accused's assault upon her as to cast doubt to <span style="">her alleged resistance </span>to <span style="">the accused's advances:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
happened after Melchor Cruz threatened you with the pentel pen?</blockquote>

what happened after he embraced you?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the first testimony, accused allegedly covered her mouth
immediately to prevent her from shouting while in the second testimony, it took
some time for accused to cover her mouth -- in fact, he embraced her, she
kicked him, he forced her to lie down, he mashed her body with both hands, she
was able to wrestle ("naibalya ko siya") with him, he attempted to
remove her pair of short pants, she pushed him, he stood up, he stayed near the
door to prevent her from going out, and THEN AND ONLY THEN, did he cover her
mouth.  And all the while that the
struggle was going on, she did not even make any attempt to shout.</p>

<p class="BODY">Actually, this last testimony is more of an indication of what
really transpired.  Unwittingly, private
complainant revealed the true nature of her sexual intercourse during cross
examination.  In this particular sexual
intercourse, Rosalie must have cried out in pain that is why accused covered
her mouth TO PREVENT the people in the store from knowing that the two of them
were having sex inside the room which was just beside the store.</p>

affair with the accused indirectly as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Complainant's immediate failure to notify the authorities or, at

the truthfulness of her narration.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> But
would Rosalie have volunteered that information to her grandmother?</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the love letters she sent to accused, where she
herself wanted the whole affair kept secret, it is more credible that someone
else also "spilled the beans," as testified to by accused, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

<p class="BODY">Indeed, we find it hard to swallow the rape story of complainant
hook, line and sinker.  Moreover, we are
bothered by the following facts which make it difficult for us to accept
complainant's version of what happened to her in the morning of December 2,
1978:</p>

<p class="NUM">1. The weapon of intimidation was alleged to be a pentel pen
"with pointed object" as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
did you first learn that Melchor Cruz entered your room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
saw him entering the room, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
he knock?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
he say anything when he entered the room?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None,
sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
was unarmed?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He<b>
</b><span style="">was </span>armed with what?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pentel
pen with pointed object, inside which he made, sir.”<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There was no clarification as to what that "pointed
object" in the pentel pen was.  It
could have been the short sharp tip of the pentel pen itself.  Definitely, it was not a knife nor a gun nor
a club nor a similar weapon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presence of said pentel pen is important because it was what
allegedly instilled fear in her and which intimidated her from shouting even
before the accused covered her mouth right after he embraced her, assuming that
her first version of when the accused exactly covered her mouth was what indeed
happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, in her statement given to TSGT Jose C. Quiocho of the
Western Sector, PC Metrocom, San Miguel, Manila, on December 18, 1978, no such
pentel pen with a pointed object was mentioned, as follows:</p>

omitted in order not to clutter up the quotation)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Granting that this unusual pentel pen had indeed intimidated
Rosalie at the start, the records do not show that throughout the alleged rape
the accused had consistently threatened or forced complainant at pentel pen
point to have sex with him.  What
Rosalie's testimony shows is that the accused had forgotten all about his
pentel pen weapon<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
while consummating the act.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the Medico Legal
Officer had testified that there was no hymenal laceration in Rosalie's hymen,
he made an observation that the opening of her vaginal canal was big enough
(2.8 cms. or 1.123 inches, more or less, in diameter) to admit an erected male
organ.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Prospero A. Cabanayan testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Will you please tell the
Honorable Court how you happened to examine this Rosalie Beltran, Doctor?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well, the subject,

<blockquote>"Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And for what reason
was she examined, for what reason was the request made?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reason was that,

by her mother as to the determination whether or not, there was a defloration
or not.</blockquote>

your examination?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And what were your
findings?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well, in this particular
case, this is one of the cases wherein the hymen was elastic and there was no
evidence of any hymenal laceration.  However, on further examination of the witness subject, the orifice or
the opening of the vaginal canal was big enough and it measures 2.8 cms. and
enough to admit a male organ or erection without producing any laceration.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, this is not the first time Rosalie has had sexual
intercourse.  In the light of the
accused's testimony that they have had at least thirty (30) sexual intercourses
since February 10, 1977,<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> the
2.8 cm. diameter orifice of Rosalie's private part could be easily explained.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">3. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court

disturbing, to say the least, and is an indication that the complaint for rape
was not made in a desire to bring the culprit to justice but, probably, to save
the honor of Rosalie's mother, Leonida (the accused was, after all, only her <i>sapatero).</i>  It also casts serious doubts as to the
charge of rape.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;"> It should be noted, as above stated, that Leonida
testified in court that she was no longer interested in pursuing the case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">4. <span style="">&nbsp; </span>While it may have been that Rosalie and the
accused were lovers, and had engaged in regular sex, still, not being married
to each other, Rosalie had the right to refuse accused's passionate advances
when she wanted to.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">  If indeed the December 2,
1980 sexual intercourse was without the consent of Rosalie, and, that she was
indeed raped, then a very vital and material piece of evidence that would show
the violence employed on the person of complainant, her pair of short pants,
which was allegedly torn when the accused embraced complainant, should have
been presented by the prosecution.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">  A truly aggrieved rape
victim and, likewise, a truly aggrieved mother, would have made sure that that
torn pair of short pants would have been kept intact for presentation to the
police authorities to substantiate their cries of rape.  The torn pair of short pants would have
strongly corroborated the testimony of the offended party that she was raped.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As the alleged torn pair of short pants was not presented by the
prosecution, the Court cannot, in the light of the love letters Rosalie sent to
the accused, the lack of interest of her mother to further prosecute the case
and the three different versions of how the accused allegedly covered her mouth
to prevent her from shouting while raping her, state with certainty that she
was raped in the morning of December 2, 1978.  If at all, what happened is a consented sexual act with the accused.</p>

Physical evidence is evidence of the highest order.  It speaks more eloquently than a hundred witnesses.  And the physical evidence in this case
strongly corroborates the testimony of the offended party that she was
raped.  They consist of the green color dress
and the panty that Erlinda was wearing at the time she was raped and which show
a torn portion of the left side of the dress and a torn portion of the
panty.  According to Erlinda, they were
torn when appellant forcibly pulled her dress up and removed her panty shortly
before she was raped.  <span style="">x x x.” </span>People <i><span style="">v.</span></i><span style=""> Sacabin, 57 SCRA707, 713.</span></p>
