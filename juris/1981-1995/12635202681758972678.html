				<BR><STRONG>MELENCIO-HERRERA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The factual background of this case may be stated as follows:
DEUTCHE MILCHWERKE DR. A. SAUER (DMW, for brevity) was a firm in <st1:country-region><st1:place>West
  Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region> manufacturing PRODUCTS (probably
chemicals) under the trademarks FISSAN, etc. Private respondent Philippine
Chemical Laboratories, Inc. (PHILCHEM, for brevity) is a local company which
apparently also manufactures and sells chemicals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1963">February 28, 1963</st1:date>,
DMW and PHILCHEM executed a so-called Agency AGREEMENT the basic provision of
which was that PHILCHEM would be the exclusive importer of the PRODUCTS into
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philip­pines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
The benefit to PHILCHEM would be the profits realized from re-sale in this
country of imported PRODUCTS. Other relevant provisions, generally stated, were
that:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(a) The term of the
AGREEMENT was five years renewable auto­matically for five years each time
unless one party gives due notice of termination to the other.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>PHILCHEM could manufacture the PRODUCTS
locally with raw materials from sources other than LINGNER, but in such case
DMW will have to be paid 5% of 80% of <span class="SpellE">PHILCHEM's</span>
wholesale prices.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(c)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>After termination of the AGREEMENT, PHILCHEM
will be entitled, for five years, to 10% royalty on sales of PRODUCTS in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
(hereinafter to be referred to as the ROYALTY CLAUSE).</p>

<p class="NUM">(d) "<u>All</u> <u>legal</u> <u>settlements</u> <u>within</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span><u>compass</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">It appears that, subsequently, the DMW interests were ac­quired
by LINGNER &amp; FISHER GMBH (LINGNER, for brevity). On the other hand, LINGNER
was a subsidiary of BEECHAM GROUP LTD. which, through BEECHAM PRODUCTS
INTERNATIONAL (BEECHAM, for brevity), had opened an office in this country at
Unit A, <st1:place><st1:placename>Padilla</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<st1:address><st1:street>Emerald Avenue</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:city></st1:address>, Metro Manila, under the
supervision or <span class="SpellE">managership</span> of one named TANNER.
LINGNER and BEECHAM can be deemed to constitute a single personality.
Subsequent reference to LINGNER will include reference to DMW and BEECHAM.</p>

<p class="BODY">The AGREEMENT was automatically renewed once, or up to <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1973">Feb­ruary 28, 1973</st1:date>, and finally
terminated on <st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1977">August 31, 1977</st1:date>.
The events relative to the termination were as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Before <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1973">February 28, 1973</st1:date>,
the parties agreed to extend the AGREEMENT up to <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1975">February 28, 1975</st1:date>. If it is not terminated by prior
notice six months before <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1975">February 28,
 1975</st1:date>, as it was not, it would be extended for a further two years
up to <st1:date month="2" day="28" year="1977">February 28, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">By letter dated February 25, 1977, through the law firm of <span class="SpellE">Ozaeta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Romulo</span>, De Leon, <span class="SpellE">Mabanta</span>, Buenaventura, <span class="SpellE">Sayoc</span> and
De <span class="SpellE">los</span> Angeles (the L<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">aw </span>Firm, for brevity) PHILCHEM was ad­vised that LINGNER was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">interested in continuing </span>business
relationship with PHILCHEM and will be interested in negotiating a new contract
and that, prior to the signing of a new contract, LINGNER was proposing that
the old contract be extended by mutual agree­ment for a period of six (6)
calendar months beginning March 1, 1977 to expire automatically on August 31,
1977 if no contract is entered into. The proposal was accepted by PHILCHEM, and
no new contract having been signed by <st1:date month="8" day="31" year="1977">August
 31, 1977</st1:date>, the AGREEMENT terminated on that date.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1979</st1:date>,
PHILCHEM presented a claim to LINGNER for P1<span class="GramE">,055,000.00</span>
under the ROYALTY CLAUSE. The claim was discussed between PHILCHEM and TANNER
of BEECHAM with the interven­tion of the Law Firm. No settlement having been
arrived at, PHILCHEM, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on </span><st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1980">August 6, 1980</st1:date>, filed a complaint
against BEECHAM <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">alone in Civil Case No.
38086 of the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.
The summons issued could not be served on BEECHAM, the Sheriff having </span>reported
that BEECHAM was neither a company <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">registered
in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, nor resident at the given address of Unit
A, </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Padilla</span></st1:placename><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Building</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span><st1:address><st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Emerald Avenue</span></st1:street><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span><st1:city><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Pasig</span></span></st1:city></st1:address><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, <span class="GramE">Metro</span> Manila.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">PHILCHEM then filed an
amended complaint, this time making LINGNER and BEECHAM as the defendants, </span>and
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pleading that summons could be served
on the law Firm</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as an </span><u>agent</u>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

summons <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">through the Law Firm. It will
thus be noted that two issues were being raised. The first was whether or not
LINGER was doing business in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">; and the second was whether or not LINGNER
could be validly summoned through the </span>La<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">w </span>Find <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as its agent. The
Trial Court denied the Motion to Dismiss, assuming that LINGNER could be sued
in this jurisdic­tion, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">holding that LINGNER can be served with
summons through </span>the Law <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Firm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">LINGNER went on <i>certiorari</i> to the Intermediate Appellate
Court where it reiterated the plea that summons could not be va­lidly served on
it through the Law Firm; and it also re­quested that a hearing be held,
conformably to the provisions of Section 9(3) of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, on the question of whether or not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">LINGNER was </span>doing business in this
country.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court held that summons served through the La<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">w </span>Firm was valid on the strength of <span class="SpellE">Johnlo</span> Trading Co. vs. Flores (88 Phil. 741 [1951]); and it
further ruled that re­ceiving evidence on whether or not LINGNER was doing
business in the Philippines could not be justified under the cited Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the Comment, Reply, Rejoinder and <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>-rejoinder
submitted by the parties, we resolved to give due course, without requiring the
submittal of memoranda.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Appellate Court acted correctly in denying the request for an
evidentiary hearing. Evidence necessary in regards to factual issues raised in
cases falling within the Appellate Court's original and appellate jurisdiction
contemplates "inci­dental" facts which were not touched upon, or
fully heard by the trial or respondent Court. The law could not have intended
that the Appellate Court would hold an original and full trial of a main
factual issue in a case, which properly pertains to Trial Courts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is </span>our view <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that evidence as to whether LINGNER was doing
</span>business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, even before the Trial Court, is no longer
necessary view of the fact that PHILCHEM and LINGNER </span>were <span class="SpellE">contractees</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in the
AGREEMENT and the claim of PHILCHEM </span>is based <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">on the ROYALTY </span>CLAUSE of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that
AGREEMENT. Whether LINGNER is or </span>is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

expressly stipulated in the AGREE­MENT that all controversies based on the
AGREEMENT "shall fall under the jurisdiction of Philippine courts".
In other words, there was a covenant on venue to the effect that LINGNER can be
sued by PHILCHEM before Philippine Courts </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">in regards to </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">controversy
related to the AGREEMENT.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">A case should not be
dismissed simply because </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">an
original </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">summons was wrongfully
served. It should </span>be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">difficult
to conceive, for example, that </span>when a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">filed against him should be
