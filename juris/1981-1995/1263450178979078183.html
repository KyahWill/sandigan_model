The confession of appellants, particularly of Mario Salazar and Pedro Naval,
are exonerative in nature as they point to other members of the group as the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Appellants named some
agents who allegedly subjected them to cruel and painful punishment to compel
them to sign the confessions, yet they did not file charges against these
agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They attribute the non-filing of
the suits to their poverty and inability to afford the expenses of litigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is no valid reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have availed of the facilities
being offered by the government to poor litigants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They could have com­plained to the proper
authorities just as Mario Salazar did.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, NBI agents Federico Opinion and <span class="SpellE">Eligio</span>
</span><span class="SpellE">Songco</span> denied the alleged maltreatment of the
appellants.<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellants also failed to submit to physical examination to show the injuries
they allegedly sustained when they were tortured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only Mario Salazar was physically examined by
Dr. Benjamin C. Guerra of the Philippine General Hospital<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
when he complained to Judge <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span> <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>, upon being arraigned on <st1:date year="1971" day="26" month="10">October 26, 1971</st1:date>, that he was abused as a
consequence of which he sustained injuries in various parts of his body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The medical certificate issued by Dr. Guerra
on <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1971</st1:date> showed
that Salazar had contusions on his right shoulder and his left thigh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon an investigation conducted by the NBI,
however, it was shown that said contusions were inflicted by Mario himself with
the aid of another inmate, Reynaldo Francisco.<a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a>
They were found to be fresh wounds inflicted only about four days before, when
the statement allegedly taken by force and intimidation was signed two weeks
before or on <st1:date year="1971" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This belies the claim of appellant Salazar
that his medical certificate stands <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in a face to face confrontation
with witnesses Reynaldo Francisco and <span class="SpellE">Angelico</span> <span class="SpellE">Najar</span>, Mario Salazar broke down and admitted having
inflicted contusions and abrasions on himself with a broken hanger he found
inside the cell and with the help of Reynaldo Francisco.<a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a>
All three of them executed separate sworn statements attesting to the
self-infliction <span style="">by Salazar of the
injuries on himself,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> with a photographic reenactment of the

<p class="BODY">Appellants further contend that their confessions are
inadmissible in evidence because they are filled with inconsistencies, such as,
to which group Mario Salazar was with, with what Mario Salazar and <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Nardong</span></i></span><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Putik</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>were armed, who took the personal
properties of the victims, and who shot the victims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, indeed, contradictions relating to
these matters, but they refer to inconsequential details.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When extra­judicial confessions of two
accused contain inconsistent details, the admissions need not be considered as
in­voluntary.<a style="" href="#_ftn49" name="_ftnref49" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup></span></span></a>
In fact, these inconsistencies could be considered as additional proof that the
confessions are voluntary.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, as
claimed by appellants, these statements were prepared by the NBI agents
themselves and signed by appellants under duress, then, these confessions would
have been as perfectly tight as the agents could have made them to preclude any
possibility of escape from the clutches of the law.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the specific individuals who shot the victims, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Francisco admitted that he, Boy <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ubod</span> did it.<a style="" href="#_ftn50" name="_ftnref50" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup></span></span></a>
Mario Salazar merely declared that <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, Rene and <span class="SpellE">Ubod</span> pointed their guns at the two NBI agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He did not see who shot the agents because he
turned his back.<a style="" href="#_ftn51" name="_ftnref51" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup></span></span></a>
Pedro Naval stated that he saw <span class="SpellE">Maca</span> hit the tall
agent, then successive shots rang out.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He said he saw <span class="SpellE">Maca</span>, <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Nardong</span></i></span><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Putik</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>and the two PC clad men fire at the
agents.<a style="" href="#_ftn52" name="_ftnref52" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup></span></span></a>
As all of them were armed with various kinds of guns, except <span class="SpellE">Restituto</span> Jimenez who carried a <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">balisong</span></i></span><span style="">, </span>confusion <span style="">as </span>to the identity of the triggermen could easily ensue as <span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">Nardong</span></i></span><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Putik</span></span></i><span style=""> </span>did not specify who among them would
execute his order to kill the agents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
should be noted that <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Francisco admitted that
he was one of those who shot the victims and Pedro Naval saw him do it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate, there can be no iota of doubt
that the accused, as a band, acted concertedly in furtherance of the same
criminal intent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their criminal
responsibility as perpetrators of the murder and robbery here prosecuted is
beyond question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to who shot whom
need not be pinpointed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some took a
direct part in the actual commission of the crimes, others cooperated in the
same by their presence and by means of acts without which the crimes would not
have been perpetrated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Those who were
not active participants made no effort to prevent the commission. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>All are, therefore, equally guilty as <span style="">principals irrespective of the individual
participation of each in the felonious act.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn53" name="_ftnref53" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In sum and substance, the
extrajudicial confessions of the accused having been voluntary, and
corroborated </span>as they are with incontrovertible proof of <i>corpus</i> <span class="SpellE"><i>delicti</i></span>, the same are sufficient to support
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact of death of the two
agents was established by the <i>post</i> <i>mortem</i> findings and Court

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Pedro Naval and <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> Francisco aver that they were denied their right to
counsel during custodial interrogation thus infringing Section 20, Article IV
of the 1973 Constitution, which grants for the first time to a person under
investigation for the commission of an offense the right to remain silent and
to counsel, and to be informed of such right, thereby rendering inadmissible as
evidence any confession obtained in vio­lation of such right.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Factually, however, this contention is
inaccurate for the respective Statements</span><a style="" href="#_ftn55" name="_ftnref55" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> will show that before they were taken, the
accused were informed of their right to remain silent and to counsel and the
possibility of the use of their statements in other proceedings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But even if the contrary were true,
considering that the confessions were obtained in 1971, this Court has held
that Sec. 20, Article IV of the 1973 </span>Constitution is prospective in
effect and does not apply to a confession obtained before the ratification of
the New Constitution on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense of alibi, on
which appellants rely, can </span>be given credence only when there is no clear
