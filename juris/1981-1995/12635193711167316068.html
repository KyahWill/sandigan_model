				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In the determination of the basic issue raised in the case at bar
involving the status of some 14 members of private respondent local union
whether they are employees of petitioner company in which case they should be
included in the 30% jurisdictional requirement necessary to support the
petition for certification election, or independent contractors and hence,
excluded <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, Our rulings in <span class="SpellE">Mafinco</span> Trading Corp. vs. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>,
70 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 139, where We reiterated the "control
test" earlier laid down in Investment Planning Corp. vs. Social Security
System, 21 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 924, and in Social Security System
vs. Hon. Court of Appeals and <span class="SpellE">Shriro</span> (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.) Inc., 37 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 579 are
authoritative and controlling.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Mafinco</u></span><u> case</u>, the
Court, through Justice <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, said:</p>

<blockquote>"In a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the issue of whether
respondents are employees or independent contractors should be resolved mainly
in the light of their peddling contracts. - <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><u>Pro <span class="SpellE">hac</span> vice</u>
the issue of whether <span class="SpellE">Repomanta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Moralde</span> were employees of <span class="SpellE">Mafinco</span>
or were independent contractors should be resolved mainly in the light of their
peddling contracts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A different approach
would lead this Court astray into the field of factual controversy where its
legal pronouncements would not rest on solid grounds.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A contract whereby one engages to purchase and sell soft
drinks on trucks supplied by the manufacturer but providing that other party
(peddler) shall have the right to employ his own workers, shall post a bond to
protect the manufacturer against losses, shall be responsible for damages
caused to third persons, shall obtain the necessary licenses and permits and
bear the expenses incurred in the sale of the soft drinks is not a contract of
employment. - We hold that under their peddling contracts <span class="SpellE">Repomanta</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Moralde</span> were not employees of <span class="SpellE">Mafinco</span>
but were independent contractors as found by the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span>
and its <span class="SpellE">factfinder</span> and by <span class="GramE">the</span>
committee appointed by the Secretary of Labor to look into the status of Cosmos
and <span class="SpellE">Mafinco</span> peddlers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were distributors of Cosmos soft drinks with their own capital and
employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily, an employee or a
mere peddler does not execute a formal contract of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is simply hired and he works under the
direction and control of the employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Repomanta</span> and <span class="SpellE">Moralde</span> voluntarily
executed with <span class="SpellE">Mafinco</span> formal peddling contracts which
indicate the manner in which they would sell Cosmos soft drinks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That circumstance signifies that they were
acting as independent businessmen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
were free to sign or not to sign that contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If they did not want to sell Cosmos products under the conditions
defined in that contract, they were free to reject it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But having signed it, they were bound by its
stipulations and the consequences thereof under existing labor laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One such stipulation is the right of the
parties to terminate the contract upon 5 days' prior notice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether the termination in this case was an
unwarranted dismissal of an employee, as contended by <span class="SpellE">Repomanta</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Moralde</span>, is a point that cannot be resolved
without submission of evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Using
the contract itself as the sole criterion, the termination should perforce be
characterized as simply the exercise of a right freely stipulated upon by the
parties.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Tests for determining the existence of
employer-employee relationship.</span> - In determining the existence of
employer-employee relationship, the following elements are generally considered,
namely:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the selection and engagement
of the employee; (2) the payment of wages; (3) the power of dismissal; and (4)
the power to control the employees' conduct - although the latter is the most
important element.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Factors to determine existence of
independent contract relationship.</span> - An independent contractor is one
who exercises independent employment and contracts to do a piece of work according
to his own methods and without being subject to control of his employer except
as to the result of the work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'Among the
factors to be considered are whether the contractor is carrying on an
independent business; whether the work is part of the employer's general
business; the nature and extent of the work; the skill required; the term and
duration of the relationship; the right to assign the performance of the work
to another; the power to terminate the relationship; the existence of a
contract for the performance of a specified piece of work; the control and
supervision of the work; the employer's powers and duties with respect to the
hiring, firing, and payment of the contractor's servants; the control of the
premises; the duty to supply the premises, tools, appliances, material and
labor; and the mode, manner, and terms of payment.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Shriro</u></span><u> case</u>, <span class="GramE">We</span> held that the common law rule of determining the
existence of employer-employee relationship, principally the "control
test", applies in this jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where the element of control is absent; where a person who works for
another does so more or less at his own pleasure and is not subject to definite
hours or conditions of work, and in turn is compensated according to the result
of his efforts and <span class="GramE">not the amount thereof, relationship of
employer and employee does not exist</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">And supplementing the above jurisprudence is Our ruling in Social
Security System vs. The Hon. Court of Appeals, Manila Jockey Club, Inc., Phil.
Racing Club, 30 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 210 wherein the Supreme Court,
speaking through then Associate Justice, now Chief Justice Fernando, held:</p>

<blockquote>"The question of when there is employer-employee relationship
for purposes of the Social Security Act has been settled in this jurisdiction
in the case of Investment Planning Corp. vs. Social Security System, 21 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 924 which applied the so-called control test, that is,
whether the employer controls or has reserved the right to control the employee
not only as to the result of the work to be done but also as to the means and
methods by which the same is to be accomplished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, where the element of control
is absent; whether a person who works for another does so more or less at his
own pleasure and is not subject to definite hours or conditions of work, and in
turn is compensated according to the result of his efforts and not the amount
thereof, we should not find that the relationship of employer and employee
exists.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This decision rejected the
economic facts of the relation test."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeks to reverse the
resolution of the Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations dated January 15,
1980 ordering that a certification election be conducted among the sales
personnel of La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span> Cigar and Cigarette Factory,
as well as his resolution dated November 18, 1980 denying the motion for
reconsideration and directing that a certification election be conducted
immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said resolutions
reversed and set aside the order of dismissal dated <st1:date year="1979" day="29" month="8">August 29, 1979</st1:date> of the Med-Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts show that on <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="4">April 7, 1979</st1:date>, the La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span>
Cigar and Cigarette Factory Provincial (<st1:place>Luzon</st1:place>) and Metro
Manila Sales Force Association (herein referred to as the local union) applied
for and <span class="GramE">was</span> granted chapter status by the National
Association of Trade Unions (hereinafter referred to as <span class="SpellE">NATU</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1979</st1:date>,
some thirty-one (31) local union members signed a joint letter withdrawing
their member­ship from <span class="SpellE">NATU</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, on April 18, 1979, the local union and <span class="SpellE">NATU</span> filed a petition for direct certification or
certification election which alleged among others, that forty-eight of the
sixty sales personnel of the Company were members of the local union; that the
petition is supported by no less than 75% of the sales force; that there is no
existing recognized labor union in the Company representing the said sales
personnel; that there is likewise no existing collective bargaining agreement;
and that there had been no certification election in the last twelve months
preceding the filing of the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Company then filed a motion to dismiss the petition on June
13, 1979 on the ground that it is not supported by at least 30% of the members
of the proposed bargaining unit because (a) of the alleged forty-eight (48)
members of the local union, thirty-one (31) had withdrawn prior to the filing
of the petition; and (b) fourteen (14) of the alleged members of the union were
not employees of the Company but were independent contractors.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">NATU</span> and the local union opposed the
Company's motion to dismiss alleging that the fourteen dealers are actually
employees of the Company because they are subject to its control and
supervision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 29, 1979, the Med-Arbiter issued an order dismissing
the petition for lack of merit as the fourteen dealers who joined the union
should not be counted in determining the 30% consent requirement because they
are not employees but independent contractors and the withdrawal of the 31
salesmen from the union prior to the filing of the petition for certification
election was <span class="SpellE">uncontroverted</span> by the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, on September 24, 1979, the local union on its own
signed only by the local union President, filed a motion for reconsideration
and/or appeal from the order of dismissal on the following grounds:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) the findings of facts of the med-arbiter
as it appears on the order are contrary to facts and (b) in finding that no
employer-employee relationship exists between the alleged dealers and
respondent firm, the med-arbiter decided in a manner not in accord with the
factual circumstances attendant to the relationship.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion for reconsideration/appeal, the Director of
the Bureau of Labor Relations, in the Resolution dated January 15, 1980,
reversed and set aside the order of dismissal, holding that the withdrawal of
the 31 signatories to the petition two days prior to the filing of the instant
petition did not establish the fact that the same was executed freely and
voluntarily and that the records are replete with company documents showing
that the alleged dealers are in fact employees of the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Company then filed a motion to set aside the resolution dated
January 15, 1980 of the Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations, contending
that the appeal was never perfected or is jurisdictionally defective, copy of
the motion for reconsideration/appeal not having been served upon the Company,
and that the Resolution was based solely on the distorted and self-serving
allegations of the union.</p>

<p class="BODY">The local union opposed the Company's Motion for reconsideration
and submitted a memorandum on <st1:date year="1980" day="22" month="4">April
 22, 1980</st1:date> in amplification of its opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, the legal counsel of <span class="SpellE">NATU</span>
filed a manifestation on May 15, 1980 stating that the act of the local union
of engaging another lawyer to handle the case amounts to disaffiliation, for
which reason said legal counsel was withdrawing from the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The local union counter-manifested that the
local union had not been officially notified of its expulsion from the <span class="SpellE">NATU</span>; that there was no valid ground for its expulsion;
that the National Executive Council of <span class="SpellE">NATU</span> had not
approved such expulsion; and that it had no objection to the withdrawal of
Atty. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span>, Jr.
as its counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then <span class="GramE">came</span> a motion of <span class="SpellE">NATU</span> through its President and legal counsel withdrawing as
petitioner and contending that since the local union was no longer affiliated
with it, it was no longer interested in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Twelve members of the National Executive
Council then came in and manifested that they constitute a majority of the
Executive Board of <span class="SpellE">NATU</span> and affirmed that the local
union was still an affiliate of <span class="SpellE">NATU</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">There followed a counter-manifestation of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span>, Jr. on August
27, 1980 stating that six signatories to the aforesaid manifestation had no
authority to make the said foregoing statement as they had resigned from the
Executive Board <u>en</u> <u>masse</u>; that the acts of the President may not
be reversed by <span class="GramE">the<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Executive</span> Council; and that the twelve signatories did not
constitute a majority of the sixty (60) members of the Executive Council.</p>

<p class="BODY">The local union made its reply to the counter-manifestation stating
that the power to expel an affiliate exclusively belonged to the National
Executive Council of <span class="SpellE">NATU</span>, under Section 2, Article V
of the <span class="SpellE">NATU</span> Constitution and By-Laws; that such power
could only be wielded after due investigation and hearing; that disaffiliation
is effected only by voluntary act of the local union, which is not the case
here, because it is the President and legal counsel who are trying to expel the
union.</p>

<p class="BODY">Simultaneously with said reply, the local union filed an
opposition to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lontok's</span> motion to
dismiss/withdraw petition, stating that Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span>
had no more personality to file the same inasmuch as he had previously
withdrawn as counsel in his manifestation dated May 7, 1980, and the local
union has accepted the same in its counter-manifestation dated May 16, 1980;
that expulsion requires two-thirds vote of the members of the National
Executive Council, as well as investigation and hearing; that engaging another
lawyer is not a ground for expulsion of an affiliate; and that the local union
was compelled to hire another lawyer because up to the last day of the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Lontok</span>
still had not filed an appeal from the decision of the Med-Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1980</st1:date>,
the Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations promulgated a resolution denying
the Company's motion for reconsideration and directing that the certification
election be conducted immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the apparently simple task of determining whether the Director
of the Bureau of Labor Relations committed grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of jurisdiction in ordering the direct certification election, three
difficult issues must be resolved, namely:</p>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Arial"><span style="mso-list:Ignore">I.<span style="font:7.0pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

independent contractors.</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the withdrawal of 31 union
members from the <span class="SpellE">NATU</span> affected the petition for
certification election insofar as the thirty per cent requirement is concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->Whether or not the withdrawal of the petition
for certification election by the <span class="SpellE">NATU</span>, through its
President and legal counsel, was valid and effective.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A basic factor underlying the exercise of rights under the Labor
Code is status of employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
question of whether employer-employee relationship exists is a primordial
consideration before extending labor benefits under the workmen's compensation,
social security, <span class="SpellE">medicare</span>, <span class="GramE">termination</span>
pay and labor relations law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
important in the determination of who shall be included in a proposed
bargaining unit because it is the <u>sine qua non</u>, the fundamental and
essential condition that a bargaining unit be composed of employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure to establish this juridical
relationship between the union members and the employer affects the legality of
the union itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It means the
ineligibility of the union members to present a petition for certification
election as well as to vote therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Corollarily</span>, when a petition for certification election is
supported by 48 signatories in a bargaining unit composed of 60 salesmen, but
14 of the 48 lacks employee status, the petition is vitiated thereby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Herein <span class="GramE">lies</span> the
importance of resolving the status of the dealers in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the contention of the company that the dealers in the sale
of its tobacco products are independent con­tractors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, the <st1:place>Union</st1:place>
contends that such dealers are actually employees entitled to the coverage and
benefits of labor relations laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioner, to effectively market its products,
the Company maintains a network of dealers all over the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These arrangements are covered by a
dealership agreement signed between the Company and a dealer in a particular
area or territory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And attached to the
petition is a representative copy of the said dealership agreement which <span class="GramE">We</span> quote below:</p>

<p class="BODY">Following the rule in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Mafinco</u></span><u>
case</u> that in a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the issue of whether
respondents are employees or independent contractors should be resolved mainly
in the light of their peddling contracts, so must We likewise resolve the
status of the 14 members of the local union involved herein mainly on their
dealership agreements for verily, "a different approach would lead this
Court astray into the field of factual controversy where its legal
pronouncements would not rest on solid grounds." We must stress the Supreme
Court is not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of facts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, after considering the terms and stipulations of the
Dealership Contracts which are clear and leave no doubt upon the intention of
the contracting par­ties in establishing the relationship between the dealers on
one hand and the company on the other as that of buyer and seller, We find that
the status thereby created is one of independent <span class="SpellE">contractorship</span>,
pursuant to the first rule in the interpretation of contracts that the literal
meaning of the stipulations shall control.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(Article 1370, New Civil Code)</p>

<p class="BODY">From the plain language of the Dealership Agreement, We find that
the same is premised with the prefatory statement "the factory has
accepted the application of (name of applicant) and therefore has appointed him
as one of its dealers." Its terms and conditions include the
following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that the dealer shall handle
the products in accordance with existing laws and regulations of the government
(par. 1); that the dealer shall send his orders to the factory plant in cash in
any amount or on credit up to the amount of not more than P10,000.00 only at
any given time (par. 2); that the factory shall supply the dealer with a truck
or a panel delivery and all expenses for repairs shall be borne by the factory
(par. 3); and that the dealer shall not receive any commission but shall be
given a discount for all sales and said discount shall be decided by the
factory from time to time (par. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">It also provides that the dealer alone shall be responsible for
any violation of any law (par. 5); that the dealer shall be assigned to a
particular territory which the factory may decide from time to time (par. 6);
that the dealer shall sell the products at the price to be agreed upon between
the parties (par. 7) and that the dealer shall post a surety bond of not less
than P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> to guarantee and secure complete and
faithful performance (par. 8).</p>

<p class="BODY">Either party may terminate the contract without cause by giving
15 days notice in writing; however, in the event of breach or failure to comply
with any of the conditions, the factory may terminate or rescind the contract
immediately (par. 9 and 10).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Dealership Supplementary Agreement reiterates that the
Company "hereby constitute and appoints the DEALER as its authorized
dealer for the sale and distribution of the <span class="SpellE">COMPANY's</span>
products" and "the DEALER hereby accepts such appointment" (par.
1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It also provides that the
geographical area in which the dealer shall undertake his responsibilities is
Greater Manila and Suburbs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the
Company may change or subdivide the territory as the business exigencies and
the policy of the Company will dictate (par. 2).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under said supplementary agreement, the dealer undertakes
to:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) diligently canvass for buyers of
the Company's products; (b) refrain from selling or distributing goods of
similar nature; (c) furnish the Company every 3 months a list of
buyers/customers, specifying their addresses and individual daily supply; (d)
abide by the Company policy, particularly with respect to pricing; (e) keep
account of all his dealings and promptly liquidate his accounts; (f) refrain
from engaging in any activity which will prejudice the Company from withdrawing
cigarettes beyond the maximum volume allotted to him (par. 3).</p>

<p class="BODY">In case of incapacity of the dealer, the Company may designate a
substitute (par. 6).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Company also
reserves the right to determine, from time to time, the amount of credit
granted or to be granted to the dealer (par. 7).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise immediately noticeable that no such words as
"to hire and employ" are present.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Dealer­ship Agreement uses the words "the factory has accepted
the application of (name of applicant) and therefore has appointed him as one
of its dealers"; whereas the Dealership Supplementary Agreement is prefaced
with the statement:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"For and in
consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements made herein, by one to the
other, the COMPANY and the DEALER by these presents, enter into this
Supplementary Agreement whereby the COMPANY will avail of the services of the
DEALER to handle the sale and distribution of the cigarette
products".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing in the terms and
conditions likewise reveals that the dealers were engaged as employees.</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, on the basis of the clear terms of the dealer­ship
agreements, no mention is made of the wages of the dealers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, it specifies that the dealer shall
not receive any commission from the factory but the latter shall give the
dealer a discount for all sales either on consignment or in cash (par. 4).</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the matter of wages, the term "wages" as
defined in Section 2 of the Minimum Wage Law (Rep. Act No. 602) as amended, is
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(g)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>'Wage' paid to any employee shall mean the

<p class="BODY">Respondents, in effect, admit the clarity of the terms and
conditions of the agreements which covenant that the relationship between the dealers
and the Company is one of buyer and seller of La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span>
products, and therefore, one of an independent <span class="SpellE">contractorship</span>
when they claimed that the dealership arrangement as established under the
Dealership Agreement and the Dealership Supplementary Agreement is essentially
a legal cover, cloak or disguise to hide the continuing Employer-Employee relationship
established prior to 1964.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Respondents' Joint Memorandum, p. 34).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Precisely, there was need to change the contract of employment
because of the change of relationship, from an employee to that of an
independent dealer or contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
employees were free to enter into the new status, to sign or not to sign the
new agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Mafinco</u></span><u> case</u>, the respondents therein as in
the instant case, were free to reject the terms of the dealership but having
signed it, they were bound by its stipulations and the consequences thereof
under existing labor laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
the 14 local union members voluntarily executed with La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span>
formal dealership agreements which indicate the distribution and sale of La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span> cigarettes signifies that they were acting as
independent businessmen.</p>

<p class="BODY">We ruled earlier that the terms and stipulations of the
dealership agreement leave no room for doubt that the parties entered into a
transaction for the distribution and sale of La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span>
products whereby the distributor/seller or dealer assumes the status of an
independent con­tractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We note that
the applicant who is appointed dealer "is willing and able to do as such
for the main purpose of extensively <u>selling</u> the products of the FACTORY

<p class="BODY">It is not disputed that under the dealership agree­ment, the
dealer purchases and sells the cigarettes manufactured by the company under and

his order for the purchase of cigarettes to be sold by him in a particular
territory by filling up an Issuance Slip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

approved, a Sales Invoice is then issued to the dealer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the approved Issuance Slip
and the Sales Invoice, the dealer secures the delivery of his order from the
ware­house of the company and upon delivery of the cigarettes from the
warehouse, the dealer has the obligation to pay whether the cigarettes are
disposed or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dealer on his own
account sells the cigarettes in any manner he deems best without constraint as
to time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The dealers do not devote their
full time in selling company products.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are likewise engaged in other livelihood and busi­nesses while
selling cigarettes manufactured by the company.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sales to the dealers are either on cash or credit basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where it is on cash basis, the amount is paid
immediately upon the delivery of the products from the company's
warehouse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is on credit, the
dealer would usually settle his account within one week from the time the
credit is extended to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon payment
of the purchase price, a company official receipt is issued to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents contend that there are essential differences
between the dealership agreement and that in actual practice and operation,
then proceeded to point them in the attempt to prove the control of La <span class="SpellE">Suerte</span> over the sales effort of the dealers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They also contend that the dealership
agreement, as stated earlier, is essentially a legal cover, a cloak or disguise
to hide the continuing employer-employee relationship established prior to
1964.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reject both contentions as being without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, We cannot accept nor consider evidence
varying the terms of the agreement other than the contents of the writing

written consent of the factory being first had and obtained (par. 1); (3) In

cigarettes up to the amount of not more than P10,000.00 only at any given time
during the existence of this contract, unless allowed by the factory to get
more (par. 2); (4) The company shall give the dealer a discount for all
sales...and said discount shall be decided by the factory from time to time
(par. 4); (5) It is however agreed and understood that the company may, from
time to time, upon written notice thereof to the dealer, change or divide the

religiously abide by the company policy, rules and regulations, particularly
with respect to pricing of all products to be sold and distributed by him (par.
3, sub-par. (d), Annex 10); (7) The dealer shall put up a bond or additional
bond with the company in such amounts as in the judgment of the company may be
satisfactory (par. 5, Annex 10); (8) In the event that the dealer should become
incapacitated for any reason whatsoever, the factory may designate for the
duration of said incapacity a substitute to handle the sale and distribution of
the products in the territory (par. 6, Annex 10); (9) The company reserves the
right to determine, from time to time, the amount of credit granted or to be
granted the dealer (par. 7, Annex 10); (10) This agreement may be cancelled
and/or terminated by the company should the dealer violate its undertaking

<p class="BODY">On the second issue - whether or not the withdrawal of 31 union
members from <span class="SpellE">NATU</span> affected the petition for
certification election insofar as the 30% requirement is concerned, We reverse
the Order of the respondent Director of the Bureau of Labor Relations, it
appearing <span class="SpellE">undisputably</span> that the 31 union members had
withdrawn their support to the petition before the filing of said
petition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would be otherwise if the
withdrawal was made after the filing of the petition for it would then be
presumed that the withdrawal was not free and voluntary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption would arise that the
withdrawal was procured through duress, coercion or for valuable consideration.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the distinction must be that
withdrawals made before the filing of the petition are presumed voluntary
unless there is convincing proof to the contrary, whereas withdrawals made
after the filing of the petition are deemed involuntary.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason for such distinction is that if the with­drawal or
retraction is made before the filing of the petition, the names of employees
supporting the petition are supposed to be held secret to the opposite
party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Logically, any such withdrawal or
retraction shows <span class="SpellE">voluntariness</span> in the absence of
proof to the contrary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it
becomes apparent that such employees had not given consent to the filing of the
<span class="GramE">petition,</span> hence the subscription requirement has not
been met.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the withdrawal or retraction is made after the petition is
filed, the employees who are supporting the petition become known to the
opposite party since their names are attached to the petition at the time of
filing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, it would not be
unexpected that the opposite party would use foul means for the subject
employees to withdraw their support.</p>

<p class="BODY">In recapitulation, <span class="GramE">We</span> hold and rule that
the 14 members of respondent local union are dealers or independ­ent
contractors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are not employees of <span class="GramE">petitioner company</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>With the withdrawal by 31 members of their support to the petition prior
to or before the filing thereof, making a total of 45, the remainder of 3 out
of the 48 alleged to have supported the petition can hardly be said to
represent the union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the
dismissal of the petition by the Med-Arbiter was correct and justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Director committed grave abuse of
discretion in reversing the order of the Med-Arbiter.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the above pronouncements, the resolution of the third issue
raised herein is unnecessary.</p>
