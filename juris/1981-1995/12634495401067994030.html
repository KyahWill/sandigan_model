				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner in this <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition proceeding
filed on <st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="6">June 20, 1980</st1:date>
against respondent Commission on Elections, sought to enjoin the enforce­ment
of its resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It reads as follows: "It appearing that
the Municipal Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Lumba</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayabao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span> has canvassed the election returns and tabulated the
votes obtained by the candidates, except election returns which has been
excluded, and in order not to deprive the municipality of the services of its
elective muni­cipal officials, the Commission [resolved] as it hereby resolves,
to order the Municipal Board of <span style="">Canvassers
to immediately convene and temporarily proclaim, after due notice, the winning
mayoralty candidate of <span class="SpellE">Lumba</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayabao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, pursuant to
Resolution No. 9434, as amended by Resolution No. 9440, of this Commission,
without prejudice to the final outcome of the said cases."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Mohamad</span> Lamping <span class="SpellE">Mitmug</span> must have had the impression that if such resolution
be implemented his opponent, respondent <span class="SpellE">Mangayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Daga­langit</span> would be proclaimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue raised, there­fore, is the validity
of allowing a temporary procla­mation, prior to the canvassing being
completed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission on
Elections was then looking into charges and countercharges of alleged anomalies
by both candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the restraining order
issued on <st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1980</st1:date>, it
was specifically stated that respondent <span class="SpellE">Mangayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Dagalangit</span> should "DESIST from assuming, discharging
or performing the functions or duties of Municipal Mayor and to further claim
and receive salaries <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As early as <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1980</st1:date>,
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Mangayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Dagalangit</span>
filed his comment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter on <st1:date year="1980" day="18" month="8">August <span style="">18,
 </span>1980</st1:date>, the comment of respondent Commission on Elections was
filed through Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Then on <st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1980</st1:date>
there was a reply to comment by petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All of those comments were noted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently on January 13, 1981 there was a manifestation filed by
respondent Commission on Elections to the effect that: <span style="">"Inasmuch as the Court's restraining Order of June 26, 1980 did
not restrain the enforcement of </span>COMELEC <span style="">Resolution No. 9759 dated May 7, 1980, the fingerprint division of </span>COMELEC
<span style="">proceeded with the examination and
analysis of fingerprints and signatures on the records of voting and the books
of voters specified in the said </span>COMELEC <span style="">Resolution of May 7, 1981, and has now submitted its report on the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, COMELEC issued an order dated
January 8, 1981 setting the pre-proclamation cases for hearing on January 19,
1981 at 10:00 o'clock in the morning, . . . ."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The latest pleading, received on March 19, 1981, is a
manifestation submitted directly to the Supreme Court by respondent Commission:
"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the new Municipal Board of
Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Lumba</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayabao</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>, as duly
constituted pursuant to the herein respondent's Resolution No. 81-01, dated
March 3, 1981, convened and canvassed the votes of candidates for Mayor of said
municipality, on March 14, 1981, at 10:00 o'clock in the morning, in the
Session Hall of the Commission on Elections, <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>,
Manila; and 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That after the aforesaid
canvass, the results showed that the votes obtained by the three (3) candi­dates
for Mayor are as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(1) <span class="SpellE">Mangayao</span> <span class="SpellE">Dagalangit</span> - 2,376 votes
(2) <span class="SpellE">Mohamad</span> Lamping <span class="SpellE">Mitmug</span>
- 1,432 votes (3) <span class="SpellE">Bambai</span> <span class="SpellE">Dagalangit</span>
- 54 votes and, thereafter, the same board of canvassers proclaimed <span class="SpellE">Mangayao</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Dagalangit</span>, one of
the respondents in this case, as the duly elected Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Lumba</span>
<span class="SpellE">Bayabao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It likewise enclosed copies of the certificate of canvass of the votes cast and
proclamation of the winning candidates; statement of canvass and statement of
votes by voting center.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is thus clear that the objective of the petitioner is to
prevent a temporary proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With
the canvassing completed, and the proclamation made, private respondent
emerging as the victor with the right reserved to petitioner to file his corre­sponding
election protest, this case has become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, this mode of disposing the case is in accordance with
the invariable principle followed by this Court given its formulation as to
disquali­fication controversies in <span class="SpellE">Aguinaldo</span> v. <span style="">Commission </span>o<span style="">n</span> Elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
It is equally applicable to petitions raising questions more appropriately
decided in an election protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By
virtue thereof, proceedings filed with us after January 30, 1980 are dismissed,
without prejudice to having the issues <span style="">passed
upon in </span>the appropriate contests before the proper agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The time that had elapsed since the 1980
election emphasizes the validity and wisdom of such an approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is even more appropriate here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An election protest should settle the matter
conclusively once and for all, instead of the parties being caught in the
procedural meshes of a pre-proclamation controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this petition is dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This decision is immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
temporary restraining order issued on June 26, 1980 is lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
