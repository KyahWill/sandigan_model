erred in finding that the accused were guilty beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants-appellants, in primarily averring that they were
framed up, relate their version of the facts of the case as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“That on August 1985, he (<span class="SpellE">Agayas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vocente</span>) was presently employed as a gardener in <span class="SpellE">Natubleng</span>, <span class="SpellE">Buguias</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, which is about 52 kilometers away from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Baguio</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That on August 29,

taking a bus going to <span class="SpellE">Sagpat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Kibungan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, his residence because of an information that
his wife has just delivered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He failed,
however, to get a ride for home because the last bus already left as it was
already <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, he decided to visit Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span>, his co?accused, who was then employed as
assistant cook at the Provincial Restaurant, located at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he was there, two (2) visitors of
Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span> arrived and then they invited them
to go for a drink at the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Canteen which is
about 80 meters away from the Provincial Restaurant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That when they were going up to the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span>
Terminal, one of the visitors who was later identified by Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span> and corroborated by Domingo <span class="SpellE">Lagawas</span>
as a certain <span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span>,
an alleged NARCOM informer, handed to the accused <span class="SpellE">Agayas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vocente</span> one red knapsack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span> told the accused to proceed to <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span>
Canteen informing them that he will join them later as he was going to see
somebody on the other corner leading towards <span class="SpellE">Acop</span> <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> station near the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span>
Canteen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“That when they were about 10 minutes drinking (sic) at the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Canteen, <span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span> arrived and ordered beer then immediately <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> agents frisked <span class="GramE">them,</span>
handcuffed them and took the red knapsack placed on top of the table.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were brought to <span class="SpellE">Trancoville</span>,

 <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:city></st1:address> City, the
sub-office of the NARCOM, and there they were mauled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he (<span class="SpellE">Agayas</span> <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span>) was asked by <span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span> to go with them to KM 3, La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, where <span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span> retrieved 1 carton on the basement of the building,
which when opened at the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> sub-station contained
marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, dated July 29, 1986)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>“Taking the witness stand,
the accused Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span> corroborated the
testimony of the accused <span class="SpellE">Agayas</span> <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span>
on the color of the pack seized by the arresting officers, the manner they were
arrested at <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Canteen and the mauling
incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He denied having been in
possession of two (2) stalks of marijuana, and in fact he claimed that his
jacket was not returned by the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> and that his
P10.00 was not returned by the arresting officers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, dated March 2, 1987)</blockquote>

the cook of the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Canteen, affirmed the
testimony of the accused that the knapsack seized by the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span>
placed on top of the table of the accused was a red knapsack and not a mere
plastic bag as claimed by the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, dated August 5, 1986, pp. 1-7)</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Domingo <span class="SpellE">Lagawad’s</span> testimony corroborated
the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Agayas</span> <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span>
that the owner of the carton taken at KM 3, La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Benguet</span></span> belongs to a certain <span class="SpellE">Lito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span>, who is known to them (sic) (TSN, dated,
August 5, 1986, pp. 8-15).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Julio <span class="SpellE">Liw-<span class="GramE">an’s</span></span>
testimony confirms the fact that at the time of the arrest of Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span>, he was employed at the Provincial Restaurant as
assistant cook.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That it was his off-duty
when he was arrested.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Busoy</span> <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span>, brother of accused, <span class="SpellE">Agayas</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vocente</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Lucio</span> <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span>, brother of the accused, Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span>, claimed that after the arrest of their brothers,
when they went to the <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span> sub-station at <span class="SpellE">Trancoville</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, a <span class="SpellE">Narcom</span>
agent told them that the case of their brothers can be fixed at a fee of P15<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That since
the case is already <span class="GramE">filed,</span> the arresting officers’
remedy is not to testify during the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">That they did not give the money but requested for
three (3) extensions of time from September 1985 up to November 1985.</span></blockquote>

agents testified in court in December 1986 when the negotiation failed.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, dated October 8, 1986, pp. 6-22)” (At

Command, AFP substation at <span class="SpellE">Trancoville</span>, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City from a so-called coordinating individual (CI)
in the early afternoon of August 29, 1985 that dried marijuana leaves were
being offered to him for sale, commanding officer Capt. <span class="SpellE">Manzano</span>
devised an entrapment plan against the reported pushers (pp. 2-3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., December 9, 1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He designated three NARCOM agents:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

priced the<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>marijuana dried leaves at
P600.00 per kilo, to which <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> agreed and
thereupon ordered a kilo of said stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was also agreed that they would meet shortly afterwards at the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Bus Terminal Canteen where delivery and payment
would be made (p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Dec. 9, 1985).</blockquote>

and Logan occupying another table nearby and they all waited for the pushers
(p. 6, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Dec. 9, 1985).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span> and <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span>
entered the canteen, the latter handed to <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>
the aquamarine plastic bag he was carrying, saying it contained one kilo of
dried marijuana leaves (p. 7, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Jan. 6,
1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>.
<span class="SpellE">Fider</span> and Logan sprang up to the pushers, identified
themselves as NARCOM agents and placed <span class="SpellE">Agayas</span> <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span> and Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Salbino</span>
under arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both pushers were frisked
and the back right pocket of <span class="SpellE">Salbino’s</span> pants yielded
2 stalks of marijuana dried leaves weighing about 5 grams (pp. 7, 8, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., id.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asked if
they had some more of the stuff, <span class="SpellE">Agayas</span> <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span> revealed he has two (2) kilos more stashed in a
certain residence at km. 3, La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> (p.
9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., Dec. 9, 1985).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lawmen and the appellants proceeded to
the place indicated and <span class="SpellE">Vocente</span> retrieved from
underneath a house, a carton box (Exhibit C-3) marked “Hotcake and Waffle Magic
Mix” containing approximately 2 kilos of dried marijuana flowering tops (C-C-1,
C-2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These were also seized by the
agents (p. 10, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., id.)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A Joint Affidavit narrating the circumstances
of the arrest of appellants was executed by the NARCOM agents (p. 177, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defendants-appellants anchor their prayer for a verdict of
acquittal on the following allegations:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(a) that <span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span>
who was the coordinating individual who helped the NARCOM agents in framing up
the accused-appellants for personal gain was never presented in court; (b) that
<span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span> was the real
owner of the red knapsack wherein the seized marijuana was kept and the cook of
the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Bus Canteen testified that it was a red
knapsack, not a plastic bag that he saw the NARCOM agents seize; and (c) that
the undue delay in the trial of the case against the accused-appellants was
intended to allow the NARCOM agents to extort money from the two brothers of
the defendants-appellants in exchange for “fixing” the latter’s case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only plausible defense of the accused-appellants was that
their arrest was a product of a frame-up, a defense which persons similarly
charged, more often than not, regard as their last stronghold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Like alibi, it is a weak defense that is easy
to concoct but difficult to prove (People v. <span class="SpellE">Edgardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Estevan</span> y <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span>, G.R. No.
69676, June 4, 1990; People v. Dante Marcos y <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>,

y <span class="SpellE">Asag</span>, G.R. No. 84392, February 7, 1990) In the
instant case, the defendants-appellants failed to convincingly show any ill
motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to falsely testify against the
defendants-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PC Sgt. Samuel <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> who posed as the marijuana buyer, Sgt. Glenn
Logan, one of the two PC soldiers who lent support to the entrapment plan
against the defendants-appellants and Carlos Figueroa, the forensic-chemist who
reported as positive for marijuana the specimen confiscated from the
defendants-appellants and given to him for examination, all of these witnesses
enjoy the presumption of regularity in the performance of their duties so that
the burden of overturning the said presumption lies on the defendants-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter failed to prove their claim that
they were framed-up by the arresting officers for personal gain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="GramE">see</span> People v. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Alfonso y <span class="SpellE">Cawading</span>, G.R.

observation made by the trial court that:</p>

<blockquote>“Significantly, too, the accused did not frontally deny the
prosecution evidence that <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> and the civilian
informer first met with the accused at the <span class="SpellE">Pitstop</span>
Pub House where <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> was introduced by the
informer to the accused as an interested marijuana buyer and thereafter, the
accused quoted the price of P600.00 a kilo and <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>,
in turn, ordered one kilo of the stuff which the accused undertook to deliver,
as they in fact delivered, at the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> bus
Canteen.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">accused’s</span>
denial is merely inferential, if at all, considering that they adverted to a
meeting at another establishment, namely, the Provincial Restaurant, and that
this meeting was between the accused and a certain <span class="SpellE">Lito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span> and the latter’s unidentified companion,
before they went to the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Bus Canteen to drink
beer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a tangential denial cannot
overcome the force of the positive and unequivocal declaration of the State
witnesses.” (At pp. 29-30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the informer, <span class="SpellE">Lito</span> <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span>, was never presented in court by the prosecution is
of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His testimony, if it were
given, would at best be corroborative or cumulative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, his non?presentation is not
fatal to the prosecution’s case as recently reiterated in the case of <u>People</u>
<u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Tangliben</u></span> <u>y</u> <u>Bernardino</u>
(G.R. No. 63630, April 6, 1990).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, if the defense was really convinced that the alleged red
knapsack which contained the seized marijuana belonged to <span class="SpellE">Lito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span>, it could have taken steps to avail of <span class="SpellE">Ognasy’s</span> presence in court by compulsory process (People v.
Said <span class="SpellE">Sariol</span> y <span class="SpellE">Muhamading</span>,
G.R. No. 83809, June 22, 1989 citing People v. <span class="SpellE">Boholst</span>,
152 SCRA 263 [1987]).</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court’s finding that in the attempt to
prove their innocence, the defendants-appellants tried to distort the real
scenario of the crime by counter-alleging that it was a red knapsack and not an
aquamarine or green plastic bag that contained the marijuana in question and
that the real owner of the said knapsack was <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span>
and not either of them “in the hope that the murkier it becomes their guilt
would be more difficult to discern.” Considering that the defendants-appellants
were both caught red-handed while handing the prohibited drug aforementioned to
Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span> for purposes of sale and that the
prosecution’s witnesses gave positive testimonies relating to the said
incident, we are constrained to affirm the lower court’s judgment of
conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears noting, however,
that under the circumstances of the present case, there was already a perfected
contract of sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the <span class="SpellE">Pitstop</span> Pub House where Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Fontanilla</span>,
acting as poseur-buyer was introduced by <span class="SpellE">Ognasy</span> to
the defendants-appellants, there was already an agreement to sell one kilo of
marijuana at the agreed price of P600.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the <span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span> Bus Canteen, what was left was
the obligation of both parties to deliver their respective parts in the
perfected contract of sale the poseur-buyer, the payment and the
accused-appellants, the marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, there was more than just an <u>attempt</u> to sell which connotes
that the other party to whom the said offer to sell was made did not agree to
accept the offer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we have held in the
case of <u>People</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Ramon</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Macuto</u></span>,
G.R. No. 80112, promulgated on <st1:date year="1989" day="25" month="8">August
 25, 1989</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>“The commission of the offense of illegal sale of marijuana
requires merely the consummation of the selling transaction whereby as in this <span class="GramE">case,</span> the accused handed over the tea bag of marijuana <u>upon</u>
<u>the</u> <u>agreement</u> with the poseur buyer to exchange it for
money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="GramE">What</span> is important is the fact
that the poseur-buyer received the marijuana from the appellant and that the
contents were presented as evidence in court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Proof of the transaction suffices.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The identity of the tea bag of marijuana which constitutes the corpus <span class="SpellE">delicti</span> was established before the court.” (Underlining

<p class="BODY">Considering that the Dangerous Drugs Act provides the same
penalty not only for selling and attempting to sell but also for distributing
or delivering, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the lower
court’s decision is not affected.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the contention that the delay in the trial proceedings
of the instant case was for extortion purposes, we find the claim
unsubstantiated by the evidence on the record.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">IN VIEW
OF THE FOREGOING,</b> the judgment appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED in all its
parts. </p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
