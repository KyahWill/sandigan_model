<p class="BODY">The ten-year prescriptive period fixed in Article 1144 of the
Civil Code may not be invoked by the petitioners for the Civil Code is a law of
general application, while the prescriptive period fixed in Article 292 of the
Labor Code (now Art. 291) is a special law applicable to claims arising from
employer-employee relations (De <span class="SpellE">Joya</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, 19 SCRA 893; <span class="SpellE">Lagman</span> vs.
City of Manila, 17 SCRA 579; Philippine Trust Co. vs. <span class="SpellE">Macuan</span>,
54 Phil. 655).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no discrimination in the exclusion of the twenty-five
(25) faculty members (who dropped out) from the benefits awarded to the
petitioners in the decision dated <st1:date year="1983" day="15" month="6">June
 15, 1983</st1:date>. Their exclusion fully accords with the prayer of their
motion to dismiss that they be excluded as plaintiffs in the case. It may be
assumed that they had good and valid reasons for filing that pleading. Why
counsel for the petitioners insists on bringing them in when they want to be
left out, is, to <span class="GramE">Our</span> mind, a case of "being more
popish than the pope."</p>
