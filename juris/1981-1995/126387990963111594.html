convicted in Criminal Case No. 22478, entitled, "People vs. <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Osias</span> y. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, et al.", of the Regional Trial Court (RTC)
Branch 124, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, he submits that the trial
court committed a reversible error in finding him guilty beyond reasonable

</span>He claims that the trial court failed to consider the attendant
circumstances, to wit:</p>

<p class="2Q">I.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Durana's</span> testimony is weak and full of inconsistencies

<p class="2Q">II.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> is a paid witness, as such his testimony should not

<p class="2Q">III.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> has not positively identified appellant as one of

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">He argues that if the foregoing
circumstances are taken either singly or collectively, reasonable doubt of his
guilt would be created.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, his
defense of alibi would be brought to sharper focus.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In either case, he should be then absolved of
the accusation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case had its beginnings at <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10
 o'clock</st1:time> in the morning of <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="4">April
 25, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Romeo <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span> y de la Cruz was riding an easy rider
butterfly-type bicycle along <st1:street><st1:address>J.P. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>

when suddenly, accused Fernando Sanchez y de la Cruz, nicknamed
"Dodo," appeared and tried to grab the bicycle from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Romeo fell but stood up immediately to
prevent his assailant from getting his bicycle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While the two were grappling, the other accused and sole appellant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Osias</span> y <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>, nicknamed "<span class="SpellE">Benjie</span>,"
who was positioned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span>the back
of Romeo, stabbed the latter on the left side of the neck "by making a
sway of his right hand upward going downward" with a 6-inch double-bladed
knife.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gaining possession of the bicycle, Dodo and <span class="SpellE">Benjie</span>
carried it with them as they ran in the direction of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Romeo walked towards the <st1:place><st1:placename>Martinez</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> which was about ten meters
away, but collapsed near the gate of the said hospital.</p>

<p class="BODY">The incident was seen by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>,
the sole eyewitness presented by the prosecution, who was standing in front of<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><st1:city><st1:place>St. Joseph</st1:place></st1:city>'s
Pharmacy on the other side of <st1:street><st1:address>J.P. <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, which was about six meters away from the
scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had just come out
of the pharmacy where he bought a drug called <span class="SpellE">prosteclin</span>;
from where he stood he had a full view of the stabbing incident as there was no
motor vehicle that passed by at that particular time when it happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">Romeo <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>, who sustained one
wound, died at 10:30 in the morning of April 25, 1984 from shock, traumatic,
due to "a stab wound at the right side of the neck, measuring 5 x 3.5 x 12
cm. deep, lacerating the right jugular vessel, trachea, and the left
lung."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">It was only on <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="1">January 1,
 1987</st1:date> that the appellant was arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His co-accused, Fernando Sanchez y de la

show.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1987</st1:date>,

Thereafter, trial was commenced by Judge <span class="SpellE">Cancio</span> C.
Garcia, now Justice of the Court of Appeals, who heard the testimonies of the
witnesses for both the prosecution and the defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judge Garcia, however, was replaced by Judge
Rene <span class="SpellE">Victorino</span> who penned the decision, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<p class="2Q">IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, this Court finds the accused VIRGILIO <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">OSIAS </span>y MALLARI guilty beyond

amended, and hereby sentences him to suffer imprisonment of Reclusion <span class="SpellE">Perpetua</span>; to indemnify the heirs of the victim in the
amount of P30,000.00 as consequential damages; to return the bicycle,
subject-matter of the robbery, and if unable to do so, to pay the value thereof
in the amount of P1,000.00, to the legal heirs of the victim and to pay the

<p class="BODY">The appellant narrated at the trial that on <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1984</st1:date>, he was with his sisters,
Patricia, <span class="SpellE">Metring</span>, and Paring, at the family

</span>He stayed home the rest of the day.</p>

<p class="BODY">Luisa <span class="SpellE">Osias</span>, a sister of the appellant,
substantially corroborated her brother's testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this review, we shall resolve the errors allegedly committed
by the trial court in the order enumerated above.</p>

<p class="BODY">I.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Durana's</span> testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is
</span>weak and full of inconsistencies, thereby making his testimony not
credible.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant claims that inasmuch as <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>
reported the alleged stabbing incident to the police authorities only <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">six </span>(6) days later--i.e. on May 3, 1984
when he gave a sworn statement to the <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City
police--and testified only upon the insistence of the father of the victim who
is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span>neighbor and a family
friend, the crime imputed against the appellant is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">a </span>fabricated one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this
reason, <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> should not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">be </span>relied upon at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">all, </span>the
appellant contends.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no correlation between the credibility of a witness and
his belated reporting to the authorities of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">a crime </span>he had witnessed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, we see nothing wrong in the <span class="SpellE">behaviour</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">a </span>matter of fact he immediately informed
the relatives of the victim of the stabbing incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
The initial reluctance of an eyewitness to a crime to come to the open and get
himself involved in a criminal investigation and prosecution is common and
understandable, and has been judicially declared as not affecting credibility.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> explained satisfactorily that he
waited <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">until </span>after the burial of
the victim before reporting the incident to the authorities.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Per se <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>witness
who is a neighbor and a family friend of the victim does not inescapably make
one a biased witness unworthy of belief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In order to be denigrated as such, there must be extant other factors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For example, motive must be established why
the witness falsely testified against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Or the witness has a special interest in the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this case, the evidence confirms the absence of motive or special
interest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the appellant does
not know of any reason why <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> testified against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, the appellant submits that <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>
should not be believed at all, especially in his detailed description of the
milieu of the incident, where, in the words of the appellant, "everything
seemed to be suspended in time and motion, the busy street gave way to allow <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> to vividly witness the commission of the heinous
act."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
We do not agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other than this bare
assertion, the appellant did not present any evidence demonstrating that the
milieu at the time of the incident was otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>
is categorical and unwavering in his positive eyewitness testimony.</p>

your line of vision of your eyes was obstructed by the passing transportation

<p class="BODY">We are convinced that the detailed narration of <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> on the milieu of the crime attests to the clarity of
his observation and the truthfulness of his account.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another alleged inconsistency in the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> is his account of seeing the appellant standing at
the back of the victim and stabbing him only once with a six-inch long
double-bladed knife at the left side of the neck by swaying his right hand upward
then downward,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
as against the victim still able to negotiate the 10-meter distance to the
Martinez Hospital.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The appellant contends that the physical evidence revealed that the victim
sustained one stab wound on the right side of the neck<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

and that according to Dr. <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> Lucero, the
physician at the Martinez Hospital who had attended to the victim, the
assailant was facing the victim with a knife, stabbed him on the neck, and put
the knife downward,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">We are not impressed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
consider such contradictions minor and collateral and as such do not impair the
credibility of <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We subscribe to the observations of the
Solicitor General that it is understandable if the witness <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">is </span>unable to pinpoint exactly where
the fatal blow was inflicted, whether on the right or left side of the neck,
and not know the relative positions of the malefactors with respect <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>the victim, considering that the
assailants and the victim were grappling for the possession of the bicycle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">and </span>were therefore in constant motion
and changing positions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

obvious reason:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Durana</span>

is a paid witness, as such his testimony should not be believed.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant capitalizes on the admission of the father of the
victim, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>, that he gave <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> P25.00 each day he appeared in court to testify,
which could have amounted to P1,000.00,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">While we held in a case<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
that the witness, by receiving money from the complainant, morally becomes beholden
to the giver, this generalization, nevertheless, must be viewed in its proper
perspective.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By itself, this giving of
money to the witness does not compel outright dismissal of his testimony as
incredible or manufactured.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, it
should be considered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span>one of
the factors in evaluating its probative value.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, we believe such admission is an <span class="SpellE">indicium</span>
of the truthfulness of the version of the prosecution regarding the killing and
robbery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">While </span>the father of the victim could have denied outright having
given the witness money, he nonetheless admitted it with frankness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And the money received by <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>,
as pointed out by the Solicitor General, was relatively meager.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor was it shown by the appellant that
without said amount the witness would not have testified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In People v. Rafael <span class="SpellE">Lacson</span>,
et al., decided in 1961,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
in which it was charged by the appellants that the prosecution witnesses were
being supported during the trial by political enemies of the accused, the Court
held that assuming that to be true, it was no evidence that for such trifling <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">sums </span>the witnesses would agree to
perjure themselves and falsely charge the appellants of a capital offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
We here uphold this doctrine.</p>

<p class="BODY">III.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> has not positively identified the appellant as one
of the perpetrators of the criminal act.</p>

<p class="BODY">To underscore this contention, the defense cited the declaration
of <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> that he only met the appellant twice in his
life.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first one occurred at the
stabbing and robbery incident he witnessed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the second time happened on <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="10">October
 28, 1987</st1:date> when he testified at the trial of this case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
Yet <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> in his statement before the <span class="SpellE">Kalookan</span> City Police Station on <st1:date year="1987" day="1" month="5">May 1, 1987</st1:date> stated that the appellant was the
person who stabbed the victim, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Cuaderno</span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
This knowledge, it is argued, is based on the hearsay information <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> acquired from <span class="SpellE">Bonie</span>, the
brother of Dodo (co-accused Fernando Sanchez y <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz), who is the witness' friend, that it was <span class="SpellE">Benjie</span>
(appellant <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Osias</span> y
<span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>) who was Dodo's companion at the time of the
incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, his supposed positive identification as one of the perpetrators of the
criminal act is a pure conjecture, the appellant concludes.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is only half the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is true that <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> testified that he only
met the appellant twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is, on <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="4">April 25, 1984</st1:date>, at the incident he
witnessed, and on <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="10">October 28, 1987</st1:date>,
when he testified in the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> likewise declared that he already
knew the appellant while still <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">at </span><st1:street><st1:address>9th
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This apparent contradiction will come into light when viewed from
the perspective of the entire testimony of <span class="SpellE">Durana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span>
questions propounded by Judge <span class="SpellE">Cancio</span> upon <span class="SpellE">Durana</span> did seem to exact a heavy toll on <span class="SpellE">Durana's</span> answers, as note the following excerpt from the
