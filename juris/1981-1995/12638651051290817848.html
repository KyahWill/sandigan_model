				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue seeks a review of the
decision dated February 2, 1988 of the Court of Tax Appeals (CTA) in CTA Case
No. 2991 entitled, "Manila Hotel Corporation vs. Commissioner of Internal
Revenue" ordering the Commissioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"to
</span>refund to the Manila Hotel Corporation the caterer's tax paid in the
total amount of P2<span class="GramE">,463,576.30</span> without interest"
(p. 39, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Manila Hotel Corporation ("Hotel" for
brevity) operates the Manila Hotel and the service and banquet outlets therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During the period from <st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1977</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1978</st1:date>, it paid to the petitioner the total sum of
P2<span class="GramE">,463,576.30</span> as caterer's tax on the gross receipts
from the sale of food in its restaurants.</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 18, 1978, the Hotel filed a claim for refund of that
amount on the ground that Section 191-A of the National Internal Revenue Code
which was the basis for the assessment and collection of the caterer's tax
against it never became a law because Section 42 of House Bill 17839 (later
R.A. 6110), which inserted in the Tax Code a new Section 191-A imposing a
caterer's tax of 3% on the gross receipts of restaurant operators, was
allegedly vetoed by President Marcos on August 4, 1969.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commissioner of Internal Revenue failed to act on the
petitioner's claim for refund.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1979</st1:date>, before the claim
had prescribed, the Manila Hotel Corporation filed CTA Case No. 2991.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1979</st1:date>,
the Hotel received a letter dated <st1:date year="1979" day="11" month="1">January
 11, 1979</st1:date> from the Commissioner of Internal Revenue denying its claim
for refund.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="2" month="2">February 2, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court of Tax Appeals rendered the assailed decision in favor of the
Hotel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found that Congress has not
taken any s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tep </span>to override the
presidential veto of the proposed Section 191-A of the National Internal Revenue
Code, hence, Section 191-A did not become a law; there was no legal basis for
collecting the caterer's tax.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner, on the
other hand, alleged that the CTA failed to consider the then current and
subsequent legislations on the caterer's tax.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We have carefully
