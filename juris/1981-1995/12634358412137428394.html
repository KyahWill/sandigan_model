				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The complaining witness was at the time of the alleged rape a 25-year
old mother of three children and five months pregnant.  The accused-appellant is her uncle by
affinity.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Alda Malima Patong, the incident happened at her own
house in Jimenez, Misamis Occidental, at about <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">8 o'clock in the evening </span>of March 22, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cervando Patong had earlier that afternoon arrived from Siquijor
and visited her husband Joseph Patong, who is his nephew.  With three other friends, they drank a
gallon of <b>tuba</b> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">until 5 p.m.,
when Cervando and the other guests left.  Thereafter, following his daily routine, her husband went out to fish.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">She said that later that
night, Cervando returned to their house and asked if he could spend the night
there.  As he was a relative, she said
he could and invited him in.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">She and the children were sleeping in the sala, so she spread a
mat with a pillow and blanket for Cervando in the dining room.  Only a curtain served as a divider between
the two rooms.</p>

<p class="BODY">Returning to the sala, she saw Cervando blow out the kerosene
lamp in the dining room and supposed he would be going to sleep.  She was surprised and incensed, however,
when he crossed over to the sala and asked her to lie with him.</p>

<p class="BODY">She angrily rejected his suggestion, but he pointed a knife at
her stomach and snuffed out the other lamp.  The suggestion was now a demand.  He dragged her to the dining room.  Then he forcibly laid her on the mat and pulled off her panty, all the
while threatening her with the knife.</p>

<p class="BODY">His lust insisted even harder as he kissed and sucked her
mouth.  Alda struggled and pleaded with
him, but to no avail.  Soon the ugly
deed was done.  He ejaculated into
her.  Apparently not yet sated, he
continued feeling her body <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">even as she </span>still
resisted and cried.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally releasing her, he insolently told her he would call her
if he needed her again.  Then he went to
sleep.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 10 o'clock, when she heard Cervando snoring, Alda
sneaked out of the house with her youngest child and went to the house of her
neighbors, Victor and Nenet Sagang, about ten meters away.  She told them she had been raped by
Cervando.</p>

<p class="BODY">The spouses were immediately helpful.  They notified Oscar Paye and Peter Junio, barangay councilors,
and Francisco Patong, Alda's father-in-law.  Junio reported the matter to the police and Patrolmen Lou de la Vega,
Romero Bomediano, Pablito Paredes and Amado Camposano came to investigate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alda and her neighbors surrounded her house in case their quarry
should attempt to escape.  When the
policemen arrived, they went in and saw Cervando still asleep with the knife
near his head.  They got the knife and
then roused him.  He did not resist when
they handcuffed him.  Asked if he was
the person who had attacked Alda, he said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">nothing.  Alda positively identified him </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">her assailant but he remained silent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The following morning, Alda submitted to medical examination,
resulting in the finding that the vaginal smear was "positive of sperm
cells."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
She thereafter filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a criminal </span>complaint
for rape that became the basis of the information against Cervando.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other witnesses for the prosecution were Victor Sagang, Oscar
Paye, Romero Bomediano, Peter Junio, and Lou de la Vega, who all corroborated
Alda.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his defense, Cervando submitted an improbable tale.  He averred that what happened that night was
not a rape but a robbery.  He was the
victim.  Peter Junio was one of the
robbers and Alda herself was involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">To begin with, he protested, it was not he who asked to stay in
Alda's house but Alda herself who invited him to sleep there.  He was on his way to his sister-in-law's
house when Alda pulled him by the arm and practically forced him into her
house.</p>

<p class="BODY">He testified that while he was sleeping, he was awakened by a
group of three men who were looking for a gun he was supposed to be
carrying.  Finding none, they took away
the contents of his bag, including his clothes, a watch, and a pair of
sunglasses.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to him, Alda promised him that she and her husband
would recover the stolen articles or make good <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">their value.  It was their
responsibility because he had been robbed in their house.  Thus assured, he went to sleep.  But at about 11 o'clock, he was awakened and
hit in the head with the barrel of a rifle by one of the patrolmen who arrested
him.  He was surprised when he was later
charged by Alda with raping her.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Nobody corroborated him.  He alleged that he was prevented from
presenting his own witness but was unable to substantiate this complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">We have gone over the
record of this case and must agree with the trial court that the defense
offered by Cervando deserves little credence indeed.  It is shot </span>through and through with holes.  It is plainly a fabrication and an inept one
at that.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Implicating Alda in the
robbery was an especially unbelievable concoction.  Alda flatly denied it.  Significantly, Cervando never mentioned the robbery at the time of his
arrest or even when he was already in the </span>police station.  He also did not explain why, if he had
really been robbed, the robbers <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">did </span>not
get the bag itself and all its contents.  Of the five pairs of trousers allegedly in the bag, four were not
touched at all.</p>

<p class="BODY">By contrast, Alda's testimony was consistent and credible.  Her narration of the rape was forthright if
understandably strained because of the embarrassing details she had to recount.  Her reaction to the offense was instant and
natural:  she fled her house<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> as </span>soon as she heard Cervando snoring
and sought the help of her neighbors.  She unhesitatingly told them what had happened.  She reported the outrage to her husband
immediately upon his return from the sea.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presence of sperm cells in her violated organ affirmed her
charge more <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">than words or </span>anger
alone could prove.  Even if it did not,
the other evidence against Cervando was enough to prove that he had indeed
repaid her hospitality by ravishing her in her own house.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Judge </span>Celso
L. Conol <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of </span>the Regional Trial
Court of Oroquieta City did not err in finding Cervando Patong guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of raping Alda Malima Patong.  We agree that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in view </span>of
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">aggravating circumstance of
night-time, dwelling and abuse of confidence, he should suffer the sentence of
RECLUSION PERPETUA with all the accessory penalties in accordance with the
Revised Penal Code.  We shall however,
increase the civil indemnity to P30,000.00, conformably to existing doctrine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Cervando Patong should have been grateful to Alda for allowing
him the shelter of her home when he requested it.  Instead, he sullied it by violating her.  By thus degrading himself with his
unspeakable lechery, he has earned his own condemnation to a life behind bars.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appeal is DISMISSED and the appealed
judgment is AFFIRMED as above modified, with costs against the
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED">SO ORDERED<span style="font-weight:normal">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
