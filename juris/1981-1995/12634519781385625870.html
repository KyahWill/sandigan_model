				<BR><BR><div align="justify">Crispin Royo and Mariano Maglente appealed 
from the decision of the Circuit 
Criminal Court of Manila, finding them guilty of murder, sentencing each
 of them 
to reclusion perpetua and ordering them to indemnify solidarily the 
heirs of 
Carmen Huelva-Lim Chan in the sum of twelve thousand pesos (Criminal 
Case No. 
2684). 
<p>At about noontime of October 12, 1977, the dead body of Carmen 
H. Chan, a 
fifty-one-year-old widow, was found between a partition and a printing 
machine 
on the ground floor of her three-story house located at 432 Jaboneros 
Street, 
Binondo, Manila. </p>
<p>The autopsy disclosed that she died due to manual strangulation
 and multiple 
stab and "blunt" wounds between three and six o'clock in the morning of 
October 
12, 1977 (27 tsn March 8, 1978; Exh. C and D). </p>
<p>The external injuries consisted of (1) a contused lacerated 
wound in the 
forehead, (2) lacerated wound in the basion, (3) lacerated wound in the 
supraorbital area of the left eye, (4) contusions on the lips, (5) five 
contusions over the left lower jaw, (6) small lacerated wound near the 
right 
corner of the mouth, (7) nail scratches on the slightly swollen and 
purplish 
neck, (8), (9) two penetrating stab wounds in the chest lacerating the 
heart, 
(10), (11), (12) three stab wounds also in the chest lace­rating the 
heart, (13) 
nine semi-circular contused, penetrating wounds in the chest, (14) and 
(15) two 
lacerated wounds on the scalp. </p>
<p>There were hematomas on the lower anterior chest extending to 
the epigastric 
region and on the larynx and surrounding soft tissues.&nbsp; The 
victim's nasal 
bones, ribs, malar bones and alveolar process were fractured. </p>
<p>Crispin Royo, 20 (19), a former household helper of Carmen 
Chan, who had 
stayed with her family for three years, was arrested in the afternoon of
 the 
following day, October 13, 1977, in connection with the 
killing.&nbsp; He made a 
handwritten confession at eight-thirty in the evening.&nbsp; He 
admitted that he 
stabbed the victim.&nbsp; Royo stated that the killing was suggested
 by Mariano 
Maglente (Jun), who like Royo is from Masbate and who also used to work 
as a 
house-boy of the Chan family.&nbsp; Although Maglente had found 
another job in 
Tayuman Street, he used to visit Royo on Sundays in the house of Carmen 
H. 
Chan.&nbsp; Royo's confession reads as follows: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>" Sabi ni Jun sa akin na patayin ko si Miss Chan kasi manloloko
 daw si Miss 
Chan kaya inutusan ako ni Jun.&nbsp; Kasi kung magpatrabaho paabot 
ng alas dose ng 
gabi umpisa sa alas sais ng umaga.&nbsp; Ang pagkain ay parang sa 
baboy. </p>
<p>" Ang suweldo namin sa isang semana ay sampung piso lang kaya 
nagalit kami 
kay Miss Chan, kaming lahat na trabahador.&nbsp; Kaya mayroong nag- 
utos sa akin, si 
Jun, na patayin si Miss Chan. </p>
<p>" Sinabi ko oo, papatayin ko.&nbsp; Sabi ni Jun magkita 
kami ni Jun kung hindi 9 
12 ng buwang ito.&nbsp; Nagkita kami noong 9.&nbsp; Sabi ko sa 
kanya hindi ko magagawa.&nbsp; 
Sabi ni Jun sa dose na lang. </p>
<p>" Nagkita kami ng dose, alas sais ng umaga tapos binigay niya 
ang kutsilyo.&nbsp; 
Pagdating ko sa bahay, nag­bukas na siya ng pinto.&nbsp; Inutusan 
ako na magtapon ng 
basura. </p>
<p>" Pagdating ko sa loob, binunot ko ang kutsilyo sa 
bulsa.&nbsp; Pagkatapos lumapit 
sa akin si Miss Chan, pagkatapos sinaksak ko ng dalawa o tatlong 
beses.&nbsp; Natumba 
siya, tapos umalis na ako. </p>
<p>" Pumasok si Jun, pagkatapos hindi ko na nakita." ( Exh . F). 
</p></blockquote>
<p>Patrolman Ilagan testified that the foregoing confession does 
not contain any 
advertence as to Royo's constitutional rights because Royo simply asked 
for a 
piece of paper so that he could write his confession.&nbsp; 
According to Ilagan, he 
verbally informed Royo of his constitutional rights. </p>
<p>Elizabeth Chan, 22, the victim's daughter, testified that at 
about seven 
o'clock in the morning of October 12, 1977, she spotted Maglente walking
 on 
Jaboneros Street and turning on San Fernando Street. </p>
<p>Maglente was arrested.&nbsp; He was confronted with Royo's 
confession.&nbsp; He denied 
any complicity in the killing.&nbsp; Royo executed another 
confession at about ten 
o'clock in the evening of October 13, 1977.&nbsp; It was 
typewritten.&nbsp; He again 
implicated Maglente.&nbsp; He fingered Maglente who was present 
during the 
investigation.&nbsp; He identified the weapon he used in stabbing 
Carmen Chan, the 
plastic printing press roller used by Maglente ( Exh. I) and the pants, 
smeared 
with blood, which he wore during the killing ( Exh. J). </p>
<p>On October 14, 1977, at about six-thirty in the evening, Royo 
reenacted the 
killing at the scene of the crime.&nbsp; Maglente, who was present, 
did not 
participate in the re-enactment.&nbsp; However, when arraigned on 
the charge of 
murder, Royo, like Maglente, pleaded not guilty. </p>
<p>The trial court in convicting Royo found that his two 
confessions were 
voluntarily executed. </p>
<p>Royo's case.&nbsp; - Royo, a native of Tinigban, Aroroy, 
Masbate, who finished 
Grade six, recounted in his typewritten confession that at about six 
o'clock in 
the morn­ing of Wednesday, October 12, 1977, Maglente gave him a kitchen
 knife, 
while they were at San Fernando Street, Binondo.&nbsp; Maglente told
 him that he ( 
Maglente) would wait for Royo at the corner of Jaboneros and San 
Fernando 
Streets. </p>
<p>Armed with the knife, Royo went to the house of Mrs. Chan on 
Jaboneros 
Street.&nbsp; He saw her opening the door.&nbsp; She told Royo 
to get the garbage can.&nbsp; 
Royo disposed of the garbage and reentered the ground floor of the house
 to 
return the garbage can.&nbsp; Mrs. Chan told him to get out, 
actually pushing him, 
and, as she did so, Royo stabbed her in the chest.&nbsp; Maglente 
entered the ground 
floor and hit Mrs. Chan with a printing press roller ( Exh. I) 
.&nbsp; Royo fled to 
Saluysoy, Meycauayan, Bulacan. </p>
<p>Royo identified the knife which he used and which was found at 
the scene of 
the crime.&nbsp; He disclosed that the motive for the killing was 
Mrs. Chan's beastly 
treatment of himself and Maglente.&nbsp; His exact words were: "Alas
 12:00 nang gabi 
kami pinahihinto mula nang alas 6:00 na aga ang kain para sa baboy." 
(No. 39, 
Exh . G). </p>
<p>While Royo's confession was being taken, Maglente was present 
at the 
investigation room.&nbsp; The investigator asked Royo to point to 
Maglente.&nbsp; Royo 
complied and pointed to Maglente (No. 40, Exh. G). </p>
<p>The following notice and waiver of his constitutional rights 
are found in 
Royo's second confession: </p>
<blockquote>

<p>"WITNESSES: </p>
<p>RODOLFO S. ILAGAN </p>
<p>RODOLFO JANER </p>
<p>"Subscribed and sworn to before me this 13th day of October 
1977 in the City 
of Manila. </p>
<p>Sgd. BALTAZAR DIZON </p>
<p>(Assistant Fiscal of Manila) </p>
<p>Administering Officer" </p></blockquote>
<p>An examination of that confession reveals that the police 
investigator 
endeavored to comply with the cons­titutional requirements by apprising 
Royo of 
his rights to have counsel and to remain silent and by securing from him
 a 
waiver under oath of those rights.&nbsp; The swearing officer, 
Fiscal Baltazar Dizon, 
also apprised him of his constitutional rights (22 tsn October 9, 1978).
 </p>
<p>Royo testified briefly at the trial.&nbsp; He declared that
 the charge that he 
killed Mrs. Chan was not true.&nbsp; On April 30, 1979 (after the 
prosecution had 
closed its evidence), he executed in the chapel of the city jail before a
 police 
captain an affidavit wherein he said that "Mariano Maglente ay walang 
kasalanan 
sa pagkamatay ni Carmen Chan" (par. 4, Exh. 2, p. 115, Record). 
</p>
<p>In that affidavit, Royo also said: "Na ako ay binugbog ng mga 
Pulis sa 
Detective Bureau ng Homicide bago kami ay dinala dito sa Manila City 
Jail, at 
walang mga declaration o 'statement' na ibinigay ko sa Pulis na kasama 
ko si 
Mariano Maglente noong fecha 12 ng Oktubre, 1977 sa Jaboneros, Binondo, 
Maynila, 
noong nakitang patay si Carmen Chan ng mga pulis." (No. 5, Exh . 2). 
</p>
<p>It is evident that Exhibit 2 is in the nature of a retraction 
of the 
statements in his two confessions im­plicating Maglente in the killing 
of Mrs. 
Chan.&nbsp; It has no probative value because it was obviously an 
afterthought, a 
belated self-serving declaration designed to exculpate Royo and 
Maglente.&nbsp; It 
was by means of that 1979 affidavit that Royo repudiated his 1977 
confessions. 
</p>
<p>Royo's testimony on direct examination consisted merely of his 
denial that he 
killed Mrs. Chan and his identification of his affidavit repudiating his
 prior 
confessions.&nbsp; On cross-examination, he admitted that he had 
never complained to 
the authorities about any maltreatment. </p>
<p>The issue is whether Royo's confessions are admissible under 
Article IV of 
the Constitution which provides: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"SEC. 20.&nbsp; No person shall be compelled to be a 
witness against himself.&nbsp; Any 
person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have 
the right 
to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such 
right.&nbsp; No force, 
violence, threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiates the 
free will 
shall be used against him.&nbsp; Any confession obtained in 
violation of this section 
shall be inadmissible in evidence." </p></blockquote>
<p>Section 20 refers to confessions taken during custodial 
interrogation.&nbsp; We 
agree with the trial court that Royo's confessions were 
voluntary.&nbsp; One 
tell-tale badge of the spontaneity and regularity of the second 
confession is 
the fact that Royo used therein Visayan words, aside from Tagalog 
words.&nbsp; That 
shows that the investigator took down his answers verbatim and did not 
alter the 
same. </p>
<p>But did Royo waive his constitutional rights to have counsel 
and to remain 
silent when he executed those confessions? </p>
<p>The rule is that "a defendant may waive effectuation of his 
rights to remain 
silent and to be assisted by counsel at a custodial police 
interrogation, 
provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently" 
(Syllabus, Miranda vs. Arizona, 16 L. Ed. 2nd 694, 697, 706-707). 
</p>
<p>We hold that under the circumstances surrounding the execution 
of Royo's 
second pre-trial confession, especially the warning and notice to him of
 his 
constitutional rights, which he waived under oath, he made a valid 
renunciation 
of the said rights.&nbsp; Consequently, the confessions are 
admissible.&nbsp; His 
conviction can be predicated thereon.&nbsp; A different holding 
would result in a 
palpable miscarriage of justice. </p>
<p>Maglente's case.&nbsp; - As already stated, Royo in his two
 confessions implicated 
Maglente in the killing of Mrs. Chan by stating that it was Maglente who
 
suggested the killing and that it was Maglente who used the printing 
press 
roller in bludgeoning the victim.&nbsp; Elizabeth Chan testified 
that she saw 
Maglente on Jaboneros Street early in the morning of the day when her 
mother was 
killed.&nbsp; Maglente did not testify at the trial. </p>
<p>Royo's confessions are not admissible against Maglente because 
they are 
hearsay and res inter alios acta as to Maglente.&nbsp; Royo did not 
testify on the 
confessions.&nbsp; In his later affidavit, he swore that Maglente 
had nothing to do 
with the killing of Mrs. Chan and that his confes­sions were induced by 
maltreatment ( Exh. 2).&nbsp; Without Royo's confessions, there is 
no evidence 
against Maglente.&nbsp; The Solicitor General recommended his 
acquittal. </p>
<p><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the lower court's 
judgment is affirmed as to 
Crispin Royo and reversed as to Mariano Maglente who is hereby 
exonerated 
because the evidence showing that he was a co-principal by inducement 
and direct 
partici­pation is inadmissible.&nbsp; Costs de oficio . </p>
