Her conviction is made to rest upon the following findings of the Trial Court,
subsequently adopted in their entirety by the Court of Appeals, <span class="SpellE"><u>viz</u></span>:<span style="font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>â€œ(T)he accused filed with the * * (Philippine National Cooperative
Bank) four applications for letters of credit, the first on September 14, 1964
and the last three all on August 24, 1965, and in the respective amounts of
P10,000.00, P22,300.00, P24,000.00 and P24,600.00 * * (Exhibits C, A, F and
G).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the applications were
processed and approved, domestic letters of credit were opened on the same
dates of the applications and in the amounts applied for (Exhibits C-2, A-2,
F-2 and G-2, respectively).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among the
papers filed for the issuance of the domestic letters of credit were commercial
invoices of the different suppliers of the merchandise sought to be purchased (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. C-1, a-1, f-1 and G-1), also bearing the same dates
of the applications for letters of credit with which they were respectively
attached.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The different suppliers then
drew sight drafts against the applicant payable to the order of the PNCB, also
bearing the same dates as the respective applications and for the same amounts
(Exhibits D, A-3, F-4 and G-5Z).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
PNCB then drew its own drafts against the accused as the buyer of the
merchandise and which drafts were accepted by the accused also on the same
dates of the respective applications (Exhibits E, E-1, A-3, A-6, F-4, F-5, F-7
and G-8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After such acceptance, the
corresponding trust receipts were signed by the accused also on the same dates
of the respective applications (Exhibits E-2, A-8, F-8 and G-9).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The four trust receipts signed by the accused uniformly
contain the following stipulation:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent:0in">'The undersigned hereby acknowledges to
have received in trust from the * * (PNCB) the merchandise covered by the
above-mentioned documents and agrees to hold said merchandise in storage as the

account provided the proceeds thereof are turned over in their entirety to the
said bank to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">be </span>applied against
any acceptance(s) and any other indebtedness of the undersigned to the said
bank.'</p>

<blockquote>"The records of the PNCB which had been presented in evidence
show that the drafts drawn by the bank against the accused and accepted by the
latter were supposed to be due in 90 days from the dates thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No payments were made excepting a partial
payment of P3,900.00, inclusive of interests, made on <st1:date year="1965" day="20" month="5">May 20, 1965</st1:date>, as evidenced by the receipt Exhibit
I, for the account under the letter of credit No. 006; and another partial

 1965</st1:date> on the same letter of credit, evidenced by the receipt Exhibit
J.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These partial payments were evidently
in pursuance of written demands for payment addressed by the PNCB to the
accused on <st1:date year="1965" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1965</st1:date>
(Exhibits K-2 and K-3).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A last formal
demand was addressed to the accused in a letter of counsel for the PNCB dated <st1:date year="1967" day="26" month="1">January 26, 1967</st1:date> (Exhibits H, H-<span class="SpellE">i</span> and H-2)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

whatever, since it had made no payment at all on account of the commercial

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of record, the assailed factual
findings as to the receipt of the merchandise and the damage sustained by the
Bank cannot stand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The proofs </span>are
indeed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">inadequate on these propositions
of fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is difficult </span>to
accept <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the prosecution's theory that it
has furnished sufficiency proof of delivery by the introduction in evidence of
the commercial invoices attached to the applications for the letters of credit
and of the</span> trust receipts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
invoices are actually nothing more than lists of the items sought to be
purchased and their prices; and it can scarcely be believed that goods worth no
mean sum actually transferred hands without the unpaid vendor requiring the vendee
to acknowledge this fact in some way, even by a simple signature on these
documents alone if not in act by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
execution of </span>some appropriate document, such as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">delivery receipt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The trust receipts do not
fare any better as proofs of the delivery to Ramos of the goods.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Except for the invoices, all documents
relating to each trust receipt agreement, including the trust receipts
themselves, appear to be </span>standard <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Bank
forms accomplished by the Bank personnel, and were all signed by Ramos in one
sitting, no doubt with a view to facilitating the pending transactions between
the parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If, as she claims, Ramos
was made to believe that bank usage or regulations require the signing of the
papers in this way, i.e., on a single occasion, there was neither reason nor
opportunity for her to question the statement therein of receipt of the </span>goods
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">since it was evidently assumed that
deliver to her of the goods would shortly come to pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At any rate, Ramos has </span>categorically
and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">consistently denied ever having received
the goods either from the Bank or the suppliers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And this was because, according </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">her, the suppliers simply refused to part with the goods as no payment
had been made <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> by the Bank.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

resolved by the production of the delivery receipts or the testimony of the
employees who made the supposed deliveries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And the prosecution could not have been unaware of such evidence, its
ready accessibility, and its importance, specially after the appellant </span>had
disclaimed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">receipt of the goods </span>in
question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">existence of that evidence is placed in </span>serious
doubt by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">fact that the prosecution
made </span>no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">effort to bring it
before the Court, although it could have done so routinely and without any
difficulty whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, this
omission cannot be taken against the accused, who is presumed innocent until
the contrary is proved beyond reasonable doubt.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

all the elements of the crime charged.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The State however insists
that Ramos' receipt of the goods is proven by the fact that she made marginal
fee deposits on all the letters of credit, and also tendered partial payments
for the merchandise subject of the first trust receipt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But evidence of these supposed deposits and
payments is no </span>less flimsy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">too.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only document presented in proof of the
deposit of marginal fees was Ramos' Statement of Account</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">But no </span>receipt <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for the
claimed deposits was ever produced.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
the other hand, the prosecution offered two official receipts in evidence</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> ostensibly showing that Ramos remitted
partial payments to the Bank for the </span>goods allegedly received under the
first trust receipt transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet these
payments -- supposedly made on May 20 and <st1:date year="1965" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1965</st1:date> -- are not oven reflected in the 1967
Statement of Account which credited Ramos only with the payment of marginal fee
deposits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, although both
PNCB receipts indicate that checks were given in payment the <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> checks were never exhibited, nor any reason
advanced for their non-production.</p>

<p class="BODY">The omission to present obvious and available primary items of
proof is also perceived in the attempted substantiation of the claim that the
Bank paid the suppliers for the goods, and thereby suffered damage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under its standard procedures, the Bank
effects payment on a negotiated letter of credit by the issuance of a check,
the cancelled check being the invariable proof that negotiation has been consummated.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Again, not one such check issued by the Bank to the suppliers was ever
submitted, or any receipt signed by any supplier, or any of the Bank's books,
ledgers, or journals reflecting any of the disbursements, in settlement of
Ramos' accounts with her suppliers.</p>

<p class="BODY">This rather sorry state of the evidence against the accused, who
is to be presumed innocent until <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
contrary is proved beyond reasonable doubt, compels a reversal of her
convictions in all four cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
