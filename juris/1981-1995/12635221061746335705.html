In Criminal Case No. CCC-II-15 (BB) of the then Circuit Criminal Court 
of Baguio, accused Johnny Basadre was found guilty of the crime of 
murder, qualified by treachery, and with the aggravating circumstance of
 recidivism and the special aggravating circumstance of 
quasi-recidivism, was sentenced to suffer the extreme penalty of death, 
to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Alfonso Rayray in the amount of 
P12,000.00 and to pay the costs.  Thus, this case is before Us on 
automatic appeal.
<p>
Prosecution evidence shows that in the afternoon of August 8, 1971, 
Alfonso Rayray and his brother Domingo, together with one Edito Tacla, 
were at Maresciel Soda Fountain in Baguio City to partake of some 
refreshments.  Domingo Rayray and Edito Tacla sat on the stools beside 
the counter and eventually proceeded to enjoy the refreshments they have
 ordered.  Alfonso Rayray went towards the juke-box near the door which 
is about two meters where his brother Domingo and Edito Tacla were 
seated.
</p><p>
While Alfonso was scanning the list of musical selections available for 
play, a commotion suddenly broke out in front of the Maresciel Theater, 
sending people to scamper away from the place.  Suddenly, a man who was 
later on identified as Johnny Basadre (herein appellant) approached 
Alfonso Rayray and stabbed him with a knife.  Spontaneously, Alfonso 
exclaimed:  "Binagsuldac metten", meaning (I am already wounded).
</p><p>
Alfonso Rayray was rushed to the Baguio General Hospital and was 
immediately operated on by Dr. Magdaleno Mucum who found the patient 
with a fatal stab wound at he hypogastric region where part of the 
intestine protruded.  He was confined at the hospital up to September 
24, 1971 when he was transferred at the Pines City Doctors' Hospital 
where he underwent another operation by Dr. Ernesto Bayuga.
</p><p>
On October 31, 1971, Alfonso was transferred at the Lahos Clinic and 
Hospital at Vigan where he underwent one more operation on November 4, 
1971.  However, on November 16, 1971, on account of internal hemorrhage,
 the patient finally succumbed and died of hemorrhage complication.
</p><p>
When Alfonso Rayray was still at the Baguio General Hospital, Pat. 
Tinasa was able to interview and question him in the course of which he 
was shown five (5) photographs of different police characters.  Alfonso,
 who was then weak, pointed to a photograph (Exhibit G-2) which turned 
out to be the picture of appellant Johnny Basadre.
</p><p>
On September 9, 1971, Domingo Rayray confirmed Alfonso's identification 
of appellant Basadre as the assailant by pointing to the latter's 
picture (Exhibit G-2), among the five photographs shown him as the very 
person who stabbed his brother.
</p><p>
The defense is denial and alibi.  Appellant declared that in 1970 he was
 in New Bilibid Prisons at Muntinlupa serving sentence until he escaped 
therefrom on December 13, 1970.  He went to Manila where he stayed for 
about six (6) months and, upon learning that the Muntinlupa prison 
guards were looking for him, he went into hiding in Dagupan for some 
four (4) months, following which he transferred to Lingayen, Pangasinan 
and stayed with his grandparents.  In August 1971 he claimed that he was
 in Ba-ay and did not go up to Baguio until October 1971 because "I was 
afraid that this is the place I had cases" and "I was thinking that they
 might be looking for me here in Baguio." However, he admitted that in 
1971 his parents were living in Baguio and that was the reason he 
finally went there to see his mother.
</p><p>
On December 16, 1971, appellant Basadre was apprehended by Pat. Talostos for possessing a concealed deadly weapon.
</p><p>
Convicting appellant Basadre of the crime of murder, the trial court said -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The accused admitted that he was in Ba-ay, Lingayen, Pangasinan, 
sometime in August although he could not remember the exact date.  He 
also admitted that before he returned to Baguio in October 1971 he had 
gone to Camp 6 five or six times the last of which was in the month of 
September 1971 when he stayed for a week with an uncle working in the 
mines. </p>
  <p> "Under these circumstances it is not impossible that on August 8, 
1971, he could have gone to Baguio and committed the crime.  It must not
 be overlooked that at that time the accused was a fugitive from justice
 -- an escapee from Muntinlupa and as such he never stayed in one place 
long enough to be traced by authorities.  It was therefore not 
impossible for him to penetrate Baguio in any of his trips to Camp 6.  
His reason that he purposely did not proceed to Baguio because he was 
afraid the authorities might catch up with him does not by itself render
 impossible his going there.  As a matter of fact even with this fear he
 nevertheless went to Baguio in October 1971 to see his mother.  His 
forays to Baguio previous to October 1971 without being caught by the 
police must have emboldened him even more to come to Baguio until the 
police finally caught up with him in December 16, 1971.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p> "It is therefore the considered opinion of this court that as 
against the positive identification of the accused, the defense failed 
to prove his alibi to the satisfaction of the court.  x x x" (pp. 36, 
38, Rollo) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this appeal, defendant-appellant claims that the trial court erred 
(1) in not dismissing the information on the ground of double jeopardy; 
(2) in not acquitting the accused, the evidence being insufficient for 
conviction; (3) in disregarding the evidence for the defense; and (4) in
 finding that treachery and quasi-recidivism were present.
</p><p>
Appellant's first assigned error is devoid of merit.  Criminal Case No. 
522 of the then Court of First Instance of Baguio and Benguet for murder
 against herein appellant Johnny Basadre was only transferred by raffle 
to the Circuit Criminal Court of the Second Judicial District which 
docketed it as Criminal Case No. CCC-II-15 (BB), pursuant to 
Administrative Order No. 274, dated September 11, 1968, as amended by 
Administrative Order No. 274, dated September 30, 1968, of the then 
Department of Justice.  Thus, it cannot be said that Criminal Case No. 
522 of the Court of First Instance was terminated, much less was 
appellant convicted or acquitted therein.  After his arraignment in said
 Criminal Case No. 522, the case was transferred for actual trial to the
 Circuit Criminal Court where it was given the corresponding docket 
number.
</p><p>
With respect to the identity of appellant as the assailant of Alfonso 
Rayray, prosecution witness Domingo Rayray testified as follows:

  <p>
    A     He stabbed him like this sir.  (witness standing on the left

<p>
Appellant's alibi cannot overcome the positive identification by the 
victim when appellant's picture, among others, was shown to him; and, by
 Domingo Rayray who pointed to him (Johnny Basadre) when he took the 
witness stand.  The absence of motive does not preclude the commission 
of the crime considering that nowadays it is of judicial knowledge that 
others have been killed or assaulted for lesser or no reason at all.  
Nowadays, the impulsiveness of youth has given way to mature thinking 
(People vs. Reyno 13 SCRA 647).
</p><p>
Anent the fourth assigned error, the Solicitor General agrees with the 
defense that the qualifying circumstance of treachery has not been 
satisfactorily established and, as a consequence, the crime committed 
was only homicide.  We quote from the brief of the Solicitor General -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "It is to be recalled that while the deceased was standing before 
the jukebox at the side of the door of the Maresciel Soda Fountain, a 
commotion occurred in the alley in front of said door, which was also in
 front of the Maresciel Theater (See Sketch, Exh. X), so that the people
 there ran in all directions.  The deceased must have been attracted and
 gone to the door to find out what the commotion was all about.  At this
 juncture, appellant armed with a knife, approached the deceased and 
frontally attacked the latter by stabbing him in the abdomen.  Under the
 circumstances, the deceased could not have failed to see the impending 
assault and could have put up a defense, so that it cannot safely be 
said that there was absolutely no risk to appellant arising from the 
defense the deceased might make. </p>
  <p> "Moreover, while the attack upon the victim has been sudden and 
unexpected, it does not of itself show treachery unless there is 
evidence that such form of attack was purposely adopted by the accused 
(People vs. Tumaob, 83 Phil. 742).  No such evidence exist to prove this
 purpose, not only because the accused and the victim were undisputably 
unknown to each other, but further because the accused herein was merely
 running away from the site of the commotion and the deceased happened 
to be blocking or was along his path.  Verily, therefore, it could not 
be said that the accused had the opportunity to reflect on the means, 
method and forms of attacking the victim. </p>
  <p> "Domingo Rayray's pretension, that the deceased was attacked by 
the appellant while the former was leaning on the juke-box scanning the 
lists of the records and trying to select which to play, is difficult to
 believe.  If this were true, appellant, who must have entered the door 
of the Maresciel Soda Fountain from the alley, could have easily stabbed
 him in the back.  But the fact is that deceased was stabbed in the 
stomach, indicating that it was a frontal assault. </p>
  <p> "Settled is the rule that a qualifying circumstance must be 
established as conclusively as the crime itself and that in case of 
doubt, the same must be resolved in favor of an accused (U.S. vs. 
Adriano Perdon, 4 Phil. 141).  The application of the foregoing doctrine
 to the case at bar becomes the more imperative, because an estimation 
of the alleged qualifying circumstance of treachery, which, as already 
adverted to above has not been clearly proved, would require the 
imposition of the extreme penalty of death, in view of the aggravating 
circumstances of recidivism and quasi-recidivism." (pp. 15-17, 
Appellee's Brief) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We are not in accord with this finding.  The sudden and unexpected 
attack on the victim Alfonso Rayray which ensured the commission of the 
killing without any risk to the assailant constitutes treachery.  It 
maybe true that the attack was made by assailant face to face with the 
victim, but We should consider the fact that the latter was unarmed, was
 totally unaware of the coming attack from someone he did not even know 
and was not in a position to defend himself against him.  Treachery may 
be appreciated in a sudden frontal attack (People vs. Reyno, 77 Phil. 
93).
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the appealed judgment is AFFIRMED with the modifications that
 for lack of necessary votes, appellant Johnny Basadre is hereby 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua, to idemnify the 
heirs of Alfonso Rayray in the amount of P30,000.00 and to pay the 
costs.
