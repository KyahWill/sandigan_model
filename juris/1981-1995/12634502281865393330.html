				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition filed on January 15, 1979 for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>
seeking the setting aside of the decision and the two orders subsequent thereto
of respondent judge dated August 20, 1975 and November 14, 1978 and December
27, 1978, respectively, as acts committed in grave abuse of discretion, the
compromise agreement on which said decision was based being allegedly in
contravention of the Constitution and the Public Land Act, hence the execution
thereof under the two questioned subsequent orders had no legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The exact nature of the petition and the relevant antecedents may
perhaps be stated more comprehensively by quoting from the petition itself
(omitting the annexes mentioned therein) the following:</p>

<blockquote>"2.1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
assailing as grave abuse of discretion, tantamount to a jurisdictional error,
the order of the respondent Judge in refusing to nullify a compromise agreement
that violates the Public Land Act (Com. Act 141) and the 1973 Constitution, and
in ordering the execution of judgment based thereon, rendered in three related
cases between the petitioners and private respondents.</blockquote>

payment to petitioners (the <span class="SpellE">Guiangs</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hiquianas</span>) of the total sum of P240,000.00 pursuant to the

Deeds of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="25" month="9">September
 25, 1978</st1:date>, petitioners opposed respondents' petition for contempt
and execution and filed a detailed and lengthy opposition (Annex 'G'),
embodying a counter-motion <u>'To Declare the Compromise Agreement Void as to </u><st1:city><st1:place><u>Sale</u></st1:place></st1:city>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In essence, petitioners contend that the
compromise decreed the sale to the <span class="SpellE">Kintanars</span> of six
lots with a combined area of 146 hectares originally covered by sales patents
acquired through purchase by petitioners from the government, consequently
violating the maximum limit of 24 hectares that an individual may acquire by
purchase under Section 11 of Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution, taken in
relation to the Public Land Act (Com. Act 141).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At the time of the execution of the compromise agreement, petitioners
were not aware that private respondents were already holders of 29 hectares of
public land acquired before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
new Constitution in 1973.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At any rate,
the total area that the compromise agreement ceded in favor of respondents were
grossly excessive of the legal limits above mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If construed as a sale, the compromise was a
nullity, but taken as a lease, since private respondents had already taken
possession of the lands and <span class="SpellE">benefitted</span> immensely from
their produce, the compromise was perfectly valid and legal because the 1973
Constitution allows an individual to lease <u>500</u> hectares of alienable
public lands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Viewing the <span style="">compromise as a lease would make the amounts
paid by respondents to petitioners, rentals or reasonable damages for the use
and occupancy of the lands.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

hearing to ventilate factual issues arising from their opposition and
counter-motion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1978</st1:date>, the respondent Judge issued an order (Annex 'H'):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) denying the petitioners' counter-motion
to declare the compromise agreement void as to sale; (b) ordered the issuance
of a writ of execution and (c) denying respondents' petition for contempt.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="24" month="11">November
 24, 1978</st1:date>, petitioners filed a Motion for Reconsideration (attached
as Annex 'I') of the Order of <st1:date year="1978" day="14" month="11">November
 14, 1978</st1:date>, insofar as that portion where the respondent Judge
refused to nullify the compromise agreement as a sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>During the hearing of this motion on <st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="12">December 5, 1978</st1:date>, the parties agreed

positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1978</st1:date>, petitioners submitted their
memorandum of authorities which is attached hereto as Annex 'J'.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1979" day="2" month="2"><span style="">February
 2, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, We required
respondents to comment on the petition, issuing at the same time a restraining
order against the implementation of the impugned order of execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although filed ten (10) days beyond the
period given by the Court, We nevertheless accepted respondents' comment,
considering that the main issue raised by petitioners is a novel one, in the
sense that it is predicated on the theory that a judgment by compromise, which
becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> upon approval by the
court, may still be set aside, three (3) years later and after it had been
partially complied with by both parties, upon the ground that the agreement, it
is contended, </span><span style="">violates </span><span style="">the Constitution and the Public Land Act,
hence contrary to public policy of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners maintain the affirmative,
contending that when the purpose of setting aside a judicial compromise is to
pursue and implement a fundamental state policy embodied in no less than the
Constitution, the ordinary remedies for relief and </span>periods <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> do not apply.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondents posit in their belated
comment that:</p>

following comment:</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">1.0 <u>On the Petition</u></p>

<blockquote><span style="">1.1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In line with the
decision of this court in the case of ROMULA MABALE, et al., Petitioners vs.
Hon. SIMPLICIO M. APALISOK, et al., Respondents, (G.R. No. L-46942, <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="2">Feb. 6, 1979</st1:date>) petitioners should have
seasonably moved for the setting aside of the compromise and the judgment based
upon it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In that case this court said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'To be entitled to appeal from judgment approving a compromise, a
party must move not only to set aside the judgment, but also to annul or set
(aside) the compromise itself on the ground of fraud, mistake or duress
vitiating his consent to the compromise .... to set it aside under Rule 38 of
the Rules of Court, the petition for relief must be filed within six months
from the date judgment was entered . . . ' (supra)</p>

<blockquote>1.2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment based on compromise in these
three cases was entered on <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="8">20 August
 1975</st1:date>, on the same date that the compromise agreement was signed and
submitted, so that petitioners should be presumed to have knowledge about it on
said date also.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners had,
therefore, up to 20 <st1:date year="1976" day="19" month="2">February 19 76</st1:date>
within which to file their petition for relief.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On 22 September 1975, or just about 32 days
after the judgment on compromise was entered, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>
wrote a 'four page letter' to the Land Registration Commissioner, already
questioning the legality of the sales under the compromise agreement on exactly
the rationale he <span style="">advances </span>now.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commissioner of LRC replied to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> on 29 September 1975 (seven days later) confirming
and agreeing in so many words with the latter's belief that Section 122 of CA
141 was being violated by the implementation of the compromise agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.5.<span style=""> </span>From the foregoing, it is clear that
petitioners had more than ample time within which to seek relief from the lower
court's judgment on compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
deliberately neglected to do this.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
leading the private respondents on to complying with the compromise,
petitioners received the payments of the private respondents in the following
amounts:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>,
having thus acquired the wherewithal, thereafter traveled extensively abroad,
returning home sometime in September of October of 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, upon his arrival, he wrote
respondent Atty. <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>
a letter dated October 9, 1977 informing the latter that he, petiÂ­tioner <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>, and his family will never sign the deeds of sale
for the remaining lots (B-1, B-2, A-2 and A-3); that the transfer of lots B-3
and B-4 were void, and inferentially <u>threatening <span class="SpellE">Kintar</span>
with</u><u><span style=""> criminal prosecution</span></u><span style=""> </span>for a statement in an affidavit
accompanying the transfer of Lots B-3 and B-4.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> further demanded the return of
Lots B-3 and B-4 without offering to return one centavo of the payments he
received.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even then the petitioners raised the question
of legality of the compromise agreement and the judgment in earnest only when
the private respondents were constrained to move for court intervention by way
of <span style="">an </span>order of execution on <st1:date year="1978" day="18" month="8">18 August 1978</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What all the foregoing citation of events lead
to is that under the doctrine laid down in the case <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>,
petitioners have by their studied neglect, foreclosed entitlement to appeal by <i>certiorari</i>,
there having been all along 'plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary
course of law' (Sec. 1 Rule 65, Rules of Court)." (Pp. 169-171, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As background for the resolution of the above conflicting claims
of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We may quote hereunder
from the petition what appear to be the specific relevant facts bearing on the
question of whether or not there is indeed any public policy violated in the
compromise agreement in issue as would justify its nullification and setting
aside, notwithstanding the time that has elapsed before the supposed unconstitutionality
thereof was raised, particularly in the light of Section 3 of Rule 38 of the
Rules of Court on Petitions for Relief, which fixes the period for possible
setting aside of a judgment at only sixty (60) days from the time the party
concerned learns of the judgment and not later than six months or 180 days
after it has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, and besides,
the fact that said judicial compromise had already been partially complied with
by the parties, petitioners having actually executed and delivered to
respondents the corresponding deeds of sale covering two of the contested lots
(Lots B-3 and B-4 covered by OCT 12881), such that what is pending only for the
complete consummation of the agreement is the execution by petitioners, the <span class="SpellE">Guiangs</span> and <span class="SpellE">Hiquianas</span>, of the
deeds of sale over four more lots covered by said agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>According to the petition (omitting the
attachments mentioned therein), and there is no serious denial thereof in

private respondents (see attachment A of Annex 'G').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding completion of the staggered
payments for the <u>other</u> lots, petitioners could not bring themselves to
execute the deeds for their conveyance because by then, they were seized by
serious misgivings concerning the legality of the compromise agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What triggered the quest for legal opinions by the
petitioners, was the discovery that at the time of the compromise agreement,
private respondents did not disclose that they had already acquired 29 hectares
of alienable public lands.</blockquote>

concerning the legality of a transfer of lands originally acquired through
sales patent, in excess of the maximum of 24 hectares imposed by the New
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In reply, the Commissioner
of the Land Registration Commission stated that the document of transfer was
already an accomplished fact and bears the imprimatur of the Court, and that
since private respondents (the <span class="SpellE">Kintanars</span>) had
executed an affidavit--which incidentally was false and which became the basis
of a criminal charge for perjury before the <span class="SpellE">Fiscal's</span>
Office of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>--the
Commissioner was constrained to give due course to the registration of the sale

reasons why he could not execute a deed of conveyance of the remaining four
lots subject of the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner proposed <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> and certain
repayments in lieu of the compromise agreement to avoid the harmful effects of
escheat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>
ignored the deadline set by <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> for acceptance of
the counterproposals.</blockquote>

the Fiscal dismissed the charge on the ground that the lands so transferred

to only 24 hectares by virtue of the New Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The letter of Director Casanova appears as
Attachment H to Annex 'G' of this Petition." (Pp. 10-14 of Petition)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing premises, the legal and
constitutional issues We have to resolve are the following:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does Section II, Article XIV of the 1973
Constitution of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
reading:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 11.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The National
Assembly, taking into account conservation, ecological, and developmental
requirements of the natural resources, shall determine by law the size of lands
of the public domain which may be developed, held or acquired by, or leased to,
any qualified individual, corporation, or association, and the conditions <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No Private
corporation or association may hold alienable lands of the public domain except
by lease not to exceed one thousand hectares in area; nor may any citizen hold
such lands by lease in excess of five hundred hectares or acquire by purchase
or homestead in excess of twenty-four hectares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>No private corporation or association may hold by lease, concession,
license, or permit, timber or forest lands and other timber or forest resources
in excess of one hundred thousand hectares; however, such area may be increased
by the National Assembly upon recommendation of the National Economic and
Development Authority."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">constitute an amendment of Section 122 of
Commonwealth Act 141, the Public Land Act providing that:</p>

<blockquote>"Except in cases of hereditary succession, no land or any
portion hereof originally acquired under the free patent, homestead, or
individual sale provisions of this Act, or any permanent improvement thereon be
leased to such individual, when the area of such land, added to that of his
own, shall exceed one hundred and forty-four hectares, any transfer,
assignment, or lease made in violation hereof shall be null and void."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">in
the sense that after the Constitution took effect on January 17, 1973, any
transfer or assignment of lands, already validly in the hands of private
individuals and having areas allowed by said provision, (not in excess of 144
hectares) but acquired by them under free patent, homestead, or individual sale
provisions of the Act, the area that may be transferred or assigned such holder
to another person can no longer exceed twenty-four (24) hectares?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming the affirmative of the foregoing
proposition, but considering, on the other hand, that the parties had entered
into the agreement in good faith as the means of settling amicably the three
juridical suits (enumerated in the petition) among them, and that the approval
of the court thereof had under the rules already long become final, as in fact,
it had already been partially executed in 1975, is it still legally possible to
have the same declared a nullity and be set aside as prayed for in an
opposition filed in 1978 to a motion for its execution?</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is a conceded fact that when they entered
into the compromise agreement in dispute, private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span> spouses, were already the owners and had already
the title in their names of a lot of <span style="">29
</span>hectares acquired under the Public Land Act; now, what is the effect of
such fact upon the validity of the compromise agreement, considering the
prohibition contained in the same Section 122 against transfer or assignment to
persons already owning areas of lands, which if added to what is to be
transferred or assigned to them would exceed the limit provided therein?</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<p class="BODY">After mature deliberation and consideration of pertinent
principles of statutory and constitutional construction together with what
appears to be the obvious intent and objective of the legal and constitutional
provisions relevant to the above issue, We encounter no difficulty at all in
holding that, as contended by petitioners, Section 122 of the Public Land Act
has been amended by no less than Section 11, Article XIV of the 1973 Constitution
of the Philippines by reducing correspondingly the areas of the dis<span style="">posable public lands mentioned therein.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their comment as well as in their memorandum, however, private
respondent insists (1) that there is no "causative link", as they put
it, between the limitation of areas in the Constitution and the limitation of
areas in the Public Land Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They argue
that whereas under the 1935 Constitution, the pertinent provision was that:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No private
corporation or association may acquire, lease or hold public agricultural lands
in excess of one thousand and twenty four hectares, nor may an individual
acquire such lands <u>by purchase in excess of one hundred and forty four</u>
hectares or <u>by lease in excess of one thousand and twenty four</u> hectares
or by <u>homestead</u> in excess of twenty four hectaresâ¦." (Sec. 2,
Article XIII of the 1935 Constitution)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">the
limit to <span class="SpellE">leasable</span> lands was 1,024 hectares, Section
122 of the Public Land Act set the limit to only 144 hectares and (2) that the
limitation of purchasable areas under the Act is also 144 hectares was a mere
unintended coincidence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Clearly, such contention
suffers from the flaw known in logic as </span><u>non-sequitur</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">There
was nothing wrong for the legislature to provide for a limitation, as to
leasable lands, less than that fixed in the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the cited constitutional provision
itself opens with the statement that "(t)he National Assembly, taking into
account conservation, ecological, and developmental requirements of the natural
resources, shall determine by law the size of lands of the public domain which
may be developed, held or acquired by, or leased to, any qualified individual,
corporation, or association, and the conditions <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>."
The so-called "causative link" would indeed not have existed, had the
Congress exceeded what the Charter allowed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The argument about
unintended "coincidence" in the limit of purchasable areas is too
speculative, even puerile, to require any refutation. What to Us is clear and
obvious is that when the Constitution fixes a limit of the area of public lands
that can be "acquired" by purchase by an individual, it follows as a
matter of logic that such is also the maximum area of land originating from the
public domain that can be transferred to him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>True, lands once acquired from the government under the Act do become
private property, as private respondent argues, but for reasons of public
policy and interest implicit in Section 122 itself, such private ownership is
subject to the limitations stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Proof of the strictness of the policy is that the prohibiÂ­tion or
injunction is automatically embodied in the Torrens Title issued to the
purchaser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All such titles pertinently
read in part thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"ORIGINAL CERTIFICATE OF TITLE</blockquote>

<blockquote>"TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the said tract of land, with the
appurtenances thereunto of right belonging unto the said _________ and to his
heir and heirs and assigns forever, <u>subject to the provisions of Sections
121, 122 and 124 of CommonÂ­wealth Act No. 141 as amended</u>. (<span class="SpellE">Underlinings</span> supplied for emphasis)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"TRANSFER CERTIFICATE OF TITLE</blockquote>

<blockquote>"IT IS HEREBY CERTIFIED that certain land situated in the
__________, more particularly bounded and described as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>is registered in accordance with the
provisions of Section 122 of the Land Registration Act in the name of:</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>subject to the provisions</u> of the
said Land Registration Act and the <u>Public Land Act</u>, as well as to those
of the Mining Laws, if the land is mineral, and <u>subject further to such
conditions contained in the original title and may be subsisting</u>. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>(<span class="SpellE">Underlinings</span>
supplied for emphasis)" (Pp. 277-278, Record.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is Our considered opinion, and We so hold, consistently with
the view of the Legal Division of the Bureau of Lands cited by petitioners in
their petition (p. 14) that after the ratification of the Philippine
Constitution of 1973 on January 17, 1973, the maximum area of land acquired
from the disposable public domain that can be transferred or assigned to
another party by the original patentee, purchaser or homesteader became 24
hectares (instead of the 144 hectares under the 1935 Constitution), thereby
reducing correspondingly the 144-hectare limitation set in Section 122 to only
24 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hereby adopt as Our own
the subsequent opinion of the Director of Lands quoted not only in the petition,
as already stated, but also in petitioners' "Motion Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span>
for Earliest Decision of the Above-Entitled Case" dated <st1:date year="1980" day="7" month="10">October 7, 1980</st1:date>:</p>

<blockquote>"The first query is whether public
lands which have already been titled or patented under the homestead sales or
individual sale or free patent provision of Public Land Act are to be
considered 'private agricultural lands.' After a public land has been titled
under the provisions of the Public Land Act (Commonwealth Act No. 141, as
amended) the same for all legal intents and purposes, becomes a private
agricultural land subject, however, to the restrictions contained in Section
29, 118, 119, 121 and 122 of the said Act.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Your second query states whether
Article 122 of Commonwealth Act No. 141 as amended covers a situation wherein
parcels of public lands acquired by an individual, which after collation exceed
144 hectares which have already long been patented under homestead, individual
sale or free patent provisions thereof could be owned or possessed by him
legally.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our reply to the above is in
the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent provision
of Section 122 of the Public Land Act provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0in;">'Except in cases of hereditary succession,
no land or any portion thereof originally acquired under the free patent, homestead,
or individual sale provisions of this act, or any permanent improvement on such
land shall be transferred or assigned to any individual, nor shall such land or
any permanent improvement thereon be leased to such individual, when the area
of said land, added to that of his own, shall exceed one hundred and forty-four
hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any transfer, assignment or
lease in violation hereof shall be null and void.'</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>
provision constitutes one limitation on the transfer or lease of lands titled
under the provisions of the Public Land Act.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Simply stated, an individual cannot acquire either by sale, transfer,
assignment or lease, lands originally acquired under the free patent,
homestead, or individual sale provisions of Commonwealth Act No. 141 if the
total area of such acquisition added to his present landholdings exceed one
hundred forty-four hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To construe
the provision otherwise would render nugatory the rationale or philosophy which
underlined such a restriction which is to prevent the concentration of large
tracts of lands in the hands of a single individual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is only one recognized exception to
this and that is when the transfer or assignment is by means of hereditary
succession in which event the area limitation contained in Section 122 will not
apply.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As regards your third question on
whether the maximum area that an individual could acquire under Section 122 of
Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended has been amended from 144 to 24 hectares,
our reply thereto is in the affirmative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It will be stated as a preliminary
premise that the basis of the 144 hectare limit provided for in Section 122 of
the Public Land Act is the area stated in Section 22 of the same Act which is
also one hundred forty-four hectares.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The area limits set forth in these two sections of the act are based on
the constitutional limit contained in the 1935 Philippine Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the New (1973) Constitution in its
Section 4, Article XIV has chosen to reduce the original area that an
individual can purchase from one hundred forty-four (144) to twenty four (24)
hectares, it must follow as a matter of course that since January 17, 1973,
when the New Constitution went into full force, the maximum area of patented or
titled land that an individual can acquire is only such as-will not exceed
twenty-four (24) hectares including his present landholdings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With these premises, it is our considered
opinion that the maximum area that an individual could acquire under Article
122 of Commonwealth Act No. 141, as amended, has been amended or reduced to 24
hectares as provided for under Section 11, Article XIV of the 19 73
Constitution." (Annex K of Annex G of the petition.)</blockquote>

defendants' PETITION TO DECLARE PARTY IN CONTEMPT AND FOR EXECUTION dated 17
August 1978, most respectfully interpose the instant Opposition DENYING or
ADMITTING the material allegations thereof as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs ADMIT the allegations found in paragraphs 1 and 2
of the petition regarding the fact of presentation by the parties hereto of a
so-called Compromise Agreement between the parties hereto and its subsequent
approval by this Honorable Court and also in so far as the same alleges payment
to plaintiffs by defendant-vendees <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span> and Corazon B. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>
of the amounts provided therein. Plaintiffs, however, DENY, for reasons found
elsewhere in this pleading, the rest of the allegations thereof insofar as they
impute upon plaintiffs the obligation to execute a deed of conveyance over the
six (6) parcels of land subject matter of the three (3) above-entitled cases,
or insofar as they insinuate that such payments represent consideration for the
sale of such land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason for this
is plainâthat any such sale would be prohibited under the provisions of
Commonwealth Act No. 141, known otherwise as the Public Land Act, in
correlation with the 1973 Constitution, which prohibit the acquisition by any
citizen of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
of any lands of the public domain in excess of twenty four (24) hectares.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs DENY paragraph 3 of the petition of defendants
insofar as the same allege 'compliance' only on the part of defendants of their
alleged obligations under the so-called Compromise Agreement and failure and
refusal on the part of plaintiffs to execute certain 'actions they promised and
undertook to do' as indicating a lack of candor if not a gross misrepresentation
of facts before this Honorable Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fact is that as early as August 21, 1975, or the day following the
August 20, 1975 date of the Compromise Agreement and Decision of this Court
approving the same, plaintiffs-spouses Benjamin V. <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> H. <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>, in
compliance with and obedience to such Decision, immediately executed a Deed of
Absolute Sale in favor of defendants-spouses <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span> and Corazon B. <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span>
over Lots 'B-3' and 'B-4' (covered by Sales Patent No. 2521 and Original
Certificate of Title No. 12281 of the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
in the name of plaintiffs-spouses <span class="SpellE">Benajmin</span> V. <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> H. <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>), with the result that the latter-mentioned office
caused cancellation of the certificate /s of title in the names of said
plaintiff-spouses and entered two (2) new certificates of title in the names of
defendant-spouses.</blockquote>

Annex 'A', and made an integral part of this Opposition.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Much as it is plaintiffs' sincere desire to comply with the
remainder of what is incumbent upon them as provided in the aforementioned Compromise
Agreement, the same cannot, however, be done with impunity since, as will be
fully discussed elsewhere in this pleading, such an act is prohibited by the
law and the Constitution and therefore legally impossible of accomplishment.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs DENY the allegations of paragraph 4 of the
petition for lack of knowledge sufficient to form a belief as to the truth
thereof at the time of preparation of this pleading.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">IV</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs CONCEDE in principle the legal conclusion
expressed in paragraph 5 of the petition but DENY its applicability to the
cases at bar for reasons already outlined elsewhere in this pleading.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">V</p>

<blockquote>"Plaintiffs hypothetically ADMIT the
legal conclusion expressed in paragraph 6 of the petition, but DENY such
allegations therein insofar as they insinuate plaintiffs contumaciously refused
to comply with 'the order of the Court'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As plaintiffs shall endeavor to explain herein, ever since their
execution of the Deed of Sale, Annex 'A', plaintiffs have been actually taking
tedious, painful and time-consuming efforts and steps if only to determine once
and for all whether they are really bound to execute the deeds and acts
provided for in the Compromise Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As things have turned out, plaintiffs have now become more than ever
convinced that such acts as are proposed by defendants-spouses run counter to
public policy, thus prompting plaintiffs to exercise restraint in the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this be interpreted as a
refusal to comply with the remainder of what is allegedly incumbent upon them,
such refusal is, however, justified, for to direct plaintiffs to do otherwise
would be to command them to violate the fundamental law of the land, something
that neither the plaintiffs nor this Court cannot be privy to.</blockquote>

understanding of the plaintiffs' stand as outlined in the pleading at bar,
plaintiffs have deemed it essential and relevant to trace and bring forth to
the attention of the Honorable Court the origins of the six (6) lots
subject-matter of the compromise agreement presented in the three (3)
above-captioned civil cases.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The said six (6) lots originally formed part of that larger

350.6569 hectares for a period of 25 years from January 21, 1927 (or until
January 20, 1952) under the provisions of Act No. 2874.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the Lessee died sometime in the year 1942, and upon
petition of PASCUALA V. VDA. DE HIQUIANA as surviving wife of GAUDENCIO C.
HIQUIANA, the contract of lease affecting said 350-hectare parcel of land was
extended by means of an Order of Reconstitution and Renewal of Lease Contract
dated February 21, 1950 for another period of 25 years from and including
January 20, 1952, said application and extension granted being recorded under

<blockquote>"By authority of the Office of the Bureau of Lands secured,
and as per Lessee's request, the area covered under the above-mentioned lease
application was subdivided into four (4) lots, known as Lots 'A', 'B', 'C' and
'D', with the corresponding subdivision plan prepared, identified as Psd-34219,
approved by the Director of Lands on February 21, 1952.</blockquote>

Lots 'A', 'B' and 'D' of said subdivision plan Psd-34219 requesting that she
(Lessee) be allowed to purchase Lot 'C' thereof, that her daughter NATIVIDAD H.
GUIANG be allowed to purchase Lot 'B', that her son AURELIO HIQUIANA be allowed
to purchase Lot 'A' and that Lot 'D' be allocated to JULIA HIQUIANA.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing quoted respective pleadings of the
parties, what comes out as the basic question We are called upon to resolve is
whether or not the compromise agreement in dispute was void <span class="SpellE"><u>ab</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">initio</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And We do not hesitate to say that the answer to that question is
definitely in the affirmative or YES.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, in resolving the first issue between the parties, as
formulated by Us, We came to the inevitable conclusion that Section 122 of the
Public Land Act has been amended by the 1973 Constitution by reducing the area
of land acquired under the Act that could be transferred by any purchaser,
patentee or homesteader to only 24 hectares instead of the 144 hectares allowed
under the 1935 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, the
compromise agreement, executed on <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="8">August
 20, 1975</st1:date> and here in dispute, provides for the transfer of a total
of 146 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It inevitably follows
then that said compromise agreement contravenes not only a statute but the
fundamental law of the land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Adding to
its being contrary to law, which undoubtedly is also covered by the public
policy expressed in the Constitution, is the fact that private respondents, the
<span class="SpellE">Kintanars</span>, already owned at the time of the agreement
a lot of 29 hectares which they had acquired also from the government pursuant
to the Public Land Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such being the
situation, it is incontestable that under Paragraph (1) of Article 1409 of the
Civil Code said agreement is "inexistent and void from the beginning"
since its "object or purpose is contrary to law - - - or public
policy".</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is of no consequence,
pursuant to the same article, </span>that petitioners, the <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span>
spouses, executed on August 21, 1975, apparently in ratification of the
impugned agreement, the deeds of sale covering the two lots already referred to
and that petitioners actually received in part or in whole the money consideration
stipulated therein, for according to the same Article 1409, contracts
contemplated therein, as the one We are dealing with, "cannot be ratified
nor the defense of its illegality be waived." Neither is it material, much
less decisive, that petitioners had not earlier judicially moved to have the
same annulled or set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Article 1410 of the Civil Code, "(t)he action or <u>defense</u> for
declaration of the inexistence of a contract does not prescribe."</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, that is, as to the apparent delay in
petitioners' invocation of the inexistence or nullity of the agreement oft
referred to above, it is but meet to mention here, as somewhat of an added equitable
consideration in favor of petitioners, that as related in their opposition
quoted above, they realized or at least began to have apprehensions about the
validity of what they had done practically before the ink with which they
signed the agreement had dried.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is
conceded, albeit not in so many words, by private respondents in their
memorandum (p. 14).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in an effort
to have his misgivings verified, as <span style="">early
as </span><st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="9"><span style="">September 22, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, petitioner Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> wrote the
Commissioner of Land Registration relative thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately for petitioners, in cavalier
fashion, the Commissioner merely considered that the registration of the two
deeds of sale covering Lots B-3 and B-4, OCT 12281 was already a <u>fait
accompli</u> and like Pontius Pilate simply washed his hands off the matter.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Not contented with such official indifference
to a matter of constitutional importance, petitioners sought redress from the
Office of the President and the Department (now Ministry) of Justice and
lastly, the Director of Lands, who as already related earlier gave the opinion
favorable to petitioners, which We have earlier quoted herein approvingly.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners even went to the extent of filing
a charge of perjury against respondents on account of their obviously false
affidavit submitted to the Register of Deeds denying in effect the indisputable
fact that they were already then the owners of more than 24 hectares of land
acquired under the Public Land Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
criminal prosecution is still pending review in the Ministry of Justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notable, if not admirable, indeed, was the continuous, consistent
and unrelenting effort of petitioners to rectify a constitutional misstep they
had taken in rather hastily entering into the questioned compromise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That it may be said that they might have
thought at the time that it was a fair bargain does not in law minimize the
undeniable invalidity and contravention of public policy involved in their
act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To be sure, We can believe that a
judgment herein favorable to petitioners may result in material benefits to
them, but such probable contingency is merely incidental and should not blur
Our eyes in any degree to the matter of constitutional policy We are sworn to
pursue and implement.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- B -</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, inasmuch as private respondents have taken the
judicial initiative to try to enforce the agreement in dispute, or, in the
words of petitioners "jumped the gun on them" by filing a motion for
execution, of necessity, We have to go into the application in these instant
cases of the provisions, principles and jurisprudence regarding the doctrine We
might briefly refer to as <span style="">that of
"<u>in <span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span></u>".<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To start with, petitioners invoke not only Article 1416 of the
Civil Code but also the ruling of this Court in the leading case of Philippine
Banking Corporation vs. <span class="SpellE">Lui</span> She, 21 SCRA 52 in
support of their contention that the rule of <u>in <span class="SpellE">pari</span>
<span class="SpellE">delicto</span></u> is inapplicable to these cases, and,
therefore, they may recover the above-mentioned two lots, Lots B-3 and B-4, OCT
12281. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Article 1416 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 1416.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the
agreement is not illegal <u>per se</u> but is merely prohibited, and the
prohibition by the law is designed for the protection of the plaintiff, he may,
if public policy is thereby enhanced, recover what he has paid or
delivered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This article, it is imperative to note, allows recovery of what
has been paid or delivered pursuant to an inexistent contract only when the
agreement "(1) is not illegal <u>per se</u> but merely prohibited; (2) the
prohibition is for the protection of the plaintiffs and (3) if public policy is
enhanced thereby." Substantially, We may say, without the need of quoting <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, the foregoing postulation is what was applied by
Us in the Philippine Banking case.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Referring to the situation now before Us, there can be no doubt
that upholding the petitioners would enhance the public policy expressed in the
Constitution of limiting transfers of property acquired from the government to
only 24 hectares as well as that <span style="">implicit
in the provision of the Public Land Act prohibiting any citizen from acquiring
by purchase or homestead disposable public lands in excess of twenty-four (24)
hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It may also be said that these
limitations or prohibitions are intended for the protection of the actual
landholder or transferor or vendor-to-be because it safeguards him, for one
thing, against being more or less induced under certain circumstances to part
with his holding thru <span class="SpellE">importunings</span> or other <span class="SpellE">insiduous</span> devices or schemes and, for another thing, he is
enabled to work with peace of mind on his land and utilize the same for the
purposes for which he had acquired it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In regard to the
requirement that the agreement must not be illegal <u>per se</u>, it might be
contended that Our holding that the compromise under consideration is contrary
to public policy removes the recovery of the two delivered lots and the further
non-enforcement of the impugned orders of the trial court from the application
of Article 1416.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold it is not so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any act in violation of the limitations and
prohibitions herein involved is <span class="SpellE"><u>malum</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">prohibitum</span></u>, not <span class="SpellE"><u>malum</u></span><u>
in se</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An act or contract that is
illegal <u>per se</u> is one that </span>by <span style="">universally recognized standards is inherently or by its very nature
bad, improper, immoral or contrary to good conscience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other </span>hand, what is contrary to
public policy may not be necessarily universally so, for public policy, like
public interest, whether expressed in a Constitution or in any statute or
official declaraÂ­tion of the duly constituted authorities or evinced from the
situation or circumstances of the time concerned, is something dictated by the
conditions obtaining within each country or nation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, in respect to the very matter under
discussion, namely, the limitation and control of the disposition of lands of
the public domain, every government in the world can have its own distinct
policy suitable and peculiar to its internal interest, including the history
mores, customs and traditions of the people thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For instance, the provisions of our Constitution
and our laws covering such matter and the others relative to the conservation
of our natural resources exclusively for us, Filipinos, are easily
distinguishable from those of the Constitutions and laws of the United States,
Russia, England, Singapore, Malaysia, etc., etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the juridical concept of what is
illegal <u>per se</u> cannot be necessarily equated with what is contrary to
public policy in all instances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
cases at bar, the disputed compromise agreement is contrary to the public
policy embodied in our Constitution and the Public Land Act as amended by the
former since <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>,
but it is not illegal <u>per se</u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such may not be the case in other countries.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, nothing objectionable, <span class="SpellE">juridically</span>
speaking, lies in the way to having the prayer of petitioners granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since they are not, in terms of the <u>in <span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span></u> doctrine and
under the facts of these cases, the once trying to enforce an agreement
contrary to the public policy of our Charter and our laws, such circumstance that
they are the ones resisting the invocation of said doctrine is what makes their
posture more legally tenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As already
stated earlier, under Article 1410 of the Civil Code, "the action or <u>defense</u>
for the declaration of inexistence of a contract does not prescribe" just
as under Article 1409, "(n)either can the right to set up such defense of
illegality be waived." From which it is clearly implicit that one against
whom the doctrine is invoked may deny its application whether he be plaintiff
or defendant, or the <span class="SpellE">movant</span> or <span class="SpellE">oppositor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, private respondents are the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> for enforcement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We hold <span style="">that as <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> to such motion, petitioners are in the right in
putting up the defense that the agreement and orders sought to be enforced are
contrary to public policy and that the said agreement is not illegal <u>per se</u>,
hence, Article 1416 affords relief to them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- C -</p>

<p class="BODY">Having arrived at the foregoing conclusions, it follows
necessarily that the fact that private respondents cannot deny that on August
20, 1975, they were already the holders of a <span class="SpellE">torrens</span>
title over 29 hectares of land acquired by them by virtue of the Public Land
Act from disposable lands of the public domain, is a total bar to the
enforcement of the orders they are seeking, and this is the reason why We
cannot just reduce the 146 hectares under litigation to only 24 hectares, which
would have been legally possible, if private respondents' situation were
otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But able counsel for private
respondents would try to save their case by inviting our attention to the fact
that the original contracts of conveyance between the parties were entered into
prior to <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Those contracts are not the ones involved here.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is here in question is the compromise
agreement of August 20, 1975 which precisely and pointedly provides that
"the Agreement shall supersede all other agreements, contracts to sell and
other documents pertaining to the lots in question," for which reason the
only parties-in-interest to the instant proceeding have become exclusively
herein petitioners and respondents and none others, particularly, the children
of the <span class="SpellE">Kintanars</span>, notwithstanding their having been
parties in Civil Case No. Q-19573 of the trial court, as original purchasers.</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">- D -</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners suggest that to avoid entire invalidity of the
questioned agreement, it be construed merely as a lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are loath to follow the suggestion for the
simple reason that it is <span class="SpellE">juridically</span> doubtful how a
contract worded in the clearest tenor as one of transfer or conveyance of the
title or ownership of the property concerned itself could be construed as
merely a lease thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe and
so hold that it would be simplest and best to let the natural consequence of the
constitutional invalidity, which We here declare, of the compromise agreement
and of the decision based thereon as well as the subsequent orders of execution
of such decision be allowed to follow its natural course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By this is meant that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) the private respondents, the <span class="SpellE">Kintanar</span> spouses shall <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
to petitioners, the <span class="SpellE">Guiang</span> spouses, the two lots,
Lots B-3 and B-4 previously covered by OCT 12281 without any compensation but
solely by virtue of this judgment; (2) the petitioners shall retain the
remaining lots, Lots B-1 and B-2 covered also by OCT 12281 and Lots A-2 and A-3
covered by OCT 16465, without any obligation to convey the same to private
respondents, or, to put it the other way, private respondents may not compel
the petitioners or any of them, judicially or otherwise to convey to them
(private respondents) much less to any of the latter's children any of the lots
or lands aforementioned; and (3) instead of considering whatever private
respondents have paid not only under the contracts hereby invalidated but also
under the original transaction between the parties, the same should be deemed
as damages due petitioners for their inability to have possession of the lands
herein involved up to the time the judgment herein is complied with, at the
rate of Fifty Thousand (P50,000.00) Pesos a year from August 20, 1975.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, the petition alleges that only P240,000.00
have been paid by private respondents, albeit a higher figure is vaguely
alleged in the later pleadings of petitioners, and petitioners estimate the
rentals, if We should accept the theory of lease proposed by them, to be
P736,000.00 up to the present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
not inclined to accept those figures.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
are more impressed by the allegation on page 3 of private respondents'
memorandum that they have fully paid the P220,000.00 consideration stipulated
in the compromise in addition to P136,000.00 they had already previously paid
under the contracts that became the subject of the three cases that were
precisely attempted to be compromised on <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
are also inclined to accept as more reasonable the P50,000.00 estimate made by
private respondents of the net yearly yield of the lands in dispute.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing view We have taken of these cases now before
Us, We see no need to resolve the other issues discussed by the parties in
their memoranda and motions.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered granting the herein
petition and declaring the rights of the parties to be as they are stated above
in the paragraph preceding the penultimate one of the above opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Costs against private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</p>

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, Jr., Fernandez, <span style="font-style: normal;">and</span> De Castro, JJ.,<span style="font-style: normal;"> concur.<o:p></o:p></span></span><br>

What aggravates the action of the Commissioner is that he took for granted the

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result in that if the agreement be given effect
Sec. 122 of C.A. No. 141, as amended by C.A. No. 615 on <st1:date year="1941" day="5" month="5">May 5, 1941</st1:date>, will be violated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Kintanars already have 29 hectares of
land acquired under the Public Land Act (C.A. No. 141, as amended) and if they
acquire an additional 146 hectares of land which was also acquired under the
Public Land Act they will exceed the statutory limit of 144 hectares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In arriving at this conclusion I take note of
the fact that the 146 hectares sought to be conveyed to the Kintanars were
acquired subsequent to the amendment of Sec. 122 of C.A. No. 141 by C.A. No.
615 and are accordingly governed by the latter law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I am not prepared to say that Sec. 122 of
C.A. No. 141, as amended, has been further amended by Art. XIV, Sec. 4 of the
1973 Constitution in that the statutory limit has been reduced from 144 to 24
hectares only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the Gold
Creek case, it could be that the law governing conveyance of lands formerly of
the public domain should be governed by the laws extant at the time of their
acquisition.</p>
