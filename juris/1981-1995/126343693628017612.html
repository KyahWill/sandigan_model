				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">FULGENCIO MONTES Y GRAFIL alias "Fulgen" was convicted by
the court <i>a quo </i>for the rape of seven-year old Avelina <span style="">Y. </span>Bonga.  He was sentenced to <i>reclusion perpetua </i>and to indemnify
his victim in the amount of P30,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case
of insolvency, and to pay the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Avelina <span style="">Y. </span>Bonga
was born in 1981 to the spouses Francisco and Coleta Bonga of Paric,
Samar.  After Francisco died, Coleta
left for Saudi Arabia to work.  Before
leaving, she entrusted Avelina to her sister, Elena Y. Borja.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Coleta left her three (3) other daughters with their grandmother "Ayo
Yape" or "Apo Ayo."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the afternoon of 9 December 1981, Avelina went to the house of
her grandmother some 300 meters away from her aunt's residence.  At around five-thirty in the afternoon,
while Avelina was under the house of her grandmother playing with a cousin,
accused Fulgencio Montes, a 51-year old farmer, arrived.  He was a tenant in the nearby coconut farm
of Julita Alde.  Without a word, Fulgencio
grabbed Avelina and gagged her mouth.  Then he dragged her towards the coconut grove about 100 meters
away.  There he removed his pants and
then her panties.  He made her sit on
his lap, in squatting position, and inserted his penis into her vagina.  Avelina cried as she felt pain.  Then she noticed a whitish fluid coming out
of his penis after which Fulgencio stood up, gave her P1.00 and then told her
to go home as he would still gather coconuts.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Avelina went home.  She
told her sisters, later her aunt Elena, about what Fulgencio did to her.  The following morning, Elena and Avelina
reported the rape to the police.  At
three o'clock in the afternoon, Avelina was examined by Dr. Hilarion A.
Macapanas, Jr., OIC of the Eastern Samar Provincial Hospital.  His findings were:  External Examination – fairly developed, fairly well-nourished
child x x x no contusion or hematoma in the body; Genital Examination – fresh
laceration of the hymen at 7:00 o'clock; Microscopic Examination – vaginal
smear positive for spermatozoa; Conclusion – (1) genital injury noted on
Avelina Bonga and (2) vaginal smear positive for spermatozoa.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 December 1981, Elena Y. Borja, as guardian of Avelina,
filed a complaint for rape against Fulgencio.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused professes innocence.  His version is that he knew Avelina since she was born and that he lived
just 20 meters away from her grandmother's house.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> On 9
December 1981, he was <span style="">at </span>a
nearby coconut plantation gathering coconuts.  Then at three o'clock in the afternoon, it started to rain and so he
sought shelter in the house of Avelina's grandmother.  While he was sitting on <span style="">a
</span>step of the ladder, he overheard "Ayo Yape" scolding Avelina
because her mother did not send money.  Elena also arrived.  She was in
an angry mood.  Without any permission,
she took three coconuts from those he had earlier gathered.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Then he went back to the plantation where he worked until five
o'clock in the afternoon.  On his way
home, he saw Avelina playing but did not pay attention to her.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, Fulgencio claimed that Elena filed the
complaint against him because she was angry but could not accuse him of any
other <span style="">crime.  </span>Out <span style="">of </span>respect
for Elena and her mother, however, he chose not to sue Elena for theft of the
three coconuts.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Juan Barbo, another farmer, corroborated the <span style="">story </span>of Fulgencio and added that he
and Fulgencio arrived simultaneously at the house of Avelina's grandmother when
they sought shelter from the rain.  But
after the downpour, each went his own separate <span style="">way.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <i><span style="">a
quo </span></i>gave more credence to the prosecution, and on 23 October 1989,
rendered judgment convicting Fulgencio.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fulgencio contends in this appeal that the trial court erred in
finding him guilty of rape.  While he
does not question the medical findings, he denies being the rapist.  He theorizes that after the sexual assault,
Avelina could have been in such a state of shock that she could not positively
identify her attacker who, in all probability, could have been a stranger or a
mere passer-by.  Fulgencio claims that
Avelina's impressionable mind, she being only seven, was conditioned by her
aunt Elena to believe that he was her defiler because Elena "hated"
him enough to implicate him.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">This is untenable.  As
observed by the Solicitor General, the hatred which Elena supposedly harbored
against Fulgencio is a mere figment of the imagination.  If anyone should be irked it should be
Fulgencio because Elena took three heads of coconut from his stack without even
letting him know.  But assuming that Elena
was indeed furious at the accused, which is not adequately shown in the evidence,
such animosity could not be of such degree as to drive Elena to induce her
young, niece to falsely accuse Fulgencio of the dastardly act.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, we have the candid and forthright narration of
Avelina detailing how she was raped by Fulgencio.  Thus –</p>

<blockquote>ATTY TAN:</blockquote>

<blockquote>x   x   x   x</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q  </span>What did Fulgencio Montes do if any
when you saw him on the ground in the house of your grandmother at sitio Paric
x x x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  He took hold of me and dragged me to the coconut plantation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q     And what did Fulgencio
Montes do when you were already in the coconut plantation grove?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  He took off his pants and when he was naked he let me sat on his lap and
placed his penis inside my vagina.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  What else happened after Fulgencio Montes made you sat (sic) on his lap
and after he placed his penis into your vagina?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  After that he ordered me to go home, he gave me one peso and ordered me
to go home <span style="">x x x </span>x when I was at
home I was crying already.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x   x   x   x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  x x x When you were dragged by Fulgencio Montes towards the coconut
grove did you not resist?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  I did not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  Why didn't you, what did he tell you?<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>A  He was holding my hands and at the same time gagging my mouth.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  Did you make an outcry?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  I did not because my mouth was gagged.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  You said that Fulgencio Montes took off his pants and when he was naked
he placed his penis inside your vagina.  Why?   Were you not wearing panty
at the time?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  I had a panty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  What happened to the panty you were wearing?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  He took off the panty.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  What was the position of Fulgencio Montes when he allegedly placed his
penis inside your vagina?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  He was sitting.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  And what was your position then, how was he <span style="">positioned and </span>what was your position then?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  (Witness now demonstrating to the Honorable Court on a sitting,
squatting position).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  Were you seated on the lap of Fulgencio Montes?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q  Did you feel pain?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A  Yes, sir.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>sharp contrast,
Fulgencio's bare insinuation that Avelina was merely used by her aunt to falsely
implicate him in the crime of rape is totally absurd.  At the risk of being banal, <span style="">it
</span>is hard to believe that a maternal aunt would callously sacrifice her
niece and expose her to public scrutiny and the humiliation of a trial just to
appease her <span style="">rankled feelings.  </span>We are convinced more than ever that <span style="">Elena was motivated by an </span>earnest
desire to bring the rapist of her niece to justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the lame excuse that Fulgencio was at the house of
"Ayo Yape" during the alleged rape cannot prevail over Avelina's
categorical statement that it was he who dragged her towards the coconut grove
and placed his penis inside her vagina.  As he himself admitted, he has known Avelina since her infancy and they
were practically neighbors in sitio Paric.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, it is not difficult to see why the trial court believed
the testimony of a mere child.  The
reason is plain enough.  She was simply
telling the truth.  In a long line of
decisions, this Court has demonstrated its marked receptiveness to the
testimony of rape victims who are young and immature girls,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
like Avelina.</p>

<p class="BODY">In rape cases, the accused may be convicted solely on the word of
the complaining witness whose testimony is credible, natural and convincing.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, the testimony of Avelina was corroborated by her aunt Elena.  It was further strengthened by Dr.
Macapanas, Jr., who examined her one day after the rape and found a fresh
hymenal laceration as well as spermatozoa in her vagina which could have been
caused by the penetration of a male organ.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>This medical conclusion, coupled with
Avelina's testimony that Fulgencio placed his penis <span style="">inside </span>her vagina, is sufficient to establish the essential
requisite of carnal knowledge under Art. 335 of the Revised Penal Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The essence of statutory rape as provided in Art. 335, par. 3, of
the Revised Penal Code is the carnal knowledge of a woman below twelve years
old.  Sexual intercourse then with a
girl under twelve is always rape, and force, intimidation or physical sign of
violence is inconsequential.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Avelina then was only seven years old.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced beyond any cavil of doubt, as was the court <i><span style="">a quo, </span></i>that Fulgencio raped
Avelina in the afternoon of 9 December 1981.  Considering the very tender years of the innocent victim and the moral
depravity and debasement of the perpetrator, the civil indemnity of P30,000.00
awarded by the court below should be increased to P50,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>finding accused-appellant
FULGENCIO MONTES y GRAFIL alias "FULGEN" guilty of rape and imposing
upon him a prison term of <i><span style="">reclusion
perpetua </span></i>is AFFIRMED, with the modification that the civil indemnity
of P30,000.00 awarded to his victim, Avelina Y. Bonga, is increased to
P50,000.00.  Costs against accused-appellant.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
