May 18, 1988, of the National Labor Relations Commission ordering the
petitioner, Manila Electric Company (Meralco), to reinstate the complainant,
Ramon L. Meris, as a probationary employee for a period of five (5) months with
backwages from March 23, 1987 to April 17, 1987.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a complaint filed by respondent Ramon L. Meris against the
petitioner on March 30, 1987, the former charged the latter with illegal
dismissal and prayed for reinstatement with full backwages.  Petitioner's defense to the charge was that
"the termination of the complainant's probationary employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>sanctioned
by Section 6, Rule 1, Book VI of the Rules and Regulations implementing the
Labor Code, which provides that “the service of an employee who has been
engaged on probationary basis may be terminated x x x when he fails to qualify
as a regular employee in accordance with the reasonable standards prescribed by
the employer."</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the
case as found by the Labor Arbiter and adopted by the NLRC are as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>“x x x the complainant was hired by the respondent company as a
probationary employee under a probationary Employment Agreement for a period of
five (5) months starting November 17, 1986, wherein, he was assigned as a</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>messenger and given a monthly salary
of P1,130,00 and an allowance of P580.00.  His work among others, </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">was
</span>to file pleadings in court, serve summons for execution, verify or
follow-up cases in court and other related matters under the legal
department.  That on March 23, </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">1987 </span>(after 4 months)</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i><span style="font-size:8.0pt">*</span></i></span></a><i>,
he received a memorandum dated March 19, 1987, from the personnel
Administration Division advising him of the termination of his probationary
employment effective March 23, 1987.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"From the foregoing facts just stated, it behooves upon us
to determine whether the dismissal of complainant was for a just and valid
cause or not.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>"Respondent avers that the work activities of complainant
were monitored by his supervisors namely Guillermo F. Estabaya and Alfredo J.
Fernandez, who ‘</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">x x x </span>observed

that there were instances that he failed to report back at the close of the
office hours after performing his official tasks; that <u>he</u> <u>does</u></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <u>not</u> <u>follow</u> <u>instructions</u>;

dismissal illegal.  While it may be true
that complainant was hired on a probationary basis, yet -- we cannot deny him
the right to security of tenure which may be terminated only for a </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">just </span>cause or when authorized by
existing </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">laws </span>or when he
fails to qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards
made known to him upon his engagement.<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<blockquote><i>“As regards the claim of respondent that complainant usually </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">comes late </span>and that he often fails </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>return after an official outside
trip particularly on December 15 &amp; 24 1986; January 2; 5; 17 (Sat) 19; 20;
26; and 29; February 12; 16; 18; 24; 26 and 27; and March 2, 1987, respondent
failed to present complainant's daily attendance records allegedly because,
‘The daily attendance pads during the period November 20, 1986 to March 23,
1987 were </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not </span>being
retained </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">as </span>those </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">are </span>not being utilized for payroll </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">preparation; </span>hence these were disposed
of every end of the payroll period.’  The best proof </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">to </span>establish
that complainant's daily attendance leaves much to be desired would have been his
daily time records, but respondent was not able to submit these despite the
issuance of a subpoena duces tecum to them upon the request of complainant
himself, which to our mind militates against respondent’s </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">position </span>that

<p class="BODY">On December 28, 1987, the labor arbiter rendered judgment,
disposing as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>'WHEREFORE, premises considered, respondent Manila Electric
Company, with main office and postal address at Lopez Building, Meralco Center,
Ortigas Avenue, Pasig, Metro Manila, is</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

deduction." (pp. 129-130, Rollo; emphasis supplied.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This was affirmed on appeal by Meralco to the NLRC, but with the
modification that "appellant is ordered to reinstate complainant <u style="text-underline:words">as</u> <u style="text-underline:words">a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">probationary</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>employee</u> </span>for a period of five
(5) months with backwages from March 23, 1987 to April 17, 1987."</p>

<p class="BODY">The basis for the termination of private respondent's
probationary employment was his inability to meet the standard of performance
required of him.  Thus, the legality or
illegality of the dismissal hinges on whether or not that ground existed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In finding that private respondent was illegally dismissed, the
NLRC, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in </span>its decision of May 18,
1988, said:</p>

<blockquote><i>"It goes without saying </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">that it </span>behooves upon appellant to exercise and give more
freedom to probationary employees new as they are in the company and unaware of
the nuances of their work and work habits.  They need more attention.  And
they should, within the period of probation, be made aware of whatever mistakes
they commit in the performance of their duties.  The supervisor should personally confront them if they commit
mistakes.  And discipline them when
warranted.  It cannot be gainsaid that

appellee </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">as </span>probationary
employee could not cope up </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">with </span>his
work.  If he could not, then the
dismissal could have come earlier and respondent should not have waited </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">for </span>five (5)* months to terminate his
services.  As it is everybody, except
appellee, was informed of his evaluation." (p. 1</i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">67, </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></span></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the Office of the Solicitor General in its
comment stated as follows:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Private respondent was dismissed without prior hearing on
March 23, 1986, close to a month prior to the expiration of his probationary
term on April 17, 1986.  He was
dismissed on the ground that he failed to meet the </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">required standard performance.  As </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The petitioner assails these findings of the labor arbiter and
the NLRC.  It contends that the
dismissal of the private respondent was not illegal because it was done during
his probationary employment period after he was found unfit for the position of
messenger that he was occupying in the petitioner’s legal department.  Petitioner invokes Art. 280 of the Labor
Code which provides that:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Probationary Employment - Probationary employment </i><i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">shall</span></u></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> <u>not</u> </span><u>exceed</u> <u style="text-underline:words">six</u>
</i><i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">months</span></u></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>from </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">the </span>date the employee started working, unless it is covered by an
apprenticeship agreement stipulating a longer period.  The services </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span></i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">an </span>employee </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">who </span>has been engaged on a probationary
basis may be terminated for a just cause or when he fails to qualify as a
regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards made known by the
employer to the employee at the time of his engagement."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">We find meri</span>t in<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">petition.  </span>The very
findings of fact of the labor arbiter and respondent NLRC reveal that the
private respondent’s superiors in the petitioner's legal department where he
was employed as a messenger, were dissatisfied with his performance.  He was neglectful of his duties.  He frequently "played hookey,” taking
the rest of the day off and not returning to the office after having performed
his errands.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC gravely abused its discretion in holding that the
dismissal of the private respondent after a probationary period of five (5)
months instead of six (6), as provided in Art. 280 of the Labor Code, was
illegal, and in ordering his reinstatement as probationary employee for a
period of five (5) months, or a total of nine (9) months of probationary
employment.  The provision of Art. 280
that "probationary employment shall not exceed six (6) months" means
that the probationary employee may be dismissed for cause at any time before
the expiration of six (6) months after hiring.  If after working for less than six (6) months, he is found to be unfit
for the job, he can be dismissed.  But
if he continues to be employed longer than <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">six </span>(6) months, he ceases to be a probationary employee and
becomes a regular or permanent employee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that private respondent's superiors did exert
reasonable efforts to instruct him and apprise him of "the standard of
performance required and explained to him" but “he frequently did not
follow what was instructed for him to accomplish." "Notwithstanding
efforts and instructions x x x his performance was very below what was required
of him." He was also uncooperative toward his co-employees; and
disrespectful to his superiors.  Under
the circumstances, we find there was sufficient cause for terminating his
probationary employment after only four (4) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, as he was never apprised of the charges against him
before he was actually discharged, and no administrative investigation was
undertaken so he could have presented his side and defended himself, the
company is liable to indemnify him for damages for its breach of the legal
procedure.  In Wenphil vs. NLRC, G.R.
No. 80587, Feb. 8, 1989, we ruled that said damages shall be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the sum of P1,000.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> is
granted.  The decision of the National
Labor Relations Commission ordering the reinstatement of the private respondent
as a probationary employee for a period of five (5) months with backwages is
hereby set aside.  However, the
petitioner is ordered to indemnify the private respondent for damages in the
sum of P1,000.  No costs.</p>
