repeatedly stressed in the majority of appeals in criminal cases, an appellate
court gives great weight to the factual findings of trial courts and accords
them respect if not finality unless the appellant is able to show that the
trial court overlooked or disregarded matters of substance which, if
considered, would very likely change the results. (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Egas</span>, 137 SCRA 188; People vs. Rosario, 134 SCRA 496)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is very hollow and obviously self-serving.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stronger proof is needed to overcome the following </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">findings </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of the trial court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Central to the evidence of the case at bar is the very
testimony of Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Braulio</span></span><span class="GramE"> <span class="SpellE">Basco</span> - as the poseur buyer in the
'Buy-Bust operation' conducted by the team led by Capt. Gabriel <span class="SpellE">Payle</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
such testimony was strongly reinforced by the testimonies of the other members
of the team, including Capt. <span class="SpellE">Bayle</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the buy-bust operation they have
conducted zeroed in the accused in his trading business of marijuana leaves in
that particular area of this city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True
enough this kind of business can <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">only </span>be
effectively busted through an informer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All these declarations are in convergence to common knowledge - and
observation of man.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The narration of
events by the prosecution's witnesses are positive, credible, probable and
entirely in accord with human experience.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It bears all the earmarks of truth that it is extremely difficult for a
rational mind not to give credence to it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They testified in a clear, precise, positive, and straightforward manner
and even under a rigid <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">cross-</span>examination
conducted by the defense and soul searching questions asked <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by </span>the Court did not disturb the very
essence of their testimonies.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The defense of alibi and complete denial put-up by the
accused cannot prevail over the clear, explicit and positive identification
made by all the prosecution's witnesses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"No jurisprudence in criminal cases is more settled than the
rule that alibi <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>the weakest
of all defenses and that the same should be rejected when the identity of the
accused has been sufficiently and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">positively </span>established by eyewitnesses to the
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alibi is easy to concoct and
difficult to disprove.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs.
Pizarro 131 SCRA 418) Otherwise stated, alibi is a reason with a bad
reputation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People vs. <span class="SpellE">Canete</span> 125 SCRA 452)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sad to state, the other decisive factor which militates very
heavily against the theory exposed by the accused was when he readily admitted
the source of the 25 grams of marijuana leaves that he sold to Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Basco</span></span><span class="GramE"> the poseur
buyer.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He led the team to the
house of his sister-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>, and there they found the following articles, namely:</blockquote>

last items were even surrendered by the accused and his sister-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Loreta</span> <span class="SpellE">Sunga</span>." (pp. 27-28, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The other error assigned
by appellant refers to his extrajudicial confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
B) <span class="GramE">which</span> he claimed should be disregarded because of
its involuntariness and because he made it without the presence and advice of
counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At any rate, even if his
