				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">In an information filed by the City Fiscal of Cavite City with the Regional Trial Court of Cavite, Crisostomo Bugaoan&nbsp; y Ignacio alias "Tom", was charged with ILLEGAL RECRUITMENT IN A LARGE SCALE allegedly committed as follows:<br><blockquote>"That on or about the period comprising February 11, 1987 to March 24, 1987, in the City of Cavite, Republic of the Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, representing himself to be the President/Manager of the CIB International, an unlicensed recruiting firm, falsely manifested that he has the power and capacity to recruit and employ applicants for overseas employment and could facilitate the issuance and approval of the necessary travel papers in connection therewith, did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and knowingly induce, in a large scale, the following applicants, to wit:&nbsp; Reynaldo C.

(Original Records, p. 1)</blockquote>Upon arraignment, the appellant pleaded NOT GUILTY.&nbsp; In the course of the trial, the complaint was amended to include as complainants Benjamin Alejo and Danilo R. Miralles.&nbsp; When arraigned, the appellant again pleaded NOT GUILTY.<br><br>To prove&nbsp; the guilt of the appellant, the prosecution presented as witnesses the complainants.<br><br>Dionisio Basmayor testified:&nbsp; Sometime in February, 1986, he was introduced to the appellant by a certain Rosie Asistores who was his friend.&nbsp; The appellant went to his house and promised to send him to Japan as factory supervisor with a monthly salary of $1,000.00.&nbsp; On February 11, 1986, he gave the appellant P15,000.00 as fee for the "preparation of all travel documents like passport, visas and others" (TSN., October 5, 1987, p. 5) and the appellant issued a receipt.&nbsp; All in all, he gave the amount of P78,000.00 to the appellant.&nbsp; After receiving the money, the appellant promised that Basmayor would leave in three weeks time or at the latest, in three months time.&nbsp; Later on, he did not see the appellant anymore.&nbsp; When he heard that the appellant was detained, he went to the police station to file a complaint with respect to the money taken from him.&nbsp; (TSN., October 5, 1987, pp. 2-7) He also testified that the appellant's office - CIB International Promotion and General Services - was located in front of his house at 686 Del Pilar Street, Caridad, Cavite City and that appellant occasionally asked him to come to his office "to assist him." (TSN., October 5, 1987, p. 11)<br><br>Medardo Valerio, Reynaldo Reyes and Renato Gonzales testified to the following:&nbsp; Sometime in February, 1987 they applied at CIB International Promotion and General Services for work abroad.&nbsp; The appellant promised them that they could go to Japan as factory workers for a monthly salary of $500.00 each.&nbsp; The appellant asked money to process their travel documents.&nbsp; Valerio was able to give the appellant P3,500.00 for which he was issued receipts (Exhibits "A", "B", "C" and "D").&nbsp; Reynaldo Reyes was able to give him a total amount of P3,000.00 also evidenced by receipts issued by the appellant (Exhibits "B", "C" and "D").&nbsp; Renato Gonzales was able to give a total amount of P3,500.00 also evidenced by receipts issued by the appellant (Exhibits "A", "B", "C" and "D").&nbsp; The appellant disappeared without fulfilling his promises to them.<br><br>Rufino Pascua, a teacher, testified:&nbsp; On February 16, 1987, he together with his brother-in-law Reynaldo Imperial applied for work abroad at the CIB International Promotion and General Services.&nbsp; The appellant promised them jobs at Maling Industry in Japan with a monthly salary of $500.00 each.&nbsp; The appellant asked for P8,000.00.&nbsp; Pascua and Imperial gave P4,500.00 each to Basmayor in front of the appellant.&nbsp; When they could not leave as scheduled on February 28, 1987, they demanded the return of their money.&nbsp; The appellant promised to return their money and executed a promissory note dated April 23, 1987 promising to pay the total amount of P9,000.00 on or before May 12, 1987 (Exhibit "7") but the appellant never returned the money and disappeared.&nbsp; (TSN., October 12, 1987, pp. 13-46)<br><br>Corazon Sabal&nbsp;&nbsp; testified that her son Medardo Bigalbal applied for work abroad at CIB International Promotion and General Services.&nbsp; The appellant asked for a placement fee in the amount of P8,000.00.&nbsp; She gave him an initial payment of P3,000.00 after which she paid P2,000.00 and P1,600.00 successively.&nbsp; The appellant promised her that Medardo could leave after paying in full the placement fee, but Medardo was not able to leave as the appellant disappeared.&nbsp; (TSN., November 3, 1987, pp. 2-16)<br><br>Benjamin Alejo, a tricycle driver, testified that on March 7, 1987, the appellant went to their barrio Bagong Pook to recruit construction workers for Saudi Arabia promising a monthly salary of $600.00 per worker.&nbsp; Three (3) days later or on March 10, 1987, the appellant returned.&nbsp; Alejo applied, giving appellant P6,000.00 borrowed from his aunt, a sister of his mother.&nbsp; The appellant told him and all the others who applied that their date of departure would be known the next month.&nbsp; They waited for him to come back.&nbsp; They next saw him at the police station when he was apprehended after which Alejo filed his complaint against the appellant.&nbsp; (TSN., February 9, 1988, pp. 2-10)<br><br>On the other hand, the appellant denied the charges against him.&nbsp; According to him, sometime in January 1987, he was introduced to complainant Dionisio Basmayor, Jr., by Rosie Asistores who accompanied Basmayor to his residence to ask help "in order to process their papers in going to Japan as tourist." (TSN., March 21, 1988, p. 3) He stated that he was experienced on the matter because he was a former employee of Las Palmas International Shipping Corporation.&nbsp; He then went to Basmayor's residence upon the latter's invitation during the second week of February 1987 and was introduced to Basmayor's family.&nbsp; He denied receiving money from Basmayor since the latter did not comply with the requirements.&nbsp; He also denied meeting the complainants.&nbsp; According to him, he came to know them only at the fiscal's office and again in court.&nbsp; He also denied that he signed the receipts presented by the complainants to prove the monies taken from them.&nbsp; He, however, admits his connection with CIB International Promotion and General Services (CIB) by stating that:<br><br><table  ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="14%"><div align="justify">"Q </div></td> <td width="86%"><div align="justify">There appears a word below the name Crisostomo Bugaoan CIB International, do you know what is CIB International?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">“A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes sir, I know this.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What does it mean?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">That CIB International Promotion and General Services.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Do you have any connection with the CIB International Promotion and General Services?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Yes, sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What is your connection with that CIB company or firm?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">I am starting to establish that company CIB International Promotion and General Services.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">For what line of business is CIB International and Promotion Services will be engaged in?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">One is janitorial services, buy and sell for several means of livelihood.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">On February 11, 1987, was the CIB International Promotion and General Services already operating or still in the planning stage?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">None, yet.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What do you mean none yet?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">During the month of February, CIB International Promotion and General Services was not yet established in Cavite City." (TSN., March 21, 1988, pp. 8-9)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>Finally, the appellant stated that Dionisio Basmayor was not connected with the CIB.<br><br>The Court found the accused guilty beyond reasonable doubt of Illegal Recruitment in Large Scale and he was sentenced to a prison term of <span style="font-style: italic;">reclusion perpetua; </span>to pay a find of P100,000.00 without subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency; to indemnify the offended parties Reynaldo Imperial the amount of P4,500.00; Rufino B. Pascua the amount of P4,500.00; Ricardo Bigalbal the amount of P7,200.00; Renato 0. Gonzales the amount of P3,500.00; Medardo M. Valerio the amount of P3,500.00 and Dionisio Basmayor the amount of P15,000.00 and to pay the costs.&nbsp; (<i>Rollo</i>, p. 33)<br><br>The appellant now claims that he should be acquitted on the ground of reasonable doubt.&nbsp; He contends that the prosecution's evidence is weak and doubtful since he was not positively identified by the complainants to have received their money.&nbsp; He maintains that it was complainant Basmayor who took the complainants' money "whose motives then are suspect." The appellant's posture is belied by the evidence on record.<br><br>The appellant's denial that he never knew the complainants until he met them at the Fiscal's office and later in court is far from the truth.&nbsp; The complainants positively identified him as the one who recruited them for work abroad.&nbsp; Thus, all the complainants were one in saying that they applied for work at CIB which the appellant admits he has established.&nbsp; It was the appellant whom they talked to regarding the fees they have to pay in order that they can leave for work abroad and it was the appellant who gave them the information as to when they would leave for their respective placements abroad.<br><br>It would seem, however, that with respect to the payment of fees, the appellant oftentimes asked Basmayor, who was always with him to receive the money.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the complainants testified that whenever this happened, the appellant was always present but demanded that the complainants give the money to Basmayor.&nbsp; On cross-examination, complainant Renato Gonzales testified as follows:<br><br><table  ="" width="85%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="9%"><div align="justify">"Q </div></td> <td width="91%"><div align="justify">A while ago you described before this Court that you gave the amount of P3,500.00 to Dionisio Basmayor?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">No, Basmayor was the one who received.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">To whom did you give?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I was giving the money to Mr. Tom Bugaoan but he won't accept and he told me to give it to Mr. Basmayor.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">“Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Did you not tell us a while ago that you did not see in his room because it was closed and you only assumed that he was there?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">Before we gave the money we were able to talk to him and he told us you go outside and give it to Jun.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"Q</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">So, you are now changing your testimony Mr. Witness, why did you not tell us that fact when I was asking you before the presence of Bugaoan and you told us that you only assumed that he was there inside the room because in some previous times you were able to enter the office and you saw Bugaoan there?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">I said that.

Pascua, Jr., and Mr. Reynaldo B.
