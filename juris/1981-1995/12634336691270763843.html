				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petition seeks to set aside and annul the decision of the
National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) signed by former NTC Commissioner
Jose Luis Alcuaz dated November 14, 1989 as well as the order dated July 16,
1990 of the NTC <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 16, 1987, Eastern Telecommunications Philippines, Inc.
(Eastern) filed with the NTC, an application (docketed as NTC Case No. 8758)
for a Certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to construct,
maintain and operate an International Digital Gateway Facility (IDGF).  In its application, Eastern alleged that it
is a domestic corporation and that it has the franchise to land, construct,
maintain and operate telecommunications systems by cable, or any other means now
known to science or which in the future may be developed for the reception and
transmission of messages to and between any point in the Philippines to point
exterior thereto..." (R.A. 5002)</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 22, 1987, NTC issued a notice of hearing, requiring
publication of Eastern's application and submission of financial and technical
requirements and setting the case for initial hearing on May 31, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 23, 1988, petitioner Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Company (PLDT) filed an "Opposition to Main Application and to Prayer for
Provisional Authority" dated June 20, 1988 based primarily on the
following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  Since PLDT already
operates and maintains three (3) international gateway switching facilities or
exchanges and will construct and operate by the year 1989 a new large-capacity international
digital exchange in Metro Manila, ETPI's proposed international digital gateway
constitutes a needless and wasteful duplication of facilities and an
improvident expenditure of dollars, contrary to public policy and detrimental
to the public interest;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)  ETPI is basically an
international data or record carrier and as such it has no local telephone
exchanges or much less a telephone network of its own in the Philippines;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)  ETPI's proposal to
operate its own international gateway is a device, scheme or strategem to
exploit PLDT's domestic telephone network and expand its inordinately lucrative
business as a telephone correspondent;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)  ETPI's proposed
international gateway will only enable ETPI to relegate to lesser importance
its primary obligation to operate as a record carrier, obtain at the expense of
PLDT an increasing but undeserved share in revenue from international telephone
traffic, for ETPI will ride piggy-back on PLDT's own nationwide telephone
network, and undermine the viability of PLDT's programmed new large-capacity
international digital gateway;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5)  There will be
substantial diminution and stunted growth of PLDT's revenue from its
international toll services vis-a-vis its huge investments for its ongoing
development projects; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>6)  The establishment of
ETPI's proposed international gateway is contrary to the international practice
to have one or more gateways of single ownership.” (Rollo, pp. 224 to 225)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On July 8,1988, PLDT served on Eastern a “Request for Admission
and Interrogatories" which was answered by Eastern on August 9, 1988.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 31, 1988, NTC issued an order defining the issues for
trial on the basis of the respective formulations of issues by Eastern and
PLDT.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the scheduled hearing on September 14, 1988, PLDT filed a
Motion to Dismiss Eastern's Application, questioning the jurisdiction of the
NTC to hear and decide the application upon the ground that Eastern was
disqualified by its franchise from acquiring the CPCN applied for.  After protracted debate between the parties,
the NTC denied the Motion to Dismiss and the trial proceeded.</p>

<p class="BODY">On various hearing dates, Eastern and PLDT presented their
respective documentary and testimonial evidence.  Thereafter, both applicant Eastern and oppositor PLDT filed
extensive memoranda in support of their respective positions.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 10, 1989, NTC <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u> ordered that
hearing be conducted for the purpose of propounding clarificatory questions to
Eastern and PLDT.  Afterwhich, per order
dated November 3, 1989, the case was considered submitted for final resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 10, 1989, the NTC through Commissioner Jose Luis A.
Alcuaz rendered a decision granting Eastern's application.  The dispositive portion reads as follows:</p>

decision dated Oct. 13, 1989, pp. 12-15; NTC Case No. 87-149; Annex
"A")</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Commissioner Alcuaz signed the decision on November 10, 1989 and
released the same to the NTC Secretariat on November 14, 1989.  Thus, the decision was entered into the NTC
docket on November 14, 1989.  Also on
the same day, Eastern was served with a copy of the decision by Commissioner
Alcuaz in his NTC office.  The next day,
Eastern submitted its "acceptance" of the terms and conditions
specified in the decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">A day later, on November 15, 1989, the NTC received a letter
dated November 13, 1989 from the Office of the President addressed to
Commissioner Alcuaz stating that he had been replaced as head of NTC.  President Aquino stated that she was
designating Undersecretary of Transportation Josefina T. Lichauco as acting
Commissioner of the NTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 3, 1990, the NTC <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u> issued an order
directing its board Secretary formally to release copies of the NTC decision
dated November 14, 1989 to the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">PLDT then filed a "Motion To Declare So-Called Alcuaz
Decision Void/Inexistent" as well as a motion for reconsideration of that
decision.  After further pleadings and
counter pleadings, the NTC by an order dated July 16, 1990 En Banc denied the
PLDT motions assailing the validity of the said decision and confirmed the
November 14, 1989 decision signed by Commissioner Alcuaz.</p>

ITSELF IN TELEPHONE SERVICES BY TAKING UNDUE ADVANTAGE OF PLDT'S PRESENT
TELEPHONE SYSTEM AND OPERATION." (Petition, pp. 13-14)</p>

<p class="BODY">The basic issue is whether or not the rendition of the assailed
NTC decision and order was attended by grave abuse of discretion amounting to
lack of jurisdiction on the part of the NTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">1.  Eastern filed its application
for a CPCN to operate an IGF with the NTC on the basis of its franchise granted
by law under R.A. 5002.  It is
undisputed that the proposed IGF is nothing else but an international telephone
exchange.  (OSG Comment, p. 13) It is an
equipment that is a component or constitutive element of a voice or telephone
system rather than a non-voice or data service.  Since an IGF is useful only for a telephone system, NTC cannot
validly grant Eastern the CPCN it seeks because of franchise limitations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The specific rights and privileges granted to Eastern are recited
in Section 1 of R.A. 5002 which reads in full:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 1. There is hereby granted to ‘The Eastern Extension
Australasia and China Telegraph Company, Ltd.' its successors and assigns,
hereinafter referred to as the 'Grantee' <u>a</u> <u>franchise</u> <u>to</u> <u>land,</u>
<u>construct,</u> <u>maintain</u> <u>and</u> <u>operate</u> <u>telecommunication</u>
<u>systems</u> <u>by</u> <u>cable,</u> <u>or</u> <u>any</u> <u>other</u> <u>means</u>
<u>now</u> <u>known</u> <u style="">to</u> <u>science</u> <u>or</u>
<u>which</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>future</u> <u>may</u> <u>be</u> <u>developed</u>
<u>for</u> <u>the</u> <u>reception</u> <u>and</u> <u>transmission</u> <u>of</u>
<u>messages</u> <u>between</u> <u>any</u> <u>point</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>Philippines</u>
<u>to</u> <u>points</u> <u>exterior</u> <u>thereto,</u> including airplanes,
airships or vessels even though such airplanes, airships or vessels may be
located within territorial limits of the Philippines.” (Underlining supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the foregoing that the privilege so granted by
the legislature was for the construction, operation and maintenance of
communications systems for the transmission of messages by cables or means
other than telephone.  This is a
significant distinction from the legislative franchise in <u>PLDT</u> <u>v.</u>
<u>National</u> <u>Telecommunications,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al.</u> (190 SCRA 717
[1990]) where the franchise of Express Telecommunications Co. specifically used
the word "radiotelephony."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondents contend that the law does not make any
distinction between voice and non-voice transmission of messages.  Since a "message" is any written
or oral communication or other transmitted information sent by messenger or by
some other means (as by signals) and "gateway" is the point of entry
and exit for inbound and outbound international messages (data as well as
voice) the respondents argue that there is no question that Eastern is
qualified to own and operate its own international gateway facility or
telephone exchange for receiving and transmitting messages between any point in
the Philippines to any exterior part thereto or abroad (OSG Comment, p.14)</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of any qualification or intention to the contrary,
the technical, not the general or ordinary meaning of a word used in a statute
should be adopted in the construction of the statute.  (Agpalo, Statutory Construction 1986, p. 138) This is
particularly true in this case.  The
word "message", as used in the franchise and in the telecommunication
industry has a peculiar meaning when used with reference to communication
systems.  The literal or common meaning
can not be applied to key words in a franchise for highly technical and
scientifically advanced services so as to broaden a legislative grant beyond
its plain and intended meaning.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with PLDT's contention that no one "transmits"
on the telephone his or her "message".  Telephone technology precisely eliminates the intermediary role
of a messenger (human or mechanical) by allowing the calling and the called
parties, respectively, to directly communicate with one another.  A party need not "transmit" any
"message" through cable to be received and given to the other
party.  This procedure of sending <u>data</u>
(the "message") by cable transmission is characteristic of a
telegraph but not of a telephone system.  Thus, when RA 5002 speaks of a "telecommunication (system) by
cable... for the reception and transmission of messages," it can only be
referring to a record or data service such as a telegraph system.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is not the product, effect or end result, nor the act of
receiving and transmitting messages which is given a franchise.  It is the <u>system</u> used, the facility
established, and the entire network whose costs run into hundreds of millions
of pesos which is given legislative approval.  A radio-television company, a computer-network, a cable system, a postal
system, a package and message delivery firm, and many other schemes for
broadcasting and communicating messages, information, and entertainment are all
engaged in the reception and transmission of messages.  But to say that their franchises tan be
interpreted to include a telephone exchange system is to strain interpretation
into incredulous limits.</p>

<p class="BODY">Franchises are always interpreted <u>strictly</u> against the
franchise holder, never liberally and certainly not in a strained and
exaggerated manner.  (Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. v. National Telecommunications Commission, 190 SCRA 717
[1990]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The legislative history of the law granting Eastern's franchise
is most instructive and belies the arguments of Eastern.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eastern is actually not the original grantee of the franchise
under RA 5002.  It acquired its
franchise from Eastern Extension Australasia and China Telegraph Co., Ltd., a
foreign corporation organized and existing under the laws of Great Britain which
was engaged in international telecommunications in Manila since Spanish
times.  This company was given a
concession for the construction, operation and maintenance of a submarine
telegraph cable from Hongkong to Manila.  On June 21, 1952, when the concession expired, RA 808 was approved
granting a legislative franchise "to land, construct, maintain and operate
at Manila in the Philippines a <u>submarine</u> <u>telegraph</u> <u>cable</u>
connecting Manila with Hongkong."</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 2, 1967, R.A. 808 was amended by R.A., 5002 by enlarging
the scope of the franchise granting Eastern Extension Australasia a franchise
to land, construct, maintain and operate telecommunications by cable or other
means known to science or which in the future may be developed for the
transmission of messages between any point in the Philippines to points
exterior thereto.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 24, 1974, P. D. 484 was issued by President Ferdinand E.
Marcos authorizing Eastern Extension Australasia to transfer and assign the
franchise granted to it under R.A. 808, as amended by R. A. 5002 to the Eastern
Telecommunications Philippines, Inc. (Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Court
of Tax Appeals, 195 SCRA 444 [1991])</p>

<p class="BODY">The original legislative grant was a franchise for a submarine
telegraph (not telephone) cable.  The grantee
upon whom Congress vested the franchise was a telegraph and not a telephone
company.  From 1952 until the franchise
was assigned to Eastern and, in fact since Spanish times, it's predecessor
never operated any telephone service.  The assignment of the franchise contemplated only what the transfer
could convey which is a telegraph system.  And even from the time of the transfer in 1974, Eastern never operated
telephone service.  Eastern has always
been aware of the limits of its franchise and the exact nature of its
operations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The clear intention of the law granting the franchise cannot be
disputed.  If Congress had contemplated
the use of telephone, the law would have stated so.  Undeniably, telephone technology was already existing in 1952
when R. A. 808 was enacted.  To construe
the phrase "telecommunication system by cable or <u>any</u> <u>other</u>
means <u>now</u> <u>known</u> <u>to</u> <u>science</u> <u>or</u> <u>which</u> <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>future</u> may be developed for the reception and transmission of
messages" so as to include telephones is well-nigh preposterous.  Indeed, telephones did not have to be
discovered or developed.  They were not
for the future.  They were already
existing at that time.  As held in <u>De</u>
<u>los</u> <u>Santos</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Mallare</u> (87 Phil. 289 [1950]), the
history of the times and state of things when the act was framed must be
followed.  Conditions of the things at
the time of enactment of the law should be considered to determine the
legislative intent.  (Gomez Garcia v.
Hipolito, et al., 2 Phil. 732 [1903]; United States v. De Guzman, 30 Phil. 416
[1915])</p>

<p class="BODY">Eastern's franchise was intended from the beginning and has been
interpreted to cover only record or data telecommunications services.  This is bolstered by the fact that at
present, Eastern is the holder of various CPCN's from the NTC to operate only non-voice
telecommunications services.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.  The only opportunity
when Eastern had anything to do with voice communications was in 1977 when
President Marcos authorized it to be a correspondent of telephone
administrations in Singapore, Taiwan and Hongkong.  Eastern wrote Malacañang for approval and the President placed a
marginal note on the letter telling Eastern to go ahead.  Notwithstanding this authority given by
President Marcos, the act of the President did not amend the legislative
franchise and is of doubtful validity.  The marginal note is certainly not in the exercise of the President's
legislative power.  It was never
published and could not have amended or enlarged an act of Congress.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eastern, meanwhile, capitalizes on this marginal note on its letter
to show that it is also engaged in voice communication.  It, therefore, asserts that PLDT is now
estopped to question the franchise limitation of Eastern since PLDT entered
into an agreement with Eastern involving international telephone service in 1978
(Letter-Agreement dated September 29, 1978, Exhibit "O", ETPI
Comment, pp. 8-9)</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is specious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The alleged assent of PLDT to Eastern's operation as a
"voice correspondent" is contained in an agreement extracted from
PLDT at a time when it could not have resisted such a Presidential
imposition.  PLDT never intended to
voluntarily recognize the validity of Eastern's voice correspondentship.  This is shown by the fact that after the
former President had been removed from office, PLDT refused to implement the
agreement.  PLDT can not therefore be
deemed in estoppel under these circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that Eastern agreed "to limit itself to
correspondent relationship for voice traffic" can not be taken to mean
that Eastern may operate a telephone service now.  Its franchise does not authorize it to do so.  NTC Circular No. 3-06-88 dated March 16,
1988 provides that "no Certificate of Public Convenience (CPC) can be granted
by this Commission to a person or entity who does not hold any valid franchise."</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> Significantly, in its
July 29, 1988 answer to a request for admission and interrogatories in NTC Case
No. 87-50, Eastern admitted that it does not and has never operated any
telephone exchange or network in the Philippines and has no decision or order
from any regulatory commission granting it a certificate of public convenience
to operate a telephone exchange or network in this country.</p>

<p class="BODY">This alone shows that Eastern was then fully aware of its
franchise limitation that it can not operate a domestic telephone or
telecommunications system.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eastern, however, asserts that it is not asking for authority to
install and operate a <u>domestic</u> telephone or telecommunications
system.  The international gateway
facility it proposes to undertake is understood as a system which would mediate
between the domestic telephone system of PLDT and the trasmitting and carrying
facilities of Eastern.  The gateway
facility will permit messages originating from a person using PLDT's domestic
telephone system to enter the transmitting and carrying facilities of Eastern,
as well as messages incoming from abroad through Eastern's carrying facilities
to enter PLDT's domestic system.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, there is a need to interconnect with PLDT's domestic
telephone network as ordered by the NTC.  Eastern's expounded services would be useless if it cannot mainly use
the existing PLDT grid.  Interconnection
as the term denotes, contemplates or relates to the linkage of two existing
telephone companies with one another in order to allow the subscribers of one
system to access or reach the subscribers of the other operator.</p>

<p class="BODY">Interconnection is proper only between two legitimate companies
with valid legislative franchises and not between an international message
transmission company and a legitimate telephone firm as in the case at
bar.  Eastern's franchise can not be
strained or distorted to enable it to become a carrier's carrier.  Certainly, an interconnection system requires
a specific franchise.</p>

<p class="BODY">While PLDT has franchises for both domestic and international
telephone services, Eastern has none.  The pretense that it does not need any to tap into an existing domestic
telephone network is misleading.  Unless
it utilizes PLDT's domestic network, the gateway facility or telephone exchange
of Eastern would be completely useless.  This is the meaning of interconnection whether termed
"interfacing" or some other name.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the absence of legislative authority to operate a telephone
system, it was therefore grave abuse of discretion for NTC to order Eastern to
interconnect with PLDT.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.  Eastern had no use for
a "gateway facility" in its many decades of operations in the
Philippines.  Only when it decided to go
into the telephone business as an expansion of its "message
transmission" business because of various hi-tech developments did it
suddenly need a gateway facility and read into its franchise something which
was never there.  The use of gibberish
and esoteric jargon and such high sounding technical terms as analog or digital
levels, interfacing with broadband transmission, switching maintenance, traffic
operations, network maintenance management, transmission center, etc. can not
disguise the fact that a gateway facility is part of a telephone system and that
Eastern wants to engage in combined international and substantially extensive
domestic <u>telephone</u> services without any legislative authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">The proposed gateway facility by interconnecting with PLDT's
domestic telecommunications network will enable local subscribers to talk
directly with users of telephones abroad.  It is in effect a long distance telephone exchange system.  Eastern will charge long distance telephone
rates and collect from local subscribers who use its services.  This is a far cry from its franchised
business of being an international carrier of messages to and from its
terminals or landing stations.  It will
be engaged in domestic services from the gateway or exchange to the local
telephone user and international services from the gateway to the foreign
country.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eastern has no telephone system in the Philippines or anywhere
else in the world.  It does not have a
single telephone subscriber.  Yet, it
has been authorized by NTC to open a telephone exchange connecting PLDT
subscribers with telephone systems around the world.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.  In <u>Commissioner</u>
<u>of</u> <u>Internal</u> <u>Revenue</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Tax</u>
<u>Appeals</u>, (<u>supra</u>), this Court accepted the submissions of Eastern
that it is engaged <u>exclusively</u> in international communications and
international commerce.  We ruled that
its legislative franchise was granted on the <u>premise</u> that its operations
are international and what it has in the Philippines is a terminal or station
only.  Eastern argued and this Court
agreed in a case involving domestic tax assessments that the company operates
only a cable station or a terminal in the Philippines and does not fall under
the citizenship requirements of the Constitution.  We ruled that the Court "is not prepared to punish the respondent
corporation which remained firm in not violating its franchise."</p>

<p class="BODY">Eastern was firm in not violating its franchise when domestic tax
assessments were in issue.  Not so when
it comes to expanding its business into an entirely different and fast-growing
profitable field.  It is now adopting an
entirely new position.  In big
advertisements in all major newspapers around May 15, 1992, Eastern advertised
as its first line of business, direct dial and cellular international telephone
services.  We see no reason why the
Court should suddenly fall for specious and deceptive arguments and come out
with findings and conclusions diametrically opposed to its earlier decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">6.  The main reason far
our decision is legal.  Eastern has no
franchise.  It must first go to
Congress.  An additional point, however,
is that there is no urgent public need for the establishment of another IGF.</p>

<p class="BODY">PLDT puts forth the argument that at present it has five (5)
existing gateway facilities to meet the needs of the people but NTC
nevertheless approved Eastern's application in the event that PLDT's operations
might be suspended i.e. labor dispute, fortuitous event, technical causes etc.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its order of July 16, 1990, the NTC states that:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x [W]ith PLDT's cut-over of its
Makati gateway facility it will have a total of 4575 international switch
termination.  The combined capacity of
the new international gateway operators, namely Philcom and ETPI will only
amount to <u>33%</u> <u>of</u> <u>PLDT's</u> <u>capacity</u>.  It is the Commission's position that <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>event</u>, therefore, <u>that</u> <u>any</u> <u>of</u> <u>PLDT's</u>
<u>gateway</u> <u>facilities</u> <u>become</u> <u>inoperative</u>, relief can
be provided by the gateway facilities of Philcom and the applicant.  The possibility that any two of the gateway
operator's facilities would fail at the same time is very remote.  xxx" (Underlining supplied, page 12,
Order - Annex "B" of petition)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>" x x x The Commission is also
convinced of the economic viability of another gateway operator and that
authorizing applicant is not unnecessary and wasteful duplication.  The grant to another operator of another
international gateway would <u>provide</u> <u>for</u> <u>excess</u> <u>capacity</u>
<u>which</u> <u>will</u> <u>take</u> <u>care</u> <u>of</u> <u>any</u> <u>abnormal</u>
<u>increase</u> <u>in</u> <u>the</u> <u>international</u> <u>traffic</u> <u>which</u>
<u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>expected</u> <u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>trend</u> <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> <u>economic</u> <u>activities</u> in the country.  xxx." (Underlining supplied; p. 13,
Order, Annex "B" of petition).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The proposed combined facilities of applicants Eastern (NTC Case
No.87-149) which will be thirty-three percent (33%) of PLDT's capacity are
intended to "provide relief" in the event any of PLDT's gateway
facilities become inoperative and to provide excess capacity to "take care
of any abnormal increase in international traffic."</p>

<p class="BODY">NTC's fear is more illusory than real.  In PLDT's 63 years of existence, it could only point to one
outage of consequence at the PLDT gateway which took place in November
1987.  But this did not even <u>totally</u>
disrupt PLDT's international operations.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not see how the common good may be served when there are
other remedies available which are less costly and more expedient than
constructing and maintaining a sixth gateway in a stand-by capacity which would
function only in the extreme case that the other five (5) gateways may
shutdown.</p>

<p class="BODY">7.  Finally, NTC's
reliance on free competition in the industry is to allow a private purpose for
gain to masquerade behind a noble policy against which nobody can dissent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Citing the recent case of <u>Philippine</u> <u>Long</u> <u>Distance</u>
<u>Telephone</u> <u>Co.</u> <u>v.</u> <u>National</u> <u>Telecommunications</u>,
<u>supra</u>, that "neither PLDT nor any other public utility has a
constitutional right to a monopoly position", PLDT has never claimed as a
right the power to exclusively operate IGF's in the Philippines.  In fact, Philippine Global Communications
(PHILCOM) was granted a CPCN to operate another IGF in NTC Case No. 87-149
under Philcom's legislative franchise, R.A. 4167.  (See Urgent Motion Reiterating Prayer for a Temporary Restraining
Order, p. 2) But the indubitable fact is that PLDT has invested billions of
pesos over decades of operating, maintaining and improving the country's telephone
system.</p>

<p class="BODY">Eastern had been in the Philippines long before petitioner PLDT
was incorporated and commenced business.  Eastern and PLDT existed peacefully together for decades because they
had separate franchises for different and specific purposes.  Only when Eastern tried to muscle into
PLDT's turf did litigation arise.  What
Eastern is trying to accomplish is to ride piggy back on the existing
infrastructure built and developed by PLDT.  It is competing with PLDT's gateway facilities but in order to compete,
it must interconnect with PLDT's domestic network.  It will become what is known in the business as a carrier's
carrier.  This is even worse than what
Justice Isagani A. Cruz characterized in <u>Philippine</u> <u>Long</u> <u>Distance</u>
<u>Telephone</u> <u>Co.</u> <u>v.</u> <u>National</u> <u>Telecommunications</u>
<u>Commission</u> (<u>supra</u>) through his story of the little red hen who
found some rice but none of the barnyard animals would help her plant, water,
harvest, and finally cook it.</p>

<p class="BODY">PLDT has existing gateway facilities which are used by its own
domestic telephone subscribers.  The
records do not show any urgency for another company, especially a
non-franchised one, to operate a similar facility for exactly the same people
without having spent a single centavo to build up the domestic system.  The proposed international gateway will not
add a single telephone unit to existing phones in the country.  We fail to see how a non-franchised
telephone system will improve telephone services in the Philippines through the
proposed scheme.  There will be a
diversion of profits to Eastern, but no additional telephone anywhere and no
improvement of services.  Unless, like
the proverbial camel in the desert poking its head into a tent, Eastern
proposes to later expand into other profitable areas of the telephone business
and starts installing its own phones.  Eastern should first go to Congress, get its own franchise, and prove
that it can really contribute to more efficient telephone services instead of
merely riding piggy back on the most profitable aspect of another company's
operations.</p>

<p class="BODY">I must record my dissent.  In my view, the majority decision is profoundly flawed and can scarcely
be contemplated without deep foreboding by those who believe in the basic policy
principle of free competition rather than monopoly in the area of
telecommunications so vital for economic and social development.  In my view, and this is submitted with great
respect and reluctance, the majority has uncritically embraced an eccentric
interpretation urged by the PLDT, an interpretation with absolutely no legal or
other basis, save PLDT's own bare assertion.  This is commonly known as "boot-strapping" or self-levitation,
something which the Court, in other contexts, has vigorously rejected.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The extraordinary interpretation peddled by the PLDT is in fact contradicted by
PLDT's own legislative franchise, something overlooked by the majority.  What must not be lost sight of is that
PLDT's highly selective arguments are designed solely to frustrate the NTC's
order to interconnect PLDT's domestic system with Eastern's proposed
international gateway facility and thereby to protect and further expand PLDT's
monopoly position in the Philippine telecommunication industry.  In fact, PLDT seeks to overturn in whole or
in part the landmark decision written by Mme. Justice Ameurfina M. Herrera for
the Court less than two (2) years ago in <u>Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co. v. National Telecommunications Commission, et al</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, PLDT in effect asks us to disregard the explicit provision in its own
legislative franchise, which became law after the Herrera decision, authorizing
the NTC to order PLDT to allow interconnection of its facilities, for local and
international communications, with other telecommunications operators.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent Eastern Telecommunications Philippine, Inc.
(Eastern) filed, on 16 July 1987, with the NTC an application for a Certificate
of Public Convenience and Necessity (CPCN) to construct, maintain and operate an
International Gateway Facility (IGF), which is estimated to cost US$5
Million.  Eastern is a 60% Filipino
owned corporation<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
organized under Philippine law and holder of legislative franchise under R.A.
No. 808, as amended by R.A. No. 5002, in relation to P.D. No. 489 granting the
right and privilege to:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x land, construct, maintain and operate <u>telecommunication</u>
systems by <u>cable</u>, or <u>any other means now known to science</u> or
which <u>in the future  may be developed</u>
for <u>the reception and transmis­sion of messages between any point in the
Philippines to points exterior thereto</u>, including airplanes, airships or
vessels even though such airplanes, airships or vessels may be located within
‘territorial’ limits of the Philippines." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Eastern is successor to Eastern Extension
Australasia and China Telegraph Company, a British company which had been in
the Philippines since the Spanish colonial period.  Together with other companies, Eastern invested in the
Philippines US$25 Million in submarine cable and related facilities, and
installed, owns, maintains and operates submarine cables between the
Philippines and Hongkong-Japan, the Philippines and Taiwan, and the Philippines
and Singapore.</p>

<p class="BODY">We turn first to the scope of the franchise authority of Eastern.  The contention of PLDT so precipitously
embraced by the majority, appears to be that an IGF is inherently part of
"a telephone system" since it is "useful only for a telephone
system." Thus, PLDT contends that in effect Eastern is asking for a CPCN
to establish a <u>telephone</u> system.  But Eastern has no franchise to establish a telephone system.  Hence, PLDT continues, Eastern cannot be
granted the CPCN it seeks.</p>

<p class="BODY">The IGF facility which NTC authorized Eastern to install and
operate, is described in the following technical terms, in the NTC decision of
14 November 1989:</p>

<blockquote>"A.  System Components</blockquote>

<blockquote>The international gateway shall consist of the international
switching maintenance center (ISMC), international transmission center (ITMC),
international network maintenance management center (INMC), and traffic
operations center (TOC).  The ISMC shall
provide the switching operations including the maintenance thereof.  The ITMC shall provide for the international
links and the maintenance of the international circuits.  The INMC shall see to it that traffic [is]
routed via the best route possible.  The
management of the entire network is undertaken by the INMC.  The traffic operations center shall be where
the positions are situated.  The TOC
shall among others provide for operator-assisted international calls.</blockquote>

<blockquote>B.  System Capability</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  The proposed ITMC shall
be equipped to accommodate terminating circuits as well as transit
facilities.  It shall have the
capability to interface with domestic broadband transmission and switching
networks operated by other carriers either the analog or digital levels.  It will also provide cost effective manner
of terminating/ processing and cross connecting digital capacities.  It is designed to support transmission
standards for ISDN channels.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  The proposed ISMC shall
be fully ISDN compatible switching system that will carry both broadband and
voice band message, data and information switching.  It will support various international telephone signalling equipments,
i.e., C5, C6, C7 as well as transparent circuit switching and data/records
signalling protocols.  It can also
provide manual switching capability both for voice and non-voice services.  It will also be equipped to act as a tandem
switch providing the international switching interface to domestic service
carriers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  The INMC shall be
equipped with the latest in network management technology that can perform
automatic rerouting of circuits and quick mapping of capacities while ensuring
a minimum degree of interruption.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.  The proposed gateway
shall initially be capable of switching international telephone traffic to
countries where applicant has international correspondents."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Drawing upon the glossary of epithetical
jurisprudence, my learned brother Gutierrez, Jr., <u>J</u>. has disregarded the
foregoing technical specifications as "gibberish and exotic jargon"
and as "high sounding" and then proceeds to state that the above
description "cannot disguise the fact that the gateway facility is part of
a <u>telephone</u> system and that Eastern wants to engage in combined
international and substantially extensive <u>domestic telephone system</u>
without any legislative authority."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
But epithets are no substitute either for rational argument or for technical
specifications.</p>

<p class="BODY">What I understand from the foregoing technical description by the
NTC is that an IGF comprises equipment which makes possible the interfacing or
interconnection between a domestic telecommunication system, like that of PLDT,
and the cables or other equipment for transmitting electronically messages from
points within the Philippines to points outside the Philippines, as well as
messages originating from points outside to points inside the Philippines.  The IGF constitutes a telecommunications
exchange that in effect connects PLDT's subscribers or users with the
subscribers and users of telecommunications systems located in different parts
of the outside world.  The IGF is not in
itself a telephone or telecommunication <u>system</u> but it is not, in any
case, necessary to try to determine what constitutes a <u>telephone</u> system.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, the existing legislative franchise of Eastern
authorizes it to land, construct, maintain and operate "<u>telecommunications</u>
<u>systems</u>" for the purpose of effecting "the reception and
transmission of messages between any point in the Philippines to points
exterior [to the Philippines].” "<u>Telecommunication</u>" is, in
itself, a comprehensive term. Etymologically (<u>tele</u> [from the Greek] +
communication),<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
it means simply <u>communication over distance</u>, making <u>no</u> limiting
reference to the means or mode of such communication.  In the second place, the legislative franchise of Eastern itself <u>expressly</u>
elaborates that the "<u>telecommunication</u> systems" which Eastern
may install, maintain and operate may be "by <u>cable</u> or <u>any other
means now known to science</u> or which <u>in the future may be developed</u>."
It is very difficult to craft language more comprehensive in scope than the
foregoing phrase.  Clearly, the species
of method or the particular modality of <u>reception</u> and <u>transmission</u>
of messages across the territorial boundaries of the Philippines was of
secondary importance to the legislative authority which granted the
franchise.  In the third place, there is
<u>no basis at all in Eastern's legislative franchise</u> for a supposed
distinction (which PLDT tries very hard to suggest) between voice and non-voice
transmissions or messages and for a supposed limitation upon Eastern to
transmit and receive only non-voice messages.  The statute simply does <u>not</u> distinguish between voice or oral and
data or non-voice messages or transmissions:  the statutory text speaks simply of "<u>messages</u>." There
is a basic and well-known scientific reason why the statute makes no such
distinction.  Voice messages do not
travel via wires (cables whether submarine or underground or aerial) or any
other media <u>qua</u> voice (i.e., as sound waves); voice transmissions,
exactly like data (or non-voice) messages, travel in the form of electronic
impulses through cables (or any other media) and are simply converted at the
point of reception or destination into other forms visually or audibly
perceptible by human beings.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fourthly, PLDT's own legislative franchise provides no support
for the highly selective reading that PLDT would place upon the word "<u>telephone</u>
system."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
The portion of PLDT's legislative franchise defining the scope of PLDT's
franchise authority does <u>not</u> even use the word "telephone"
(except in referring to PLDT by name) nor the phrase "<u>telephone</u>
system;" <u>instead the oft-repeated and operative term is
"telecommunications</u>." It is not by accident that PLDT advertises
itself in the broadcast media as a <u>telecommunications company</u> rather
than as a telephone company.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
<u>Even the original 1928 legislative franchise of PLDT did not limit a
"telephone company" to the transmission and reception of voice or
oral messages</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Fifthly, and perhaps most importantly, Eastern in its application
was <u>not</u> asking for authority to install and operate a <u>domestic</u>
telephone or other telecommunications system, understood as a system for carrying
messages from one point in the Philippines to another point also in the
Philippines.  Eastern was merely asking
for authority to install and operate an <u>international</u> gateway facility,
which would mediate between the domestic telephone system of PLDT and the
transmitting and carrying facilities of Eastern.  The gateway facility will permit messages originating from a
person using PLDT's domestic telephone system to enter the transmitting and
carrying facilities of Eastern, and as well messages incoming from abroad
through Eastern's carrying facilities to enter PLDT's domestic system.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, there is no lack of legal authority on the part of
Eastern to install, maintain and operate the IGF that it seeks.  The point has been succinctly put by the Solicitor
General in his Memorandum for public respondent NTC:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x Since a 'message' is any 'written or <u>oral</u>
communication or other transmitted information sent by messenger or by some
other means (as by signals)' (Webster's Third New International Dictionary,
1971 ed., p. 1418), and 'gateway' is the point of entry and exit for inbound
and outbound <u>international</u> messages (data as well as voice) (tsn., Jan.
12, 1989, pp. 96-97), there is no question that under its franchise, [Eastern]
is qualified to own and operate its own international gateway facility for
telephone messages between any point in the Philippines to any point exterior
thereto, or abroad.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In other words, while [Eastern], due to franchise limitations,
cannot operate a <u>domestic</u> telephone network, it is not legally
disqualified from operating an <u>international</u> telephone exchange or
gateway facility.  Certainly, there is
no law, rule or regulation which requires that an international gateway
operator must at the same time be a domestic telephone operator.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>In other countries, it is not unusual for ownership and
operation of international gateways to be vested in the international operator,
not the domestic operator</u>.  There,
the international telephone exchange operator is <u>not</u> the domestic
telephone operator.  This is true, for
example, in the <u>United States, Japan, Canada, Australia</u> and <u>Thailand</u>
(TSN, September 29, 1989, pp. 7-9)."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring partly in the original and partly supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other issues proffered by PLDT are so peripheral that my brother
Gutierrez, Jr. himself did not address them.  From another point of view, it is important to note the conclusion
reached in the 15-page decision of the NTC:</p>

<blockquote>"After careful consideration of all the evidence submitted in
this case, pro and con, the Commission is convinced that applicant is <u>legally</u>,
<u>technically</u> and <u>financially capable</u> to install, operate and
maintain an international digital gateway facilities incorporating
transmission, switching and traffic operations facilities.  The Commission is also convinced that while
there may be complexities involved in interconnection and in having three (3)
operators of an international digital gateway, it finds out that <u>another
system is technically and economically feasible</u>.  The Commission is fully convinced that <u>the advantages of
installing</u>, operating and maintaining another gateway by another carrier <u>outweighs
the disadvantages</u> and that <u>ultimately, public interest will be served
and the growth, development and expansion of telecommunications services in the
country will be accelerated</u>.  For
lack of merit, the opposition of PLDT is hereby OVERRULED.”<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, the NTC did not only address the <u>legal
capability</u> of, or franchise authority vested in Eastern;<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
it also explicitly considered the technical requirements of the IGF and
acknowledged the <u>technical</u> and <u>financial ability</u> of Eastern to
install, maintain and operate the facility.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In attacking the NTC decision, what PLDT was apparently really trying
to say was that the NTC had failed to indicate the necessity or desirability of
another international digital gateway facility, considering that PLDT itself
already owns and operates three (3) IGFs.  Implicitly, PLDT's contention appears to be that to grant Eastern's
application for another facility would be to approve an unnecessary duplication
of facilities.  The NTC addressed this
broad contention in the following manner:</p>

<blockquote>"As testified to by the applicant, the establishment by it of
a new international digital gateway <u>will complement existing as well as
planned switching and transmission</u> to provide <u>continuity and security</u>
of international service <u>in the event of major facility failure</u>.  It will use the <u>latest digital technology</u>
and incorporate the <u>most modern very large scale integrated (VLSI) circuit
technology</u> which will result in a <u>significant reduction in per
termination installed capital costs</u>.  This will result in <u>more efficient</u> and <u>less expensive</u>
switching, operational and maintenance costs thru <u>benefiting both national
carriers and telephone subscribers</u> in the Philippines.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Applicant strongly advances that the Philippines will be the direct
and principal beneficiary of [Eastern's] proposed gateway since the <u>existing
facilities will be enhanced</u> and the role of the <u>Philippines as a major
telecommunications center for international traffic</u> will be
maintained.  Since applicant is
technically and financially capable of constructing, maintaining and operating
international gateway; that its proposed gateway facility is technically and
operationally feasible, and <u>that PLDT by its acts and conduct appears to
have [the] intention to take</u> <u>over the business of [Eastern]</u>, it is <u>imperative</u>
to the <u>stability and survival of  [Eastern] as an international telecommunications carrier</u>; that it be
able to establish and operate its own international gateway."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, in its 16 July 1990 Order, the NTC said:</p>

<blockquote>"As to the allegation that the decision did not consider PLDT's
evidence, the same is inaccurate.  The
brief prepared by the Technical and Financial Staff of this Commission and the
discussions held by the staff with the then Commissioner which were the basis
of the conclusion/decision took into consideration the volumes of evidence
presented by all parties.  It also took
into consideration the fact that <u>with PLDT's cut-over of its Makati gateway
facility it will have a total of 4575 international switch termination.  The combined capacity of the new
international gateway operators, namely Philcom and ETPI will only amount to
33% of PLDT's</u> capacity.  It is the
Commission's position that <u>in the event</u>, therefore, <u>that any of
PLDT's gateway facilities become inoperative, relief can be provided by the
gateway facilities of Philcom and the applicant</u>.  The possibility that any two of the gateway operator's facilities
would fail at the same time is very remote."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above quoted NTC order makes clear that, while PLDT complains
strenuously about having to compete with Eastern and Philippine Global
Communications (the other two international gateway operators granted authority
by the NTC), in fact NTC is very protective of PLDT.  For the approved <u>combined</u> capacity of the gateway
facilities of <u>Philcom</u> and <u>Eastern</u> will amount to <u>only
one-third (1/3) of PLDT's existing gateway capacity.</u>  PLDT was obviously not satisfied with
two-thirds (2/3) of the international end of telecommunications business.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that additional compelling considerations support
the Decision and Order of the NTC which would make possible the establishment
of alternative international gateway facilities -- that is, non-PLDT-owned
facilities.  During the hearings before
the NTC, it was brought out that PLDT had in the past suffered a major facility
breakdown, resulting in the disruption of long distance telephone service
between the Philippines and the outside world.  On 9 November 1987, for instance, such a breakdown occurred with the
result that 85% of the country's telecommunications to and from the outside
world were out of commission for about 17 to 18 hours.  Again, on 21 December 1987, a nationwide
strike paralyzed PLDT operations, threatening the security and reliability of
international communications between the Philippines and the rest of the world.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Undeniably, the availability of alternative gateway facilities when
interconnected with existing local telephone networks (including but not
limited to PLDT's own network and gateway), will substantially increase the
reliability and continuity of international telecommunications service in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">  Still another
consideration, fully reflected in the record of this case, supports the
decision reached by the NTC.  PLDT, in

In 1988, PLDT unilaterally stopped collect?call service from the
Philippines to Hongkong in an attempt to pressure Cable Wireless Hongkong (the
telephone administration in Hongkong) to appoint PLDT as its Philippine
correspondent, to the prejudice, in particular, of families and friends of
Philippine overseas workers in Hongkong who rely substantially on such
service.  The NTC had to order PLDT to
restore the collect-call service through a Memorandum dated 13 April 1988.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
This utilization of its monopoly position was delicately described as
"business leverage" by PLDT First Vice President Ramon Santiago in
his testimony during the hearings.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record also shows that PLDT exercised its power or
"leverage" based on its gateway monopoly position to compel Eastern's
telephone correspondents in Singapore and Taiwan to accede to dual correspondentships.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We turn to the issue of interconnection between PLDT's domestic
telephone system or network and Eastern's IGF.  PLDT strenously contends that interconnection is proper <u>only</u>
between two (2) discrete <u>telephone</u> systems; this argument makes clear
why PLDT contended so arduously that Eastern was not a telephone system and
therefore not entitled to apply for interconnection with PLDT's system and that
NTC was not authorized to require such interconnection between PLDT and
Eastern.  PLDT went on to contend that
interconnection with Eastern "was not directed to meet or satisfy a public
need for it but rather, and exclusively, to allow [Eastern] to exploit PLDT's
present telephone subscribers."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, <u>PLDT's contention collides frontally with
Section 13 of PLDT's own legislative franchise</u>.  Section 13 of R.A. No. 7082 reads:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 13 The National Telecommunications Commission is hereby
authorized, after due notice and hearing, <u>to order the grantee [PLDT] to
allow interconnection</u> of its facilities, for both <u>local and
international, with other duly authorized telecommunications operators</u> and <u>conversely
of the former with the latter under such terms and conditions as the Commission
may deem proper and reasonable in the interest of public good</u>." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, there is no physical or technical or
economic basis for restricting the notion of inter-­connection to the linking
up of two (2) separate <u>telephone</u> systems.  Section 13 of PLDT's own franchise makes clear that interconnection
may, and in fact does, relate to connecting or linking up a telephone or other
telecommunications system and telecommunications facility for transmit­ting
messages from the Philippines to points outside the Philippines and vice
versa.  The NTC found <u>as a fact</u>
that interconnection can be physically and technically effected between a
gateway facility operated by an international carrier and a telephone or other
telecommunications system operated by another, local, carrier.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
Eastern pointed but that its IGF can be and <u>is required to be interconnected
not only with the PLDT domestic telephone system but also with other domestic
telecommunications systems</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, PLDT, exhibiting extraordinary proprietary
feelings in respect of people using its telephone system, managed to ignore
that international calls from the outside world will be transmitted into the
Philippines through Eastern's cable system and IGF and fed into PLDT's and
other national domestic telephone systems.  The number or frequency of calls originating from outside the
Philippines as compared with the frequency of calls originating within the
Philippines, does not appear in the record.  Considering, however, among other things, the number of Filipinos living
or working overseas in different continents, and the growing business and
financial relations between Philippine enterprises and international companies,
international calls from the outside world may well be at least as heavy in
volume and might in fact be or become heavier, than those originating from the
Philippines.  In other words, there may
be expected reciprocal flows in a higher aggregate volume of international
traffic and more efficient service, at more moderate cost, should come about
with the interconnection required by the NTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company v. National
Telecommunications Company, et al</u>.,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
PLDT made comparable argument in resisting an NTC interconnection order.  In overruling these objections, the majority
of the Court, speaking through Melencio-Herrera, <u>J</u>., said:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x Such regulation of the use and ownership of
telecommunications systems is <u>in the exercise of the plenary police power of
the State for the promotion of the general welfare</u>.  The 1987 Constitution recognizes the existence
of that power when it provides:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Sec. 6.  The use of
property bears asocial function, and all economic agents shall contribute to
the common good.  Individuals and
private groups, including corporations, cooperatives, and similar collective
organizations, shall have the right to own, establish, and operate economic
enterprises, subject to the duty of the State to promote distributive justice
and to intervene when the common good so demands (Article XII).’</p>

<blockquote>The <u>interconnection</u> which has been
required of PLDT <u>is a form of "intervention" with property rights
dictated by "the objective of government to promote the rapid expansion of
telecommunications services</u> in all areas of the Philippines, x x x <u>to
maximize the use of telecommunications facilities available</u>, x x x in
recognition of the vital role of communications in nation building x x x and <u>to
ensure that all users of the public telecommunications service have access to
all other users of the service wherever they may be  within the Philippines at an acceptable standard of service and
at reasonable cost</u>" (DOTC Circular No. 90-248).  Undoubtedly, the encompassing objective is
the common good.  The NTC, as the
regulatory agency of the State, merely exercised its delegated authority to
regulate the use of telecommunications networks when it decreed
interconnection.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is important to note that Eastern, contrary to PLDT's
egregious pleading, does not seek, nor has it been allowed by NTC, a "free
ride" on PLDT'S (domestic) telephone network. The IGF will be paid for by
Eastern itself.  Revenues derived from
international calls originating from, or destined to, a subscriber in PLDT's
telephone network are required to be <u>shared by Eastern with PLDT</u> in
proportions to be negotiated and <u>agreed upon between PLDT and Eastern with
the approval of NTC</u>.  There is, in
particular, no "appropriation" of property of the PLDT without
payment of just or reasonable compensation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is also appropriate to note, along with my brother Gutierrez,
Jr., <u>J</u>., that the other non-PLDT IGF which has been approved by the NTC,
the Philippine Global Communications Company, Inc. (Philglobcom) gateway
facility, has in fact been installed, interconnected with PLDT's domestic
telephone network and is presently in operation.  We must assume, therefore, that not only was interconnection
found physically and technically feasible, but also that an economically
acceptable sharing of revenues between PLDT on one hand and Philglobcom on the
other, was in fact reached and is being implemented.  The majority opinion, curiously, does not assail the legislative
franchise authority of Philglobcom, but, however, fails to point to any
relevant distinction between the Philglobcom franchise authority and that of
Eastern.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Through the egregious interpretation urged by PLDT and, in some
measure not yet fully clear, unfortunately adopted by the majority in the
instant case, PLDT seeks to monopolize the external transmission and reception
of telecommunications messages, i.e., <u>the sending and receiving of such
messages across the boundaries of the Philippines</u>.  The argument made by PLDT, when adopted so
unfortunately by the majority of this Court, will result in local users of PLDT
telephones having no choice but to go to PLDT <u>even for the external portion
of international telecommunications</u>.  Presumably, PLDT cannot object if its subscribers were to walk to
offices or branches of Eastern and there to make direct telephone calls to
countries outside the Philippines.  Yet
PLDT, would prevent its own subscribers from using any IGF and facilities for
transmission and reception of international messages, <u>except those owned by
PLDT</u>.  PLDT is here treating its
subscribers as its proprietary assets to be "exploited"<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
by PLDT alone, rather than as customers to be served in the manner that a
public utility is supposed to serve the public.  Both local subscribers of PLDT or any other domestic telephone
system, as well as callers from across the oceans, should be accorded a
choice.  The fundamental point is that
customers' choice and competition among carriers are essential if reasonable
prices and efficient and satisfactory service are to be maintained and the
public's needs adequately served.</p>

Communications, Inc., hereinafter referred to as the grantee, the right and
privilege of constructing, maintaining and operating <u>communica­tions systems
by radio, wire, satellites, and other means now known to science or which in
the future may be developed for the reception and transmission of messages
between any point in the Philippines to points exterior thereto</u>, including
airplanes, airships or vessels, even though such airplanes, airships or vessels
