				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">The Court is called upon, in this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, to resolve the conflicting claims of the parties on the meaning of the term "fugitive from justice" as that phrase is so used under the provisions of Section 40(e) of the Local Government Code (Republic Act No. 7160).&nbsp; That law states:<br><br><blockquote>"SEC. 40.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Disqualifications</span>. - The following persons are disqualified from running for any elective local position:<br><br>"xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>"(e) Fugitive from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad (.)"</blockquote><br>Bienvenido Marquez, a defeated candidate for the elective position of Governor in the Province of Quezon in the 11th May 1992 elections filed this petition for <i>certiorari</i> praying for the reversal of the resolution of the Commission on Elections ("COMELEC") which dismissed his petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> against the winning candidate, herein private respondent Eduardo Rodriguez, for being allegedly a fugitive from justice.<br><br>It is averred that at the time private respondent filed his certificate of candidacy, a criminal charge against him for ten (10) counts of insurance fraud or grand theft of personal property was still pending before the Municipal Court of Los Angeles Judicial District, County of Los Angeles, State of California, U.S.A.&nbsp; A warrant issued by said court for his arrest, it is claimed, has yet to be served on private respondent on account of his alleged "flight" from that country.<br><br>Before the 11th May 1992 elections, a petition for cancellation (SPA 92-065) of respondent's certificate of candidacy, on the ground of the candidate's disqualification under Section 40(e) of the Local Government Code, was filed by petitioner with the COMELEC. On 08 May 1992, the COMELEC dismissed the petition.<br><br>Petitioner's subsequent recourse to this Court (in G.R. No. 105310) from the 08th May 1992 resolution of COMELEC was dismissed without prejudice, however, to the filing in due time of a possible post-election <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> proceeding against private respondent.&nbsp; The Court, in its resolution of 02 June 1992, held:<br><br><blockquote>"Evidently, the matter elevated to this Court was a pre-proclamation controversy.&nbsp; Since the private respondent had already been proclaimed as the duly elected Governor of the Province of Quezon, the petition below for disqualification has ceased to be a pre-proclamation controversy.&nbsp; In <span style="font-style: italic;">Casimiro vs. Commission on Elections</span>, G.R. Nos. 84462-63 and Antonio vs. Commission on Elections, G.R. Nos.&nbsp; 84678-79, jointly decided on 29 March 1989, 171 SCRA 468, this court held that a pre-proclamation controversy is no longer viable at this point of time and should be dismissed.&nbsp; The proper remedy of the petitioner is to pursue the disqualification suit in a separate proceeding.<br><br>"ACCORDINGLY, the Court Resolved to DISMISS the petition, without prejudice to the filing of the appropriate proceedings in the proper forum, if so desired, within ten (10) days from notice."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></blockquote><br>Private respondent was proclaimed Governor-elect of Quezon on 29 May 1992.&nbsp; Forthwith, petitioner instituted <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> proceedings (EPC 92-28) against private respondent before the COMELEC.&nbsp; In its 02 February 1993 resolution, the COMELEC (Second Division) dismissed the petition.&nbsp; The COMELEC En Banc, on 02 December 1993, denied a reconsideration of the resolution.<br><br>Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the core issue of which, such as to be expected, focuses on whether private respondent who, at the time of the filing of his certificate of candidacy (and to date), is said to be facing a <span style="font-style: italic;">criminal charge</span> before a foreign court and evading a warrant for his arrest comes within the term "fugitive from justice" contemplated by Section 40(e) of the Local Government Code and, therefore, disqualified from being a candidate for, and thereby ineligible from holding on to, an elective local office.<br><br>Petitioner's position is perspicuous and to the point.&nbsp; The law, he asseverates, needs no further interpretation and construction. Section 40(e) of Republic Act No. 7160, is rather clear, he submits, and it disqualifies "fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad" from seeking any elective local office.&nbsp; The Solicitor General, taking the side of petitioner, expresses a like opinion and concludes that the phrase "fugitive from justice" includes not only those who flee after conviction to avoid punishment but likewise those who, after being charged, flee to avoid prosecution.&nbsp; This definition truly finds support from jurisprudence (Philippine Law Dictionary, Third Edition, p. 399, by F.B. Moreno; Black's Law Dictionary, Sixth Edition, p. 671; King vs. Noe, 244 S.C. 344, 137 S.E. 2d 102, 103; Hughes <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. PFlanz, 138 Federal Reporter 980; Tobin <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Casaus, 275 Pacific Reporter, 2d., p. 792), and it may be so conceded as expressing the general and ordinary connotation of the term.<br><br>In turn, private respondent would have the Court respect the conclusions of the <span style="font-style: italic;">Oversight Committee</span> which, conformably with Section 533<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> of R.A. 7160, was convened by the President to "formulate and issue the appropriate rules and regulations necessary for the efficient and effective implementation of any and all provisions of the Code to ensure compliance with the principles of Local Autonomy."<br><br>Here are some excerpts from the committee's deliberations:<br><br><blockquote>"'CHAIRMAN MERCADO.

Saguisag who, during the bicameral conference committee of the Senate and the House of Representatives, made this reservation:<br><br><blockquote>"x x x <span style="font-style: italic;">de ipa-refine lang natin 'yung language&nbsp; especially 'yung, the scope of fugitive.&nbsp; Medyo bothered ako doon, a</span>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></blockquote><br>The Oversight Committee finally came out with Article 73 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991.&nbsp; It provided:<br><br><blockquote>"Art. 73. Disqualifications.&nbsp; - The following persons shall be disqualified from running for any elective local position:<br><br>"(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xxx<br><br>"(e)&nbsp; Fugitives from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Fugitive from justice refers to a person&nbsp; who has been convicted by final judgment</span>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote><br>Private respondent reminds us that the construction placed upon a law by the officials in charge of its enforcement deserves great and considerable weight (Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp. vs. CA, 182 SCRA 166, 181).&nbsp; The Court certainly agrees; however, when there clearly is no obscurity and ambiguity in an enabling law, it must merely be made to apply as it is so written.&nbsp; An administrative rule or regulation can neither expand nor constrict the law but must remain congruent to it.&nbsp; The Court believes and thus holds, albeit with some personal reservations of the <span style="font-style: italic;">ponente</span> (expressed during the Court's <span style="font-style: italic;">en banc</span> deliberations), that Article 73 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991, to the extent that it confines the term "fugitive from justice" to refer only to a person (the fugitive) "who has been convicted by final judgment," is an inordinate and undue circumscription of the law.<br><br>Unfortunately, the COMELEC did not make any definite finding on whether or not, in fact, private respondent is a "fugitive from justice" as such term must be interpreted and applied in the light of the Court's opinion.&nbsp; The omission is understandable since the COMELEC dismissed outrightly the petition for <span style="font-style: italic;">quo warranto</span> on the basis instead of Rule 73 of the Rules and Regulations promulgated by the Oversight Committee. The Court itself, not being a trier of facts, is thus constrained to remand the case to the COMELEC for a determination of this unresolved factual matter.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the questioned resolutions of the Commission on Elections are REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the case is hereby REMANDED to the Commission which is DIRECTED to proceed and resolve the case with dispatch conformably with the foregoing opinion.

Blg. 881) states that the qualifications for elective provincial, city, municipal, and barangay officials shall be those provided for in the Local Government Code.&nbsp; The quondam Local Government Code was B.P. Blg. 337, which was superseded by R.A. No. 7160, otherwise known as the Local Government Code of 1991.&nbsp; Section 39 of the latter provides for the qualifications and election of local elective officials.&nbsp; Section 40 enumerates those who are disqualified from running for any elective local position, among whom is a:<br><br>(e)&nbsp; Fugitive from justice in criminal or non-political cases here or abroad.<br><br>The term "fugitive from justice" refers not only to those who flee after conviction to avoid punishment but also to those who, after being charged, flee to avoid prosecution.&nbsp; In his ponencia, Mr. Justice Jose C. Vitug finds the definition given to it by the Oversight Committee, i.e., "a person who has been convicted by final judgment," as appearing in Article 73 of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local Government Code of 1991, as inordinate and an undue circumscription of the law.&nbsp; I agree.<br><br>But this is only one side of the coin.&nbsp; I further submit that it also unreasonably expands the scope of the disqualification in the 1991 Local Government Code because it disqualifies <span style="font-style: italic;">all </span>those who have been convicted by final judgment, regardless of the extent of the penalty imposed and of whether they have served or are serving their sentences or have evaded service of sentence by jumping bail or leaving for another country.&nbsp; The definition thus disregards the true and accepted meaning of the word <span style="font-style: italic;">fugitive</span>.&nbsp; This new definition is unwarranted for nothing in the legislative debates has been shown to sustain it and the clear language of the law leaves no room for a re­-examination of the meaning of the term.<br><br>I do not share the doubt of Mr. Justice Vitug on the constitutionality of the disqualification based on the presumption of innocence clause of the Bill of Rights.&nbsp; There are certain fundamental considerations which do not support the application of the presumption.<br><br>Firstly, Section 1, Article V of the Constitution recognizes the authority of Congress to determine who are disqualified from exercising the right of suffrage.&nbsp; Since the minimum requirement of a candidate for a public office is that he must be a qualified voter, it logically follows that Congress has the plenary power to determine who are disqualified to seek election for public office.<br><br>Secondly, a public office is a public trust.&nbsp; Section 1, Article XI of the Constitution expressly provides:<br><br>SEC. 1.&nbsp; Public office is public trust.&nbsp; Public officers and employees must at all times be accountable to the people, serve them with utmost responsibility, integrity, loyalty, and efficiency, act with patriotism and justice, and lead modest lives.<br><br>A public office is not property.&nbsp; (ISAGANI A. CRUZ, <span style="font-style: italic;">Constitutional Law</span>, 1993 ed., 101; JOAQUIN BERNAS, <span style="font-style: italic;">The Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines, A Commentary,</span> 1987 ed., 40, citing Cornejo <span style="font-style: italic;">vs</span>. Gabriel, 41 Phil. 188 [1920]).&nbsp; Accordingly, stricter qualifications for public office may thus be required by law.<br><br>Thirdly, the disqualification in question does not, in reality, involve the issue of presumption of innocence. Elsewise stated, one is not disqualified because he is presumed guilty by the filing of an information or criminal complaint against him.&nbsp; He is disqualified because he is a "fugitive from justice," i.e., he was not brought within the jurisdiction of the court because he had successfully evaded arrest; or if he was brought within the jurisdiction of the court and was tried and convicted, he has successfully evaded service of sentence because he had jumped bail or escaped.&nbsp; The disqualification then is based on his <span style="font-style: italic;">flight from justice</span>.&nbsp; In the face of the settled doctrine that flight is an indication of guilt, it may even be truly said that it is not the challenged disqualifying provision which overcomes the presumption of innocence but rather the disqualified person himself who has proven his guilt.<br><br>Finally, <span style="font-style: italic;">Dumlao vs. COMELEC</span> (95 SCRA 392 [1980]) cannot be invoked to cast doubt on the validity of the challenged disqualification.&nbsp; Dumlao struck out as violative of the constitutional presumption of innocence that portion of the second paragraph, Section 4 of B.P. Blg. 52 providing that "the filing of charges for the commission of such crimes before a civil court or military tribunal after preliminary investigation shall be prima facie evidence of such fact." It is clear that the law challenged therein did in fact establish a presumption of guilt from the mere filing of the information or criminal complaint, in violation of the constitutional right to presumption of innocence.</div>
