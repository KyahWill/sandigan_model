Wilfredo Sabornido as co-principal in the murder of Felipe Daaco and the
imposition upon him of the penalty of reclusion perpetua, the decision<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the appellate court dated 28 June 1991, together with the records of the
case, was elevated to this Court for review pursuant to Sec. 13, Rule 124 of
the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure.  The events, as found by the trial court, that led to the tragic death of
the victim are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Before the commencement of its mining operations in sitio
Pamuayan, barangay Port Barton, San Vicente, Palawan, Vulcan Mining Co. held
its traditional festivities, known as the "sagda" on 31 October
1984.  A public dance was held inside
the compound of the company.  At around
6:00 o'clock in the evening, the guests started to arrive and they were served
with food and drinks.  Apart from the
officers of the company, about <span style="">forty
(40) </span>to fifty (50) visitors attended the celebration.  Among those present were:  Felipe Daaco, <span style="">Alberto Yala, Narding Magbanua, Blario Flores, Marina Valeriano, her
daughter Rosalinda Valeriano, Nimfa </span><span style="">Camposano, </span><span style="">accused
Wilfredo Sabornido and Mordido Petero, and several dance girls.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Mordido Petero arrived at the dance hall inside the compound of
Vulcan Mining Co. shortly after 6:00 o'clock in the evening.  Soon thereafter, accused Wilfredo Sabornido
(hereinafter referred to as Sabornido) also arrived at the dance hall carrying
a sickle (or scythe), a hook-shaped farm implement used for gathering
"tuba" or coconut wine, which was placed inside a scabbard.  Sabornido proceeded to the table where the
radio phono owned and operated by Marina Valeriano was set up and deposited his
sickle on top of said table.  Afterwards, he <span style="">joined Mordido
Petero who was seated on a bench on one side of the dance hall and they started
</span>to drink liquor.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the guests had eaten, the dancing commenced at around 8:00
o'clock in the evening.  The music was
supplied by the radio <span style="">phono owned </span>and
operated by Marina Valeriano and the dance hall was illuminated by an electric
light provided <span style="">by </span>the company.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At about 8:30 o'clock in the evening, Sabornido got his sickle
from the table where he had deposited the same beside the radio phono and
handed it to his co-accused Petero.  Immediately after Petero received the sickle from Sabornido, the former
stealthily approached Felipe Daaco from behind.  Without any warning, Petero slashed the throat of Felipe Daaco
with the sickle while Sabornido who was armed with a knife stood in front of
the victim at about two (2) meters away.</p>

<p class="BODY">After his throat was slashed, Felipe Daaco ran out <span style="">of </span>the dance hall.  He was pursued by Petero and Sabornido.  When the victim fell to the ground, Petero
and Sabornido, both armed with a sickle and a knife, respectively, stood on the
opposite sides of the victim glowering over his fallen body.  After they made sure that their victim was
already dead, both accused simultaneously left <span style="">the scene </span>of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">That same night, both accused disappeared from San Vicente,
Palawan.  A month after the incident,
Sabornido returned to Pamuayan, Port Barton, San Vicente, Palawan and he was
apprehended by the police authorities, while Petero<span style=""> </span>was nowhere to be found.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 May 1985, an information for murder was filed against Petero
and Sabornido before the RTC of Palawan, Branch 52, docketed as Criminal Case
No. 5685.  The information reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 31st day of October, 1984 in the evening
at Sitio Pamuayan, Barangay Port Barton, Municipality of San Vicente, Province
of Palawan, Philippines and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court,
the said accused conspiring and confederating together and mutually helping
each other with intent to kill, evident premeditation and treachery, did then
and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously <span style="">attack, assault and hack with a bladed weapon, to wit:  </span><span style="">a
</span><span style="">scythe, one Felipe Daaco
wounding him on vital part of his body and inflicting upon him mortal injury
which was the direct and immediate cause of his death immediately
thereafter."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When arraigned, Sabornido entered a plea of not guilty while
Petero has remained at large.  During
the trial, Sabornido set up the defense of alibi, alleging that:  he was not in the scene of the incident nor
in its immediate vicinity when the incident occurred; that from his place of
work, he passed by the compound of Vulcan Mining Co. at about 5:30 o'clock in
the afternoon where he was invited to partake of the food and drinks, but that
he did not stay long for he left at about 6:00 o'clock in the evening; that <span style="">while </span>he was inside the compound of
Vulcan Mining Co., he never met nor saw his <span style="">co-</span>accused Petero; that he was not engaged in gathering tuba and
that he does not own a sickle nor was he the one who handed to Petero the
sickle used by Petero to slash Felipe Daaco's throat.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Marina Valeriano, Alberto Yala and Nimfa
Camposano testified for the prosecution that they saw Sabornido together with
Petero inside the compound of Vulcan Mining Co. at about 8:30 o'clock in the
evening of 31 October 1984 during the celebration of the "sagda".   Marina Valeriano also testified to the fact
that Sabornido was the <span style="">owner of the
sickle and upon his arrival at the dance hall, he deposited the same on top of
the table beside the radio phono operated by said witness; that before the
incident occurred, Sabornido took the sickle from where he had earlier placed
it, and handed said instrument to Petero who, thereafter, stealthily approached
the victim from behind and used the sickle in slashing the neck of said victim;
that armed with a knife, Sabornido posted himself in front of their victim when
Petero slashed the neck of the victim; that both accused pursued said victim
when the latter tried to run </span>away <span style="">after
he was injured; and, that Sabornido left the scene of the crime together with his
co-accused.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Alberto Yala, likewise, testified to having seen Petero
stealthily approaching the victim from behind while Sabornido posted himself in
front of their victim holding a knife when Petero slashed the throat of their
victim; that both accused pursued their injured victim and together, they left
the dance hall after the incident.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In <span style="">the </span>decision of
the trial court dated 9 June 1989,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Sabornido was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt as co-­principal in the
murder of Felipe Daaco in <span style="">the light of </span>the
following combined circumstances -<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"(1) </span>Earlier in the evening of the
incident the sickle used by Mordido Petero in slashing the throat of the
deceased Felipe Daaco was in the possession and control of co-accused Wilfredo
Sabornido;<u><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2) It was
co-accused Wilfredo Sabornido himself who handed the same sickle to Mordido
Petero;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(3) After handing
the sickle to Mordido Petero both accused approached Felipe Daaco and the
former treacherously slashed the throat of the victim;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(4) When Mordido
Petero slashed the throat of Felipe Daaco, co-accused Wilfredo Sabornido was
holding a knife close in front of the victim;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(5) When Felipe
Daaco ran away after having been slashed by his throat both accused pursued him
still holding their respective weapons;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(6) When Felipe
Daaco fell both accused posted themselves on opposite sides of the fallen
victim glowering at him, still holding the sickle and the knife earlier
referred to; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(7) That same
evening after the incident both accused disappeared from their respective
places of residence and Sabornido returned only after the lapse of more than
one month; it can readily be deduced that co-accused Mordido Petero must have
acted pursuant to a common design and unity of purpose with co-accused Wilfredo
<span style="">Sabornido.  The accused Sabornido could (not) have acted the way he did
except and unless he was actuated by a common design with co-accused Mordido
Petero.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The dispositive portion of the trial
court's decision reads as follows:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered finding
co-accused Wilfredo Sabornido guilty beyond reasonable doubt as co-­principal
of the crime of murder and there being no mitigating circumstances appreciated
and not being entitled to the benefits of the Inderminate Sentence Law, he is
hereby sentenced to Eighteen <span style="">(18)
Years, Eight (8) Months and One (1) day to Twenty (20) Years of reclusion
temporal in its maximum period; to pay the heirs of the deceased Felipe Daaco,
by way of civil indemnify, the sum of P30,000.00, Philippine Currency and to
pay the costs.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision of the trial court, Sabornido
filed an appeal<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
with the Court of Appeals.  In a
decision dated 28 June 1991, the appellate court affirmed with modification the
conviction of Sabornido as co-principal in the crime of murder, imposing the
penalty of reclusion perpetua and increasing the civil indemnity to be paid by
the accused to P50,000.00.  The
dispositive part of the appellate court's decision reads:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the judgment of conviction is AFFIRMED with the
modification that he is hereby sentenced to reclusion perpetua.  Further, in accordance with the ruling in
the case of <u><span style="">People v. Sison</span></u><span style="">, </span>the civil indemnity to be paid by
the accused to the heirs of the victim is hereby increased to P50,000.00
Philippine Currency.  (189 SCRA 643
[1990]).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Pursuant to Section 13, Rule 124 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal
Procedure, let the entire records of these proceedings be elevated to the
Supreme Court, to which We certify the case for review."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After a review of the decision of the Court of Appeals and the
entire records of the case, we find no ground or reason to disturb the decision
of the appellate court.  From the
evidence presented before the trial court, there is no doubt in our mind that
there was conspiracy between Sabornido and his co-accused Petero in the killing
of Felipe Daaco.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To establish conspiracy, it is not essential that all the accused
commit together each and every act constitutive of the offense.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
One is considered a party to a conspiracy when he intentionally participates in
an act or deed with a view to the furtherance of a common design and
purpose.  There must be unity of purpose
and unity in the execution of the unlawful objective.  Conspiracy implies concert of design but not necessarily
participation in every detail of <span style="">execution.  The concert of action at the moment of
consum­mating the crime and the form and manner in which assistance was
rendered to the person inflicting the fatal wound established their common
criminal design.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sabornido's act of providing his co-accused with the<span style=""> </span>murder weapon, posting himself while
armed with a knife in front of the victim when Petero slashed the throat of the
former, to ensure that their common victim would not be able to escape, and
then pursuing the victim when the latter tried to run after he was injured, can
not be viewed as a minor participation in the crime committed.  In fact, the assistance and moral support
which Sabornido extended to his co-accused Petero were material and
indispensable; they emboldened the latter to pursue and execute their plan.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The series of acts performed by Sabornido and his co-accused
Petero showed a concerted effort to accomplish their intent to kill the
victim.  Although it was Petero alone
who inficted the fatal wound which caused the death of the victim and Sabornido
did not cause any actual physical injury upon the person of the deceased, yet,
his acts before, during and after the incident showed his own single-mindedness
and unwavering intent to achieve a premeditated goal of killing the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the fact that Sabornido left the scene of the crime
after the incident together with his co-accused Petero and that they both
disappeared from San Vicente, Palawan on that same night <span style="">only </span>adds to the already overwhelming
evidence of his being a co-conspirator of Petero.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Direct proof is not essential <span style="">to </span>prove conspiracy, as it may be inferred from the acts of the
accused.  It is enough that at the time
the offense was committed, the accused had the same purpose and were united in
its execu­tion.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be deduced from the mode and manner in which the offense was
perpetrated.  The conditions attending
its commission and the acts executed may be indicative of the common design to
accomplish a criminal purpose and objective.  If there is a chain of circumstances to that effect, then conspiracy has
been established.  If such be the case,
then, the act of one is the act of all the others involved and each is to be
held to the same degree of liability as the others.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Sabornido's defense of alibi cannot prevail over his positive
identification made by no less than three (3) prosecution witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It has been said many times that alibi is one of the weakest defenses an
accused can invoke.  Easily lending
itself to concoction and fabrication, it must be invariably viewed with
suspicion and may be considered only when established by positive, clear and
satisfactory evidence.  To be given
credence, it must not only appear that the accused interposing the same was at
some other place, but also that it was physically impossible for him to be at
the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The house of Sabornido was only about three hundred (300) meters away from the
scene of the crime.  Assuming then that
he had already left the dance hall at about 6:00 o'clock <span style="">in </span>the evening as he claimed,
nonetheless, it was not physically impossible for him to have been back at the
compound of Vulcan Mining Co. when the incident occurred.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals was correct in modifying the penalty imposed
u<span style="">pon</span> Sabornido from eighteen
(18) years, eight (8) months and one (1) day to twenty (20) years of reclusion
temporal in its maximum period to reclusion perpetua, there being no
aggravating nor mitigating circumstances that attended the commission of the
offense.  Under Article 248 of the
Revised Penal Code, the penalty for murder is reclusion temporal maximum to
death, although where death appears to be the proper penalty, the court <span style="">shall not impose it, but shall sentence the
accused to </span><span style="">reclusion </span><span style="">perpetua.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>
