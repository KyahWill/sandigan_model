near the same gate together with his companions, struck a bottle of beer on the
table causing an injury on his hand which started to bleed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then, he approached petitioner in a hostile

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1978" day="9" month="6">9 June 1978</st1:date>,

final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> after the lapse of thirty (30)

In compliance, petitioner filed a reply (opposition) to the motion for
reconsideration, alleging that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">filing
of said motion and supplement </span>thereto was without notice to the adverse
party and proof of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">service, </span>hence,

<blockquote>In view of the recent trend in the Supreme Court to liberally
construe the Rules, and in view of Section 2, Rule 1, the Court resolves to
give due course to the motion.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon review of the facts of the case, it appears and the Court
finds merit in the motion for reconsideration, particularly noting that there
is indeed no showing of compensatory damages being proved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, this Court reconsiders its decision to conform to the
facts and the law, namely, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>moral
and exemplary damages, in order to merit, the plaintiff ought to have proven
actual or compensatory damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, this case is ordered dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with said order, petitioner filed the petition at
bar contending that no copy of the Motion for Reconsideration was served upon
petitioner and no proof of service as well as notice of hearing were attached
to said motion when filed with the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>; thus, the motion
for reconsideration did not interrupt the running of the period to appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged mailing of a copy of said motion
by ordinary mail did not, according to petitioner, cure the defect.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further argues that respondent's
admission that he slapped herein petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">in </span>public causing him physical suffering and social humiliation,
entitles the latter to moral damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Actual and compensatory damages need not be proven before an award of
moral damages can <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>granted, so
petitioner contends.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondent claims that the order of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> apprising petitioner of the motion for
reconsideration filed by private respondent and requiring the former to file <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>reply (opposition) thereto, had
cured the defect of lack of proof of service and notice of hearing of said
motion for reconsideration: and that the award of moral damages to petitioner
is without basis for lack of proof of bad faith on the part of private
respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the alleged lack of service on petitioner of a
copy of the motion and notice of hearing and failure to attach to the motion
proof of service thereof, the general rule is that notice of motion is required
where a party has a right to resist the relief sought by the motion and
principles of natural justice demand that his rights be not affected without an
opportunity to be heard.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>copy
of the motion for reconsideration was served upon petitioner, although service
was effected through ordinary mail and not by registered mail as required by
the rules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, petitioner was duly given
the full opportunity to be heard and to argue his case when the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span>required him to file a reply (opposition) to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motion </span>for reconsideration and
subsequently set the motion for oral argument.</p>

<p class="BODY">What the law really eschews is not the lack of previous notice of
hearing but the lack of opportunity to be heard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that parties should not rely
on mere technicalities which, in the interest of justice, may be relaxed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
The rules of procedure should be viewed as mere tools designed to facilitate
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">attainment </span>of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their strict and rigid application, which
would result in technicalities that tend to frustrate rather than promote
substantial justice, must be avoided.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the case should, as much as possible, be decided on the merits and
not merely on technicalities.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the petitioner's claim for moral damages, we find the same
to be meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no question
that moral damages may be recovered in cases where a defendant's wrongful act
or omission has caused the complainant physical suffering, mental anguish,
fright, serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock,
social humiliation and similar injury.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
An award of moral damages is allowed in cases specified or analogous to those
provided in Article 2219 of the Civil Code to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"ART. 2219. Moral damages may be recovered in the following
and analogous cases:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's contention that there was no bad faith on
his part in slapping petitioner on the face and that the incident was merely
accidental is not tenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
established before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> that there was an<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>existing feud between the families of
both petitioner and private respondent and that private respondent slapped the
petitioner without provocation in the presence of several persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">The act of private respondent in hitting petitioner on the face
is contrary to morals and good customs and caused the petitioner mental
anguish, moral shock wounded feelings and social humiliation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent has to take full
responsibility for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his act </span>and
his claim that he was unaware of what he had done to petitioner because of
drunkenness is definitely no excuse and does not relieve him of his liability
to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to Art. 21 of the Civil Code in relation to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">par. </span>(10) of Art. 2219 of the same
Code, "any person who <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">causes </span>loss or injury to another in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>manner that is contrary to morals,
good customs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>public policy
shall compensate the latter for the damage."</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that no actual or compensatory damage was proven before
the trial court, does not adversely affect petitioner's right to recover moral
damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moral damages may be awarded in
appropriate cases referred to in the chapter on human relations of the Civil
Code (Articles 19 to 36), without need of proof that the wrongful act
complained of had caused any physical injury upon the complainant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

It is clear from the report of the Code Commission that the reason underlying
an award of damages under Art. 21 of the Civil Code is to compensate the
injured party for the <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">moral injury</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>caused upon his person, thus -</p>
