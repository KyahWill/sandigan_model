<p class="BODY">The material and established facts of this case, as well as the
points in dispute between the parties, having been succinctly but thoroughly
summarized by the Solicitor General, we are minded to quote at length
therefrom.</p>

<blockquote>"On the night of <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="2">February
 13, 1987</st1:date>, Armando Frias, while on duty as member of the Integrated
National Police of Urbiztondo, <span class="GramE">Pangasinan,</span> received a
report that there was a victim of a crime in the clinic of Dr. Padlan in the
poblacion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded to the clinic
and found the victim lying down with her head bleeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asked her how she felt and when she
replied that she was weak, he took her ante-mortem statement (TSN, November 4,
1988, pp. 3-5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim, Carmelita
Morado, 18 years old, told Frias that she was raped and struck with a stone by
Juanito Aquino, appellant herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Frias
took down her statement which was duly witnessed by attending physician Dr. Padlan
and Capt. Eddie Ramos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The written
statement was also thumbmarked by Carmelita Morado (TSN, pp. 3-5, 8, 10,
November 4, 1988, Armando Frias).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="GramE">Jaime Datuin and Pat.</span> Renato Solomon <span class="GramE">were</span>
also among the people who were present when Frias took the statement of the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the victim gave her
statement she shouted that she be taken to the hospital because she was weak
(Id., p. 9).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carmelita Morado was taken
to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Virgen</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Milagrosa</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>

and admitted at <st1:time minute="35" hour="23">11:35 p.m.</st1:time> of that
same evening in serious condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr.
Saturnino Posadas, director of said <st1:place><st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>, testified that Carmelita
Morado sustained the following injuries;</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>lacerated wound about 10 cm. at the front of
the head;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">skull</span> fracture
located on the front portion of the skull;</blockquote>

urethal (sic)</blockquote>

<blockquote>(TSN pp. 2-3, November 18,
1988; Dr. Saturnino Posadas; Medico Legal Certificate, Exhibit 'C')</blockquote>

<blockquote>"She died the following morning before surgical operations
could be performed (TSN, p. 4 November 18, 1988, Dr. Saturnino Posadas).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A team of police officers was sent out to arrest Juanito
Aquino.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was found and arrested inside
the town auditorium at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00</st1:time>
that same evening of <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1987</st1:date>
attending a Valentine dance (TSN, pp. 7-8, September 15, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant was detained at the municipal jail in Urbiztondo,
Pangasinan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it was only on <st1:date year="1987" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1987</st1:date> that the statement
of appellant was taken as the police officers waited for the parents of
appellant (TSN, pp. 3, 13-14, August 24, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before appellant's interrogation begun, he was asked if he
had a lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As he had none, Armando
Frias and the Station Commander Captain Ramos fetched Atty. Liliosa Rosario of
the Citizens Legal Assistance Office to assist appellant during the
investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Atty. Rosario, upon
arrival at the office of Frias where the investigation was to take place,
interviewed appellant (supra at pp. 14-16).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the start of the investigation, Armando Frias informed
appellant of his constitutional rights, of his right to remain silent and to
counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was assisted by Atty.
Rosario throughout the investigation (TSN, p. 10, August 23, 1988; p. 18, August
24, 1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After appellant signed his
statement, Frias took appellant and his counsel to the office of Judge Juan C.
Austria, of the 5th Municipal Circuit Trial Court, who called the Interpreter
and the Clerk of Court to read the statement and translate the same to
appellant to ensure that appellant understood what was written.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Judge <st1:country-region><st1:place>Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>
made appellant sign the statement in his presence (TSN, pp. 21-23, August 24,
1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, after the complaint was filed but before appellant
could be arraigned, a Motion to <span class="GramE">Commit</span> appellant to the
<st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for Mental Health, as earlier mentioned, was filed by appellant's counsel as
appellant was allegedly manifesting unstable behavior with fits of
violence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was duly committed
sometime in July, 1987.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was released
in 1988 whereupon he was duly arraigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant pleaded 'not guilty' and put up the defense of insanity.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"To prove insanity, appellant presented Dr. Nicanor L.
Echavez, a psychiatrist at the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place> for Mental Health who was in
charge of the pavilion where appellant was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After Juanito Aquino was admitted to the
mental hospital in July 1987, he conducted physical, mental and psychological
examinations and found him to be suffering from mental disorder classified
under organic mental disorder with psychosis (TSN, pp. 4-­5, 7, May 23,
1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dr. Echavez was of the opinion
that when appellant Juanito Aquino committed the heinous act, the latter was
totally deprived of mind (supra at pp. 15-16).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Patricio Aquino, appellant's father, also testified that his
son was already mentally ill even when he was still young.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was suspended from school because
he was very playful, overactive and naughty especially with his classmates
(TSN, p. 4, May 24, 1988); that appellant was cruel to his brothers and
sisters, stole his mother's jewelry which he sold for a low sum, wandered
sometimes naked, and oftentimes not coming home for extended periods of time
(supra at pp. 5, 8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was
previously confined at the Mental Hospital in 1985 when he was caught wandering
around naked (supra at p. 10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Sgt. Raymundo Lomboy, the police officer charged with
appellant's custody and who transferred appellant for commitment to the
National Center for Mental Health, recalled that while appellant was in his
custody, appellant acted abnormally by singing, shouting, dancing and generally
disturbing the other inmates (TSN, p. 7, July 21, 1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After appellant was treated and released from
the National Center for Mental Health, he acted queerly by singing and shouting
whenever he failed to drink his medicine (supra at p. 15).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Appellant himself was also presented as witness, the doctor
having certified that he could withstand trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the gist of appellants' testimony was to deny any knowledge of
the crime, the persons, things and events connected with it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted he knew that he has some mental
illness and had undergone treatment like electric shock (TSN, pp. 5-7, 18-19,
July 14, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, the prosecution presented an array of
witnesses to prove that appellant was lucid before and after the crime was
committed and that he acted with discernment.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Armando Frias testified that from the time of appellant's
arrest and during the investigation, appellant acted normally, and gave
responsive answers to all the questions propounded to him (TSN, pp. 5, 9, 13-15
August 23, 1988).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Frias knew appellant
even prior to the incident because he worked as a laborer in the construction
of the theatre in the town proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
believed appellant to be normal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Angel Baysic, another member of the Integrated National
Police in Urbiztondo, Pangasinan whose house is located near the theatre being
constructed, also knew appellant who worked there as a laborer and sometimes
cooked the laborer's meals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Baysic
became closely acquainted with appellant and sometimes they drank together with
other laborers after work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During these
times, he observed appellant to act normally and was responsive to conversation
(TSN, pp. 4-7, September 6, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Carlos Sabangon, one of the police officers who arrested
appellant at the town auditorium, testified that when appellant was arrested
during the valentine dance, he was appropriately dressed and behaved normally
and in fact was just about to sit down after dancing when they arrived to
arrest him (TSN, pp. 8-9, 17 September 15, 1988).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Eduardo Fernandez, a jail guard, was one on duty when
appellant escaped from prison on <st1:date year="1987" day="3" month="5">May 3,
 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While appellant was
confined in the provincial jail, Fernandez did not observe any queer behavior
from appellant (TSN, pp. 34-35, 41, 43, September 15, 1988)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial on the merits, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered
its verdict convicting appellant of the crime of rape with homicide and
sentenced him to suffer life imprisonment and to indemnify the heirs of the
deceased in the amount of P35<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as damages.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

The case was, however, brought to us for review, with appellant taking the

<p class="BODY">The controversy boils down into one issue, that is, whether or
not appellant, who has invoked insanity as his defense, has overcome the
presumption of sanity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sanity being the normal condition of the human mind, the
prosecution may proceed in the first instance upon the presumption that the
defendant was sane and responsible when the act was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption is always in favor of sanity
and the burden of proof of insanity is on the defense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The basis for the <span style="color:windowtext">presumption</span> of sanity
is well explained by the United States Supreme Court in the leading case of <st1:city><st1:place><u>Davis</u></st1:place></st1:city>
<u>vs</u>. <st1:country-region><st1:place><u>United</u> <u>States</u></st1:place></st1:country-region>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
in this wise:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"If that presumption
were not indulged, the government would always be under the necessity of
adducing affirmative evidence of the sanity of an accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But a requirement of that character would seriously
delay and embarrass the enforcement of the laws against crime and in most cases
be unnecessary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the law
presumes that everyone charged with crime is sane and thus, supplies in the
first instance the required proof of capacity to commit crime."</p>

<p class="BODY">As we have done in a prior case, for purposes of disposing of
appellant's defense it is well to restate and keep in mind certain basic
principles in law, viz:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that a person is
criminally liable for a felony committed by him; that a felonious or criminal
act (<u>delito</u> <u>doloso</u>) is presumed to have been done with deliberate
intent, that is, with freedom, intelligence and malice because the moral and
legal presumption is that freedom and intelligence constitute the normal
condition of a person in the absence of evidence to the contrary; that one of
the causes which will overthrow this presumption of voluntariness and
intelligence is insanity in which event the actor is exempt from criminal
liability as provided for in Article 12, Paragraph 1, of the Revised Penal
Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It will readily be observed that the extrajudicial confession
executed by appellant clearly reveals how the crime charged against him was
perpetrated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This confession is,
however, being assailed as inadmissible in evidence on the ground that it was
executed without the assistance of counsel engaged by appellant himself, and
that he did not understand nor was he informed of his constitutional rights.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with this submission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The extrajudicial confession is admissible in
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Atty.
Liliosa Rosario, a lawyer from the then Citizen's Legal Assistance Office
(CLAO), assisted appellant when he was placed under custodial investigation.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The same lawyer represented him during the
early part of the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <u>People</u>
<u>vs</u>. <u>Layuso</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
we strongly denounced the widespread misconception that the presence of a
lawyer under the right to counsel provision of the Constitution is intended to
stop an accused from saying anything which might incriminate him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right to counsel is intended to preclude
the slightest coercion as would lead the accused to admit something false.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lawyer, however, should never prevent an
accused from freely and voluntarily telling the truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether it is an extrajudicial statement or
testimony in open court, the purpose is always the ascertainment of truth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As explained in <u>Gamboa</u> <u>vs</u>. <u>Cruz</u>,
<u>etc</u>.,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
the person being interrogated must be assisted by counsel to avoid the
pernicious practice of extorting false or coerced admissions or confessions
from the lips of persons undergoing investigation for the commission of an
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presence and assistance of Atty. Liliosa Rosario adequately
precluded the possibility of extracting from appellant any false or coerced
confession or admission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, it
was shown that the extrajudicial confession executed by appellant was explained
to him in his dialect when he was brought before Judge Juan C. Austria where
such confession was subscribed and sworn to by appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
The records also show that the validity of the extrajudicial confession is not
being questioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only the reliability
of its contents is being placed in doubt, ostensibly because of the main
submission of the defense that appellant was insane when the crime was
committed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, the CLAO attorney would not have affixed her signature in the
extrajudicial confession had she known of any legal infirmity in its execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to his principal submission, appellant relies heavily
on the clinical case report regarding his mental and physical condition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He stresses in his brief that the testimony
of Dr. Nicanor L. Echavez, Physician-In-Charge, Male Court Case Pavilion of the
National Center for Mental Health, has explicitly shown that appellant was
supposedly insane immediately before, during and after the commission of the
crime and that the evidence adduced explicate that the mental illness of
appellant is incurable and that he has no lucid intervals.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
He explains that the normal appearance and behavior of appellant while
testifying in court is not suprising.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
says that it is due to the fact that, during that time, he was undergoing
medical treatment and his mental condition during the trial of the case where
he had been regularly taking medicine should not be confused with his mental
status at the time of the commission of the offense.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant is clutching at straws of argument, a clear indicium of
a dearth in plausible explanations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor
was the trial judge, who had the opportunity to observe and evaluate his
demeanor on the witness stand, including his manner of testifying and the
answers he also gave in his extrajudicial confession, the least bit impressed
by appellant's defense of insanity as vividly explained in his decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And well must it be so, for the rule is that
insanity must be positively proven.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
presumption, we repeat, is in favor of sanity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The rule has consistently been that when a defendant in a criminal case
interposes the defense of mental incapacity, the burden of establishing that
fact rests upon him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Now, it has long been settled that the period to which an inquiry
into the mental state of the accused should be directed is that transpiring
immediately before and/or at the very moment of the act or acts under
prosecution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
In the eyes of the law, insanity exists when there is a complete deprivation of
intelligence in committing the act, that is, the accused is deprived of reason,
he acts without the least discernment because there is complete absence of the
power to discern, or there is total deprivation of the freedom of the
will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mere abnormality of the mental
faculties will not exclude imputability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The <u>onus</u> <u>probandi</u> rests upon whoever invokes insanity as
an exempting circumstance and must prove it by clear and positive evidence.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Insanity itself is a condition, not a thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not susceptible of the usual means of
proof and to this fact is due the unusual difficulty of making proof of its
existence and measuring its effect, when once proven to exist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As no man can look into the mind of another,
the state of such mind can only be measured as the same is reflected in the
actions of the body it is created to govern.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, we have held that mind can only be known by outward acts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereby we read the thoughts, the motives and
emotions of a person and come to determine whether his acts conform to the
practice of people of sound mind.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
In interpreting these physical manifestations, scientific knowledge and
experience have been resorted to by our judicial agencies.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records indubitably disclose that appellant sexually abused
the victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After consummating his
lustful desire, he violently struck the victim on the head with a stone for
fear that the victim would report him, and thereafter he left her in the belief
that she was already dead.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
The victim did not immediately die.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">In the clinic of Dr. Serafin Padlan in the poblacion, Pat.</span>
Armando Frias saw the victim with her head bleeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He took the statement of the victim in the
local dialect.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
Thereafter, he translated the statement to English and reduced it into writing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
The statement disclosed the identity of appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That same evening, the victim was still
brought to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Virgen</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Milagrosa</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where she was treated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She was serious
but still conscious, and was able to narrate to Dr. Saturnino Posadas what
happened to her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She died the following
morning.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence adduced for appellant that he was insane immediately
before or at the very moment the crime was committed is too nebulous and
conjectural to be convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Dr.
Nicanor L. Echavez of the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for Mental Health described the mental illness of the accused as "organic
mental disorder with psychosis,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
he admitted that a person suffering from insanity may know that what he is
doing is wrong.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
The same witness also testified that there is no possibility of appellant
having lucid intervals,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
but he, however, also observed that the mental illness of appellant came on and
off.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The clinical case report also shows that appellant, when
interviewed upon his admission to the mental institution, recalled having taken
120 cubic centimeters of cough syrup and consumed about 3 sticks of marijuana
before the commission of the crime.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
This admission substantially affirms his prior extrajudicial confession that he
was under the influence of marijuana when he sexually abused the victim and, on
the occasion thereof, killed her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
It is, therefore, beyond cavil that assuming appellant had some form of mental
illness, it did not totally deprive him of intelligence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presence of his reasoning faculties,
which enabled him to exercise sound judgment and satisfactorily articulate the
aforesaid matters, sufficiently discounts any intimation of insanity of
appellant when he committed the dastardly felonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The annals of crime are replete with
documented records, and we are not without our share in this jurisdiction,
where mental illness has been feigned and invoked to provide a defense for the
accused in a criminal prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">One more thing.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court imposed the penalty of life
imprisonment on appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a judgment
of conviction for a felony, the court should specify the appropriate name of
the penalty, which in this case should be <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u> and
not life imprisonment, since under the scheme of penalties in the Revised Penal
Code the principal penalty for a felony has its own specific duration and
corresponding accessory penalties, unlike those generally provided for crimes
in special laws.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, with the modification that the principal
penalty imposed on appellant is <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>, and the
reduction of the civil indemnity to P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in line
with prevailing jurisprudence, the judgment of the trial court is hereby
