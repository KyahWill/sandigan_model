<span class="SpellE">Nacionale</span> Air France", which reversed the Trial
Court's judgment dismissing the Complaint of private respondents for damages
arising from breach of contract of carriage, and awarding instead P90<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in February, 1970, the late Jose G. <span class="SpellE">Gana</span>
and his family, numbering nine (the GANAS), purchased from AIR FRANCE through
Imperial Travels, Incorporated, a duly authorized travel agent, nine (9)
"open-dated" air passage tickets for the Manila/Osaka/Tokyo/Manila
route.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The GANAS paid a total of
US$2,528.85 for their economy and first class fares.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said tickets were bought at the then
prevailing exchange rate of P3.90 per US$1.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The GANAS also paid travel taxes of P100.00 for each passenger.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="24" month="4">24 April 1970</st1:date>,
AIR <st1:country-region><st1:place>FRANCE</st1:place></st1:country-region>
exchanged or substituted the aforementioned tickets with other tickets for the
same route.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At this time, the GANAS were
booked for the Manila/Osaka segment on AIR FRANCE Flight 184 for <st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="5">8 May <span class="GramE">1970</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> and for the Tokyo/Manila return <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The GANAS did not depart on <st1:date year="1970" day="8" month="5">8 May 1970</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in January, 1971, Jose <span class="SpellE">Gana</span>
sought the assistance of <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> <span class="SpellE">Manucdoc</span>,
a Secretary of the Sta. Clara Lumber Company where Jose <span class="SpellE">Gana</span>
was the Director and Treasurer, for the extension of the validity of their
tickets, which were due to expire on 8 May 1971. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> enlisted
the help of Lee Ella, Manager of the Philip<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">pine Travel Bureau, who used to handle travel arrangements for the
personnel of the Sta. Clara Lumber Company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ella sent the tickets to Cesar <span class="SpellE">Rillo</span>, Office
Manager of AIR </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
  13.0pt">FRANCE</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tickets were returned to
Ella who was informed that extension was not possible unless the fare
differentials resulting from the increase in fares triggered by an increase of
the exchange rate of the US dollar to the Philippine peso and the increased
travel tax were first paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ella then
returned the tickets to <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> and informed her of
the impossibility of extension.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the GANAS had scheduled their departure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="5">7 May 1971</st1:date> or one day before the expiry date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the morning of the very day <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>their scheduled departure on the
first leg of their trip, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> requested travel
agent Ella to arrange the revalidation of the tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ella gave the same negative answer and warned<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> her that although the tickets could be used
by the GANAS if they left on </span><st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">7 May 1971</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the tickets would no longer be valid for

 1971</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Teresita</span> replied
that it will be up to the GANAS to make </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">the arrangements.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">With that assurance, Ella, on his own,
attached to the tickets validating stickers for the Osaka/Tokyo flight, one a
JAL sticker and the other an SAS (Scandinavian Airways System) sticker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The SAS sticker indicates thereon that it was
"Revalidated by the Philippine Travel Bureau, Branch No. 2" (as shown
by a circular rubber stamp) and signed "<span class="SpellE">Ador</span>",
and the date is handwritten in the center of the circle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then appear under printed headings the
notations:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>JL 108 (Flight), 16 May
(Date), 1040 (Time), OK (status).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, Ella made no more attempt to contact AIR </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">FRANCE</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> as there was no more time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding the warnings, the GANAS departed from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="5">7 May <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1971</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>on board AIR FRANCE Flight 184 for <st1:place><st1:city>Osaka</st1:city>,
 <st1:country-region>Japan</st1:country-region></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no question with respect to this leg
of the trip.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, for the Osaka/Tokyo flight on <st1:date year="1971" day="17" month="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">17 </span>May <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1971</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, </span>Japan Airlines refused to honor the
tickets because of their expiration, and the GANAS had to purchase new
tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They encountered the same
difficulty with respect to their return trip to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
as AIR <st1:country-region><st1:place>FRANCE</st1:place></st1:country-region>
also refused to honor their tickets.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They were able to return only after pre-payment in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
through their relatives, of the readjusted rates.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They finally flew back to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>

Case No. 84111 for damages arising from breach of contract of carriage.</p>

<p class="BODY">AIR FRANCE traversed the material allegations of the Complaint
and alleged that the GANAS brought upon themselves the predicament they found
themselves in and assumed the consequential risks; that travel agent Ella's
affixing of validating stickers on the tickets <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">without the knowledge and consent of AIR FRANCE, violated airline
tariff rules and regulations and was beyond the scope of his authority as a
travel agent; and that AIR FRANCE was not guilty of any fraudulent conductor

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="5">29 May 1975</st1:date>,

affirmative ruling thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing rules, it <span class="GramE">is clear</span>
that AIR FRANCE cannot be faulted for breach of contract when it dishonored the
tickets of the GANAS after <st1:date year="1971" day="8" month="5">8 May 1971</st1:date>
since those tickets expired on said date; nor when it required the GANAS to buy
new tickets or have their tickets re-issued for the Tokyo/Manila segment of
their trip.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither can it be said that,
when upon sale of the new <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">tickets, </span>it

</span>To all legal intents and purposes, <span class="SpellE">Teresita</span>

<p class="BODY">The circumstance that AIR FRANCE personnel at the ticket counter
in the airport allowed the GANAS to leave is not tantamount to an implied
ratification of travel agent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Ella's </span>irregular
actuations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be recalled that
the GANAS left <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> the day
before the expiry date of their tickets and that "other arrangements"
were to be made with respect to the remaining segments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the validating stickers that Ella
affixed <span class="GramE">on his own</span> merely reflect the status of
reservations on the specified flight and could not legally serve to extend the
validity of a ticket or revive an expired one.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion is inevitable that the GANAS brought upon
themselves the predicament they were in for having insisted on using tickets
that were due to expire in an effort, perhaps, to beat the deadline and in the
thought that by commencing the trip the day before the expiry date, they could
complete the trip even thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
should be recalled that AIR FRANCE was even unaware of the validating SAS and
JAL stickers that Ella had affixed spuriously.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, Japan Air Lines and AIR FRANCE merely acted within their
contractual rights when they dishonored the tickets on the remaining segments
of the trip and when AIR <st1:country-region><st1:place>FRANCE</st1:place></st1:country-region>
demanded payment of the adjusted fare rates and travel taxes for the
Tokyo/Manila flight.</p>
