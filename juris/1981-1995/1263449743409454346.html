				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> to review the decision
of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. No. S.P. 06585 entitled "<span class="SpellE">Rufino</span> Q. Fernandez vs. Hon. Ricardo M. <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span>,
et al.," promulgated on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="9">September
 22, 1977</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this <span class="GramE">case are</span> clear,
undisputed and may be summarized briefly as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent's father was the original lessee of the
building and lot owned by the late <span class="SpellE">Doña</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> Gay de <span class="SpellE">Loring</span> and the
spouses Mercedes Van Kauffman and Jaime <span class="SpellE">Ibañez</span> de <span class="SpellE">Aldecoa</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This lease
dates back to 1899.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his father's
demise, private respondent continued the lease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The building and lot subject of the lease was bought by petitioner
herein from the intestate-estate of the original owners for the sum of P250<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> on <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="7">July 9,
 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before its purchase,
private respondent was a lessee of the said owners and was paying them a rental
of P1<span class="GramE">,250.00</span> a month.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the purchase, the rental corresponding to the first half of the
month of July, 1974 in the sum of P625.00 was paid by private res<span style="">p</span>ondent to the original owners and
that of the second half in the sum of P625.00 to the new owner, petitioner
herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the continuance of the lease,
it was verbally agreed by and between the petitioner and private respondent
that the rental for the succeeding months would be increased to P<span style="">2<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span>starting
August, 1974.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This went on until
September, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>About the second week
of October, 1975, private respondent was informed by a representative of
petitioner, Atty. Santiago <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Divinagracia</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span> his contract of lease would terminate on <st1:date year="1975" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1975</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When private respondent refused to vacate the
premises on October 31, 1975, petitioner reiterated the advice earlier made in
a letter dated November 4, 1975 formally advising him of the termination of the
lease on October 31, 1975 and giving him, the private respondent, a final
extension to occupy the premises up to the end of November, 1975, for which
reason petitioner refused to accept further payment of rentals for December,
1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent in turn
informed petitioner that he was depositing his rentals for the succeeding
months with the Clerk of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">A complaint for unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> was
filed by herein petitioner against private respondent before the City Court of
Iloilo, Branch I, which rendered a decision in favor of private respondent, the
<span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, this court hereby renders its decision ?</blockquote>

<blockquote>a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordering defendant to pay the plaintiff the
sum of P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> a month as the reasonable rent for
the use of the premises, beginning January, 1976;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fixing the duration of the lease of
defendant which, since 1899 to the present, is 76 years, at one year for every
10 years, i.e., that defendant may continue to lease the premises for seven and
a half (7-1/2) years to commence from finality of the decision;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">without</span>
pronouncement as to the costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the decision, petitioner appealed to the Court of First
Instance which modified the City Court's decision by:</p>

<blockquote>"(<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dismissing the
complaint;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ordering
defendant to pay plaintiff the sum of P3,000.00 a month, as the reasonable rent
for the use of the premises, beginning January, 1976; and</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Extending
the duration of the lease by defendant of plaintiff's property to one (1) year
to commence from finality of the decision,</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">without</span> pronouncement as to costs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the latter decision, private respondent filed a petition for
review before the Court of Appeals which modified the previous decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion
of the Appellate Court's decision states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, and as thus modified, in the sense that the lease
should be as it is hereby extended for another five (5) years, the judgment of
the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="">quo</span></u><span style=""> </span>is affirmed in all other
respects.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Without
pronouncement as to costs."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the judgment of the Court of Appeals, petitioner herein
appealed by <i>certiorari</i> to this Court, assigning a single error involving
a legal issue, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>The respondent Court of Appeals committed a grave error in the
correct application of Article 1687 of the New Civil Code by extending the
lease for another five (5) years which is a grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack or <span style="">in </span>excess of its
jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, in support of the foregoing assigned error, argues
upon the following considerations:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
Court of Appeals practically made a contract between the parties which is
contrary to the spirit and intent of Article 1687 of the New Civil Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
Court of Appeals did not show that the Court <span style="">of </span>First Instance of Iloilo, Branch V, presided by the Hon. Judge
Ricardo M. <span class="SpellE">Ilarde</span> to which this case was originally
appealed, gravely abused its discretion by reducing the term of the lease to
only one (1) years;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">III.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
conclusion arrived at by the Court of Appeals are contrary to law, the admitted
facts and admission of the parties;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">IV.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
Court of Appeals did not observe the criteria set out by this Honorable Court
in the application of Article 1687 of the New Civil Code in the exercise of its
<span style="">dis</span>cretion.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first and fourth arguments of the petitioner relate solely to
the proper application of Article 1687 of the New Civil Code, hence <span class="GramE">We</span> are constrained to consider and resolve them
together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner alleges that there
was grave abuse of discretion by the Court of Appeals in reckoning the
occupancy of the lessee from 1899 when his predecessor-in-interest was the
occupant of the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should have
been reckoned only from his personal occupancy of the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner further alleges that the Court of
Appeals was oblivious of the following facts:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) There was a change of ownership - the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
became owner only on July 9, 1974; (2) The leased premises is a commercial lot;
(3) The private respondent was made to understand that in the future, the
petitioner may need the premises for its own use; (4) The private respondent
has admitted that he has two stores, one at the premises subject of this case
and the other store located at his own commercial building; and (5) The
petitioner herein was the one who filed the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span>
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could have been another matter
had the private respondent filed an independent action asking for the fixing of
the period of the lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">Withal, petitioner concluded that the decision <span style="">of </span>the respondent Court is most
unfair, arbitrary and inequitable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
unjust and authoritarian.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court
practically made a contract between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It curtailed the basic human right of the
parties of their freedom to contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's contention is devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, it is beyond dispute that
Article 1687 of the New Civil Code is applicable, which article states:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1687.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
period for the lease has not been fixed, it is understood to be from year to
year, if the rent agreed upon is annual; from month to month, if it is monthly;
from week to week, if the rent is weekly; and from day to day, if the rent is
to be paid daily.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>However, even
though a monthly rent is paid, and no period for the lease has been set, the
court may fix a longer term for the lease after the lessee has occupied the premises
for over one year</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 1687 of the <span style="">New </span>Civil Code must be correlated with
Article 1197 of the New Civil Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1197.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
obligation does not fix a period, but from its nature and circumstances it can
be inferred that a period was intended, the court may fix the duration
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE"><span style="">x</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering both Articles together, it is at once clear and
evident that the court is accorded the power to fix a longer term for the
lease, which power is <span class="SpellE">potestative</span> or discretionary in
nature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prerogative is addressed to
the court's sound judgment and is controlled by equitable considerations.
"The court may fix a longer term where equities come into play demanding
an extension." (<span class="SpellE">Divino</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Fabie</span>
de Marcos, 4 SCRA 186).</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not, therefore, be contended that the Court of Appeals <span style="">in </span>the exercise of its discretionary
power under Article 1687 in relation with Article 1197 made a contract between
the parties, since the very purpose of the law is not the fixing of a longer term
for the lease, but to make the indefinite period of lease definite by fixing
once and for all the remaining duration of the lease.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can <span class="GramE">We</span> sustain the factors
assigned by the petitioner herein, which the Court of Appeals refused to
appreciate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Squarely resolving these
factors, that there was a change of ownership, the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span>
became the owner only on <st1:date year="1974" day="9" month="7">July 9, 1974</st1:date>,
and that the lease is not recorded in the Registry of Property, is of no
moment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the first place, that
purchaser is bound to continue the lease is explicit under Article 1676 of the
Civil Code, more specifically the same article provides:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The purchaser of a piece of land which
is under a lease that is not recorded in the Registry of Property may terminate
the lease, save when there is a stipulation to the contrary in the contract of
sale, or <u>when the purchaser knows of the existence of the lease</u>."
Such knowledge of the lease was established<span style=""> </span>in the findings of the Court of
Appeals, thus:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x
</span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that private
respondent knew of the existence of such lease is eloquently shown by the fact
that when the private respondent bought the property on July 9, 1974, the
private respondent received only the rental corresponding to the second half of
the month of July, or the sum of P625.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rental for the first half of the same month was in fact paid to the
former owner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance not only
shows that private respondent know of the existence of such prior lease, but
also that they knew the monthly rental fixed for the lease of the premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span>we therefore entertain no doubt that private respondent knew of the
existence of such lease and that from its actuation from August 1974 to
September 1975, it allowed the herein petitioner to continue with the lease
indefinitely <span style="">x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Secondly, that the leased <span class="GramE">premises is</span> a commercial lot finds no legal
significance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 1687 does not make
any qualification <span class="GramE">nor</span> distinction as to its
application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>expressio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">est</span></span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span>
<span class="SpellE">alterius</span></u>, the law applies to both residential and
commercial lands as well.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, that
private respondent was made to understand that in the future the petitioner may
need the premises for its own use is without importance in the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not there was such an
understanding would not affect the lease contract existing between the
parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such knowledge is not
sufficient to terminate an existing contract in compliance with the provisions
of Article 1687.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold otherwise would
be making a fetish of a technicality which the law abominates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, every owner is precisely interested
in his own property and the fact that he may need the property at some future
time is beyond human scruples.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But then
the question of when such future time will arise is <span class="SpellE">potestative</span>
in nature and will depend on the prevailing circumstances and conditions as
well as the acquiescence of the parties, so that by reason of equity, justice
and fairness, Article 1687 supplies the remedy in the event the parties decide
to terminate their contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fourthly,
that private respondent admitted that he has two stores, one at the subject
premises and the other at his own commercial establishment, does not alter the <span class="SpellE">appplicability</span> of Article 1687, considering the fact that
the private respondent's other store is also tenanted and as the Court of
Appeals correctly pointed out, <span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> It would be most
difficult for him to eject the tenants of his property for him to move in.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Moreover, petitioner established his hardware business in
the premises since 1946.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any sudden
transfer would certainly affect his business x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." Finally, the fact that petitioner herein was the
one who filed the unlawful <span class="SpellE">detainer</span> case instead of
the private respondent is immaterial considering that private respondent had in
his counterclaim prayed that "the Court fix the term of the lease to ten
(10) years from the final termination of the case." The provision of
Article 1687 may be interposed as a defense in the answer (Imperial Insurance
Inc. v. Simon, 14 SCRA 855), or as a counterclaim therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exercise of the power given to the Court
in Article 1687 to extend the period of the lease when the defendant has been
in occupancy of the premises for more than a year, does not contemplate a
separate action for that purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
power may be exercised as an incident in the action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
itself and by the court having jurisdiction over it (Ramirez vs. <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Chit, 21 SCRA 1364).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot lose sight of the fact that
it would be an idle and costly procedure to require the lessee to file another
action to have the term of the lease fixed, with all the possible delays and
inconveniences attendant upon a lawsuit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Apropos</u> the second argument that the Court of Appeals <span style="">did </span>not show that the Court of First
Instance of Iloilo to which this case was originally appealed, gravely abused
its discretion, the petitioner maintains that since it is the lower court which
is familiar with the reigning conditions of each locality, its judgment on the
additional term to be granted to the lessee in each case should not be
interfered with on appeal, absent a clear abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well to stress that in a petition for review, the appellate
court has the discretion to alter, modify or affirm the decision brought to it
on appeal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the exercise of such
discretion, it may either increase or decrease the extension of the lease
period granted by the lower court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>onus <span class="SpellE">probandi</span></u> that the
respondent Court committed grave abuse of discretion is upon the petitioner
himself, and not the court reviewing the decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner must show on <i>certiorari</i>
that the appellate Court exercised its discretion arbitrarily or
despotically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have examined the
records and <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>find nothing of importance to
warrant a disturbance of the conclusions reached by the respondent Court of
Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of Our settled and
established jurisprudence, that when the lower court has jurisdiction over the
subject matter of the case, its actuation in the exercise of such jurisdiction
is not correctible by <i>certiorari</i> (<span class="SpellE">Matanog</span> v.
Alejandro, G.R. Nos. L-22502-03, <st1:date year="1964" day="30" month="6">June
 30, 1964</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">The final argument of the petitioner faults the Court of Appeals'
findings as contrary to law, admitted facts and admission of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">advocation</span> is
without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a legal rule that
not every error in the proceeding or every erroneous conclusion of law or of
fact is abuse of discretion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the
absence of any <span class="GramE">indication<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>and</span> cogent reason, We will not encroach upon the respondent
Court's prerogative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After a careful
perusal of the judgment of the Court of Appeals, We find no reversible error
committed that would warrant the reversal of the present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are in full accord with the findings and
conclusions of the respondent Court as the same are final and binding upon <span class="GramE">Us</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="GramE">We</span> again reiterate the voluminous jurisprudence to the <span style="">effect </span>that "findings of facts of
the Court of Appeals are binding on the Supreme Court and cannot be
reviewed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Torres v.</span>
People, 39 SCRA 28; Heirs of Francisco Pasco v. Han <span class="SpellE">Pia</span>,
45 SCRA 164; <span class="SpellE">Tolentino</span> v. De Jesus, 56 SCRA 167; <span class="SpellE">Tiongco</span> v. De la Merced, 58 SCRA 89).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>are not unmindful that the foregoing established rule admits of
exceptions, such that the findings of fact of the Court of Appeals may be
reviewed by <span class="GramE">Us</span>:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the same are grounded entirely on
speculation, surmises or conjectures;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the inference made is manifestly
mistaken, absurd or impossible;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When there is grave abuse of discretion;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the judgment is based on misapprehension
of facts; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the Court of Appeals, in making its
findings, went beyond the issues of the case and the same are contrary to the
admissions of both appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Ramos v. CA, 63 SCRA 331; <span class="SpellE">Napolis</span> v. CA, 43 SCRA 301).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span>find that not
one of the exceptional circumstances aforementioned is present in the case at
bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The findings of facts of the
appealed decision are sufficiently supported by substantial evidence, and the
conclusions drawn <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> are not against the law
or jurisprudence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Court
of Appeals rests on cited doctrinal jurisprudence, justice and equity as it
stated that:</p>

<blockquote>"Considering the doctrine laid down in the said decisions
(Gregorio <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Inc. vs. Dolores de Mesa, 35 SCRA
137, and <span class="SpellE">Divino</span> vs. Marcos, et al., 4 SCRA 186), and
the fact that the petitioner had been in the occupancy of the premises since
1899, petitioner's occupancy has gone for no less than 70 years, We, therefore,
find in the broader interest of justice and equity the extension of the lease
should be for a period of five (5) years."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After having gone at length over the records of the present case,
and in the light of the above pronouncements, <span class="GramE"><span style="">We</span></span><span style=""> </span>are positively convinced that the petitioner is not entitled to
the writ of <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is
absolutely no showing that the respondent Court acted so
"arbitrarily", "despotically", or "capriciously"
as to amount to lack of jurisdiction in reviewing the appealed decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is settled to the point of being
elementary that the only question involved in <i>certiorari</i> is jurisdiction,
either want of jurisdiction or excess thereof, and abuse of discretion shall
warrant the issuance of the extraordinary remedy of <i>certiorari</i> when the
same is so grave "as when the power is exercised in an arbitrary or
despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice or personal hostility, and it
must be so patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty, or to
a virtual refusal to perform a duty enjoined, or to act at all, in
contemplation of law (<span class="SpellE">Abig</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Constantino</span>,
2 SCRA 299; <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos v. Province of <span class="SpellE">Tarlac</span>, 67 Phil. 480; <span class="SpellE">Alafriz</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Wable</span>, 72 Phil. 278).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Even mere abuse of discretion is not sufficient by itself to justify the
issuance of a writ of <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For that purpose, the abuse of discretion must be grave and patent and
it must be shown that it was exercised arbitrarily or despotically (<span class="SpellE">Travera</span> Luna, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Nable</span>, 72
Phil. 278; Villa <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> Transit, Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Bello</span>, 75 SCRA 735) which is not the case made out by the

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>Acting C</i>.<i>J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the result of the judgment penned by Mr. Justice
Guerrero affirming the decision of the Court of Appeals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said decision of the Court of Appeals
extended the lease of respondent over the commercial property for an
unqualified period of five (5) years "in the broader interest of justice
and equity," and modified that of the Court of First Instance which
extended the duration of respondent's lease of petitioner's property "to
one (1) year to commence from finality of the decision." Accordingly, it
should be understood that such flat and unqualified five-year extension granted
by the appellate court should be counted from the date of promulgation of its
decision on <st1:date year="1977" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1977</st1:date>
which will therefore expire on <st1:date year="1982" day="21" month="9">September
 21, 1982</st1:date>.</p>
