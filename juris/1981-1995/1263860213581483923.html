<p class="BODY">As mentioned <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">earlier, </span>the
NLRC affirmed the above decision of the POEA <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its petition for <i>certiorari</i>, the petitioner questions
only the award of stand-by pay to <span class="SpellE">Saceda</span> for being
allegedly devoid of legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition has no merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The legal basis of the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> award of
"stand-by" pay to <span class="SpellE">Saceda</span> during the period
that he was made to wait while his employer worked for the ticketing, booking
and processing of his exit visa and travel documents for his return trip to the
Philippines, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is
</span>the employment contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
the contract, the PNCC was obliged to notify the employee "two months
before the end of the term of the contract" whether his contract would be
extended or he would be repatriated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Within that two-month period, the employer, which keeps in its
possession the employee's passport and travel documents for the duration of his
employment, is supposed to work for the ticketing and processing of the
employee's travel documents so that he may immediately return to the
Philippines upon the expiration of his contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner alleged that it takes at least one month to have
travel papers processed by the Saudi Arabian authorities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, the two-month period stipulated in
the contract is more than enough for the purpose.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioner alone is to blame<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span>for its
failure to obtain <span class="SpellE">Saceda's</span> travel papers within the
two-month period before his contract came to an end.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since it was through its fault that <span class="SpellE">Saceda's</span> departure was delayed, it must give him stand-by
pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">The stand-by compensation which the employer is required to pay
the employee while the latter waits for his travel papers, is actually the
damages caused to him by the employer's delay in getting his travel papers
ready.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As correctly pointed out by the
Solicitor General in his Comment, the basis of the employer's liability for
such damages is Article 1170 of the Civil Code which provides:</p>

<blockquote><i>"Art. 1170<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those</span> who in the performance of their
obligations are guilty of fraud, negligence, or <u>delay</u>, and those who in
any manner contravene the tenor thereof, are liable for damages."<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As it was the petitioners obligation to get <span class="SpellE">Saceda's</span>
travel documents ready for his repatriation to the Philippines upon the
termination of his overseas contract, the petitioner must answer in damages for
the delay in <span class="SpellE">Saceda's</span> departure which compelled him
to "stand-by," idle and jobless in a foreign land, while waiting for
his employer to hand him his ticket and travel papers for his trip home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The measure of those damages is the income he
could have earned if he were repatriated promptly in order that he could work
again in his own country.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that <span class="SpellE">Saceda</span> refused to depart
on February 21, 1984 because he wanted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">to
</span>wait for the outcome of the complaint which he filed against petitioner
for the payment of his completion bonus, unused vacation/sick leaves, and
unpaid wages from December 1, 1983 up to January 27, 1984 (when his extended
contract of employment expired) does not shift to him the blame for his delayed
departure, for, as it turned out, his suit was justified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision promulgated by the Saudi Labor
Authorities on March 24, 1984 upheld <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">his
</span>claims.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since <span class="SpellE">Saceda</span> was compelled to litigate
by reason of the petitioner's unjust refusal to pay his valid and demandable
claims, the petitioner is answerable for the damages he suffered by having to
stay on to see his case through.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
petitioner should, therefore, pay him stand-by compensation from January 28,
1984 up to March 27, 1984 when he was repatriated after the petitioner paid the
judgment in his favor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is dismissed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As above modified, <span class="GramE">We</span>
affirm the decision of the NLRC in POEA Case No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">(L) 84-07-660, with costs against the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
