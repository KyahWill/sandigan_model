				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">This is a claim for overtime pay.&nbsp; Miguel Aspera, a mechanical engineer, worked for Engineering Equipment, Inc. in Saudi Arabia for nearly a year from April 26, 1977 to April 16, 1978 at a monthly salary of P750 (P860) with a six-day work week consisting of <i>ten</i> working hours.&nbsp; His written contract of employment provides:<br><blockquote>“1. <i>Work Schedule/Assignment</i>.&nbsp; x x x Your work days shall be on a six-day work week basis, with a working day consisting of ten (10) working hours.&nbsp; You may be required to work overtime in excess of ten (10) hours each, work day and to work on your restdays and on Saudi Arabian legal holidays.<br><br>“2. A monthly salary of P750.00 plus overtime pay for work rendered during restdays/holidays and/or in excess of ten (10) hours during regular working days."</blockquote>Aspera worked ten hours daily for 335 working days.&nbsp; He claims that his monthly salary should correspond to eight hours of daily work and that for the additional two hours daily, he was entitled to overtime pay at $1.2162 per hour or to $814.85 for 670 hours during 335 working days.<br><br>The Director of Employment Services and the National Labor Relations Commission sustained his claim and awarded him that amount as overtime pay.&nbsp; They declared void the stipulation for a ten-hour working day because it was contrary to section 83 of the Labor Code, formerly Eight-Hour Labor Law, which expressly provides that "the normal hours of work of any employee shall not exceed eight (8) hours a day" and to section 87 of the same Code which provides that work performed "beyond eight (8) hours a day" is treated as overtime work.<br><br>Hence, this recourse by the petitioner.&nbsp; It contends that Aspera was a managerial employee exercising supervision and control over its rank-and-file employees with power to recommend disciplinary action or their dismissal.&nbsp; Section 82 of the Labor Code provides that managerial employees are not entitled to overtime pay.<br><br>It also asserts that Aspera was one of several employees who signed written contracts with a "built-in" overtime pay in the ten-hour working day and that their basic monthly pay was adjusted to reflect the higher amount covering the guaranteed two-hour extra time whether worked or unworked.<br><br>Moreover, it argues that the contracts were submitted to BES Director Jonathan M.R.A. de la Cruz, the same director <i>who rendered the questioned decision.&nbsp; He approved the same</i>.&nbsp; Without his approval, the petitioner would not have stipulated the ten-hour work schedule and would have provided for a lower basic salary for an eight-hour working day.<br><br>In addition to his salary, Aspera was given free board and lodging while in Saudi Arabia and free transportation in going to and returning from that country.<br><br>We hold that under the particular circumstances of this case the Acting Minister of Labor and Director De la Cruz committed a grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in awarding overtime pay and in disregarding a contract that De la Cruz himself, who is supposed to know the Eight-Hour Labor Law, had previously sealed with his imprimatur.&nbsp; Because of that approval, the petitioner acted in good faith in enforcing the contract.<br><br>Furthermore, Aspera had not denied that he was a managerial employee within the meaning of section 82.&nbsp; As such, he was not entitled to overtime pay.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of the Acting Minister of Labor dated November 16, 1981 is reversed and set aside.&nbsp; Aspera's complaint is dismissed.&nbsp; No costs.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Concepcion, Jr., Abad Santos, Escolin, Cuevas,</i> and <i>Alampay, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
