				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> seeks to annul and
set aside the Resolution of respondent National Labor Relations Commission
dated April 30, 1991, the dispositive portion of which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby reversed and
set aside and a new one entered directing the respondent to reinstate the
complainant to his former position without loss of seniority rights and with
full backwages from the time of his dismissal up to actual reinstatement but in
no case to exceed three (3) years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED." (p. 45, <u>Rollo</u>)<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are briefly narrated below:</p>

<blockquote>"After a sales meeting of the personnel of the Carlatan B-Meg
Sales Office in the afternoon of July 20, 1988, Rafaelito M. Juico, checker,
informed the Sales Office Supervisor, Mr. Romeo Babao, that the collection for
that day amounted to P80,353.20 of which P25,269.45 was in cash while the
balance was in the form of checks which he thereafter placed inside the vault.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The next day, together with his officemates Mr. Agbunag and
Mr. Velasco, Rafaelito M. Juico discovered that the vault had been opened, the
previous day's cash collection missing, while the checks were still inside the
vault.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"As a consequence of the incident, Mr. Babao was reassigned to
Manila, and Juico was transferred to the Laoag B-Meg Sales Office. </blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rafaelito M. Juico was subsequently investigated by the
respondent on the following dates:  July
26, 1988 at Carlatan, San Fernando, La Union; July 27, 1988 at Manila; August
3, 1988 at Carlatan, and on September 20 and 23, 1988 at Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Informed that his mother had become seriously ill and had
been brought to a hospital in Pampanga, Rafaelito M. Juico decided to stay with
his ailing mother, who died soon thereafter.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At his mother's wake, Rafaelito M. Juico was apprised by his
relatives that law enforcement authorities were looking for him in connection
with a case of qualified theft filed against him by respondent's Mr. Cornejo.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After posting bail for his provisional release, Rafaelito M.
Juico reported to the Carlatan B-Meg Sales Office where he requested the
Personnel Manager to dismiss his case, as he claims to have nothing to do with
it, but he was told that the criminal complaint had already been filed in San
Fernando, La Union.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On August 25, 1988, the respondent directed the complainant
to explain his unauthorized leave since August 5, 1988, which the latter
answered.  Relative to his unauthorized
absences, complainant was sent memoranda on September 14, 1988 and on October
28, 1988, asking him to put forth reasons why he should not be charged of being
AWOL.  Both memoranda were responded to
by the complainant.  With the dismissal
by the Provincial Prosecutor of the criminal complaint against him, Rafaelito
M. Juico sought to be reinstated to his former position, only to receive the
information that his services had been terminated at the close of business
hours of April 11, 1989 by the respondent for the following reasons:  (a) serious misconduct for possible
involvement in the burglary incident; and (b) abandonment of work for failure
to report for work for nine (9) days after investigation.” (pp.  38-40, <u>Rollo</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Labor Arbiter Melquiades Sol D. del Rosario disregarded Rafaelito
Juico's (hereafter, "Juico") contention that he had been denied due
process, since petitioner San Miguel (hereafter, "San Miguel") had
undertaken a series of administrative investigations which thus provided Juico
more than ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself from the charges
levelled against him.  The Labor Arbiter
further pointed out that the dismissal of the criminal complaint against Juico
was no guarantee of reinstatement to his former position, since petitioner's
act of terminating the employee from his work "is simply an exercise of
employer's prerogative for the protection of its interest."</p>

<p class="BODY">Juico's dismissal was upheld premised on "serious misconduct
for possible involvement in the burglary incident, and/or abandonment.”</p>

<p class="BODY">Juico appealed.  The NLRC
reversed the Labor Arbiter and declared Juico's termination for employment
illegal, there being no proof other than possession by Juico of a set of keys
and knowledge of the safely vault's combination.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition by San Miguel, reiterating breach of trust
as a just cause for termination, since Juico had been performing
"functions which, by their nature, required the full trust and confidence
of his employer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is without merit.  Evidence brought out during the hearing of his case shows that Juico was
employed as "Checker." The position belongs to the rank and file
category of employees.  During his
investigation, Juico enumerated his functions, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"T:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bilang
Carlatan B-Meg Sales Office (checker) ay ano-ano ba ang iyong trabahong
ginagampanan?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  S:<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ito po ay ang mga
sumusunod:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1)  <u>Pagwala</u> <u>ang</u> <u>Sales</u> <u>Office</u>
<u>Supervisor</u> (SOS) ay ginagampanan ko ang kanyang tungkulin katulad ng
paggawa ng report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)  Inventory sa hapon at rechecking ng bodega
stock tuwing umaga.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3)  Paggawa ng Daily Sales and Movement Report.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4)  Nagiisyu ng resibo ng bodega sales sa mga
customers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5)  Supervision sa unloading ng incoming
shipment at outgoing load for route.</blockquote>

<blockquote>6)  <u>Pag</u> <u>wala</u> <u>din</u> <u>ang</u>
<u>SOS</u> ay nirereceive ko ang benta ng salesman.</blockquote>

<blockquote>7)  <u>Pagwala</u> <u>din</u> <u>ang</u> <u>SOS</u>
ay ako na ang nagreremit ng cash sales/checks sa Metro Bank armor car (na
dumarating) sa pagitan ng alas 10 ng umaga at alas 12 ng tanghali.</blockquote>

<blockquote>8)  Ang SO(P) din, ang hindi naremit na benta ay
pag wala siya ay ako na ang nagtatago sa Mosler Safety vault na­naka embed sa
floor sa loob ng Carlatan B-Meg Sales Office.  Kinabukasan ay ako na ang nagreremit kong wala din ang SOS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>9)  Dahil walang Security Guard ay ako na ang
nagsesecure ng padlock ng bodega at ng sales office.  Ang mga susi dito ay nasa aking possession sa aking paglabas at
paguwi ng compound.  Record of
Investigation, July 26, 1988, Annex '1,' petitioner's (Juico's Position
Paper)" (pp. 13-14, <u>Rollo</u>) (emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the discharge of certain duties in the absence of his
Sales Supervisor, Romeo Babao (Babao, for brevity) the latter testified as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"ATTY. FE:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - During the time that you were in the
Sales Office who accepts the cash that are paid to the Sales Office?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - It's me sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Is it not a fact even in your
presence you delegated such functions to Rafaelito Juico?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - Yes sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - And what is your purpose for that,
Mr. Witness?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - For facilitating the work sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Is it not a fact that the handling
of cash requires a high degree of trust on the part of the employee concerned.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - Yes sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - And that is because the position of
this Sales Office Supervisor requires a high degree of trust, Mr. Witness?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - Yes sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - How about the position of a checker?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - I trust him, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - You trust him, supposed to be you do
not know if the company trust him, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - As checker you handle the cas(h)
flow meaning to say .  .  .  .</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Is the function of handling cas(h)
with the directive of the company in Manila or was it from your directive?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - As I have discussed earlier he acted
many times as Sales Officer Supervisor, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Where did that authority come
from?  Did that come from Manila or
(from) your instruction only?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - <u>It</u> <u>is</u> <u>from</u> <u>my</u>
<u>instruction</u>, your Honor.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>ATTY.  FE:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Is it not a fact that almost all your
functions as Sales Office Supervisor you delegate to Rafaelito Juico?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - I delegate to him during my absence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - By the way as the Head of the
Office, will you please inform us the functions of a checker?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - I already told you before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Please inform us again Mr. Witness?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - The functions of a checker are:  To check the area, arrival and, the
deliveries of stocks from the sales office to the outlets, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Is that all the functions of a
checker?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - He acted as Sales Office Supervisor,
(his) functions (are) related to the operation if the Sales Office Supervisor
is not around, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - Is that a part of the functions of a
checker?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - <u>No</u> <u>your</u> <u>Honor</u>
(underscoring supplied for emphasis)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q - And that instruction delegating the
work of a Sales Supervisor to the checker merely came from you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A - <u>Yes,</u> <u>your</u> <u>Honor</u>,
(underscoring supplied (TSN, July 10, 1990, Criminal Case No. 2437 pp. 62, 63,
64 and 65)." (pp. 88-90, <u>Rollo</u>) (emphasis ours)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while Art. 283(c) of the Labor Code allows an employer to
terminate an employment for "willfull breach by the employee of the trust
reposed in him by his employer or duly authorized representative," the
basic premise for dismissal on this ground, is that the employee concerned <u>holds</u>
<u>a</u> <u>position</u> <u>of</u> <u>trust</u> <u>and</u> <u>confidence</u>
and it is the <u>breach</u> of this trust that results in the employer's loss
of confidence in the employee (Quezon Electric Cooperative v. NLRC, G.R. No.
79718-22, April 12, 1982, 172 SCRA 88 at p. 94).</p>

<p class="BODY">Juico's enumerated duties do not include the receipt of cash
collections.  Babao had testified that
this was a duty assigned to Juico to be performed in Babao's absence.  The expected trust and confidence, inherent
in an employer-employee relationship, is therefore not present, since Babao is
not Juico's employer, but merely his supervisor.<span style="font-size: 8pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of "serious misconduct for possible involvement
in the burglary", employers are generally allowed wider latitude of
discretion in terminating managerial personnel, or those of similar rank,
performing functions which, by their nature, require the employer's full trust
and confidence.  However, the
termination of employment of <u>ordinary</u> <u>rank</u> <u>and</u> <u>file</u>
<u>employee</u> based on the same ground <u>requires</u> <u>proof</u> <u>of</u>
<u>involvement</u> in the events in question (Manila Midtown Commercial
Corporation v. NUHRAIN (Ramada Chapter), G.R. No. 57268, March 25, 1988 159
SCRA 212).</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that the Regional Trial Court had acquitted Juico in the
Criminal Case of Theft (Case No. 2437 (see Annex "D," p. 144, <u>Rollo</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">Acquittal of an employee in a criminal case filed against him by
his employer does not guarantee his reinstatement if the employer has lost
confidence in him (Ocean Terminal Services, v. NLRC, G.R. No. 85446, May 27,
1991; 197 SCRA 491; Mercury Drug Corporation v. NLRC. G.R. No. 75662, September
15, 1989, 177 SCRA 580); even the dropping of a criminal prosecution for an
employee's alleged misconduct does not bar his dismissal (Starlite Plastic
Industrial Corp. v. NLRC, G.R. No. 78491, March 16, 1989, 171 SCRA 315).  However, in such cases, there is still some
basis for the loss of trust as when the employer has reasonable grounds to
believe that the employee is responsible for the misconduct.  In the case at bar, Juico was acquitted
precisely because his actual involvement or participation in the event has not
been proven.  His dismissal, therefore,
based on breach of trust is illegal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC had correctly observed:</p>

<blockquote>"We cannot see Our way clear into the adequacy of the
respondent's contention that it was compelled to terminate the complainant's
services on the ground of 'serious misconduct' for possible involvement in the
burglary, there being no proof, other than possession by the complainant of a
set of keys and knowledge of the safe vault's combination, adduced to
substantiate such ground." (p.  44,
Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Regional Trial Court in its decision in the Criminal Case
2437 stated:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  The evidence
for the prosecution and the defense are one and the same and that not only the
accused knows the combination of the safe and holds the key to the vault.  The original key is held by Romeo Babao, the
Sales Supervisor and the duplicate is held by the accused.  Nothing in the evidence for the prosecution
directly points to the accused as the same persons who perpetrated the crime as
charged in the information.  The
evidence for the prosecution is merely based on inference that since the
accused held the key and knows the combination, could have logically committed
the crime.  However, the Court perceives
the fact that other persons as stated above who knew the combination and have
access one time or another to the keys and combination of the safe.  This places the other three persons, namely
Mr. Senen, Mr. Cruz and Mr. Babao to be in the same position and all are fairly
and similarly situated as that of the accused.  Considering the circumstances under which the other three aforementioned
persons herein, there was no impossibility of committing the offense complained
of.  The possibility or impossibility of
committing the crime as charged varies apropos the circumstances under which
the said persons were in.  Nonetheless,
the possibility of any of them committing the crime as charged is not
impossible.  x x x." (pp. 154-155,
Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The NLRC therefore committed no grave abuse of discretion in
stating that:</p>

<blockquote>"Where the termination of an employee is sought on so serious
a charge as theft, as in the case at bar, the employer is required, considering
that what is at stake is the means of livelihood of the employee, to furnish
proof that the employee whose services are being dispensed with has in fact
committed the offense of which he is charged." (p. 13, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">and <span style="">in
</span>ruling against Juico's dismissal.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of
merit.  The temporary restraining order
