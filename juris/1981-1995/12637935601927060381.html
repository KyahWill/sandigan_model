1964, it was assessed by petitioner Commissioner of Internal Revenue for

disallowing the deductions of the cost of the cement from the gross sales of

had prescribed.</p>

modified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner moved for a

concrete pipes and hollow <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">blocks which

the Bureau of Internal Revenue erroneously considered </span>cement a mineral <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">product and since it was not taxed under

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the original decision
of the CTA, the deductibiÂ­lity of the cost of cement used as raw material in

13 SCRA 333 and G.R. No. L-22605, 22 SCRA 56.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>From this assumption, the CTA held that since cement as a manufactured
product is subject to the 7% percentage or sales tax under Section 186 of the
Tax Code, its value is deductible when it is used as raw material of another
manufactured product as the concrete pipes and hollow blocks of private
respondent under the same Section 186 of the Tax Code which provides as
