				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioners, the <span class="SpellE">Perartillas</span>,
assail the resolution of the Court of Appeals dated June 16, 1973, dismissing
their appeal (from the decision allowing Gonzalo de la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span>
to exercise the right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of redemption as
a co-owner), because their printed amended record on appeal does not show that
such record on appeal was filed on time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The original record on appeal was filed on <st1:date month="12" day="29" year="1970">Decem­ber 29, 1970</st1:date> or <u>within </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the thirty-day </span><span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period</u>. Because plaintiff De la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> filed a
motion for execution pending appeal, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">the </span>trial court denied in its order of <st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1971"><u>January 23, 1971</u></st1:date>, the record on appeal
had to be amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners (defendants below) were not allegedly served with
a copy of the order of <st1:date month="1" day="23" year="1971">January 23,
 1971</st1:date>. They learned <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span>that
order more than one year later or on <st1:date month="4" day="7" year="1972"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">April 7, 1972</span></u></st1:date><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span>They submitted an amended record on appeal on <st1:date month="4" day="12" year="1972">April 12, 1972</st1:date>. The <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">lower court in its order of </span><st1:date month="9" day="2" year="1972"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">September
 2, 1972</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> required the
petitioners to amend further their record on appeal, giving them an </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">extension</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">up to </span><st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1972"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">September
 23, 1972</span></u></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to effect the amendment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="11" day="4" year="1972">November 4, 1972</st1:date>,
the lower court issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">an </span>order
approving petitioners' second amended record on appeal (p. 4, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>). <u>No </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">objection
was interposed by De la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">. </span>The record was elevated to the Court
of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the docket fee had been paid and the second amended record
on appeal was printed, De la <span class="SpellE">Peña</span> filed a motion to
dismiss the appeal on the ground that the said printed record on appeal does
not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">contain </span>material data
showing that the appeal was perfected on time. As already stated, the Appellate
Court dismissed the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the dismissal of the appeal is erroneous. The
lawyers of the parties were negligent in not seeing to it that action on the
record on appeal was expedited by the lower court. The material data <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">rule </span>in section 6, Rule 41 of the
Rules of Court was construed as mandatory and jurisdictional (Director of Lands
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vs. </span>Antonio, 122 Phil. 529 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and </span>other cases).</p>

<p class="BODY"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">But </span>later cases
relaxed the rule</u>. The approval of the record on appeal <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by </span>the trial court should be accorded
great weight. "No trial judge in his right mind and who is aware of the
serious responsibilities of his office would approve a record on appeal that
was not timely filed" (B. E. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Berkenkotter</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> vs.
Court of Appeals, L-36629, September 28, 1973, 53 SCRA 228, 236).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this case the <u>original</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"> </span>record on appeal was <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">unquestionably
filed on time</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. </span>The
record on appeal was amended twice although the amendments were made more than
one year after the expiration of the thirty-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period. The amended record on appeal is "deemed to have been filed on the
presentation of the original, which was done with<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period" (<span class="SpellE">Diola</span> vs. Court of Appeals, L-36455, April 30, 1976, 70
SCRA 511, 515-6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the resolution of dismissal of the Court of
Appeals is reversed and set aside. The Intermediate Appellate Court is directed
to give due course to petitioners' appeal. No costs.</p>
