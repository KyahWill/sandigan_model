the Secretary of Justice rendered Opinion No. 191, series of 1958 finding <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span> <span class="SpellE">Chia</span>, Jr., alias <span class="SpellE">Sia</span> <span class="SpellE">Pieng</span> <span class="SpellE">Hui</span>
to be a Filipino citizen as it appears that his father <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Chia</span>, Sr. is a Filipino citizen born on <st1:date month="11" day="28" year="1899">November 28, 1899</st1:date> being the

<st1:date month="10" day="3" year="1980">October 3, 1980</st1:date> the

the ground that it was founded on fraud <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and

 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="9" month="3">March 9, 1981</st1:date>
a charge for deportation was filed with the Commission on Immigration and

<p class="BODY">An amended charge was filed with the CID on <st1:date month="3" day="19" year="1981">March 19, 1981</st1:date> alleging that said respondents
refused to register as aliens having been required to do so and continued to

acts of undesirability.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="4" year="1981">September 4, 1981</st1:date>
said respondents filed a motion to dismiss the amended charges on the ground
that the CID has no authority to reopen a matter long settled under Opinion No.
191, series of 1958.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion to
dismiss was opposed by the private prosecutor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The CID special prosecutor also filed an opposition on the ground that
the citizenship may be threshed out as the occasion may demand and that due
process was accorded to respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
respondents filed a reply thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motion
to dismiss was denied by the CID and a motion for reconsideration of said
denial was also denied in a resolution dated <st1:date month="12" day="10" year="1981">December 10, 1981</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Said respondents then filed with this Court on <st1:date month="2" day="11" year="1982">February 11, 1982</st1:date> a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
and prohibition with a prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary
injunction and restraining order docketed as G.R. No. 59619.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After requiring a comment thereon, on <st1:date month="4" day="28" year="1982">April 28, 1982</st1:date> this Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
resolved to dismiss the petition for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, Manuel <span class="SpellE">Chia</span> was charged with
falsification of public documents in the Court of First Instance (CFI) of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
in Criminal Case No. 60172 for alleging that he was a Filipino citizen in the
execution of a Deed of Absolute Sale of certain real property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was acquitted by the trial court in an
order dated May 5, 1982 on the ground that Opinion No. 191, series of 1958 of
the Secretary of Justice may be equated as <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">judicata</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>and that revocation thereof by

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="6" day="1" year="1982">June 1, 1982</st1:date>
respondents filed a motion for reconsideration of the aforesaid resolution of
this Court dismissing the petition but this was denied by another resolution of
this Court dated <st1:date month="8" day="17" year="1982">August 17, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A second motion for reconsideration thereof
was also denied by this Court on <st1:date month="9" day="16" year="1982">September

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="9" day="23" year="1982">September 23, 1982</st1:date>
the CID set the deportation case against respondents for hearing and Acting
Commissioner Victor G. <span class="SpellE">Nituda</span> gave respondents three
(3) days to move for reconsideration of the order directing them to register as
aliens and to oppose the motion for their arrest.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="9" day="27" year="1982">September
 27, 1982</st1:date> respondents filed said motion for reconsideration and
opposition but this was denied by Acting Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Nituda</span>
on <st1:date month="9" day="28" year="1982">September 28, 1982</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter directed respondents to register
as aliens within two (2) days from notice thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deportation case was set for hearing on <st1:date month="10" day="5" year="1982">October 5, 1982</st1:date> but on the same day
respondents filed the petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with a
prayer for injunctive relief in the Court of First Instance of Manila docketed
as Civil Case No. 82-12935 whereby a writ of preliminary injunction was
issued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date month="4" day="17" year="1985">April 17, 1985</st1:date> a decision was rendered by the trial
court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">dismissing the petition for lack
of legal basis and for want of supervisory jurisdiction on the part of the
trial court on the particular subject involved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">An appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> was interposed to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In due course a decision was rendered on </span><st1:date month="8" day="19" year="1987"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">August

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Hence, the herein
petition for <i>certiorari</i> filed by petitioners wherein they seek to set
aside the decision of the Court of Appeals and ask that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a new one be rendered setting aside the order
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of the CID dated September 28,
1982 and directing it to proceed with the reception of the evidence in support
of the charges against the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The issues raised in the petition are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issues raised
in G. R. No. 59619 before the Honorable Supreme Court were different from the
issues raised in Civil Case No. 82-12935-CV.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The minute resolution of
the Honorable Supreme Court in G.R. No. 59619 did not make a categorical ruling
that petitioner entered and remained in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
by false pretenses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue of whether or
not petitioners' citizenship was secured by fraud is precisely the subject
matter of the proceedings before the Commission on Immigration and Deportation,
in which no evidence had been presented yet in support of the charge of fraud
in the acquisition of petitioners' citizenship.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Petitioners are not subject
to immediate deportation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The order for the arrest
of petitioners in case of failure to register as aliens was premature since
there was no competent determination yet <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that
their citizenship was indeed procured by fraud.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Honorable Court of Appeals overstepped
its appellate jurisdiction, when it ruled on matters not covered by the
Decision of the lower court."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">There can be no question
that the CID has the authority and jurisdiction to hear and determine the
deportation case against petitioners and in the process determine also the
question of citizenship raised by the petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 37 (a) (1) of the Immigration Act
provides as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 37.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) The
following aliens shall be arrested upon the warrant of the Commissioner of
Immigration or of any other officer designated by him for the purpose and
deported upon the warrant of the Commissioner of <span class="SpellE">Imigration</span>
after a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">determination by the Board of
Commissioners of the existence of the ground for deportation as charged against
the alien:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(1) Any alien who enters the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
after the effective date of this Act by means of false and misleading
statements or without inspection and admission by the immigration authorities
at a designated port of entry or at any place other than at a designated port
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">entry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(As amended by Sec. 13, Rep. Act No. 503.) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">From the foregoing
provision it is clear that before any alien may be deported upon a warrant of
the Commissioner of Immigration, there should be a prior determination by the
Board of Commissioners of the existence of the ground as charged against the
alien.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In this case it appears
that petitioners are charged with having entered the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> by means of false and misleading statements
or without inspection or admission by the immigration authorities at a
designated port of entry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After appropriate charges are filed in the CID the specific
grounds of which he should be duly informed of, a hearing should be conducted, and
it is only after such a hearing by the CID that the alien may be ordered
deported.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such a hearing, Opinion No.
191, Series of 1958 of the Secretary of Justice and Opinion No. 147, Series of
1980 of the Minister of Justice will bear much weight in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">determination by the CID of the citizenship
of said petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioners question
the Order of Acting Commissioner <span class="SpellE">Nituda</span> that they
register as aliens as required </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
Immigration Act. While </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:20.0pt">it </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is not disputed that it is also within the
power and authority of the Commissioner to require an alien to so register,
such a requirement must be predicated on a positive finding that the person who
is so required is an alien.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case
where the very citizenship of the petitioners is in issue there should be a
previous determination by the CID that they are aliens before the petitioners
may be directed and required to register as aliens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The power to deport an alien is an act of the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is an act by or under the authority of the
sovereign power.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
It is a police measure against undesirable aliens whose presence in the country
is found to be injurious to the public good and domestic tranquility of the
people.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Although a deportation proceeding does not partake of the nature
of a criminal action, however, considering that it is a harsh and extraordinary
administrative proceeding affecting the freedom and liberty of a person, the
constitutional right of such person to due process should not be denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the provisions of the Rules of Court of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
particularly on criminal procedure are applicable to deportation proceedings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 37(c) of the Philippine Immigration Act of 1940 as
amended, it is provided:</p>

<blockquote>"c" No alien shall be deported without being informed of
the specific grounds for deportation nor without being given a hearing under
rules of procedure to be prescribed by the Commissioner of Immigration."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the charge against an alien must specify the acts or
omissions complained of which must be stated in ordinary and concise language
to enable a person of common understanding to know on what ground he is
intended to be deported and enable the CID to pronounce a proper judgment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Before any charge should be filed in the CID a preliminary
investigation must be conducted to determine if there is a sufficient cause to
charge the respondent for deportation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The issuance of warrants of arrest, arrests without warrant and service of

rules of procedure in deportation cases shall <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">insure a speedy, </span>fair and just dispensation of justice.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court takes note of the fact that a private prosecutor is
assisting in the prosecution of the case by the special prosecutor of the
CID.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court sees no reason why a
private prosecutor should be allowed to participate in a deportation case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure,
particularly Section 16, Rule 110 thereof, an offended party may intervene in a
criminal prosecution when there is civil liability arising from the criminal
action claimed by said party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such
case he may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">intervene </span>by
counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">In deportation cases, the Court cannot conceive <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>any justification for a private
party to have any right to intervene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Even if such party can establish any damages due him arising from the deportation
charge against the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">alien, </span>such
relief cannot be afforded him in the deportation proceeding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His recourse if at all is in the ordinary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">courts.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the Court rules that the intervention of a private prosecutor
should not be allowed in deportation </span>cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The possibility of oppression, <span class="SpellE">harrassment</span> and persecution cannot be discounted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The deportation of an alien is the sole
concern of the State.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is the reason
why there are special prosecutors and fiscals tasked to prosecute such cases.</p>
