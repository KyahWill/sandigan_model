1988, of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 56, National Capital Judicial Region,
Metro Manila,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

finding, after joint trial, accused <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Yap </span>guilty of illegal sale of marijuana
in Criminal Case No. 23814, and accused Roberto Mendoza of illegal possession
of the same drug in Criminal Case No. 23815, pursuant to the Dangerous Drugs
Act (RA <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">No. </span>6425, as amended).</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution substantially discloses:</p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused herein are inmates of the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Municipal Jail.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="5">1 May 1986</st1:date>,
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o’clock</st1:time> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>the evening, Appellant YAP, who was
detained at the “<span class="SpellE">brigada</span>” of the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Municipal Jail, went to the “isolation room” where Appellant MENDOZA was
detained and sold to the latter for P20.00 six (6) sticks of marijuana
cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unknown to them, Patrolman
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Agarao</span> and Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Muy</span>, then on duty as jail guards, personally
witnessed their movements from a distance of ten (10) meters away (TSN, 16
December 1987, p. 10).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They saw
Appellant YAP holding something in his right hand and when he approached
Appellant MENDOZA, each exchanged something with the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The guards immediately accosted the two (2)
accused and found in the hands of Appellant MENDOZA six (6) sticks of <span class="SpellE">handrolled</span> cigarettes (Exhibit “A”), and in the hand of
Appellant YAP they found a P20.00 bill (Exhibit “G”).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Arrested, and thereafter taken to the
Investigation Room and frisked therein, one (1) more stick of marijuana <span class="GramE">cigarette</span> was found in the pocket of Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span> pants.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Upon investigation by Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Emeterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Malanyaon</span>, Jr., of the
Anti-Narcotics Division that same evening, Appellant YAP refused to give any
written statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant <st1:city><st1:place>MENDOZA</st1:place></st1:city>
did so, however, wherein he admitted the sale to him by Appellant YAP of the
six (6) sticks of marijuana cigarettes for P20.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the lower left-hand corner of the second
page of said sworn statement appears the following annotation:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>“Assisted by Atty. Romeo de Belen - CLAO.”
The Statement was signed and sworn to before the Fiscal on <st1:date year="1986" day="5" month="5">5 May 1986</st1:date>, as shown on the left-hand margin of
the same page.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its Decision, the
Trial Court observed that this particular document was not objected to by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">in </span>defense when presented and when
offered in evidence by the prosecution (At p. 5; TSN 16 December 1987, p. 150).</p>

<p class="BODY">The six (6) sticks of marijuana were sent to the NBI for
laboratory examination and were found positive for marijuana (Exhibits “C”
&amp; “C-1”).</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <st1:place><span class="SpellE">YAP</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">’s</span> version, on the other hand, is that the only reason why
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Muy</span> caused him to be charged for drug pushing
was because he had refused to cooperate and point to one Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Lastico</span>, a designated “mayor” in the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Jail, as the mastermind of drug pushing within the prison premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he refused to do so, he was beaten up
and a firearm was discharged near his ear, after which he lost
consciousness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When he regained his
senses, he was already at the Narcotics Division.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further claims that he saw the P20-bill
(Exhibit “G”) for the first time when Pat. <span class="SpellE">Muy</span>
testified in Court and that he was not really investigated but confined in the
Investigation Room where he remained isolated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mario <span class="SpellE">Mangampo</span>, another inmate and
Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span> co-accused in a Robbery with Homicide
case, tended to substantiate Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span> version
when he testified that in the evening of the incident Pat. <span class="SpellE">Muy</span>
had caused a commotion when he fired a gun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, he saw Appellant YAP taken out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">of </span>the “<span class="SpellE">brigada</span>” and sent to the
Investigation Room.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In other
words, what he wanted to convey was that there was no incident of any previous
exchange between the two Appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, Appellant MENDOZA maintains that he was threatened
and coerced by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Muy</span></span><span class="GramE"> to execute his Affidavit.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His version, given during the trial, is that in the evening of <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="5">1 May 1986</st1:date>, he was awakened by defense
witness, Mario <span class="SpellE">Mangampo</span>, and told that he was being
summoned by Pat. <span class="SpellE">Muy</span> and told to testify against
Appellant YAP, which he refused to do because he knew nothing against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">After assessment of the evidence before it, the Trial Court
rejected Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span> version for being incredible
and refused to give credence to Appellant <span class="SpellE">MENDOZA’s</span>
assertion that he was merely threatened into executing his Affidavit (Exhibit
“D”).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Trial Court opined that,
considering their position and responsibilities as law officers, neither Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Muy</span></span> nor Pat. <span class="SpellE">Agarao</span>
would maliciously fabricate such serious charges against <span class="GramE">both
Appellants nor</span> employ force and intimidation against either of
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the judgment of conviction
that it meted out and the sentence that it imposed, adjudging:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, finding accused <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> Yap
in Criminal Case No. 23814 guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of
Section 4 of Republic Act No. 6425, he is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment
and to pay a fine of twenty-five thousand pesos (P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Finding accused Roberto Mendoza in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. 23815 guilty beyond reasonable doubt for violation of Section 8, Par.
2, of Republic Act No. 6425, he is hereby sentenced to suffer an indeterminate
imprisonment of six (6) months and one (1) day to eight (8) years and to pay a
fine of eight thousand pesos (P8,000.00).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“After finality of this decision, the marijuana
cigarettes (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> A, A-1 to A-6), shall have
to be turned over to the Dangerous Drugs Board for proper disposition in
accordance with law.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
Metro <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, <st1:date year="1988" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1988</st1:date>.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, this appeal.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Required to submit Briefs, the last one was submitted by the
People on <st1:date year="1989" day="13" month="12">13 December 1989</st1:date>
(p. 75, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>). <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The Court dispensed with Appellants’ Reply
Brief in its Resolution of <st1:date year="1990" day="14" month="3">14 March
 1990</st1:date> (p. 80, ibid.), and <span class="SpellE">therafter</span> the
case was deemed submitted for deliberation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants, represented by the CLAO (changed to the Public
Attorney’s Office [PAO]), now interpose the following</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:
15.0pt;margin-left:0in"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;
font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Assigned Errors<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“I.<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in believing that the prosecution has
adequately substantiated the respective offenses charged against both accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“II.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in admitting the
extra-judicial confession of accused Roberto Mendoza although it was taken in
violation of his constitutional rights.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“III.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in convicting both
accused-appellants despite the fact that their guilt has not been proven beyond
reasonable doubt.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Additionally, the defense argues that inasmuch as both Appellants
are detention prisoners it is most unlikely that they would have been buying
and selling marijuana openly and casually instead of discreetly and
clandestinely, and that Appellant YAP could not have come into possession of
the prohibited drugs owing to the strict measures employed in the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> jail on the screening of visitors of inmates.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a review of the oral and documentary evidence, we find the
defense submissions unconvincing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Patrolmen
<span class="SpellE">Agarao</span> and <span class="SpellE">Muy</span> witnessed
the marijuana cigarettes and the payment <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>
exchange hands between Appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the latter were frisked, the goods were found on both of them plus an
additional marijuana stick in the pocket of Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span>
pants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The motives of the said jail
guards in testifying the way they did cannot be questioned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are officers of the law entitled to the
presumption of regularity in the performance of their official duties (Sec.
5(m), Rule 131, Rules of Court; People vs. de Jesus, Nos. 71942-43, 13 November
1986, 145 SCRA 521).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They could have had
no other motive to testify the way they did except to enforce the laws,
particularly, the Dangerous Drugs Act, as is their bounden duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants’ argument that with restricted visits to inmates, they
have no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">way </span>of possessing the
marijuana, as charged, overlooks the resourcefulness with which even jailbreaks
have been staged with the use of crude gadgets fashioned from even the most
innocuous of utensils and materials.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, by their very nature, marijuana in the form of cigarettes can
easily be hidden and carried from place to place unobtrusively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span> posture that he was
charged only because of his refusal to cooperate with prison authorities in
pinpointing Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Lastico</span> as the mastermind of the
marijuana traffic in the municipal jail is tantamount to accusing the <span class="SpellE">jailguards</span> of maliciously fabricating the charges against
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside from the presumption of
regularity in the performance of their duties, Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span>
assumptions are pure speculation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Notably, after the patrolmen concerned had spotted something awry going
on between Appellants, they immediately accosted them, frisked them, and lost
no time in causing their investigation that very same evening.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Further, Appellant <span class="SpellE">YAP’s</span> contention that a firearm was discharged near his ear
inside the Investigation Room to cow him to submission strains credulity,
indeed.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Similarly, <span class="SpellE">Mangampo’s</span>
statement that the investigation of Appellants was triggered only by the shot
that Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Muy</span> had fired before the incident
deserves no credence for being without any basis whatsoever.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to Appellant MENDOZA, his denials that he was assisted
by counsel and accorded his constitutional rights when he gave his extrajudicial
<span class="GramE">confession,</span> are belied by the records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Surely, the CLAO attorney would not have
affixed his signature had Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Muy</span></span><span class="GramE">, as alleged, threatened and coerced Appellant MENDOZA into giving
his sworn statement.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Significantly, too, if Appellant YAP was not forced to sign any
statement when he refused to do so, there is no reason why Appellant MENDOZA
would not have been similarly treated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it bears repeating that said Affidavit was not objected to by
the defense when it was offered in evidence by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">At<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>any rate, even without
such confession, the prosecution evidence can easily stand on its own.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the last analysis, Appellants’ denials, as well as
submissions, cannot overcome the positive and categorical testimonies of the
two jail guards, which are entitled to full faith and credence in the absence
of any contrary indication.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now consider the penalties imposed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the People’s Brief, the Solicitor General submits that the
fine of P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> imposed on Appellant YAP by the
Trial Court should be reduced to P20,000.00 since that amount is the maximum
allowable under Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">4 </span>of RA
No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">6425 or the <span class="SpellE">Dangerious</span>
Drugs Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That </span>was the old
provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been amended since by
PD No. 1675, which took effect on <st1:date year="1980" day="17" month="2">17
 February 1980</st1:date> and, therefore, brings the present crime, committed
on <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="5">1 May 1986</st1:date>, within its
coverage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The amended provision reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“Sec. 4.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Sale</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation of
Prohibited Drugs.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The penalty
of life imprisonment to death and a fine ranging from twenty thousand to thirty
thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any person <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">who, </span>unless authorized <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span>law,
shall sell, administer, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">deliver, give </span>away
to another, distribute, dispatch in transit or transport any prohibited drug,
or shall act as a broker in any of such transactions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">x</span></span></span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> ”</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing amendatory provision, therefore, the
fine of P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> imposed by the Trial Court is
proper.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">In </span>so far as
Appellant MENDOZA is concerned, the Trial Court found him guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of violation of Section 8, paragraph <u>2</u>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">of </span>RA No. 6425 and sentenced him</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">to </span>suffer an indeterminate imprisonment
of six (6) <u>months</u> and one (1) day to eight (8) years and to pay a fine
of eight thousand pesos (P8,000.00).”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General now avers that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">the penalty </span>that should be imposed is not that provided for in
paragraph <u>2</u> Section 8 of RA No. 6425, but that provided in paragraph <u>1</u>
thereof because Appellant MENDOZA “was not convicted of possessing Indian
hemp.” Hence, according to the Solicitor General, the indeterminate penalty to
be imposed should be not less than six (6) years and one (1) day, as minimum,
to twelve (12) years, as maximum, and a fine ranging from six (6) thousand to
twelve (12) thousand pesos.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is only half accurate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The law specifically states that “Indian hemp” is also otherwise known
as “marijuana” (Section 2(<span class="SpellE">i</span>), RA No. 6425; Section 1,
(1<span class="GramE">)[</span><span class="SpellE">i</span>], BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 179).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also, the
crime was committed on <st1:date year="1986" day="1" month="5">1 May 1986</st1:date>
so that the latest amendment to Section 8 is applicable, that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">is, </span>BP <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
179, which took effect on <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">2 </span>March 1982</st1:date>, providing
that:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

twenty years and a fine ranging from twelve thousand to twenty thousand pesos
shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall possess
or use any prohibited drug except Indian hemp in regard to which the next
following paragraph shall apply.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The penalty of imprisonment ranging from six years and one day to
twelve years and a fine ranging from six thousand to twelve thousand pesos
shall be imposed upon any person who, unless authorized by law, shall possess
or use Indian hemp.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While the penalty recommended by the Solicitor General tallies with
that provided for in the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> second
paragraph, Appellant <span class="SpellE">MENDOZA’s</span> conviction should be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for </span>violation of Section 8, paragraph <u>2</u>
of RA No. 6425, as amended, as held by the Trial Court, and <u>not</u>
