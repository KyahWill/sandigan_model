Compensation Commission in ECC Case No. 1140, rendered on August 9, 1979
affirming the decision of the Government Service Insurance System dated June 5,
1978, which denied the claim of herein petitioner Paz L. Makabali for
disability benefits under P.D. No. 626, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Paz L. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Makabali
served as class­room teacher at the Del Pilar </span>Central School, San
Fernando, Pampanga, since 1946 until she retired on August 21, 1975 under the
disability retirement plan (R.A. 660) at the age of sixty (pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">8 &amp; 10, ECC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The records disclose that
as per physician's (Dr. Benicio Torralba) certification, petitioner's illness
started in 1971 as headache and blurring vision (p. 17. rec.; p</span>. 11, ECC
rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On August 24, 1972,
petitioner, while teach­ing her class collapsed with the back of her head
hitting the floor.  Purificacion P.
Bondoc and Dominador T. Bondoc, co-teachers of petitioner, who happened to be
in the adjoining classroom, heard the commotion, and immediately went to see
what was happening.  Upon seeing her
lying on the floor in a semi-conscious condition with face upward and being
surrounded by her pupils, they rushed her to the Makabali Clinic (now the V.L.
Makabali Memorial Hospital) San Fernando, Pampanga, where she was examined by a
doctor and given aid.  On the following
day, she reported for duty and resumed teaching, but she complained of some
pains in the back of her head and also her eyes.  After the incident, she often complained of recurring headache
and painful eyes (pp. 22-23, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioner was treated for glaucoma at the Pampanga
Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and General Hospital in San Fernando, Pampanga, under
the professional care of Dr. Romeo Galang.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Due to this ailment,
petitioner was forced to retire on August 21, 1975 under the disability
retirement plan (R.A. 660) at the age of sixty -- five years short of the
compulsory retirement age of sixty-five (p. 10, ECC rec.).  Subsequent to her retirement, petitioner
herein filed on June 19, 1976, her claim for disability benefits under P.D. No.
626, as amended, with the respondent GSIS for having contracted glaucoma during
her employment as classroom teacher at the Del Pilar Central School, San Fernando,
Pampanga, from 1946 to 1975 (p. 17, rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In April, 1976, she was likewise treated by Dr. Benicio Torralba
of the same ailment.  In 1978, she was
also treated by Dr. Delfin Rosales of the Philippine Eye Research Institute at
the P.G.H. compound (p. 25, ECC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On June 5, 1978,
respondent GSIS denied her claim on the ground that her ailment, glaucoma, is
not an occupational disease taking into </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">considerati</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">on the nature
of her particular work.  According to
the GSIS, "glaucoma is a common disease of middle and advanced life,
occurring generally between 40 and 70 years of age.  It has for its characteristic sign an increase in intraocular
pressure.  Predispos­ing factors are
arteriosclerosis (anaging process) and hereditary characteristics as hyperopic eyes,
small eyes, small eyeballs with large lenses and those in which the cornea is
of small size" (p. 13, ECC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On June 5, 1978,
petitioner sought recon­sideration of the aforesaid denial but the same was
likewise denied by the respondent GSIS in its letter-resolution dated November
21, 1978.  Perti­nent portions of the
said letter-resolution read as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As far as the degree of proof is concerned, the claim­ant
must be able to show, at least by substantial evidence, that the development of
the ailment was brought about largely by the working con<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">ditions present in the nature of employment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In your case, your ailment is Glaucoma.  This ail­ment, not being listed as an
occupational disease, there­fore, requires such degree of proof as mentioned
above.  On the basis, however, of the
papers and evidence on record which you have submitted, it appears that you
have not established that your employ<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">ment
had any direct causal relationship with the contrac­tion of the ailment.  <u>While it is admitted that the aforesaid
ailment supervened in the course of your employment as an Elementary Grade
Teach­er of Del Pilar Central School, San </u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

directly arose there­from or resulted from the nature thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In view of the foregoing, this Office regrets not to be able
to favorably reconsider your claim and at the same time the <u>entire records
of your case will be elevated to the Employees' Compensation Com­mission for
review</u>" (pp. 16 &amp; 17, ECC rec.; underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On August 9, 1979,
respondent ECC rendered a decision sustaining the denial of petitioner's claim
for disability benefits, primarily because petitioner failed to present proofs
sufficient to show causal relationship between her ailment and occupation as
elementary classroom teacher, or to show that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">the </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">risk </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of contracting the
ailment was increased by her working conditions.  Pertinent portions of respondent ECC's decision state the
following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Under the present employees' compensation program, when an
ailment upon which a claim for compensation benefits is based is not an
occupational disease under Annex 'A' of the Rules implementing P.D. 626, as
amended, as in the case at bar, proofs must be adduced to show that the risk of
contracting the ailment has been increased by working conditions.  The degree of proof upon which a
determination can be based must be substantive enough so as to lead an unpre­judiced
mind to a reasonable conclusion that direct causal link <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">exists </span>between the illness and the employment.  It is only submission of such positive proof
that a finding of com­pensability may be rendered.  The record in this case however, is devoid of any showing that
sufficient proofs were presented as to sway the scale of judgment in
appellant's favor.  Even Dr. Benicio
Torralba, failed to indicate in the Attending Physician's Certification that
the illness was directly caused by appellant's duties and working
conditions.  In the absence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of such showing and on the strength of the
medically accepted medical etiology of the disease, we have no other recourse
but to </span>uphold <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the finding of the
respondent System that the 'alleged ail­ment is principally traceable to
factors which are definitely not work-connected"' (p. 23, ECC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The above-quoted decision
was based on the findings and recommendation of the respondent ECC's medical
officer which state:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"<u>Glaucoma</u> is a disease char­acterized by increased
intraocular tension, which can cause impairment of vision ranging from slight
abnormalities to absolute blindness.  It
may either be primary or secondary.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The primary type may be of an acute or
chronic congestive (narrow-angle) type </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

<blockquote>"The causes of primary glaucoma are <u>not known</u>.  Among the <u>predisposing factors are
vasomotor and emotional in­stability, hyperopia and espe­cially heredity</u>.  The increase in intraocular tension is
related to an imbalance be­tween the production of aqueous and its escape
through the normal exit channels.  Obstruc­tion to the outflow of intra­ocular fluid appears to be mainly
responsible for this imbalance.  In the
chronic simple type, the anterior chamber is of normal depth but an actual
obstruction of the pores of the sclerocorneal trabeculae leading to the canal
of Schlemm causes inadequate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">drainage.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

loss of visual fields, followed by central loss of vision.  Eventually, it is usually bilateral.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The last stage of any form of glaucoma when unrelieved by
treatment is referred to as <u>absolute glaucoma</u>.  The eye is blind due to progressive atrophy of the optic nerve
head.  The pupil is widely dilated and
fixed, the iris atrophied, the disc deeply excavated.  Pain no longer is prominent but sometimes recurs at rare inter­vals.  After a time the eye­ball may
degenerate.  (The Merck Manual of
Diagnosis and Therapy, by Charles E. Lyght, 11th edition; 1966; pp. 511-513).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, on November 26, 1979, petitioner, assisted by counsel,
filed the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that her cause of action accrued as early as
1971 when she started having headache and blurring vision.  That being the case, she further contends
that the law that governs the instant case is the Workmen's Compen­sation Act,
as amended, and not P.D. No. 626, as amended, applying the doctrine laid down
in the case of CORALES vs. ECC, et al. (88 SCRA 547).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Commission, thru the Solicitor General, maintains,
however, that the law applicable to the case at bar is P.D. No. 626, as amended,
which covers injury, sickness, disability or death occuring on or after January
1, 1975 (Art. 208, Labor Code; p. 49, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent GSIS, in its answer, likewise maintains that the law
applicable in this case is P.D. No. 626, as amended, on the ground that
petitioner's cause of action could not have accrued in 1971.  Respondent System argues that "her
claim is for permanent total disability and she could not be regarded as having
been permanently and totally disabled in 1971 because she continued working
thereafter.  Stated differently, she
could not have been awarded any disability claim in 1971" (p. 77,
rec.).  Respondent System relies on the
ruling in Legaspi vs. Province of Negros Occidental, L-43066, Decem­ber 29,
1978, that the term "disability compensation" implies that the
compensation must be for loss or diminution of salary.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE find petitioner's claim meritorious.  In line with the doctrine laid down in Corales vs. ECC, et al.
(88 SCRA 547 [1979]), and reiterated in the cases of Villones vs. ECC, et al.
(92 SCRA 320 [1979]), Delos Angeles vs. ECC, et al. (94 SCRA 308 [1979]),
Balatero vs. ECC, et al. (608 SCRA [1980]), LaO vs. ECC, et al. (97 SCRA 780 [1980]),
Calvero vs. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ECC,
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">et </span>al.
(117 SCRA 452 [1982]), Segismundo vs. GSIS, et al. (121 SCRA 304 [March 28,
1983]), the question of compensability of petitioner's ailment hinges on the
approximate, if not the exact, point in time when she contracted such ailment,
which determines the law applicable in the instant case.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is indubitable that petitioner's ailment diagnosed as glaucoma
supervened in the course of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">her
employment.  This was even admitted by
respondent GSIS when it denied petitioner's request for reconsideration (p. 16,
ECC rec.).  Petitioner entered the
government service in 1946, and it was only in 1971 or after a period of almost
twenty-five </span>(25) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">years that her
ailment became manifest as headache and blurring vision (p. 11, ECC rec.).  Apparently, it was aggravated in 1972 when
she collapsed while teaching, with the back part of her head (cerebellum)
hitting the floor, after which she complained of recurring headache and painful
eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On April 10, 1976, Dr.
Benicio M. Torralba diagnosed petitioner's ailment as:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

correctly diagnosed petitioner's ailment as such, her findings (which was the
basis of the </span>ECC <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">decision) on
the predisposing factors of petitioner's disease were actually those of another

differ from each other in the <u>type of patient affected</u>, their <u>clinical
course</u> and symptomato­logy, and in their prognosis and treatment -- <u>closed-angle
and simple glaucoma</u>.  As a general
rule, the first type is characterized by <u>sudden episodic subacute attacks of
raised tension</u>, the most not­able features of which are a diminution of
vision and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the </span>subjective
appearance of halos caused by corneal oedema.  From the less severe of these attacks the eye may seem to recover to a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>considerable extent, but sub­sequent
episodes tend to <u>involve a permanent raising of the tension</u> (chronic con­gestive
glaucoma) which may result in blindness (absolute glaucoma) or an acute attack
may abolish vision.  The second type, on
the other hand, <u>deve­lops slowly, quietly and insidiously over many years</u>
with a characteristic triad of symptoms -- <u>raised tension</u>, typical field
defects and cupping of the disc -- until in the 'absolute' stage the eye become

government as an elementary school teacher for almost 29 years prior to her
disability retire­ment.  She spent more
than half of her teaching services in the barrio of San Rafael, Mexico Pam­panga,
which according to the certification of its Barrio Captain, Julian Quillar,
executed on May 25, 1979, is still without electricity (p. 4, ECC rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">We are well aware of the fact that only a handful of public
elementary school teachers are fortunate enough to be assigned in urban areas
where the working conditions are comparatively much better than those in the
rural areas.  A large<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> majority of public elementary school
teachers, as in the case of the petitioner, work in remote places such as
sitios and barrios under poor working conditions.  Thus, the daily task of conducting classes (normally composed of
40 to 50 pupils in urban areas and up to 70 pupils in rural areas) in an
atmosphere that is, by any standard, not conducive to learning becomes even
more physically taxing to the teachers.  Tremendous amount of paper work during and after office hours (from
correcting examination papers, assignments, school projects and reports to
writing lesson plans and the computation and recording of grades) can be very
physically draining especially to the senior members of the teaching profession
such as the petitioner.  Such and other
related school activities of a teacher, aggravated by sub­standard, if not
adverse, working conditions, give rise to increased tension, if not emotional
and psychological disturbance on the part of the teachers.  This is especially true in the case of
public elemen­tary school teachers whose pupils, being of tender age and
immature, need to be disciplined and to be taught good manners and right
conduct, as well as to be assisted in their formal school lessons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Medical experts report
that "glaucoma is a symptomatic condition, not a disease </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">sui generis</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The characteristic physical sign is increased
in intra-ocular pressure.  xx xx Thus a
rise in blood pressure in the capillaries usually associated with states of
congestion causes a raised ocular tension owing to the increased volume of the
dilated vessels and the increased transudation of fluid into the chambers of
the eye" (PARSONS' Diseases of the Eye, S.S. Duke-Elder, 15th ed., 1969,
p. 285).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">According to the
certification issued by Dr. Delfin Rosales, petitioner's attending physi­cian
in the Philippine Eye Research Institute at the Philippine General Hospital,
"x x her work and the strain on her eyes could have contributed
significantly to aggravating the glaucoma she is suffering right now" (p.
14, ECC rec.).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">WE must not also neglect to mention the fact that public
elementary school teachers are the low­est paid government workers, considering
the nature and importance of the services they render.  They are the most reliable and dedicated
public servants being constantly called upon by officials of the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> local and national government to assist in
various extra-curricular and civic activities which contri­bute to the welfare
of the community and the country.  Their
responsibility in molding the values and char­acter of the young generations of
the country, cannot be overestimated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"Significantly, even
Republic Act No. 4670, otherwise known as the Magna Charta for Public School
Teachers, mandates in one of its provisions that 'teachers shall be protected
against the consequences of employment injury in accordance with existing
laws.  <u>The effects of the physical and
nervous strain on the teacher's health shall be recognized as compensable
occupational diseases in accordance with existing laws</u>'" (Calvero vs. ECC,
et al., 117 SCRA 462 [1982]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is therefore patent
that petitioner's ailment had its onset earlier than when she started to have
headache and blurring vision -- after serving for about twenty-five (25) years
as a public school teacher.  According
to the above-quoted medical authorities, "the disease is so insidious that
it is often not noticed until the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">vision
</span>of one eye is almost </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">lost
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and that of the other seriously
impaired, <u>when it may be discovered by accident</u>" (Ibid., pp. 298-
299).  It was the incident on August 24,
1972, wherein she accidentally banged the rear portion of her head (cerebellum)
on the floor that led to the discovery of her ailment -- long before the
effectivity of the New Labor Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the law that governs the instant case is the
Workmen's Compensation Act, as amended, and not P.D. No. 626, as amended.  Thus, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner's claim having accrued prior to the New Labor
Code, the presumption of com­pensability, the principle of aggravation, the
award of attor­ney's fees and the payment of administrative fees must be
observed and applied.  And the
Employees' Compensation Commis­sion as the successor of the defunct Workmen's
Compensation Commission is duty bound to observe and apply the foregoing
principles in passing upon worker's compensation.  xx x" (Corales vs. ECC, et al., 88 SCRA 554 [1979]; LaO vs.
ECC, et al., 97 SCRA 780 [1980]; Panangui, et al. vs. ECC, et al., G.R. No.
56259 [March 18, 1983]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Under Section 44 of the
Workmen's Compensation Act, a presumption of compensability is established,
although rebuttable by substantial evidence to the contrary.  And this Court ruled in Segismundo vs. GSIS,
et al. (G.R. No. 50941 [March 28, 1983]), that, "(T)he presumption of
compensability places upon the employer the burden of establishing the contrary
by substantial evidence.  As there was
no evidence presented by the employer to rebut the presumption, there can
therefore be no occasion for respondent Commission to absolve the deceased's
employer.  The presumption of
compensability becomes conclusive (Pantoja vs. Republic, 87 SCRA 443; Cañonero

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Furthermore, in the case
of LaO vs. ECC, </span>et al. (97 SCRA 780, 791 [1980]), this Court ruled that
"x x x where the cause of the illness of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

determinable, the medical report of findings presented by respondent employer
(the ECC <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">or GSIS) does </span>not or
cannot constitute sub­stantial evidence to prevail over the presumption of
compensability and aggravation and thus defeat the compensability of the
claim."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Moreover, in Calvero vs.
ECC, et al. (117 SCRA 461 [1982]), this Court ruled that the presumption of
compensability established by law, could not be overcome by the opinion of the
ECC Medical Officer that there was no causal connection between the ailment and
claimant's employment nor was the risk of contracting it increased by the
working conditions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Respondents ECC and GSIS,
however, maintain that the presumption of compensability and the doctrine of
aggravation are not applicable in the instant case.  Respondent System argues that peti­tioner could not have been
awarded any disability claim </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:21.0pt">in </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">1971 because she continued working there­after.  This argument raised the issue of whether or

of salary.  However, this question has
