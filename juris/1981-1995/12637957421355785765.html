				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The question raised in this petition is whether or not
Presidential Decree No. 1344, in relation to Presidential Decree No. 957,
giving the National Housing Authority exclusive jurisdiction over cases
involving the real estate business and limiting the appeal from such decisions
only to the President of the Philippines, is constitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts which led to the filing of the present petition are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 17, 1972, petitioner Tropical Homes, Inc. entered into a
contract with private respondent Arturo P. Cordova for the sale to the latter
of a lot at Better Living Subdivision in Parañaque, Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract price was P32,108.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A ten (10) percent down payment upon the
execution of the contract was required and the balance payable at a monthly
amortization of P318.16 beginning May 17, 1972 for 20 years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 14 of the contract provided that the
contract will be automatically cancelled upon default in payment of any
installment within 90 days from its due date.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 16, 1973, Cordova was informed through a letter signed by
Manuel M. Serrano, executive vice-president and general manager of the
petitioner cor­poration that the contract was cancelled due to non­payment of
installments for a period of seven (7) months in violation of the contract,
particularly the above-mentioned section.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All the earlier payments were considered forfeited in favor of the
corporation <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>liquidated
damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 14, 1975, Cordova filed a letter-complaint with the
Investigating Committee of the Department of Trade asking for a refund of the
total payments he made amounting to P8,627.86.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was referred to respondent National Housing Authority
(NHA) which, pursuant to Presidential Decree No. 957, was vested with juris­diction
over the said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 21, 1978, NHA issued the following resolution:</p>

<blockquote>"This is a complaint for refund of payments made on a lot
filed by Arturo Cordova against Tropical Homes, Inc., owner of Better Living
Subdivision at Parañaque, Metro Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Complainant's evidence shows that on April 17, 1972, he
bought on installment basis a lot in the above-named subdivision at a contract
price of P32,108.00 (Exhibit "A"); that contract was arranged by
Atty. Nelson Revilla, an authorized broker of said corporation; that after
paying the downpayment and its monthly amor­tization, he was asked by Atty.
Revilla to pay for the 20% of the lot value in order that he may apply for a
loan with the SSS; that in compliance with this requirement, he paid the
respondent corporation the amount of P4,406.78; that not being satisfied what
is to be granted to him by SSS as loan, he was told by Atty. Revilla that he
will arrange for a second loan with Tropical Homes, Inc. and for this he gave
Atty. Revilla the amount of P650.00 for Mayor's permit; that since then, he has
not heard from Atty. Revilla; that he was told by the respondent corpo­ration
that Atty. Revilla was no longer connected with it and that he could not use
his lot to secure a second loan from it; that he had paid a total amount of
P8,627.86; that on May 1973, a separate contract covering a house and lot on
the same subdivision was entered into by complainant with respondent; that
through SSS housing loan, the house was constructed by respondent and turned
over to complainant; and that complainant demanded for the refund of the
payments he made on the first lot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent in its answer states that the contract it entered
into with the complainant had been duly cancelled in accordance with Section 14
thereof due to non-payment of installments for a period of seven (7)
months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Regarding the claim for refund,
it believes that the complainant is not entitled to it under the Maceda Law as
the contract was entered into on April 17, 1972 before the effectivity of the
said law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In connection with the alleged
amounts given to a certain Atty. Revilla, the said person is not an employee or
authorized representative of the respondent corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"We are inclined to believe the claim of complainant that
because the SSS and THI financing plan on the first lot pushed through, he
obtained the second lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
claimed that there is nothing in the second contract to show that it was in
lieu or in substitution of the first contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the circumstances under which the P4,046.78 (required 20%
downpayment) was paid clearly shows that what com­plainant wanted was a lot
which could be used for SSS housing loan so that he could have a house on the
lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Be­cause he could not obtain such
housing loan on the first lot, he applied for and was given the house and lot
and for which the second contract was executed by the respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore the second contract was deemed
entered into by the parties in lieu of or in substitution of the first contract
especially when we consider the fact that it was on the second contract that
complainant was able to attain his objective of having a house and lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant is, therefore, entitled to the
refund of his payments on the first contract totalling P8,627.86 with interest
from 1 October 1976, the date the NHA took cognizance of this case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"PREMISES CONSIDERED, it is recommended that respondent
Tropical Homes, Inc. be ordered to refund to Arturo Cordova the amount of
P8,627.86 with 12% interest per annum from 1 October 1976, until fully
paid." (Rollo, pp. 36-37).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied by NHA.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, on April 2, 1978, P.D. No. 1344 was passed
providing, inter alia:</p>

of fifteen (15) days from the date of its receipt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is appealable only to the President of the
Philippines and in the event the appeal is filed and the decision is not
reversed and/or amended within a period of thirty (30) days, the decision is
deemed affirmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Proof of the appeal of
the decision must be furnished the National Housing Authority."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 19, 1978, the petitioner, <u>availing of this decree,
appealed to the President of the Philippines.</u></p>

<p class="BODY">In said appeal, it stated that "x x x we do not thereby
waive the right to question the constitutionality of said Decree, which we
believe to be violative of the due process clause of the Constitution as well
as contrary to the primordial concept of separation of powers." (p. 55,
Rollo)</p>

<p class="BODY">No copy of this appeal was furnished to respondent NHA.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">July </span>10, 1978, Cordova then filed a motion for execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Acting on the motion, NHA issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>Writ of
Execution dated July 14, 1978.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 2, 1978, the petitioner was served with said writ by a
deputy of respondent provincial sheriff of Rizal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The President failed to act on the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this present petition for <i>certiorari</i> and
prohibition with writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only issue raised in this petition is the constitutionality
of P.D. No. 1344.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that P.D. No. 1344 is unconstitutional on
grounds that a) it deprives herein petitioner access to courts of law and b)
the manner of appeal provided for therein is violative of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court does not decide questions of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>constitutional nature unless that question is properly raised
and presented in appropriate cases and is necessary to a determination of the
case i.e. the issue of constitutionality must be the very <u>lis</u> <u>mota</u>
presented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Alger Electric, Inc. v.
Court of Appeals, 135 SCRA 37; Dumlao v. Commission on Elections, 95 SCRA 392;
People v. Vera, 65 Phil. 56).</p>

<p class="BODY">On this ground alone, the petition should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner has not clearly shown how a ruling upon the
constitutionality of P.D. No. 1344 will in any way affect the correctness of
the decision rendered against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no discus­sion whatsoever on the merits of the original case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As far as the records show, the NHA decision
appears to be fair and correct.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, the resolution promulgated by respondent NHA, was issued
before the passage of the questioned decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The writ of execution it issued, as admitted by the petitioner in its
memorandum, did not in anyway rely upon P.D. No. 1344.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The issue of constitutionaltiy is poorly
discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, we decided to give due course and require memoranda
from the parties instead of summarily denying the petition on a minute
resolution because it is best for public policy that the issue raised should be
resolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See Edu v. Ericta, 35 SCRA
481; Gonzales v. Commission on Elections, 27 SCRA 835).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sufficiently numerous persons are affected by
NHA powers and functions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>alleged
that the mode of review on appeal prescribed by the decree violates the cons­titutional
guarantee of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is predicated on the petitioner's theories that (1) the word
"only" as used in Sec. 2 of said decree, "x x appealable <u>only</u>
to the President of the Philippines x x" is a bar to recourse to courts of
law; and (2) the "affirmance­-by-inaction"on the part of the President
of the Philip­pines would render the NHA decision <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">as final </span>and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both premises are without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right to appeal <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>not
a natural right nor a part of due process, except where it is granted by
statute in which case it should be exercised in the manner and in accordance
with the provisions of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Bello v.
Francisco, 4 SCRA 134; Rodriguez v. Director of Prisons, 47 SCRA 153).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, appeal is a right of
statutory and not constitutional origin.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that P.D. No. 1344 does not specifically provide for
judicial review of NHA decisions affirmed or reversed by the President, does
not necessarily preclude judicial review.</p>

<p class="BODY">The extraordinary writs of <i>certiorari</i>, prohi­bition, <i>mandamus</i>
or quo warranto (Rules 65 and 66) are always available in proper cases <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">where </span>there is no appeal or other
plain, speedy, or adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The power of the Supreme Court to strike down
acts which infringe on constitutional protections or to nullify administrative
decisions contrary to constitutional mandates cannot be reduced or
circumscribed by any statute or decree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>No statute is needed to bring arbitrary acts or decisions within our
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of "affirmance-by-inaction", failure on
the part of the President to act upon an appeal does not necessarily mean that
the appealed decision automatically becomes final and executory.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Access to the courts of law may still be made
as mentioned above.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, any such
decision is far from being final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question that <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>statute may vest exclusive original jurisdiction in an administrative
agency over certain disputes and controversies falling within the agency's
special expertise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The very definition
of an administrative agency includes its being vested with quasi-judicial
powers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The ever increasing variety of
powers and functions given to administrative agencies recognizes the need for
the active intervention of administrative agencies in matters calling for
technical knowledge and speed in countless controversies which cannot possibly
be handled by regular courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, there is the well-settled principle that all reasonable
doubts should be resolved in favor of the constitutionality of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>statute, for which reason, it will
not be set aside as violative of the constitution except in "clear
cases" (People v. Vera, <u>supra</u>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">We, </span>therefore,
hold that P.D. No. 1344 in so far as the vesting of exclusive original juris­diction
over cases involving the sales of lots in commercial subdivisions to NHA and
the mode of appeal provided therein are concerned, is not unconstitutional.</p>

<p class="BODY">Parenthetically, Section 9(3) of Batas Pambansa 129 empowers the
Court of Appeals to have:</p>
