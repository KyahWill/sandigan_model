were on their way to the hospital, the latter changed her story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She said that the boy's mother was at the
Philippine General Hospital instead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So
they proceeded to the PGH and went up to the third floor where the accused said
the boy's mother <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>But it turned out that all the
patients on that floor were males.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
make the long story short, the accused had given Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Navarette's</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sister the run around.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And when the latter finally got fed up she
phoned Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Navarette</span> to </span>report what had
happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Navarette</span>
instructed her sister to bring the accused to her as she had now decided to
report the matter to the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While
the accused and Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Navarette's</span> sister were waiting
for a taxi at PGH, the former disappeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since the child had been left with her, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Navarette</span>
felt obliged to take care of him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
also made it a point to report the incident to the police to alert them in case
there should be reports of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>missing
child.</blockquote>
