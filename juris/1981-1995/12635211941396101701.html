The question posed for determination in this petition for <em>certiorari </em>and
 prohibition may be propounded thus:  Is the power vested by Section 7 
of Presidential Decree No. 1716-A on the Export Pro­cessing Zone 
Authority (EPZA) "to receive and investigate complaints relative to 
violation of penal laws committed inside the zones and areas owned and 
administered by the Authority" exclusive in character as to preclude the
 Tanodbayan or his deputies from conducting a preliminary investigation 
on a complaint against the director and members of the EPZA Police Force
 for offenses committed within said zone?
<p>
The salient facts are not controverted:  Sometime in November, 1982, 
respondents Guillermo M. Santos, Jr. and Bernardo S. Yambao, both 
members of the EPZA Police Force in Bataan, filed a complaint with the 
deputized Tanodbayan prosecutor, respondent Benjamin T. Vianzon, 
charging petitioners Gavino Manikad, Roberto Bañez and Benito Arellano, 
director and members, respectively, of the EPZA Police Force, with the 
crimes of smuggling, quali­fied theft, violations of the Anti-Graft Law,
 as well as the Anti-Fencing Law.
</p><p>
On the date scheduled for the preliminary investigation of the complaint, petitioners filed a motion to dismiss<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  advancing as grounds therefor that <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>  Tanodbayan Prosecutor Vianzon had no authority to conduct the corresponding preliminary investigation; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  the complaint filed by respondents Santos and Yambao was improperly and prematurely filed; and <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  there was no prima facie case against them.  The motion was seasonably opposed by private respondents.
</p><p>
On March 8, 1983, respondent Fiscal Vianzon issued the challenged order denying petitioners' motion to dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>
  Upon receipt of said order, petitioners filed a motion for 
reconsideration and/or petition for review with the Tanodbayan; but the 
same was likewise denied by the latter in an order dated May 27, 1983.  
Still unable to secure a reconsideration thereof, petitioners came to 
this Court on <em>certiorari </em>and prohibition.
</p><p>
Petitioners submit that respondent Fiscal Vianzon acted with grave abuse
 of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction in having assumed 
jurisdiction over the complaint filed by respondents Santos and Yambao, 
arguing in support thereof that the power to investigate complaints of 
this nature is lodged exclusively upon the EPZA under Section 7 of P.D. 
1716-A.
</p><p>
A mere cursory reading of the legal provision relied upon by petitioners
 shows their submission to be devoid of merit.  Said Section 7 provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The EPZA, in the exercise of its sole police authority over the 
export processing zones and areas owned or administered by the 
authority, shall have the power to receive and investigate complaints 
relative to violation of penal laws committed inside the zones and areas
 owned and administered by the Authority, and when the evidence 
warrants, to file and be deputized herein to prosecute the corresponding
 criminal cases before the appropriate court or body."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indubitably, the aforecited provision empowers the EPZA not only to 
exercise police authority, including the conduct of ordinary police 
operations such as the maintenance of peace and order, enforcement of 
the law, prevention and detection of crimes and apprehending of 
criminals, but also, as an inci­dent to its police authority, to perform
 such functions as are usually assigned to the prosecution service.  
Thus, it has been empowered <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  to receive and investigate complaints relative to violations of penal 
laws committed inside the zones and areas owned and be deputized under 
said presidential decree to prosecute the corresponding criminal cases 
before the appropriate court or tribunal.
</p><p>
It bears emphasis, however, that there is nothing in the context of said
 Section 7 to even intimate that the latter functions are to be 
exercised in an exclusive manner.  While the adjective "sole" was used 
in conjunction with "police authority", no similar term or synonym was 
employed to describe the other powers vested by Section 7 on the EPZA.  
It is a basic rule of statutory construction that a meaning that does 
not appear nor is intended or reflected in the very language of the 
statute cannot be placed therein.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
</p><p>
Thus, the interpretation given to Sections 182 and 184 of the Election 
Code of 1978 in the case of Rogelio de Jesus vs. People of the 
Philippines,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  cited by 
petitioners, cannot be accorded Section 7 of PD 1716-A.  Neither can the
 latter decree be considered as an exception to, or a limitation on, the
 authority of the Tanodbayan or his deputies to investigate complaints 
for offenses falling within the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan, to 
wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "(a)   Violations of Republic Act No. 3019, as amended, otherwise 
known as the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, and Republic Act No. 
1379; </p>
  <p> "(b)   Crimes committed by public officers and employees, 
including those employed in government-owned or controlled corporations,
 embraced in Title VII of the Revised Penal Code, whether simple or 
complexed with other crimes; </p>
  <p> "(c)   Other crimes or offenses committed by public officers or 
employees, including those employed in government-owned or controlled 
corporations, in relation to their office."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The objection posed by petitioners to the authority of respondent 
Tanodbayan's prosecutor to conduct a preliminary investigation of the 
complaint filed against petitioners by private respondents, being 
premised on the alleged exclusive authority of the EPZA "to file and be 
deputized x x x to prosecute the corresponding criminal cases before the
 appropriate court or body," must therefore fail.
</p><p>
Equally untenable is the allegation of prematureness ascribed by 
petitioners to the complaint filed against them.  The pendency of an 
administrative proceeding does not constitute a bar to a criminal 
prosecution for the same offense.  An administrative case is an entirely
 separate and distinct proceeding from a criminal action.  Each may 
proceed independently of the other.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby denied.  Costs against petitioners.
SO ORDERED.

<p>ABAD SANTOS, J., <em>concurs in a brief opinion:</em></p>
<p>I concur. In my view Sec. 7 of P.D. No. 1716-A gives the EPZA no more
 than the power to organize a police department with functions similar 
to the police department of a municipal corporation.  Like the police in
 town or city the EPZA police can file complaints in criminal cases; it 
can prosecute criminal cases in municipal trial courts but it cannot 
conduct preliminary investigations pertaining to fiscals, the Tanodbayan
 and judges.</p>
