				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Soon after the change of government in February 1986, petitioner
sent a letter dated March 17, 1986 to the Office of the President, and another
letter dated April 2, 1986 to Minister Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span>
of the Ministry of Natural Resources [MNR], seeking:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the reinstatement of its timber license
agreement which was cancelled in August 1983 during the Marcos administration;
(2) the revocation of TLA No. 356 which was issued to Twin Peaks Development
and Realty Corporation without public bidding and in violation of forestry
laws, rules and<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>regulations; and, (3)
the issuance of an order allowing petitioner to take possession of all logs
found in the concession area [Annexes "6" and "7" of the
Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 54-63.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner made the following allegations:</p>

<p class="BODY">(a) That on October 12, 1965, it entered into a timber license
agreement designated as TLA No. 87 with the Department of Agriculture and
Natural Resources, represented by then Secretary Jose Feliciano, wherein it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>issued
an exclusive license to cut, collect and remove timber except prohibited s<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">p</span>ecies within a specified portion of
public forest land with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">an area </span>of
54,920 hectares located in the municipali<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">t</span>y
of <span class="SpellE">Maddela</span>, province of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> from
October 12, 1965 until June 30, 1990;</p>

<p class="BODY">(b) That on August 18, 1983, the Director of the Bureau of Forest
Development [hereinafter referred to as "Bureau"], Director <span class="SpellE">Edmundo</span> Cortes, issued a memorandum order stopping all
logging operations in <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> provinces, and <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
the logging concession of petitioner and nine other forest concessionaires,
pursuant to presidential instructions and a memorandum order of the Minister of
Natural Resources <span class="SpellE">Teodoro</span> Pena [Annex "5"
of the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 49];</p>

<p class="BODY">(c) That on <st1:date year="1983" day="25" month="8">August 25,
 1983</st1:date>, petitioner received a telegram from the Bureau, the contents
of which were as follows:</p>

<blockquote>PURSUANT TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE
PRESIDENT YOU ARE REQUESTED TO STOP ALL LOGGING OPERATIONS TO CONSERVE
REMAINING FORESTS PLEASE CONDUCT THE ORDERLY PULLOUT OF LOGGING MACHINERIES AND
EQUIPMENT AND COORDINATE WITH THE RESPECTIVE DISTRICT FORESTERS FOR THE
INVENTORY OF LOGS CUT PRIOR TO THIS ORDER THE <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">SUBMISSION </span>OF A COMPLIANCE REPORT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS SHALL BE
APPRECIATED - [Annex "4" of the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 48];</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">(d) That after the cancellation of its timber license agreement,
it immediately sent a letter addressed to then President Ferdinand Marcos which
sought reconsideration of the Bureau's directive, citing in support thereof its
contributions to forest conservation and alleging that it was not given the
opportunity to be heard prior to the cancellation of its logging operations
[Annex "6" of the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
50-53], but no favorable action was taken on this letter;</p>

<p class="BODY">(e) That barely one year thereafter, approximately one-half or
26,000 hectares of the area formerly covered by TLA No. 87 was re-awarded to
Twin Peaks Development and Realty Corporation under TLA No. 356 which was set
to expire on July 31, 2009, while the other half was allowed to be logged by
Filipinas Loggers, Inc. without the benefit of a formal award or license; and,</p>

<p class="BODY">(f) That the latter entities were controlled or owned by
relatives or cronies of deposed President Ferdinand Marcos.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on petitioner's letter, the MNR through then Minister
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Maceda</span> issued an order dated <st1:date year="1986" day="22" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July </span>22,
 1986</st1:date> denying petitioner's request.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Ministry ruled that a timber license was not a contract within the
due process clause of the Constitution, but only a privilege which could be
withdrawn whenever public interest or welfare so demands, and that petitioner
was not discriminated against in view of the fact that it was among ten
concessionaires whose licenses were revoked in 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, emphasis was made of the total ban
of logging operations in the provinces of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ifugao</span> imposed
on <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="4">April 2, 1986</st1:date>, thus:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>It should be recalled that [petitioner's] earlier request for
reinstatement has been denied in view of the total ban of all logging
operations in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">provinces of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Vizcaya</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> and <span class="SpellE">Ifugao</span> which was imposed for reasons of conservation and
national security.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Ministry imposed the ban because it realizes the great
responsibility it <span class="GramE">bear</span> [sic] in respect to
forests.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It considers itself the trustee
thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This being the case, it has to
ensure the availability of forest resources not only for the present, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">but also for the future generations of
Filipinos.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, the activities of the insurgents in these parts
of the country are well documented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Their financial demands on logging concessionaires are well known.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The government, therefore, is well within its
right to deprive its enemy of sources of funds in order to preserve itself, its
established institutions and the liberty and democratic way of life of its
people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>[Annex "9" of the Petition, pp.
2-4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 65-67.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for reconsideration of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
order reiterating, among others, its request that TLA No. 356 issued to private
respondent be declared null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The MNR however denied this motion <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">in an </span>order dated <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="9">September
 15, 1986</st1:date>, stating in part:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>Regarding [petitioner's] request that the award of a 26,000 hectare
portion of TLA No. 87 to Twin Peaks Realty Development Corporation under TLA
No. 356 be declared null and void, suffice it to say that the Ministry is now
in the process of reviewing all contracts, permits or other form of privileges
for the exploration, development, exploitation, or utilization of natural
resources entered into, granted, issued or acquired before the issuance of
Proclamation No. 3, otherwise known as the Freedom Constitution for the purpose
of amending, modifying or revoking them when the national interest so requires.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Ministry, through the Bureau of Forest Development, has
jurisdiction and authority over all forest lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of this authority, the Ministry
issued the order banning all logging operations/activities in <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> province, among others, where <span class="SpellE">movant’s</span>
former concession area is located.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, the issuance of an order disallowing any person or entity
from removing cut or uncut logs from the portion of TLA No. 87, now under TLA
No. 356, would constitute an unnecessary or superfluous act on the part of the
Ministry:</blockquote>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:

<blockquote>[Annex "11" of the Petition, pp.
3-4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 77-78.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="11">November 26, 1986</st1:date>,
petitioner's supplemental motion for reconsideration was likewise denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, per MNR Administrative Order No. 54,
series of 1986, issued on <st1:date year="1986" day="26" month="11">November
 26, 1986</st1:date>, the logging ban in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Quirino</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
was lifted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner subsequently appealed from the orders of the MNR to
the Office of the President.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In a
resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1987</st1:date>,
the Office of the President, acting through then Deputy Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaraig</span>, denied
petitioner's appeal for lack of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Office of the President ruled that the appeal of petitioner was
prematurely filed, the matter not having been terminated in the MNR. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was
denied on <st1:date year="1987" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioner filed directly with this Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>petition for <i>certiorari,</i>
with prayer for the issuance of a restraining order or writ of preliminary
injunction, on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="8">August 27, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="13" month="10">October
 13, 1987</st1:date>, it filed a supplement to its<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"> </span>petition for <i>certiorari</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, public and private respondents submitted their respective
comments, and petitioner filed its consolidated reply thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court resolved to give due course to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful study of the circumstances <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in </span>the case at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">bar, </span>the Court finds several factors which militate against the
issuance of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> in favor of petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. Firstly, the refusal of public respondents herein to reverse
final and executory administrative orders does not constitute grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is an established doctrine in this jurisdiction that the
decisions and orders of administrative agencies have upon their finality, the
force and binding effect of a final judgment within the purview of the doctrine
of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">res</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">judicata</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>These
decisions and orders are as conclusive upon the rights of the affected parties
as though the same had been rendered by a court of general jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>iudicata</u></span> thus forbids the reopening of a
matter once determined by competent authority acting within their exclusive
jurisdiction [<u>See</u> <span class="SpellE">Brillantes</span> v. Castro, 99
Phil. 497 (1956); <span class="SpellE">Ipekdjian</span> Merchandising Co., Inc.
v. Court of Tax Appeals, G.R. No. L-15430, <st1:date year="1963" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1963</st1:date>, 9 SCRA 72; San Luis v. Court of
Appeals, G.R. No. 80160, <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="6">June 26, 1989</st1:date>.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner's letters to the Office of the
President and the MNR [now the Department of Environment and Natural Resources
(DENR)] dated March 17, 1986 and April 2, 1986, respectively, sought the
reconsideration of a memorandum order issued by the Bureau of Forest
Development which cancelled its timber license agreement in 1983, as well as
the revocation of TLA No. 356 subsequently issued by the Bureau to private
respondents in 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">But as gleaned from the record, petitioner did not avail of its
remedies under the law, i.e. Section 8 of Pres. Dec. No. 705 as amended, for
attacking the validity <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">of </span>these
administrative actions until after 1986.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By the time petitioner sent its letter dated April 2, 1986 to the newly
appointed Minister of the MNR, requesting reconsideration of the above Bureau
actions, these were already settled matters as far as petitioner was concerned
[<u>See</u> <span class="SpellE">Rueda</span> v. Court of Agrarian Relations, 106
Phil. 300 (1959); <span class="SpellE">Danan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Aspillera</span>,
G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-17305.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">No particular significance can be attached to petitioner's letter
dated September 19, 1983 which petitioner claimed to have sent to then
President Marcos<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span>[Annex
"6" of Petition, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 50-53], seeking
the reconsideration of the 1983 order issued by Director Cortes of the Bureau.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be pointed out that the averments in
this letter are entirely different from the charges of fraud against officials
under the previous resume made by petitioner in its letters to public
respondents herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the letter to
then President Marcos, petitioner simply contested its inclusion in the list of
concessionaires, whose licenses were cancelled, by defending its record of
selective logging and reforestation practices in the subject concession
area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, no other administrative steps
appear to have been taken by petitioner until 1986, despite the fact that the
alleged fraudulent scheme became apparent in 1984 as evidenced by the awarding
of the subject timber concession area to other entities in that year.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. Moreover, petitioner is precluded from availing of the
benefits of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> in the present case because he failed
to file his petition within a reasonable period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The principal issue ostensibly presented for resolution in the
instant petition is whether or not public respondents herein acted with grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in refusing to
overturn administrative orders issued by their predecessors in the past
regime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, what the petition
ultimately seeks is the nullification of the Bureau orders <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span>
TLA No. 87 and granting TLA No. 356 to private respondent, which were issued
way back in 1983 and 1984, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">Once again, the fact that petitioner failed to seasonably take
judicial recourse to have the earlier administrative actions reviewed by the
courts through a petition for <i>certiorari</i> is prejudicial to its
cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For although no specific time
frame is fixed for the institution of a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i>
under Rule 65 of the Revised Rules of Court, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">same must</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>nevertheless
be done within a "reasonable time".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The yardstick to measure the timeliness of a petition for <i>certiorari</i>
is the "reasonableness of the length of time that had expired from the
commission of the acts complained of up to the institution of the proceeding to
annul the same" [Toledo v. <span class="SpellE">Pardo</span>, G.R. No.
56761, November 19, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1982, </span>118
SCRA 566, 571.] And failure to file the petition for <i>certiorari</i> within a
reasonable period of time renders the petitioner susceptible to the adverse
legal consequences of <span class="SpellE">laches</span> [<st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Laches</span> is defined as the failure or
neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time to do that which by
exercising due diligence, could or should have been done earlier, or to assert
a right within a reasonable time, warranting a presumption that the party
entitled thereto has either abandoned it of declined to assert it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">[<span class="SpellE">Tijam</span>

part of a plaintiff in seeking to enforce an alleged right may, depending upon

rehabilitation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The ongoing administrative reassessment <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is apparently in </span>response to the renewed and growing global
concern over the despoliation of forest lands and the utter disregard of their
crucial role in sustaining a balanced ecological system.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legitimacy of such concern can hardly be
disputed, most especially in this country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Court takes judicial notice of the profligate waste of the country's
forest resources which has not only resulted in the irreversible loss of flora
and fauna peculiar to the region, but has produced even more disastrous and
lasting economic and social effects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
delicate balance of nature having been upset, a vicious cycle of floods and
droughts has been triggered and the supply of food and energy resources
required by the people seriously depleted.</p>

<p class="BODY">While there is a desire to harness natural resources to amass
profit and to meet the country's immediate financial requirements, the more
essential need to ensure future generations of Filipinos of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">their </span>survival in a viable environment
demands<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"> </span>effective and circumspect
action from the government to check further denudation of whatever remains of
the forest lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nothing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">less </span>is
expected of the government, in view of the clear constitutional command to
maintain a balanced and healthful ecology.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Section 16 of Article II of the 1987 Constitution provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 16.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The State shall protect and promote the right of the people to a
balanced and healthful ecology in accord with the rhythm and harmony of nature.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while the administration grapples with the complex and
multifarious problems caused by unbridled exploitation of these resources, the
judiciary will stand clear.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A long line
of cases establish the basic rule that the courts will not interfere in matters
which are addressed to the sound discretion of government agencies entrusted
with the regulation of activities coming under the special technical knowledge

interests of a private logging company are pitted against that of the public at
large on the pressing public policy issue of forest conservation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this Court recognizes the wide latitude
of discretion possessed by the government in determining the appropriate
actions to be taken to preserve and manage natural resources, and the proper
parties who should enjoy the privilege of utilizing these resources [Director
of Forestry v. Munoz, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24796, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 28, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 23 SCRA 1183; Lim, Sr. v.</span> <span class="GramE">The Secretary

licenses, permits and license agreements are the principal instruments by which
the State regulates the utilization and disposition of forest resources to the
end that public welfare is promoted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And

interests so require.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they are not
deemed contracts within the purview of the due process of law clause [<u>See</u>
Sections 3 (<span class="SpellE">ee</span>) and 20 of Pres. Decree No. 705, as
amended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Also</u>,

<p class="BODY">In fine, the legal precepts highlighted in the foregoing
discussion more than suffice to justify the Court's refusal to interfere in the
DENR evaluation of timber licenses and permits issued under the previous
regime, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>to pre-empt the adoption
of appropriate corrective measures by the department.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the Court cannot help but express its concern
regarding alleged irregularities in the issuance of timber license agreements
to a number of logging concessionaires.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grant of licenses or permits to exploit the country's timber
resources, if done in contravention of the procedure outlined in the law, or as
a result of fraud and undue influence exerted on department officials, is
indicative of an arbitrary and whimsical exercise of the State's power to
regulate the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">use </span>and
exploitation of forest resources.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
alleged practice of bestowing "special favors" to preferred individuals,
regardless of merit, would be an abuse of this power.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And this Court will not be a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">party </span>to a flagrant mockery of the
avowed public <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">policy </span>of
conservation enshrined in the 1987 Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, should the appropriate case be
brought showing a clear grave abuse of discretion on the part of officials in
the DENR and related bureaus with respect to the implementation of this public
policy, the Court will not hesitate to step in and wield its authority, when
invoked, in the exercise of judicial powers under the Constitution [Section 1,
Article VIII.]</p>

<p class="BODY">However, petitioner having failed to make out a case showing
grave abuse of discretion on the part of public respondents herein, the Court
finds no basis to issue a writ of <i>certiorari</i> and to grant any of the
affirmative <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span> sought.</p>
