Accordingly, our decision in this case is MODIFIED in that payment of compensation by the GSIS to the petitioner shall be without prejudice to its right of reimbursement from the Department of Education, Culture &amp; Sports, the employees of the deceased Nena S. Iscala. As modified, the decision will, therefore, read as follows, the modification being in bold:<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br><b>WHEREFORE,</b> in view of the foregoing, the decision of the Employees Compensation Commission dated October 12, 1977 denying petitioner's claim for compensation for the death of Nena Iscala is hereby SET ASIDE and the GSIS is hereby ordered to AWARD to the petitioner such compensation as provided by the Workmen's Compensation Act <i>without prejudice to its right of reimbursement from the DECS.</i> NO COSTS.<br><br><center>xxx xxx xxx</center><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Yap (C.J.), Melencio-Herrera, Paras,</i> and <i>Padilla, JJ.,</i> concur.</div>
