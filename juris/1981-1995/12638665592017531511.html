<p class="BODY"><span style="">The antecedent facts of
the case as found by the Court of Appeals are as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>On March 24, 1982, Esteban B. <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, <span class="SpellE">Jr</span> (herein petitioner) filed a complaint against <span class="SpellE">Sy</span> Yuk Tat for sum of money, damages, with preliminary

short) in the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,
Branch LII, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City (the case was later assigned
to the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, Branch
XCVII now presided over by respondent Judge).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the same day, upon plaintiff filing a bond of P232,780.00 said court
issued a writ of preliminary attachment and appointed Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span> (co-petitioner herein)
as Special Sheriff to implement the writ.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On April 6, 1982, the <span style="">same court

plaintiff's counsel and the members of the same team proceeded to No. 65
Speaker Perez St., <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City, and effected a

<blockquote>On April 12, 1982, a third party claim was filed by Wilson Ting and
Yu Hon (private respondents herein) in the same Civil Case No. Q-34782,
addressed to petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span> asserting ownership
over the properties attached at No. 65 Speaker Perez St., <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City (other than those attached at No. 296 <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>
St., Manila).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The third party claim
specifically enumerated the properties, as reflected in the Partial Sheriff's
Return dated April 13, 1982, belonging to the plaintiffs (private respondents
herein).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On the same day that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span>
filed his Partial Sheriff's Return (April 19, 1982) the third party claimants
Ting and Yu filed a motion to dissolve the aforementioned writ of preliminary
attachment in the same Civil Case No. Q-­34782; alleging among others, <span style="">that </span>being the absolute owners of the
personal properties listed in their third party claim which were illegally
seized from them they were willing to file a <span class="SpellE">counterbond</span>
for the return thereof; which motion was opposed by plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On April 29, 1982, then CFI Judge Jose P. Castro rendered judgment
by default in said Civil Case No. Q-34782 in favor of plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, on May 5, 1982, third party claimants Wilson Ting and Yu
Hon filed a complaint for damages with application for preliminary injunction
against Esteban <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cabang</span> (co-petitioners herein) in the then Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch 52, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City ("the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>for
short) which case was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-35128 ("the second
case" for short).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint
alleged <u><span style="">inter</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">alia</span></u></span><span style="">, that </span>the plaintiffs are the owners of the personal properties
reflected in the Partial Sheriff’s Return dated April 13, 1983 which have been
attached and seized by defendant <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this second civil case, the court a quo
(then presided over by CFI Judge <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span> B. <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>) issued an order on May 5, 1982, stating among
other things, the <span style="">following:</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Considering that it will take time before this Court could act
upon said prayers for the issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction, the
parties are hereby ordered to maintain the STATUS QUO in this case with respect
to the properties attached and subject of this action alleged to belong to the
plaintiffs" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 133)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, in the first case, where a judgment by default had been
rendered, the first court issued an order striking off from the records all
pleadings filed by the third party claimants.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With respect to the case in the court a quo, defendants <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> and <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span> filed their answer
with counterclaim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, in the first case, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
on June 7, 1982, filed an ex-­<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for writ
of execution which was granted the following day, June 8, 1982.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the same day (June 7, 1982) that plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>
filed his ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span> motion for writ of execution he
and <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span> filed a motion to quash or dissolve status
quo order in the case a quo as defendants therein on the ground that the court
"has no jurisdiction to interfere with properties under <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">legis</span></u></span> on orders of a court
of <span style="">co-equal and co-ordinate
jurisdiction" and that plaintiffs' complaint is not for recovery of
properties in question."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On June 24, 1982, plaintiff <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> in the
first case filed his <u>ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span></u><span style=""> </span>motion to <span style="">authorize Sheriff to sell the attached properties enumerated in Sheriff
<span class="SpellE">Cabang's</span> partial return filed on April 19, 1982, on
the ground that the properties under </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">custodia</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">legis</span></u></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">were perishable
especially those taken from No. 65 Speaker Perez, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>
City.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, on July 2, 1982, in the case <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> the
court denied defendants' <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> <span style="">and <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span> motion to quash or dissolve the
status quo order.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Meanwhile, the first case on July 12, 1982, <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span>
filed another partial sheriff's return this time stating among <span style="">others that the judgment in that case had
been partially satisfied, and that in the </span>public auction sale held on
July 6, 1982, certain personal properties had been sold to plaintiff Esteban <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, Jr., the winning bidder for P15,000.00 while the other
properties were sold in the amount of P200,000.00 in cash with <span class="SpellE">Bernabe</span> Ortiz of No 97 Industrial Avenue, Northern Hill, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Manila, as the highest bidder.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Back to the case <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u>,</span> on August 23, 1982,
plaintiffs Ting and Yu Hon filed a motion for preliminary attachment alleging
this ground:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In the case at bar,
which, is one ‘to recover possession of personal properties unjustly detained,
x <span class="SpellE">x</span> the property x <span class="SpellE">x</span> has
been x <span class="SpellE">x</span> removed x <span class="SpellE">x</span> (and)
disposed of to prevent its being found or taken by the applicant or an officer’
and/or said defendants are guilty of fraud in disposing of the property for the
taking, (or) detention x <span class="SpellE">x</span> of which the action is
brought’ (Sec. 1(c) and (d), Rule 57, Rules of Court)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Acting on such motion the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, on August 24,
1982, issued the disputed order granting the writ of preliminary attachment
prayed for by the plaintiffs (Wilson Ting and Yu Hon), stating that:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let a writ of preliminary attachment issue upon the
plaintiffs putting up a bond in the amount of P1,430,070.00, which shall be
furnished to each of the defendants with copies of the verified application
therewith, and the sheriff assigned to this court, <span class="SpellE">Danilo</span>
Del <span class="SpellE">Mundo</span>, shall forthwith attach such properties of
the defendants not exempt from execution, sufficient to satisfy the applicants’
demand." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 247)</blockquote>

<blockquote>On August 31, 1982, in the same case <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, defendant
<span class="SpellE">Uy</span> filed an urgent motion to quash and/ or dissolve
preliminary attachment which motion was opposed by plaintiffs Ting and Yu Hon.</blockquote>

<blockquote>About half a year later, on February 21, 1982, in the case <u>a</u>
<u>quo</u>, defendant <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> filed a motion for
preliminary hearing on affirmative defenses as motion to dismiss.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Following an exchange of subsequent papers
between the parties, the court a quo issued the other disputed order which
denied defendant <span class="SpellE">Uy's</span> motion to dismiss on October
10, 1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The motion to quash was also
denied by the court a quo on December 9, 1983.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Uy</span> filed a motion for
reconsideration on both Orders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally,
on <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="2">February 15, 1985</st1:date>,
respondent Judge issued two Orders ‘denying both motions for
reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(CA decision, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 109-122)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, petitioners Esteban <span class="SpellE">Uy</span>, Jr.
and <span class="SpellE">Nilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span> filed with
the Court of Appeals a petition for <i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition with
prayer for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction <span style="">or </span>a Retraining Order to annul and set aside the two orders
issued by the then CFI of <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rizal</span></span><span style=""> Branch 52.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition, the
<span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding respondent Judge not to have committed a
grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in
issuing the order dated August 24, 1982, denying petitioners’ motion to quash
the writ of preliminary attachment, and the order dated October 10, 1983,
denying petitioners’ motion to dismiss the complaint <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, we
hereby deny the instant petition, and therefore dismiss the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No pronouncement as to cost." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 132-133)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the resolution of <st1:date year="1989" day="16" month="10">October
 16, 1989</st1:date>, the Court gave due course to the petition and required
both parties to submit simultaneous memoranda within thirty days from notice (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.190).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondents <span style="">filed their
memorandum on </span><st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="12"><span style="">December 6, 1989</span></st1:date><span style=""> (Ibid., p. 192) while petitioners filed
their memorandum on </span><st1:date year="1990" day="5" month="1"><span style="">January 5, 1990</span></st1:date><span style=""> </span><span style="">(Ibid.,
p. </span><span style="">208)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not properties levied
and seized by virtue of a writ of attachment and later by a writ of execution, <span style="">were </span>under <span class="SpellE"><u>custodia</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>legis</u></span> and
therefore not subject to the jurisdiction of another co-equal court where a
third party claimant claimed ownership of the same properties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue has long been laid to rest in the case of Manila Herald
Publishing Co. Inc. v. Ramos (88 Phil. 94 [1951] where the Court ruled that
while it is true that property in custody of the law may not be interfered
with, without the permission of the proper court, this rule is confined <span style="">to </span>cases where the property belongs to
the defendant or one in which the defendant has proprietary interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when the Sheriff, acting beyond the
bounds<span style=""> </span>of his office seizes a
stranger's property, the rule does not apply and interference with his custody
is not interference with another court's order of attachment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, this Court categorically stated:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">“It </span>has been seen
that a separate action by the third party who claims to be <span style="">the owner </span>of the property attached is
appropriate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this is so, it must be
admitted that the judge trying such action may render judgment ordering the
sheriff or whoever has in possession of the attached property to deliver it to
the plaintiff claimant or desist from seizing it. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It follows further that the court may <span style="">make </span>an
interlocutory order, upon the filing of such bond as may be necessary, to
release the property pending final adjudication of the title.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jurisdiction over an action includes
jurisdiction on interlocutory matter incidental to the cause and deemed
necessary to preserve the subject matter of the suit or protect the parties interests.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is self-evident. (Manila Herald
Publishing Co. Inc. v. Ramos <u>supra</u>).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing ruling was reiterated in the later case of Traders
Royal Bank v. IAC (133 SCRA 141 [1984]) and even more recently in the case of <span class="SpellE">Escovilla</span> v. C.A., G.R. No. 84497, November 6, 1989, where
this Court stressed:</p>

<blockquote>"The<span style="">&nbsp; </span>power of the court
in the execution of judgments extends only over properties unquestionably
belonging to the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
levy by the sheriff of a property by virtue of a writ of attachment may be
considered as made under the authority of the court only when the property
levied upon belongs to the defendant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
he attaches properties other than those of the defendant, he acts beyond the
limits of his authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court
issuing a writ of execution is supposed to enforce its authority only over
properties of the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Should a third party appear to claim the property levied upon by the
sheriff, the procedure laid down by the Rules is that such claim should be the
subject of a separate and independent action.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Neither can petitioner complain that they were<span style=""> </span><span style="">denied
their day in court when the Regional Trial Court issued a writ of preliminary
attachment without hearing as it is well settled that its issuance may be made
by the court <u>ex</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span><u>.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">As
clearly explained by this Court, no grave abuse of discretion can be ascribed
to respondent Judge in the issuance of a writ of attachment without notice to
petitioners as there is nothing in the Rules of </span>Court <span style="">which makes notice and hearing indispensable </span>and
<span style="">mandatory requisites in its
issuance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span>
Credit Corp. v. <span class="SpellE">Relova</span>, 117 SCRA 420 [1982]; <span class="SpellE">Belisle</span> Investment &amp; Finance Co. Inc. v. State
Investment House, Inc. 151 SCRA 631 [1987]; </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Toledo</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style=""> v. </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Burgos</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, 168 SCRA 513 [1988].<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, petitioner's motion to quash or discharge the
questioned attachment in the <u>court</u> <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>quo</u> </span>is
in effect a motion for reconsideration which cured any defect of absence of
notice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Dormitorio</span>
v. Fernandez, 72 SCRA 388 [1976]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Estoppel</span> is likewise unavailing in the
case at bar by the mere fact that private respondent Ting (complainant in the
court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>q</u></span><u>uo</u>) pointed the items
and merchandise taken from the Mansion House and nearby Bodega which were
levied and hauled by Special Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Cabang</span>, where in
the report of said Sheriff made<span style=""> earlier
on April 6, 1982, he stated that </span>on <span style="">the same occasion referred to in his Partial </span>Return, private <span style="">respondents denied <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
Yuk <span class="SpellE">Tat’s</span> is ownership over the </span>goods in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, </span>pp. <span style="">203-204).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In like manner, the sale of the disputed properties at the public
auction, in satisfaction of a judgment of a co-equal court does not render the
case moot and academic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <b>undeviating</b>
ruling of this Court in such cases is that attachment and sale <span style="">of properties </span>belonging to a third
person is void because such properties cannot be attached and sold at public
auction for the purpose of enforcing a judgment against <span style="">the judgment debtor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Orosco</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Nepumoceno</span> [57 Phil.
1007 [1932-33]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The other issues in this case deserve scant consideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of the expiration of the restraining order, there is
no argument that the life span of the <u>status</u><span style=""> <u>quo</u></span> <span style="">order
automatically </span>expires <span style="">on the
20th day and no judicial declaration to that affect is necessary (<span class="SpellE">Paras</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Roura</span>, 163 SCRA 1
[1988]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such </span>fact <span style="">is of no consequence in </span>so <span style="">far as the propriety </span>of t<span style="">he questioned attachment is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As found by the Court of Appeals, the grounds
invoked by respondents for said attachment did </span>not depend <span style="">at all upon </span>the continuing <span style="">efficacy of the restraining order.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As </span>to petitioner's
contention that the complaint filed by private respondent in the lower court is
<span style="">merely seeking an ancillary remedy of
injunction which is not a cause of action itself, the Court of Appeals
correctly observed that the object of private respondents’ complaint is
injunction although the ancillary </span>remedy of preliminary <span style="">injunction was</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">also prayed for during
the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the proceeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the non-<span class="SpellE">joinder</span> of the husband
<span style="">of </span>private respondent, Yu Hon as
well as her failure to verify the complaint does not warrant dismissal of the
complaint for <span style="">they are </span>mere <span style="">formal requirements which </span>could <span style="">be immediately </span>cured <span style="">without </span>prejudice <span style="">to the rights of </span>the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This <span style="">Court
</span>frowns <span style="">on the resort to
technicalities to defeat substantial justice.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span><span style="">Thus, </span><span style="">the Court states that the rules of procedure
are intended to promote not to defeat substantial justice, and therefore, they
should not </span><span style="">be </span><span style="">applied in a <span style="">very </span>rigid and technical sense.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">(Angel v. </span><span class="SpellE">Inopiquez</span>, G.R. 66712, January 13, 1989). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Again on another occasion where an appeal
should have been dismissed for non-compliance with the Rules, the Court relaxed
