<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds accused
Nestor Tan Y <span class="SpellE">Jasmin</span> residing at <st1:street><st1:address>470
  San Rafael St.</st1:address></st1:street>, San Miguel, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>, GUILTY beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime o<span style="">f </span>Rape as
defined and penalized by Art. 335, par. 2, Rev. Penal Code, and hereby
sentences him to suffer an imprisonment of RECLUSION PERPETUA with the

<blockquote>Considering the gravity of the penalty imposed, it is further
ordered that accused be confined at the National Penitentiary in <span class="SpellE">Muntinglupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, upon finality
of this decision." (At p. 66, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In Criminal Case No. 83-22092,
the complaint filed against the accused alleged:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about November 3, 1983, in the City of Manila,
Philippines, the said accused did then and there willfully, unlawfully and
feloniously have sexual intercourse with the undersigned complainant, an
unmarried girl, while she was under the influence of drug, deprived of reason,
or otherwise unconscious, and against her will." (At p. 7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The prosecution evidence
upon which the trial court based its finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt
is summarized in the People's Brief as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1983</st1:date>,
the offended party, <span class="GramE">a B.S</span>. Nutrition graduate and
employed as a baker at the San <span class="SpellE">Beda</span> College, had a
snack of '<span class="SpellE">palabok</span>', and sat alone on one of the tables
of the school canteen (July 2, 1985, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp. 5,
10-15; November 4, 1985, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp. 8-10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After eating a few spoonfuls of '<span class="SpellE">palabok</span>', she stood up and went inside the canteen to buy
coke (July 2, 1985, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., p. 15).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When she returned to her table, she saw
appellant, a stockman of the canteen, sitting on the side of the table (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. <span style="">16).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Appellant was ignored by the offended party but continued to sit
on her table while she ate <span style="">(<span class="GramE"><u>Ibid</u>.,</span> </span>pp.17-18).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Without finishing the dish, she got up and
left to meet <span style="">a </span>relative
somewhere outside the campus <span style="">(<u>Ibid</u>.,
</span>p. 18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While she was walking towards the gate of the college, she
became dizzy and felt as if she was 'floating' (<u>Ibid</u>.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She tried to ignore the dizziness and
continued walking towards <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place> (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, she felt appellant holding her
upper right arm (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 19).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since appellant had been known to her for more than one year, and since
he was the immediate person seen by offended party, she trustingly requested
him to bring her to her residence for she already felt very dizzy a<span style="">n</span>d sleepy (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 19-23).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The next thing she could remember was finding <span class="GramE">herself</span> bleeding inside a small room with her skirt taken
off (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 24-25).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surprised
why she was in that condition, she immediately stood up, but then, because of
her dizziness, she fell down (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 26).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Soon, the door opened and appellant came in (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 27).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He helped her put on her skirt
and assisted her out of the room (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 27-28).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Still feeling very weak, she was brought by appellant to the <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> Fire Station at <span class="SpellE">Legarda</span>
St., but she could not recollect, however, by what means she was brought there
(<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 28-29).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At about eight o'clock in the evening Fireman Rodolfo Acosta
of the <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> Fire Station was notified of the
presence of two people under the mango tree near the fire station (March 25,
1986, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp. 27-28, 30).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached both of them, who turned out to
be appellant and the offended party (<u>Ibid</u>.,).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw that the woman was bleeding and there
was a pool of blood on the spot where she stood (<span class="GramE"><u>Ibid</u>.,</span>
p.28).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He noticed that the offended
party was very weak and could neither walk nor talk (<u>Ibid</u>., p. 31).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He ushered both the appellant and the
offended party to his office, and since blood continued dripping from between
her legs, two wives of his co-firemen brought the offended party to the toilet
and helped her clean up (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 32-33).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While inside the toilet, one of the women
assisting the offended party shouted that the latter should be rushed to the
hospital (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 34-35).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Immediately, Firemen Acosta wrapped the offended party with a fireman's
coat and brought her to the De <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> Hospital (<u>Ibid</u>.,
p. 35).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she could not walk, she was
placed on a stretcher and brought to the emergency room (<u>Ibid</u>., p.
36).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant, who appeared very
restless and apprehensive, accompanied the fireman and the offended party to
the hospital (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 36- 37).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The offended party was attended to by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
Reyes of the De <span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span> Hospital (July 28, 1986, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Record of Operation was signed by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> Reyes,
who diagnosed that the laceration was caused after an intercourse and that the
extent of the laceration required suturing in order to stop the bleeding (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "F"; <span class="GramE"><u>Ibid</u>.,</span>
p. 3-5).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The offended party was discharged from the hospital on <st1:date year="1983" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1983</st1:date> and the next day,
November 7 (should be November 10) she went to the NBI to report the incident
of November 3, (November 4, 1985, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., pp. 34Â­-35).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was likewise investigated by the police
authorities (<st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="7">July 2, 1985</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> pp.
52-55;<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"D").<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On November 10, she was
examined by the NBI Medico-Legal Officer, Noel B. <span class="SpellE">Minay</span>
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 35).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dr. <span class="SpellE">Minay</span> conducted physical and
internal examination on the offended party for any sign of laceration on her <span class="SpellE">genetalia</span> (January 16, 1984, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>.,
pp. 9-19).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The examination was reduced
into writing (Living Case No. <span class="GramE">MG-83-733; <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
"A"; <span class="GramE"><u>Ibid</u>.,</span> pp. 16?17).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusions in his final report <span style="">read â</span>genital findings compatible with
sexual intercourse with man on or about the alleged date of commissionâ,
meaning, 'that the <span class="SpellE">hymenal</span> lacerations are compatible
with the insertion of a penis by man' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B"; <span class="GramE"><u>Ibid</u>.,</span> pp. 36-37).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The report further stated that 'there were
three lacerations on the hymen of the subject which were deep-healing and
located at <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00</st1:time>, <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00 o'clock</st1:time>
(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He found the
portion of the vagina where the <u><span style="">labia</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u>minora</u></span>
and <u>labia</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>mejora</u></span> meet swollen on the
posterior part of the vestibule, which is the orifice at the end of the
opening, and the vestibule itself was also swollen and congested (<u>Ibid</u>.,
pp. 38-40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise found that the <span class="SpellE">rugosities</span> were prominent, which means that the offended
party may not have had any previous sexual intercourse or had not yet given
birth (<u>Ibid</u>., 40).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He concluded
that the breakage of the hymen of the offended party in the three places
indicated that she was forcibly violated (<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 48-49)." (At
pp. 4-9, <span class="SpellE">Appellee's</span> brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The version of the
defense summarized in the appellant's brief is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balantucas</span> testified that
the complainant and the accused were his co-employees at the San <span class="SpellE">Beda</span> College Canteen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant was the baker while the accused was the stockman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant started working at the

working at the canteen since 1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
accused started working ahead of him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
the start, the complainant and the accused were just friends.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later, the complainant was introduced to him
by the accused as his (accused) girlfriend.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant at the time just smiled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant and the accused were sweet with each other as sometimes
during their snack, they halve the cake.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only the accused who told him that the complainant is his
girlfriend even tapping the shoulder of the complainant who just smiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1983</st1:date>, he was on leave.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was on leave even before <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="11">November 3,
 1983</st1:date>, (TSN., pp. 6-18, April 7, 1987)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Accused Nestor Tan testified that he knows the complainant
because she was his co-employee at the canteen.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant joined the canteen in the middle o<span style="">f </span>1981.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were sweethearts until that night when
he brought her to the hospital on <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="11">November
 3, 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He courted the
complainant in August 1982 until she accepted him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The acceptance was made inside the stockroom
because they belong to the same room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="11">November 3, 1983</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time>, the complainant came to his
table and apologized because their date the previous day did not
materialize.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, he told the
complainant that they will proceed that day.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He asked the complainant to wait for him because her off-duty was at <st1:time minute="30" hour="15">3:30 p.m.</st1:time> while his was at <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After

sexual intercourse on <st1:date year="1983" day="27" month="10">October 27,
 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They arrived in <st1:place><st1:placename>Victoria</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Inn</st1:placename></st1:place> at around <st1:time minute="30" hour="16">4:30 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They paid
the teller the amount of P24.00 (for short time) and were handed the key for
Rm. 307 at the 3rd floor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Inside the room, they embraced and kissed each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While they were kissing, the complainant
unbuttoned his shirt slowly and loosened his pants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He took off his pants and in turn he took off
the complainant's blouse and skirt (uniform).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They caressed each other and when they were already aroused, they had
sexual intercourse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the
complainant took a shower and he lighted a cigarette while waiting for the
complainant to finish her shower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
3 or 5 minutes and the complainant had not come out, he called her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant replied, '<span class="SpellE">Sandali</span>
<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">na</span></span> <span class="SpellE">lang</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He pushed the bathroom door and peeped
inside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw blood coming from the
complainant's waist going towards her feet.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant was naked and standing under the shower.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The blood was coming out from her private
part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He asked, '<span class="SpellE">Susette</span>
why are you bleeding', she replied, <span class="GramE">âNone,</span> don't
worry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is just nervousness'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant went out the bathroom and put
on her panties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the complainant was
still bleeding.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"He was asked by the complainant to get toilet paper which she
placed on her vagina to stop the bleeding.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Because the panty of the complainant was already wet with blood, he was
asked to buy a panty outside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
buying the panty, he went back to their room.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He then reminded the complainant that there was only 30 minutes
remaining on their time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They went out
of their room and they walked along <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> and
Evangelista Streets going towards Plaza Miranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They passed through the underpass and he
suggested to her that they take a ride but the complainant opted to walk up to
her cousin's place at <st1:street><st1:address>P. <span class="SpellE">Casal</span>
  Street</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> near the

  School</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were not able to reach the place because there was blood flowing
down to her legs.</blockquote>

of the <st1:place><st1:placename>National</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Teachers
  College</st1:placetype></st1:place> building, the complainant asked if he
could bring her to his house.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He replied
he cannot because his live-in was there.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The complainant asked, âwhere will I clean myself.â He told the
complainant they will seek help from the fireman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fireman agreed to help them provided
there will be an investigation first.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, the officer-in-charge, Cpl. Rodolfo Pablo Acosta was called.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were asked about their relationship.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant replied, 'This is nothing,
there is no problem here because we are husband and wife.' They were permitted
to go to the bathroom to clean the blood on the legs of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the complainant was inside the
bathroom, he was called by the officer-in-charge who asked him why his wife was
bleeding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He told the officer-in-charge
that they came 'from the hotel and he did not know whyâ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he was called by the complainant asking
him to get a panty and a skirt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went
to his house and saw Jaime Sandoval.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asked the latter, '<span class="SpellE">Abing</span>, if you have extra skirt,
because in our house, the skirt of my wife is counted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was given a skirt of the sister of
Sandoval and he got a panty of his wife.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He returned to the fire station with <span class="SpellE">Abing</span>
(Sandoval) and gave the panty and skirt to the wife of the fireman who assisted
the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the complainant
was continuously bleeding, it was suggested that she be brought to the
hospital.</blockquote>

<blockquote>They boarded the service jeep of the station and brought the
complainant to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
hospital, the complainant signed the document âConsent of Operationâ of <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She also
gave the name <span class="SpellE">Jesusa</span> Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, she furnished the name âMrs. <span class="SpellE">Jesusita</span> <span class="SpellE">Oquendo</span> Tan appearing in
the Patient's Admittance Record as well as the name 'Nestor Tan' after the
words âResponsible or Nearest Relatives.â</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the same night, at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="22">10:00
 p.m.</st1:time>, while the complainant was still in the operating room, he
went home and talked to his wife.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
wife was so mad and wanted to stab him when told about what happened to the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After his wife had calmed
down, his wife and <span class="SpellE">Abing</span> Sandoval went to the house
of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon arrival
thereat, he requested his wife and <span class="SpellE">Abing</span> Sandoval to
stay at the gate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Inside the house was <span class="SpellE">Muning</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
asked what happened and he told the latter that the complainant was bleeding,
and, in fact, was in the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
then told his wife and <span class="SpellE">Abing</span> then waiting at the gate
to go home because he will accompany <span class="SpellE">Muning</span> and her
companions to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
hospital, they were told that the complainant was already in the room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the complainant was already conscious, she
and <span class="SpellE">Muning</span> conversed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He smoked outside the room, and, after a while, <span class="SpellE">Muning</span>
called and told him, âNestor <span class="SpellE">pakasalan</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">pinsan</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>â.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because <span class="GramE">its</span> already
getting late, he replied, 'If <span class="SpellE">Susette</span> has fully
recovered, we will take this matter'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
did not talk with the complainant when he was told by <span class="SpellE">Muning</span>
about the marriage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He went home after
leaving the hospital.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The next day, November 4, he got a cash advance in the amount
of P900.00 from San <span class="SpellE">Beda</span> Canteen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In going to the hospital he brought along
Ramon <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Torre</span> and paid
P600.00 as deposit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He proceeded to the
room of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He approached
her, held and embraced her saying, â<span class="SpellE">Susette</span>, how are
youâ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was answered, âI am a little
bit fineâ.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then, the complainant told
him, 'Nestor, I want you to marry me'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He reminded the complainant that it cannot be because he and his wife
(Linda) will be included in the mass wedding that will be held at San <span class="SpellE">Beda</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The complainant pleaded for pity because her honor is at
stake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complainant was crying and he
caressed her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After office hours, at
about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 p.m.</st1:time>, he went to the
hospital with his wife (Linda).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His wife
and the complainant were able to talk.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He was told by his wife that <span class="SpellE">Susette</span> was
asking that he choose between the two of them.<span style="">&nbsp;

leave the hospital the next day.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The accused raises the
following assignment of errors in his appeal, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONCLUDING
THAT THE PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WAS RAPED WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUG
DESPITE ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT SUCH CONCLUSION."</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT
THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED WAS PROVEN BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT." (At p.1,
Appellant's brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Article 335 of the
Revised Penal Code defines the </span>crime of rape and provides for its
penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">elements of rape pertinent to this case are:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the offender had carnal knowledge of
a woman and (2) that the woman is deprived of reason or otherwise unconscious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant admits to
having carnal knowledge of the complainant but alleges that the complainant </span>agreed
to it as they were sweethearts.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The two assigned errors
center on the credibility of the witnesses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The appellant impugns the
testimony of the </span>complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
states that as against his testimony, that of the complainantâs is contrary to
human experience.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He questions the
following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(1) the complainant had a sharp memory
recalling the time she was having a snack to the time she was walking <span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span> Bridge, the time she found herself inside the
motel room with the accused and the name of the fireman who helped her but she
could not remember how she found herself inside the motel room (2) if it were
true that the complainant was drugged, then the appellant could have easily
abandoned the complainant instead of accompanying her (3) the failure of the
complainant to resist, fight, or shout for help when she came to her senses (4)
the failure of the complainant to denounce the appellant during her stay at the
hospital (5) the medical record did not show in certain terms that the
complainant was drugged.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These contentions are
devoid of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The time of the loss of the complainant's memory is consistent
with the time when the drugs took effect on her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is understandable that the complainant
could not recall how she got to the motel room as she started to feel dizzy and
drowsy while walking towards the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Mendiola</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The last thing that she could remember prior
to finding herself bleeding in a small room was <span style="">her requesting the appellant whom she saw following her to bring her
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, July 2,
1985, pp. 23-25).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The complainant's failure to resist, fight, or shout for help can
be explained by the fact that she was still <span style="">feeling very weak from the after </span><span style="">effects </span><span style="">of the drug and
from the profuse flow of blood due to the lacerations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony is substantiated by Rodolfo
Acosta, the fireman who is a third party to both the appellant and the
complainant, who observed that the complainant looked very weak and could not
even walk nor talk.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, March 25,
1986, p. 31)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Knowing that the complainant was very weak, the appellant opted
to remove the complainant from the motel since there might have been someone
who could have linked them together.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If
the appellant was really sincere in helping the complainant, he would have at
once rushed the complainant to the hospital since he saw that the complainant
was continuously bleeding.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the medical record did not show that the complainant was
drugged as she was not checked for such, during the investigation by <span class="SpellE">Pablito</span> <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span>, a police
investigator of the Western Police District, he <span style="">discovered that the complainant was admitted to the hospital for sexual
abuse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, November 12, 1984, pp.
18-19) The complainant was even asked by the doctor who treated her how many
persons perpetrated the act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, July </span>2,
<span style="">1985, p. 41) At the time that the
complainant was asked, she was still confused as to what exactly </span>happened
to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, July 2, 1985, p. 42)</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the complainant is also corroborated by the
National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) medico-legal officer who is likewise a
third party to both the complainant and the appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The NBI medico-legal officer confirmed that the complainant was a
virgin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, January
16, 1984, p. 42) <span style="">and that there was,
indeed, forcible violation.</span></span><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, August 7, 1984, p. 51)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant on the other hand, maintains that the bleeding
brought about by the lacerations in the vagina could have been possible even if
there was mutual consent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He cites the
testimony of <span style="">Dr. de </span><span class="SpellE">Ocampo</span>, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Doctor,
could that extent of laceration on the victim's vagina come about even after
coitus or sexual intercourse had been undertaken by mutual consent between the
participating parties and assuming that the woman had already experience of
intercourse previously?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sometimes it may occur again.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
under what circumstances may <span class="GramE">bleeding</span> ensue?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So</span>metimes, let us say there is a
contraction on <span style="">the woman </span>and any
contraction will find hardness in inception of the penis <span style="">or </span>any object, Your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
assuming that the <span style="">woman </span>had
undergone coitus for the first time, will this injury come about, meaning to
say that she never had prior coitus with any man, could this kind of
relationship come <span style="">about?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Precisely, </span>because you know <span style="">when there </span>is any contraction or in the
uterus there will be very <span style="">dry especially
</span>when there is no lubrication, if <span style="">there
is </span>no contraction, inception will be fairly easy and when there is
contraction, there is no fluid in there and that will cause laceration.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this </span>instant or in the case of the
woman who had never had <span style="">prior s</span><span style="">exual </span>intercourse, with that of a
coitus with a woman who had previous experiences <span style="">and u</span>nder mutual consent and the relationship of the latter
circumstance as against the former to the extent of that relation as found by
Dr. Reyes?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because,
Y<span style="">our </span>Honor, even if the <span style="">woman is v</span>irgin and one is not she can
experience it sometimes, if the woman is virgin there will be no bleeding
provided the inception is done with the secretion fluid.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
in this particular <span style="">case, we are faced </span>with
a victim who had a big <span style="">laceration or </span>injury
as found, is it not true, Doctor, as an expert that this laceration came about
because the <span style="">victim </span>had never had
any prior coitus experience?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">A<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It </span>is very hard to tell, Your Honor,
because whether she had previous experience or not if there <span style="">was </span>contraction during that time and it
<span style="">was </span>done in a hurried way, then
precisely it will cause laceration also." (TSN, pp. 8-9, July 28, 1986)
(At pp. 20-21, Appellant's brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is very clear </span><span style="">from </span><span style="">Dr. de <span class="SpellE">Ocampo's</span> testimony that for the
appellant's theory to survive there must be contraction and the coitus must be
done in </span>a <span style="">hurried way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">This is contradicted by
the appellant's own </span>testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>According to the appellant, they (the appellant and the complainant)
leisurely caressed, <span style="">embraced and kissed
each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant even asked
permission from the complainant if he could insert </span>his penis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, November 24, 1987, pp. 7-9) This shows <span style="">that the coitus was not done in a hurried
way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, there would have been enough
lubrication as not to cause such deep lacerations which even required two to
three stitches in order to stop the bleeding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style=""><span style="">The
appellant's main defense is that he and the complainant were sweethearts ever
since August 1982.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 18, 1987,
p. 18) Thus, there was mutual consent.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, he alleges that he and the complainant </span>had their first
copulation on <st1:date year="1983" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1983</st1:date>
(TSN, <span style="">October 27, 1987, p. 18) but this
allegation was rendered false by the medico-legal officer's statement that the
complainant was a virgin.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
the appellant could not show any token or evidence in writing to prove that
such relationship existed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For over a
year of going steady, the appellant could not show any love letters, pictures,
or token gifts from the </span>complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the testimony of Antonio <span class="SpellE">Balantucas</span>, the
complainant never admitted that she and the appellant were sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His conclusion is based on the alleged
introduction by the appellant of the complainant </span>as such.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, April 7, 1987, pp. 15-17)</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Only Ramon </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">d</span><span style="">ela</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Torre's</span> testimony supports the </span><span style="">s</span>tand of the appellant that he and the
complainant were <span style="">sweethearts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, there is a need for a little more
care in the appraisal of <span class="SpellE">dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Torre's</span>
testimony as he is </span>a good friend of the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, July 11, 1988, p. <span style="">40) Aside from the appellant's self-serving
testimony there </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">nothing to support <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
<span class="SpellE">Torre's</span> testimony.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span class="SpellE">Dela</span> <span class="SpellE">Torre's</span>
<span class="GramE">testimony</span> about <span class="SpellE">Jesusita's</span>
protestations of love for the appellant, her asking him to be their
"bridge", and her desire that Tan give her a baby for her happiness
does not impress this Court as </span>natural and credible.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We, therefore, affirm the
trial court's finding that the appellant and the complainant are not </span>sweethearts
and that the sexual intercourse was unwelcome and forcible.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The argument of the
appellant that <span class="SpellE">Jesusita</span> <span class="SpellE">Oquendo</span>
filed a complaint against him because of his refusal to marry her must fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The complainant was not
outraged by the fact that the appellant refused to marry her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She was outraged because of the heinous act
that was done to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As aptly observed
by the trial court:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Her face (Vide:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>picture marked <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C taken at the NBI, page
22, record) constantly confronted the Court with that appearance of candor and
candidness matched by her honest answers, and sincerely given, to questions
hurled at her about what was done to her by accused Nestor Tan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The simplicity and quiet ways typical of a
Filipina molded in the Christian-upbringing values and culture, remained with her
even when in tears exclaiming '<span class="SpellE">Wala</span> Bang <span class="SpellE">Katarungan</span>!' in remembering the shocking event - that of
having been ravished while devoid of will which brought so <span style="">much torment, </span>shame and degradation to
herself and perhaps her parents and other relatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, in so remembering, it did not
deter her in glare of public trial to tell all bare herself in her search for
justice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court, therefore, is
convinced of her sincerity and credibility, as well as the veracity of her
narrations." (At pp. 59-60, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is a well settled rule
that appellate courts will not generally disturb the factual findings of the
trial courts which are in a better position to weigh conflicting testimonies,
having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying unless it is found that the trial courts have plainly </span>overlooked
certain facts <span style="">of substance and value
that, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. de <span class="SpellE">Guia</span>,
