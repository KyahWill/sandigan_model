Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, 
Branch VI, imposing upon each of the accused Modesto Mesias, Jr., 
Porferio Mesias and Nicolas Bilog three penalties of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 for the crime of rape committed against Leonida Manuel and ordering 
them to jointly and severally indemnify the victim in the sum of 
P15,000.00 and to proportionately pay the costs.
<p>
The accused Modesto Mesias, Jr., Porferio Mesias and Nicolas Bilog were 
charged with the crime of rape in three informations filed by the 
Assistant Provincial Fiscal of Pangasinan by virtue of a complaint 
signed by Leonida Manuel.  The complaint alleged that the accused 
conspired, confederated and mutually helped one another in having carnal
 knowledge one after the other of Leonida Manuel against her will, and 
that in the commission of the offense the aggravating circumstances of 
nighttime, uninhabited place and abuse of superior strength concurred.
</p><p>
The prosecution's version of the fact, as stated in the People's brief, is as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "On April 2, 1972 at about 7 o'clock in the evening, the 
complainant Leonida Manuel was walking home to Barrio San Felipe, San 
Nicolas, Pangasinan.  She came from the Poblacion.  About three meters 
behind her, also going in the same direction, were her barriomates 
Dionisio Descargar, Hilario Carig, and Segundo Carig.  (Tsn., pp. 2-4, 
October 23, 1973). </p>
  <p>
    While thus walking, Leonida met the accused-appellants Modesto 
Mesias, Jr., Porferio Mesias and Nicolas Bilog together with Rodolfo 
Agne.  The appellants who were residents of a nearby barrio were known 
to Leonida.  They asked her where she came from and she told them.  
(Tsn., pp. 4-5, October 23, 1972).  All of a sudden the three appellants
 held her and started pulling her.  Rodolfo Agne tried to stop them but 
to no avail (Tsn., p. 15, May 22, 1973).  Leonida also cried out for 
help to Dionisio Discargar and his companions but these three continued 
on their way.  (Tsn., p. 6, October 23, 1973; Tsn., p. 17, May 22, 
1973).
  </p>
  <p>
    Rodolfo Agne likewise went his way after his attempts to stop appellants were not heeded.  (Tsn., p. 19, May 22, 1973).
  </p>
  <p> As a result of appellants' dragging and pulling her, complainant 
stumbled by the road side.  (Tsn., p. 8, Oct. 23, 1973).  On the ground,
 her arms were held by Nicolas Bilog and Porferio Mesias while Modesto 
Mesias, Jr. sat on her thighs.  Her struggle proved futile and 
appellants were able to tear off her blouse, bra, shorts and panty.  
(Tsn., pp. 10, 15-17, October 23, 1973).  Complainant was then wearing a
 black blouse, green skirt, white bra, pink panty and black shorts.  
(Tsn., p. 15, Oct. 23, 1973; Exhibits "C"-"F"). </p>
  <p>
    Thereafter Modesto Mesias, Jr. went on top of her and had sexual 
intercourse.  Then appellants Porferio Mesias and Nicolas Bilog took 
their turns.  (Tsn., pp. 18-19, Oct. 23, 1973).  While one of the 
appellants had carnal knowledge of her, the two others held her arms and
 kept her from struggling.  (Ibid., p. 14).
  </p>
  <p>
    After the three had taken their turns abusing her, the complainant 
was not released.  Appellants continued kissing her, embracing and 
touching her, at the same time threatening to slaughter her by covering 
her with straw and burning her.  (Tsn., pp. 21-22, Oct. 23, 1973).
  </p>
  <p>
    Complainant put on her garments and walked home slowly (Ibid., p. 
31).  She reached her house at about 5 a.m.  Only her sister was home 
then.  Her parents had gone upstream looking for gold dust.  She could 
not bring herself to tell her sister before she had told her parents.  
Besides, appellant Modesto Mesias, Jr. was hanging around their place 
watching her.
  </p>
  <p>
    When her parents returned on April 8 she told her father what 
happened.  They went to see the Mayor the next day and filed the 
complaint.  (Tsn., pp. 27-28, Oct. 23, 1973).
  </p>
  <p> On April 18, 1972, complainant submitted to a medico-legal 
examination.  NBI Medico-Legal officer Dr. Nieto M. Salvador made out a 
report (MG-720276, p. 8, Records, Crim. Case No. 117)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> 
  </p>
  </blockquote>
<p> The accused denied the charges of rape filed against them and 
interposed the defense of alibi.  Modesto Mesias, Jr. testified that in 
the afternoon of April 2, 1972 he was in Barrio Malilion, Pangasinan, 
with Leonardo Pablo and a certain person named Romy.  Then they met the 
victim whom they escorted on her way to Barrio San Felipe.  On their way
 to San Felipe, he noticed that Leonardo and the victim were quarreling.
  Leonardo wanted to take the vic­tim to his house in San Manuel but the
 latter refused.  Upon reaching San Felipe, the victim went home and he,
 Leonardo and Romy went to his house where they slept.  He knows the 
victim to be married to Leonardo.  He declared that the victim 
implicated him because he was with Leonardo in the afternoon of April 2,
 1972. </p>
<p>
    Porferio Mesias testified that he was a jeepney driver and at around
 7:00 o'clock in the evening of April 2, 1972, he was in Tayug, 
Pangasinan, waiting for passengers for Carmen, Pangasinan.  From Carmen,
 he made a return trip to Tayug arriving there between 9:00 o'clock to 
9:30 o'clock in the evening.  Upon arrival at Tayug, he brought his 
jeepney to the garage and went to sleep.
  </p>
<p>
    Nicolas Bilog testified that he was in his house at Barrio Salpad, 
San Nicolas, Pangasinan, the whole day of April 2, 1972 with his 
parents.  At about 6:00 o'clock in the afternoon of the same day he went
 to sleep after working on their poultry the whole day and woke up at 
around 6:00 o'clock the following morning.
  </p>
<p>
    Venancio Madriaga was presented to corroborate the testimony of 
Porferio Mesias.  He declared that he was one of the passengers of 
Porferio on the latter's return trip to Tayug.  That was his first time 
to ride on Porferio's jeepney.  Before April 2, 1972, he had seen 
Porferio driving a passenger jeepney but he did not know the name of 
Porferio nor had he ever talked to him except the day before he 
testified in court when Porferio went to his house and asked him to 
testify.
  </p>
<p>
    Rosenda Mesias, sister of Modesto Mesias, Jr. declared that her 
house is only 30 meters away from that of her brother's.  At around 7:00
 o'clock in the evening of April 2, 1972 she saw Modesto Mesias, Jr. 
with Leonardo Pablo and another person at his brother's house.  She came
 to know later that they all slept in the house of his brother.
  </p>
<p>
    The alibis set up by the accused are unworthy of credence and can 
not stand over positive identification by the victim who could not be 
mistaken in her identification.  She knew all of the accused, the latter
 being residents of the nearby barrio of Salpad.  Besides, the alibis 
are not supported by positive, clear and satisfactory evidence.  The 
accused failed to show that it was physically impossible for them to be 
present at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission.
  </p>
<p>
    As correctly observed by the lower court, the defense put up by the 
defendants could easily be fabricated and it appeared flimsy and simply 
unbelievable.  Modesto Mesias, Jr. declared that he was with Leonardo 
Pablo on the night of April 2, 1972.  The best witness could have been 
Leonardo Pablo himself.  Porferio Mesias presented Venancio Madriaga who
 declared that he was asked to testify by Porferio only the day before 
he testified in court and that he does not know the name of Porferio.  
With respect to Nicolas Bilog, no one was presented to even corroborate 
his testimony.
  </p>
<p>
    The accused denied the charges against them but gave no valid reason
 why the victim testified against them as she did.  Modesto Mesias, Jr. 
would want the court to believe that he was being charged only because 
he was with Leonardo Pablo on the night of April 2, 1972 and that the 
charge was simply a distorted and perverted way of getting back at 
Leonardo Pablo, who the victim alleged forced her to marry him, by 
filing a complaint against his friends.  Such reason deserves scant 
consideration.  As the Solicitor General correctly observed:
  </p>
<blockquote>
    <p> "No woman in her right mind would go through the trouble and 
embarrassment of a public trial such as was entailed here only for such a
 flimsy excuse.  Modesto Mesias tried very hard to conjure a picture of 
complainant's father hating and threatening to kill Leonardo Pablo and 
his friends and Leonardo Pablo promising to take responsibility for 
appellants' predicament but too fearful for his life to come out in the 
open.  (Tsn., pp. 90, 92, 98, February 13, 1974).  Such assertions 
simply do not ring true.  The unfortunate marriage with Pablo, if any 
there was, supposedly occurred in August 1972 (Exhibit 'I').  Whatever 
bad blood may have existed between Pablo and complainant's family, 
nothing seems to have been done by the latter to the former.  Now, 
almost a year after why should a friend of Pablo be made the object of 
hatred or revenge? </p>
  </blockquote>
<p>
    Besides, if it was only Mesias, Jr. who claims to have been with 
Pablo on April 2, 1972 (Tsn., pp. 88-89, February 13, 1974) why should 
complainant charge Porferio Mesias and Nicolas Bilog besides?  And with a
 very serious crime?
  </p>
<p> Indeed, the entire records simply disclose no motive powerful enough
 to overcome complainant's aversion to any litigation of this nature 
other than her desire for justice.  She had everything against her."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> 
  </p>
<p>
    The victim declared that when the accused started pulling her, she 
cried for help to Dionisio Descargar, Segundo Carig and Hilario Carig 
who were following her but these three continued on their way.  The 
accused claimed that the failure of the victim's barriomates to help her
 is contrary to human experience.  It must be noted however, that at 
this point, no rape had taken place yet.  Dionisio Descargar in a sworn 
statement taken by the Chief of Police of San Nicolas, Pangasinan, 
stated that on the night of April 2, 1972, at about 7:00 o'clock in the 
evening, he with his companions Segundo Carig and Hilario Carig saw 
Modesto Mesias, Jr., Rodolfo Agne and two other persons on the road to 
San Felipe; that they saw them standing on the road with a girl but saw 
nothing unusual; that they continued their walk and that when they were 
about to reach their houses, they heard shouts but they were not certain
 as to who shouted.
  </p>
<p>
The accused also alleged that the testimony of the victim is replete 
with inconsistencies.  The victim testified that her right arm was held 
by Porferio Mesias while Nicolas Bilog held her left arm.  Later she 
said the reverse.  The victim also said that she was met by her elder 
sister upon arrival at their house.  On cross-examination, she said that
 she was met by her mother.  These inconsistencies are of minor details 
which do not detract from the credibility of the witness.  As properly 
observed by the Solicitor General:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Minor flaws are unavoidable at times and may be due to the lapse 
of time or to lack of sufficient education.  Discrepancies may be 
attributed to deficiencies in observation and recollection, 
misapprehension of the misleading and confusing questions during 
cross-examination to the defective translation of the questions and 
answers but they do not necessarily indicate a wilful attempt to commit 
falsehood.  (People vs. Sangalang, 58 SCRA 737).  In fact, they are 
evidence that the witness was not coached and was answering as 
spontaneously and truthfully as she could."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Also, it has been decided in a long line of cases that with respect to 
the credibility of witnesses, the Supreme Court has always accorded the 
highest decree of respect to the findings of the trial judge, unless 
there is proof of misappreciation of evidence - which is absent in the 
case at bar.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  The trial 
court said:  "The testimonies and demeanor of the witnesses of the 
prosecution in court appeared more credible than that of the defense."
</p><p>
The failure of the prosecution to present the medical certificate of the
 victim to prove loss of virginity at the time the crime of rape was 
committed is not fatal to the case at bar.  Medical examination is not 
an indispensable element in the prosecution for the crime of rape, 
because it all depends upon the evidence offered and as long as such 
evidence convinces the court, a conviction therefore is proper.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>
  At any rate, a medical examination of the victim was performed by Dr. 
Nieto M. Salvador but the same was not presented because of the 
non-availability of the doctor, although the prosecution did try to 
present the doctor even against the lower court's inclination.  Also 
virginity of the offended party is not an essential element in the crime
 of rape.  The fact that the offended party was no longer a virgin 
constitutes no defense in a charge of rape, provided that the sexual act
 was committed with force and violence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><p>
The aggravating circumstances of nighttime and uninhabited place 
however, can not be appreciated for lack of evidence to show that the 
accused especially sought or taken advantage of the night and solitude 
of the place to facilitate the commission of the crime.  It is not 
improbable that the victim was casually encountered by the accused while
 on her way home.  There is no evidence to show that the accused had 
sought the victim for any purpose whatsoever.
</p><p>
The crime of rape committed by two or more persons, under paragraph 3, 
Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Republic Act No 
4111, which took effect on June 20, 1964, is punishable by <em>reclusion perpetua</em>
 to death.  The penalty of death should be imposed upon the accused 
since the aggravating circumstance of abuse of superior strength 
attended the commission of the crime of rape with no mitigating 
circumstances to offset the same.  The evidence shows that while one of 
the accused had carnal knowledge of her, the other who held her arms and
 kept her from struggling.  The accused in conspiracy with one another 
cooperated in such a way as to secure advantage from their superiority 
of strength.  And as co-conspirators, each of the accused is guilty of 
the commission of three rapes and should each be sentenced to three 
death penalties.  However, for lack of the required number of votes, the
 death penalty cannot be imposed upon the accused.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from should be, as it is hereby, AFFIRMED.  With costs against the appellants.
SO ORDERED.
