<span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> and Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span>
started out from home as was their daily routine in an owner-type jeep on their
way to the city slaughterhouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the
vehicle left F. Cruz St. and slowed to turn towards P. Santos St., a man
suddenly emerged from the shadows on the side <span style="">of </span>the road and poked a gun at <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>
at the same time announcing that it was a hold-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Startled by the shocking event, Romeo fumbled
in his driving, causing the jeep to stall.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Two (2) men came from behind and boarded the jeep at the rear; another
man went to the side of Romeo and poked a knife at his neck, the other hand
pointing to the jeep's gas pedal and motioning him to get the engine started
again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the two (2) men at the
back seat pointed something at Romeo's back and the other likewise pointed a
weapon at his father's back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The man
with a knife sidled beside Romeo and told him just to obey his orders and nothing
bad will happen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo revived the engine
and, upon direction of the armed man beside him, drove the jeep to <st1:street><st1:address>E.
  Rodriguez St</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As if to impress that he meant business, the knife-wielding man on the
driver's side slashed Romeo's left arm and ordered him to drive the jeep to <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Vitales</span> Street</st1:street>, <st1:city><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:city></st1:address> City.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On their demand, <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>

in a bag to the man seated beside him in the front seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even offered to give up the jeep but
pleaded for their lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the jeep
moved towards <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Vitales</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
the four (4) malefactors attacked in concord with their weapons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the men at the bad seat stabbed his
father on the neck and he fell forward towards the dashboard of the
vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other man at the back seat
stabbed Romeo on the neck, while the one seated beside him to his left likewise
gave him a knife thrust.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he heard a
gun shot which was so close that he knew his father had been shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He struggled to raise himself to check and he
saw the robbers running away towards the direction of <st1:street><st1:address>Rodriguez

carried his father along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Vitales</span>

spotted a <span class="SpellE">pedicab</span> which he hailed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He placed his father in the <span class="SpellE">pedicab</span> and asked to be driven to the <span class="SpellE">Philtranco</span>
bus terminal where he knew taxicabs parked while waiting for passengers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He lifted his father and then shouted for
help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Someone came to his assistance and
boarded them inside a taxi and brought them to the San Juan de <span class="SpellE">Dios</span> Hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
wounded men were wheeled into the emergency room and separately operated
on.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">six o'clock</st1:time> in the morning, <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>

the different parts of his body from the neck to the forearm (Exhibits
"K" and "K?1").<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After a thorough clinical examination, the doctor, suspecting that there
was blood in the peritoneal cavity, decided to operate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The surgical operation disclosed that the
diaphragm and the liver had been injured causing the accumulation of blood in
the peritoneal cavity (Exhibit L).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
timely surgical <span style="">intervention </span>and
medical treatment had saved Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span>' life.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor declared that the injuries
sustained by Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> could have been inflicted
by a sharpÂ­-edged, sharp pointed knife with the probability that more than one
weapon of similar nature had been used and by more than one assailant.</blockquote>

shooting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The younger patient who
identified himself as Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> declared that four

slaughterhouse, divested them of their money and thereafter attacked them with
knives and a gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the sketchy
interview, the two police investigators left the hospital, returned to their
office to enter the incident in their log book, and reported the matter to the
officer on duty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cpl. Ricardo Santos

bystanders.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They found a butcher's knife

the scene.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Cpl. R.
Santos, after directing Pat.</span> Joseph <span class="SpellE">Hiyas</span> to
find a way to have the jeep driven to the police headquarters, interviewed some
people and tried to look for possible witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>From bits of information gathered, the police

Romeo <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span> to the hospital for confrontation with
the surviving victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Eddie Rivera,
Romeo <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo's</span> employer, volunteered to come along

evening of <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1988</st1:date>,
the police investigators brought Romeo <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span>

</span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Serafica</span> replied that he accompanied the
widow of <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> and
her son Romeo, who were his neighbors in <span class="SpellE">Malibay</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:place></st1:city>, on the information received

wounding of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> had been arrested for theft

identified as <span class="SpellE">Venerando</span> <span class="SpellE">Nebreja</span>
be taken out of his detention cell and brought to the Investigation Division

Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> broke into tears and shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'Ito ho! <span class="GramE">Ito ho!'</span>
(This is the one! This is the one!) Pat. <span class="SpellE">Borcelis</span>
asked Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> what he meant and the latter said
that the suspect in the theft case who was brought in was one of the four (4)
men who held them up, stabbed him and killed his father.</blockquote>

when police investigators arrived looking for Eddie Rivera.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His presence in the house of Eddie Rivera
made the lawmen suspicious and consequently grilled him intensely.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three (3) police officers then drove him
to his employer's residence where they obtained <span class="SpellE">Eliong</span>
Rivera's permission to bring him to the police station for further
questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was made to board an
automobile which was driven around <span class="SpellE">Malibay</span> and up to <span class="SpellE">Epifanio</span> de <span class="SpellE">los</span> <st1:address><st1:street>Santos

and returned with a man in tow whom they ordered to sit also in the back
seat.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two (2) pick ups were brought
to the office of the Theft and Robbery Section and investigated on their
suspected participation in the hold-up-slaying of <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> and the wounding of Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the office of the investigators was a
third man also being <span class="GramE">interrogated.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the questioning, the three (3) suspects
were locked up in a safety cell until late in the evening when they were taken
out and brought to a hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
made to enter a room one after another and as directed by their captors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When his time came to enter, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span> noticed a patient who was sitting up on an
elevated bed before whom he was made to walk slowly and turn around.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Finally he was asked to face the man who
looked him up and down but did not say a word.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He and his two (2) companions in the safety cell of the Theft and
Robbery Section of the police headquarters were then released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He immediately returned to the house of <span class="SpellE">Eliong</span> Rivera, his employer, and explained why it took him
a long time to come back.</blockquote>

spot along <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Boulevard</st1:address></st1:street>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was a little past dawn and the place was
deserted. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The three (3) police officers
told him to point to Eddie Rivera as the mastermind, otherwise his life has
been paid for, a remark he understood to mean he will be 'salvaged', when he
refused because he and his employer had nothing to do with the crime, the
policemen prodded him down as trying to escape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He did not budge and dared the lawmen to shoot him inside the police
car.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One of the policemen pointed a gun
at his temple and squeezed the trigger but it did not fire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was brought back to the Theft and Robbery
Section and, inside its toilet, was handcuffed behind his back, mauled,
subjected to water torture and struck all over the body, particularly the
region of the thighs, with a piece of rattan pole called '<span class="SpellE">balila</span>'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They wanted him to confess participation in

<p class="BODY">In<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the first assigned
error, the appellant questions the credibility of the identification made by
the prosecution's sole eyewitness, Romeo <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span>,
pointing to him as one of the malefactors.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant contends that such identification is not believable
because of the following circumstances:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, Romeo (name used in the text of this case for the victim) never
described the perpetrators to the policemen who interviewed him when he <span class="GramE">was in</span> the hospital nor did he furnish such information to
the doctors who treated him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
non-disclosure is not natural for <span style="">someone
</span>who is on the brink of death as it is expected that one would want to
have the perpetrators brought to justice, if that would be the last thing that
he would do.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, even after his confinement
at the hospital, he still did not go to the police authorities to describe his
assailants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only on <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1988</st1:date>, 19 days after the
occurrence of the incident that he executed his affidavit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third, as Romeo was in a shocked and startled
state, his faculties of observation were not as keen as that of one in a normal
state.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fourth, there was no description
of the scene of the crime, whether or not there was sufficient light to make a
proper identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the
inconsistencies in Romeo's testimony make such testimony doubtful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo testified that it was accused <span class="SpellE">Nebreja</span> who was the person seated beside his father (TSN,
May 26, 1988, p. 13) despite his earlier claims that it was the appellant <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span> who was beside his father (TSN, May 26, 1988, p.
8-9).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, he stated that it was <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span> who stabbed his father (TSN, May 26, 1988, pp.
8-9) but later stated that it was <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span> who shot
his father.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 26, 1988, pp.
13-14) These inconsistencies weaken the sole eyewitness' testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">The abovementioned circumstances which the appellant believes
cast doubts on the credibility of the testimony of the prosecution's sole
eyewitness can all be satisfactorily explained.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inability of Romeo to furnish the description of his malefactors
at the hospital either to the police investigators or to his doctors can be
attributed to the fact the he suffered five stab wounds in various parts of his
body, one of which was life threatening which required him to undergo a
much-needed operation (TSN, December 20, 1988, pp. 6-10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, he was in shock after seeing his father
being stabbed and shot.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aside from
these, he had to muster all the strength he had left to be able to bring his
father and himself to the hospital.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Despite the wounds that he sustained, he still carried his father for a
distance of 8 to 10 meters before he got some help.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, June 2, 1988, pp.
4-5).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first and foremost
thing that was important was for him and his father to survive.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the delay in reporting to the police authorities,
this is sufficiently justified by the fact that Romeo was still
recuperating.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The doctor who attended to
him testified that it would take more than 30 days for Romeo's wounds to heal (TSN,
December 20, 1988, p. 10).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Despite the
fact that he was only confined for five days, he was still being treated
continuously after that five day period.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, December 20, 1988, p. 10) Moreover, the death of his father
created a void that had to be filled.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Romeo was one of the only three children that the deceased left.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, July 7, 1988, p. 4).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was also a big help to the father's
business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 20, 1988, pp. 4-5)
The delay is also consistent with normal behavior considering that after a
tragic incident, the last thing that the bereaved would want to happen is to
provoke further reprisals from the perpetrators of the felonious act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is a natural tendency to seek
the ends of justice for the treacherous killing of a dearly departed, mourning
and rites for the dead take priority as dictated by our culture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People <span style="">V. </span><span class="SpellE">Sabellano</span>,
G.R. Nos. 93932-33, June 5, 1991).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As to the third circumstance, although Romeo appeared to be
shocked at the sudden appearance of a person with a gun thereby causing the
engine of the jeep he was driving to stall, (TSN, May 20, 1988, p. 9) he
immediately recovered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He started the
engine of the jeep as per instruction of one of the hold-uppers and proceeded
to drive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was not in a <span class="GramE">shocked</span> or startled state as the appellant would like us to
believe.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He had control of his senses as
he was even driving and was pleading with the hold-uppers to spare their
lives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 26, 1988, p. 6)</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fourth circumstance, whether there was sufficient light
to make <span class="GramE">an identification</span> is a proper subject of
cross-examination.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should, however,
be presumed that Romeo was driving the jeep with its lights on under the
ordinary course of events.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Rule 131,
Sec. 5 (z), Rules of Court) Also, public highways like the one wherein the
crime was committed are usually lighted by street lights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the appellant was only at most a few
feet away from Romeo as they were all inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the appellant was not a complete
stranger to him as he has seen him several times previous to the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 26, 1988, p. 10; TSN, June 2, 1988,
p. 6)</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the inconsistencies in Romeo's testimony, we agree with the
trial court that these are minor inconsistencies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exact position of the appellant inside
the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> is a minor matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is important is that the appellant was
identified as among the malefactors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
inconsistency as to who stabbed or shot Romeo's father is also of no moment as
conspiracy has been established in the case at bar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The actuations of the accused immediately
prior to, during, and right after the hold-up indicate their common intention
to commit the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant as
co-conspirator then, i<span style="">s </span>guilty <span style="">on </span>the principle that the act of one
is the act of all (People v. Arenas, G.R. No. 92060, June 5, 1991; People v. <span class="SpellE">Umbrero</span>, G.R. No. 93021, May 8, 1991)</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant further argues that the identification made by
Romeo of <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span> at the <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City Police Department when he shouted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Siya</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span>, <span class="SpellE">siya</span>
<span class="SpellE">po</span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">sumaksak</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">tatay</span> <span class="SpellE">ko</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 6,
1988, pp.34-35) was only narrated by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Borcelis</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, his
testimony is inadmissible as it is considered hearsay.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the defense failed to object to the hearsay evidence presented
his right of confrontation and cross-examination is deemed waived.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence <span class="GramE">then,</span>
is admissible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(See <span class="SpellE">Allarde</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span>, 57 Phil. 909, 922 [1933]) But <span style="">admissibility </span>of evidence should not
be equated with weight of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hearsay evidence, whether objected to or not, has no probative
value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. Valero, 112 SCRA 661,
675 [1982]) But even without Pat. <span class="SpellE">Borcelis</span>'
testimony, the appellant was positively identified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Romeo in open <span class="GramE">court,</span>
identified the appellant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 26,
1988, pp. 8-9) As said earlier, Romeo was certain that the appellant was one of
the malefactors as he saw the appellant before the appellant boarded the jeep
(TSN, May 20, 1988, p. 9; TSN, June 28, 1988, p. 8) and he recognized the
appellant as he has seen the appellant previous to the incident.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May 26, 1988, p. 10; TSN, June 2, 1988,
p. 6)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the appellant questions the manner in which he was
presented for identification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">He </span>believes that the police may have
already conditioned the mind of Romeo <span style="">that
</span>he was one of the culprits.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no showing that the identification could have been
suggested to the witness by the police.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, Romeo upon seeing <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span>
immediately broke into tears.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN, May
6, 1988, pp. 34-35) The appellant himself did not mention any circumstances
that the police had, indeed, prodded Romeo to identify him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had there been any prodding, the appellant
would have admitted to the identification and said that such identification was
made with the help of the police but instead he even denied that such an
identification was made as he said that Romeo said nothing upon seeing him and
Romeo never pointed to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(TSN,
February 7, 1989, p. 31)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even if the appellant was not presented in a police line-up (TSN,
February 7, 1989 p. 31) there could still be proper identification as long as
such identification was not suggested to the witness by the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Salguero</span>,
G.R. No. 89117, June 19, 1991)</p>

<p class="BODY">Romeo's identification of the appellant is also bolstered by his
absence of improper motive to falsely testify against the appellant (People v. <st1:city><st1:place>Santiago</st1:place></st1:city>,
G.R. No. L-46132, May 28, 1991)</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the positive identification made by Romeo of the
appellant, his contention in the fifth assigned error that the trial court
erred in not sustaining his defense of alibi and denial is without merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a well-settled rule that alibi cannot
prevail over positive identification.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Toribio</span>, G.R. No. 88098, June 26,
1991; People v. Castillo, 120 SCRA 381, 388 [1983])</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the additional argument of the appellant that if he
were really one of the assailants, he would have then already fled instead of
continuing to report for work, this must also fail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the appellant continued to
report for work is not conclusive evidence of absence of guilt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>, 179 SCRA 612, 617 [1989]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Luardo</span>, 167 SCRA 685; 703 [1988]).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant's release after his <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="3">March <span style="">22,
 </span>1988</st1:date> pick-up might have emboldened him to stay on.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant also questions his <st1:date year="1988" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1988</st1:date> <span style="">and </span><st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1988</st1:date> arrests in the
assigned error.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He states that <span style="">his </span>arrest is illegal so the effect and
consequence of such arrests are inadmissible.</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the effect and consequence of the appellant's
arrest are inadmissible need not be discussed in detail as the trial court based
its finding of guilt beyond reasonable doubt on the positive identification
made by Romeo not on the evidence gathered as a result <span style="">of </span>the appellant's arrest.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The police state that <span class="SpellE">Guiraldo</span> agreed to come
with the policemen for questioning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant now states that he was forced, hence illegally arrested.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the very arguments of the appellant, it
appears that the investigations had not yet focused on him as the probable
culprit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If not, the invitation was part
of a general inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
engages in self?contradictions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such is also the case with regard to the first part of the third
assigned error contesting the trial court's admission of the verbal confession
made by the appellant during the custodial investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This need not be delved into as the
conviction of the appellant was based on the positive identification made by
Romeo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court did not even
consider the verbal confession made by the appellant in its findings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The second part of this assigned error which
involves Pat. <span class="SpellE">Borcelis</span>' testimony has already been
discussed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the fourth assigned error, the appellant believes that because
the trial court applied the continuous trial system too strictly, he was
deprived of his right to be heard and to be assisted by counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He states that he could no longer present
additional witnesses from whom he had secured affidavits (Records, pp. 16-18)
corroborating his defense of alibi because the lower court considered the case
submitted for decision in its order of April 20, 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court's order to consider the case submitted for
decision is not without reason.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
order specifically states:</p>

<blockquote>"It is already <st1:time minute="35" hour="10">10:35</st1:time>

control the trial to avoid delay." The appellant has not shown any
