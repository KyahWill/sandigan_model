pointing out that she had no reason for implicating Ricardo if he was not
really her assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It observed that
the accused-appellant would have taken only 30 minutes by jeep ride to reach <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City from <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> and that
in any event the corroboration of his relatives and friends was not
reliable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the certification
of the parish registrar did not necessarily prove that <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span>
was present at his daughter's baptism as he was not a signatory of the
baptismal certificate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judge added:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Moreover, the accused could have easily exculpated himself and
narrated the facts of which he is now swearing for the Court to believe had he

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court disagrees with
the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find that the
accused-appellant's guilt has not been clearly established to overcome the
constitutional </span>presumption <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of
innocence in his favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Contrary to the findings
of the trial judge, the evidence for the prosecution is slipshod and hardly
credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact that the

<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">should it excuse the <span class="SpellE">implausibilities</span> of her testimony.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ask why, as there was nothing to wait for.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When, according to her, Ricardo sat beside her and touched her breast, she
did not get angry or resist - all she did was ask <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span>
to change places with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The natural

not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Improbably, she stayed behind even
when <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span> herself went out, leaving her alone with
Ricardo.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As for the alleged rape itself, it has not been clearly
established that she was forced to submit to Ricardo's will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She says she had recovered consciousness when
she was raped but admitted that Ricardo had no weapon to threaten her with, nor
did she present any torn clothes to show she had been forcibly undressed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, there was no evidence at all of the
rape itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No physician or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">medical report was presented to prove
Cristina's violation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span> said was that her daughter had a miscarriage but
that did not mean she had been raped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No less significantly, Cristina reported the alleged rape only in
April 1976, almost three months after her supposed violation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1976</st1:date>, and only after her miscarriage was

after the alleged incident, the complainant did not immediately go home to
report to her parents but continued staying with her friend <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span>
until February, when she returned to her family.</p>

<p class="BODY">Cristina claims she was afraid, but there is no showing that she
had been threatened, either during the actual rape or thereafter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She herself testified as follows:</p>

13.0pt">for help to save her friend?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And
why was she not presented at the trial as an important material witness?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As we observed in People v. <span class="SpellE">Tempongko</span></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>One also wonders why <span class="SpellE">Rosalita</span> <span class="SpellE">Quinto</span>, the complainant's companion on the night of the
alleged rape, and who was supposed to be in the room when the complainant
claimed she <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>ravished, was
not presented <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>a witness by
the prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not often that
the prosecution has the good fortune of <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">an
</span>actual eyewitness in cases like this, and yet neither the fiscal nor the
private prosecutor saw fit <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to ask <span class="SpellE">Rosalita</span> to corroborate the testimony of Lolita.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, they presented only the parents of
Lolita who testified on what happened after, and not before and during, the
alleged rape.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The trial court belittles
the accused-appellant's alibi because it is corroborated only by his relatives
and friends but this should not make the defense <u>per</u> <u>se</u>
invalid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One can accept that when there
is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">baptismal followed by a small party, only
relatives and close friends will be in attendance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And it is also not believable, </span>contrary
to the suggestion in the decision, that <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span>, who
was already in <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span>, would ride back to <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City to commit the rape, and on the very morning
of his <span class="SpellE">daugther's</span> baptism to boot, especially in the
face of the contrary testimony that he never left his sister's house until
10:30 a.m. to bring the child to church.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The defense also submits that Ricardo has straight and not curly hair
and is not "<span class="SpellE">pangit</span>" (although there is no
claim that he is handsome).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for <span class="SpellE">Gorgonio</span> <span class="SpellE">Hizon's</span> charge that <span class="SpellE">Julieta</span> <span class="SpellE">Cabañero</span> had offered to
settle the case for a fee, this was never rebutted and so was impliedly
accepted by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In this jurisdiction, the
accused is presumed innocent until the contrary is proved, and this by the
strongest evidence removing all doubt about his guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That evidence has not been established by the
prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no medical proof
of the rape itself, nor was it shown that the complainant had been forced or
threatened to submit to her alleged attacker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court relied </span>only on the complainant's identification
of the accused-appellant, disregarding the important fact that her friend, who
she said had witnessed the rape, did not testify to support her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As for Ricardo's failure to deny the charge
against him when he was investigated by the police, the judge erred in holding
this as evidence of guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused-appellant had the right to remain silent during his custodial
investigation if he preferred to make his denials at another time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And such silence should not have been taken
against him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The Court finds that it
is the complainant's conduct that is questionable or at least difficult to
understand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1976" day="7" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January
 7, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, she left
her house to live with her friend <span class="SpellE">Marilou</span>
Castillo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although she claims she was
raped </span>on <st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="1"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">January 25, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, she did not immediately report the incident
to her parents but continued staying with her friend as if nothing had
happened.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She decided to return home
only in February, but even then she said nothing </span>about <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the supposed rape until three months later,
after she suffered the miscarriage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
claims she was afraid of Ricardo but admitted he had not threatened her with
any </span>weapon nor could she explain her fear of him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On top of all this, her detailed description
of her alleged rapist was hardly credible nor was it clearly applicable to the
accused-appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering all the above circumstances, we find that the accused-appellant's
conviction cannot be sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If,
indeed, Roberto <span class="SpellE">Hizon</span> raped Cristina <span class="SpellE">Cabañero</span>, he nevertheless must be absolved because his
guilt has not been proved beyond the shadow of a doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even if it be argued that the defense is
weak, the fact is that the prosecution is even weaker and so must fail by its
own impotence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is REVERSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant is ACQUITTED and
ordered immediately RELEASED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
