<p>In this petition for <em><em>certiorari</em></em>, Egyptair and Sayed Ezzat 
assail the affirmance by the National Labor Relations Commission of the labor 
arbiter's decision granting monetary awards to John Joseph for his illegal 
dismissal as Egyptair's marketing adviser.<br><br>The records show that on June 
1, 1962, John Joseph was employed as sales promotion and press relations officer 
by the United Arab Airlines [UAA] which later became known as Egyptair.&nbsp; 
Thereafter, he was appointed by said company as acting sales manager.&nbsp; While 
holding said position from July, 1963 until December, 1967, Joseph concurrently 
acted as sales manager of Atlantic Pacific Corporation [ATPACO], the general 
sales agent of UAA.<br><br>Joseph's appointment as sales manager in the 
Philippines effective December 15, 1967, was confirmed by the general commercial 
manager of UAA, Mohamed S. El. Hakim.&nbsp; In addition to a monthly salary of 
P1,750, Joseph was also given a commission corresponding to two percent [2%] of 
the "net revenue realized from sales wholly on UAA services [direct or 
interline], provided that the amount of sectors commissionable exceeded US 
$50.00".<br><br>On April 15, 1969, the district manager in the Philippines of 
Egyptair, Mr. Gamal El-Desouki, informed Joseph that effective April 1, 1969, 
his gross salary had been increased to P2,000 a month.&nbsp; Said district manager 
also informed Joseph of the amendment of his 2% commission, as follows:&nbsp; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> sales on UAA routes, up to the amount of 
$500,000:&nbsp; one-half percent [1/2%] of the net amount excluding sectors amount of 
which is less than $50, and <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> sales on 
UAA routes over the amount of $500,000:&nbsp; one percent [1%] of the net amount.&nbsp; 
The records do not show whether the head office of UAA had approved said 
amendment.<br><br>On January 22, 1974, Joseph was appointed marketing adviser to 
Sayed Ezzat, Egyptair's manager in the Philippines.&nbsp; Four months later, he 
received a letter from Ezzat reading:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Since January 22, 1974 up to May 6, 1974 you have not reported to work 
in the office whereby we have no records to show that you are on an approved 
sick or vacation leave.<br><br>Due to your above-mentioned continued unexcused 
absences, I wish to inform you that you are resigned from the company effective 
May 6, 1974.</em>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></p></blockquote>
<p>Two days after he received that letter or on May 22, 1974, Joseph filed with 
the National Labor Relations Commission [NLRC] a complaint against Egyptair 
and/or Sayed Ezzat for illegal dismissal, non-payment of wages, sick and 
vacation leave benefits, and commissions.<br><br>After the case was submitted 
for compulsory arbitration, the labor arbiter issued a monetary award in favor 
of Joseph consisting of his claims for unpaid wages, sick and vacation leave 
benefits, commissions and separation pay.&nbsp; Alleging that the award was rendered 
without giving them a chance to present their evidence, respondents therein 
filed a motion for reconsideration.&nbsp; In due course, the NLRC set aside the award 
and remanded the case to the labor arbiter for final disposition.<br><br>The 
case was practically tried <em>de novo</em> and on August 22, 1977, the labor 
arbiter rendered a decision declaring that Joseph was not a managerial employee 
of Egyptair, and that it was Egyptair which considered Joseph resigned from the 
service, thus constructively dismissing him from the service without just 
cause.&nbsp; The dispositive portion of that decision states: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"<em>WHEREFORE, premises considered, an award is hereby rendered in favor of 
the complainant and against respondent ordering respondent to pay unto the 
complainant the sum of P280,521.00 token down, as follows:<br><br>[1] As 
backwages due to illegal dismissal, from the date of alleged termination, May 
20, 1974 until July 20, 1977 at P2,815.00 a month or a total of 
P106,970.00;<br><br>[2] As unpaid salary from May 1 - 20, 1974, in the amount 
P1,976.00;<br><br>[3] As cash commutation of the balance of earned vacation 
leave privileges, computed at fifteen [15] days for every year of service, as 
follows:&nbsp; P1,407.50 x 10 yrs. or a total of P14,075.00;<br><br>[4] Unpaid 2% 
commission for the period covered by January 1971 to January, 1974, computed on 
the basis of net revenue on sales in the amount of US $600.00 per month or 
P4,500.00 per month for thirty-five [35] months or a total of 
P157,560.00.<br><br>Respondent is hereby enjoined to pay the above-mentioned 
sums or a total of P280,521.00 within ten [10] days from receipt of this 
Decision.<br><br>Counsel for complainant are hereby entitled to 10% as 
attorney’s fees of the total claims of the complainant.</em>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </p></blockquote>
<p>Egyptair and Sayed Ezzat appealed to the NLRC. On January 13, 1983, the NLRC 
<em>en banc</em> affirmed the labor arbiter's decision with the modification 
that only the fifteen days vacation and fifteen days sick leave credits for 1974 
should be commuted.&nbsp; Hence, the instant petition for <em>certiorari</em>, 
petitioners submitting to this Court the issues of the legality of the dismissal 
of John Joseph,[3] and the legality of the monetary awards granted to the 
latter.<br><br>Petitioners contend that since they "improved" Joseph's position 
from sales manager to marketing adviser, Joseph was holding a managerial 
position so that, his dismissal without a clearance from the Ministry of Labor 
was legal.&nbsp; They add that the employer-employee relationship between them and 
Joseph was converted into a "consultancy" or a principal-agent relationship when 
Joseph accepted the position of marketing adviser.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The issue regarding the 
relationship between petitioners and private respondent is one involving a 
question of fact as it requires the presentation of evidence.&nbsp; Both the labor 
arbiter and the NLRC, before whom the issue was thoroughly ventilated found 
private respondent to be a non-managerial employee of petitioner Egyptair.&nbsp; 
Except where there is a grave abuse of discretion, which does not obtain in the 
case at bar, the findings of facts of the labor arbiter and the commission are 
binding upon this Court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>Similarly, we are bound by the 
findings of both the labor arbiter and the NLRC that Joseph did not abandon his 
job from January 23, 1974 until May 6, 1974.&nbsp; The NLRC found that as marketing 
adviser, Joseph had to work outside his office in order to solicit passengers 
and cargoes for the petitioners' from the different airline agents and 
shippers.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>Besides, petitioners' 
allegation that Joseph abandoned his job is belied by the fact that two days 
after receiving Sayed Ezzat's letter terminating his services, he filed a 
complaint for illegal dismissal.&nbsp; It would be illogical for him to have left his 
job and later on, file said complaint.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
Furthermore, petitioner airline's own actuation proves that at least from 
January, 1974 to April, 1974, it still considered Joseph as an employee because 
it paid him his salary for said months.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>Other than the alleged abandonment 
of work, petitioners failed to present convincing reasons for their precipitate 
dismissal of Joseph.&nbsp; As the burden of proof rests on the employer to show that 
the dismissal was for a just cause, petitioners' failure to do so necessarily 
meant that said dismissal was not justified.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup><br><br>Another factor which made Joseph's 
dismissal illegal is that it was effected without prior clearance from the 
Ministry of Labor.&nbsp; The importance of said prior clearance cannot be 
overemphasized because without it, a dismissal is also conclusively presumed to 
be without just cause.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The 
other matters presented by petitioners before this Court, like the actual date 
of employment of Joseph, his claim for the unpaid 2% commission on sales from 
January, 1971 to January, 1974, and his claim for the cash equivalent of his 
earned vacation and sick leave benefits for 1974, deserve scant consideration.&nbsp; 
They have been passed upon by the respondent commission and, in the absence of 
sufficient proof that the NLRC gravely abused its discretion, We see no reason 
to disturb its findings and conclusions.<br><br>But there is one more contention 
which, although unmeritorious, deserves consideration — petitioners' allegation 
that Joseph's claim for commissions has prescribed.&nbsp; They assert that the unpaid 
2% commissions for January, 1971 to January, 1974 have prescribed because the 
claims "should have been filed within one <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> year from the date it accrued, that is, 
from year to year".<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> The basis of 
petitioners' argument is the second paragraph of Article 292 of the Labor Code 
which provides that: 
</p><blockquote>
<p>"<em>All money claims accruing prior to the effectivity of this Code shall be 
filed with the appropriate entities established under this Code within one <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> year from the date of effectivity, and 
shall be processed or determined in accordance with implementing rules and 
regulations of the Code; otherwise, they shall be forever barred.</em>" 
</p></blockquote>
<p>It should be noted that the one-year prescriptive period is counted from the 
<em>date of effectivity</em> of the Labor Code. As Article 2 provides that the 
Labor Code "shall take effect six <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
months after its promulgation" on May 1, 1974, petitioners cannot validly insist 
that Joseph's monetary claims have prescribed, for they were filed on May 2, 
1974, even <em>before</em> the effectivity of the Labor Code on November 1, 
1974.<br><br>Petitioners' averment that the 1971 commissions should have been 
claimed within one year or in 1972 militates against the interest of the 
employee.&nbsp; If adopted, said interpretation of Article 292, paragraph 2, would 
run roughshod against Article 4 of the Labor Code which states that all doubts 
in the implementation and interpretation of the provisions of the Code should be 
resolved in favor of Labor.&nbsp; Moreover, it would be contrary to the very intent 
of Article 292 to allow the filing of money claims which had accrued prior to 
the effectivity of the Labor Code within a year from said 
date.<br><br><strong>WHEREFORE</strong>, the decision of the National Labor 
Relations Commission is hereby affirmed. Costs against the 
petitioners.<br><br><strong>SO ORDERED</strong>.
