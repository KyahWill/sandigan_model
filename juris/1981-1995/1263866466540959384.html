the following properties of the private respondents to satisfy a judgment for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> in favor of the workers (herein petitioners) in
NLRC Case No. RAB-VII-7-128:</p>

<p class="BODY">(1) <span class="GramE">a</span> 47,422-sqm. <span class="GramE">parcel</span>

<p class="BODY">Alleging that the sale was irregular as it included properties
not specified in the notice of auction sale, Vicente Sandoval and Sandoval
Shipyard Inc. filed in the Regional Trial Court, Branch 22, in <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span> City, an action against Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Tolo</span>
and the workers/judgment creditors (<span class="SpellE">Medado</span>, et al.)
to annul the auction sale (Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">CEB-6141).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They asked the court to issue a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction to return the possession of the shipyard
properties to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants workers, on the other hand, filed a motion to
dismiss the complaint on the ground that it was merely an offshoot of a labor
case in the National Labor Relations Commission (hereafter NLRC), hence, the
NLRC, not the RTC, has jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
court denied the motion to dismiss in its order date <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1987</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1988</st1:date>,
Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Tolo</span> asked for a hearing on his affirmative
defense of lack of jurisdiction, and prayed for the dismissal of the
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was directed by the court
to formalize his motion to dismiss and to amplify it with a memorandum of authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the final deed of sale which <span class="SpellE">Tolo</span>
executed in favor of the dismissed workers, the latter, on <st1:date year="1988" day="8" month="4">April 8, 1988</st1:date>, forcibly entered and seized the
Sandoval Shipyard premises and ousted more than 170 employees and their
families.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1988" day="11" month="4">April 11, 1988</st1:date>, Sandoval applied to the trial
court for a writ of preliminary mandatory injunction to restore him or Sandoval
Shipyard, Inc. in the possession of the shipyard premises pending determination
of the legality of the sheriff's sale thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The sheriff's motion to dismiss and the plaintiff's petition for
injunction were jointly heard by the court on <st1:date year="1988" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1988</st1:date> (p. 27, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1988</st1:date>,
the trial court, through RTC Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Vailoces</span>, dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sandoval filed a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in this Court
(G.R. No. 83182).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We referred it to the
Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. SP No. 14780) for proper determination and
adjudication.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="17" month="8">August 17, 1988</st1:date>,
the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's order of dismissal and ordered
it to "proceed with the trial of aforesaid case (Civil Case No. CEB-6141),
and upon the filing of the proper bond by petitioners, a writ of preliminary
mandatory injunction be issued to restore possession of the properties subject
of this petition to the petitioners [Sandoval, et al.]" <span class="GramE">(p.
31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals rationalized that in seeking to nullify the
auction sale, and to have the certificate of sale declared null and void, the
petitioners "are clearly asserting their title to the real property in
question" and "asking for the quieting of their title" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">(p. </span>29, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>),
hence, the complaint falls within the exclusive original jurisdiction of the
Regional Trial Court as provided in Section 9, subparagraph 2, B.P. <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It found
the seizure of the shipyard complex by the respondents to be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">"a </span>taking of the law into their
own hands," and "a material and substantial invasion not only of the
very substantial rights of the petitioners, but also of those of the 170
employees" (p. 30, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals issued a mandatory
injunction to "prevent further serious damage to petitioners x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>, extend much needed relief
and alleviate the worsening conditions of the 170 employees who were wrongfully
excluded from their work" (p. 31, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">In due time the respondents-workers appealed by <i>certiorari</i>
to this court praying that we annul the judgment of the Court of Appeals and
confirm Judge <span class="SpellE">Vailoces</span>’ order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition for review is meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals’ ruling on the
jurisdictional issue is erroneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sandoval's
action to annul the execution sale was, for all intents and purposes, a motion
to quash the writ of execution in NLRC Case No. <span class="GramE">RAB-VII-7-128.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We ruled in <u>Abbott</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>NLRC</u>,
145 SCRA <span class="GramE">207, that</span> "the NLRC has the authority to
look into the correctness of the execution of its decision." Pursuant to
Article 244(b) of the Labor Code, we further ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u>Pucan</u></span>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vs.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><u>Hon.</u> <u>Eduardo</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Bengzon</u></span>, 155 SCRA 692, that "any irregularities
in the issuance of the alias writ of execution should be referred to the same
administrative official or tribunal which rendered the decision being executed,
for, despite the finality of the decision, the Minister (now Secretary) of
Labor retains control over its execution and implementation so that resort to
regular courts would be an untenable recourse." Therefore, the trial
court, through Judge <span class="SpellE">Vailoces</span>, properly dismissed
Sandoval's complaint in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">CEB-6141.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals correctly annulled the
sheriff's sale and ordered the return of the shipyard properties to Sandoval
for the second alias writ of execution, which was issued by the Labor Arbiter,
was excessive, hence, null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Conformably with our decisions in Mercury Drug Co. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">vs. </span>Court of Industrial Relations
(April 30, 1974), 56 SCRA 694, and in <span class="SpellE">Feati</span>
University Faculty Club vs. <span class="SpellE">Feati</span> University (August
15, 1974), 58 SCRA 395, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">workers are
entitled </span>to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> for a period only of not
more than three (3) years from the date of their unlawful dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The original decision awarded them <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> amounting to P98<span class="GramE">,778</span> for
a period of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">two </span>years and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">seven </span>months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">However,
in the second alias writ of execution issued by Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Tumamak</span> on November 10,
1986, the award had blown up to P 614,510, spanning a period of 13 years!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

under it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
