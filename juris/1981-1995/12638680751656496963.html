<p class="BODY">The facts, according to the People's Brief, are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The victim, Angel Gonzales, and appellant were business
partners in the buying and selling of tricycles (TSN, Aug. 24, 1989, p. 7). <span style="">&nbsp;</span>On <st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1987">November
 5, 1987</st1:date>, at <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the after­noon, Angel was at his house in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Cruz, <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, fixing the tricycle of his parents when appellant
arrived thereat to invite him to go to the house of a certain Andres <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span> (Ibid., <span style="">p. </span>5).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They left Angel's house using Angel's
tricycle with appellant on the driver's seat (TSN, Sept. 13, 1989, p. 4).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angel and appellant arrived at <span class="SpellE">Velarde's</span> house about <st1:time hour="18" minute="30">6:30
 o'clock</st1:time> in the evening (Ibid., p. 3).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The partners asked <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span>
to buy two (2) bottles of <span class="SpellE">Ginebra</span> San Miguel to toast
the sale of a sidecar they had earlier negotiated (Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the three (3) men were thus drinking,
an argument ensued between Angel and appellant (Ibid., p. 6).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Appelant</span> was trying
to collect P400.00 from Angel as his commission in the sale of the sidecar, but
Angel would only give him P200.00 (Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Angel said that appellant was entitled to no more than P200.00 as
commission, appellant got angry and stood up (Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He then took out the gun tucked inside the
waist of his pants and threatened to fire the same (Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was pacified only when told that the <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> captain who was a neighbor of <span class="SpellE">Valarde</span>
might arrest him (Ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The trio continued drinking until Angel became so drunk that he
becomes [sic] sleepy <span style="">(Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>It was then that appellant insisted on
bringing Angel home (Ibid.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Angel and
appellant left the <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span> house around <st1:time hour="19" minute="30">7:30 o'clock p.m.</st1:time> (Ibid., p. 8).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two (2) boarded Angel's tricycle with the
appellant again taking the driver's seat and Angel reclining on the passenger's
seat (Ibid., p. 7).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the two reached
<span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Sinampalukan</span>,
appellant stopped the tricycle and hit Angel with a blunt instrument several
times on the head (Ibid., p. 20).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
result, Angel died of '<span class="SpellE">hemmorrhage</span> and intra-cranial
injuries to the brain' (Exhibit 'A-1').<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant admits that he and the deceased <span style="">were </span><span style="">business partners in the buy and sell of motorcycles </span>for almost
a year; that they had a drinking session on 5 November 1987 from 12:00 to 5:00
o'clock in the afternoon, first in <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span>
Commercial<span style="">, <span class="SpellE">Bongabong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, and </span>later,
in the <span style="">house of Andy <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span> at <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> <span class="SpellE">Santor</span> for more or </span>less <span style="">another hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He further admits
that after their drinking spree, he and the victim headed for home by boarding
the latter's tricycle which he drove.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He, however, denies killing Angel Gonzales and submits the following
version of the incident:</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
(W)hen the tricycle was between <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Curva</span> and <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. Cruz, three (3)
persons blocked its way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were <span class="SpellE">carryng</span> long firearms and wanted to be taken to <span class="SpellE">Sapang</span> <span class="SpellE">Tuyo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabaso</span> told them that it was already dark and that the
tricycle belongs to Angel Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
heated argument ensued between Angel Gonzales and the three (3) persons when he
refused what they wanted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then one of
them hit <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabaso</span> in
his stomach with the muzzle of a rifle.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He lost consciousness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Zosimo</span> <span class="SpellE">Alabaso</span> regained
consciousness later on, he saw Angel Gonzales slumped on the ground in front of
the tricycle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three (3) persons were
already far away when he saw them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
then boarded Angel Gonzales, who was heard to be moaning, into the tricycle and
drove the same to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>District</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>

already dead."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court has consistently ruled that circumstantial evidence is
sufficient for conviction if:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) there
is more than one circumstance; (b) the facts from which the inferences are
derived are proven; and (c) the combination of all the circumstances is such as
to produce conviction beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Here, the circumstances proved constitute an unbroken chain which
leads to one fair and reasonable conclusion that the <span style="">accused is guilty of the crime charged beyond reasonable </span>doubt,
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"One circumstance is that at <st1:time hour="17" minute="0">5:00
 p.m.</st1:time> of <st1:date month="11" day="5" year="1987">November 5, 1987</st1:date>,
the accused and the complainant, who are business partners in buying and
selling of tricycles, together went to the house of Andres <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Santor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, arriving there at about <st1:time hour="18" minute="30">6:30 p.m.</st1:time><span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
were riding on the tricycle of the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The three (3) of them had a drinking spree for more or less one (1)
hour.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After they finished two (2)
bottles of gin, the complainant became groggy and had to lay down in bed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So the accused insisted that he bring the
complainant home to the latter's house in <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. Cruz,
<span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
complainant, upon being persuaded by the accused, was loaded by the accused on
the passenger’ (sic) seat of the same tricycle they used earlier and then drove
the same towards <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. Cruz.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts were testified to by the
prosecution witness Andres <span class="SpellE">Velarde</span> and the accused
himself.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another circumstance is that while the said tricycle was passing
thru <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Curva</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, at more or less 7:30 p.m. that same day, the accused
was observed to be driving the same at normal speed while the complainant was
in reclining position with his head on the back rest of the passenger's seat
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was testified to by
prosecution witness Ramon Gonzales who happened to be in his <span class="SpellE">compadre's</span> house at the time in that place.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Another circumstance as testified to by prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Eugenio</span> <span class="SpellE">Matutino</span>, is that at
about 7:30 p.m. of November 5, 1987, he was at (sic) town <span style="">of </span><span class="SpellE">Bongabon</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Ecija</span></span><span style="">, </span>waiting
for a tricycle for (sic) home in <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. Cruz of that
municipality.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the tricycle he was
able to take (sic) reached <span class="SpellE">Brgy</span>. <span class="SpellE">Sampalukan</span>,
of the same municipality, the light thereof was focused on a scene of a
brawl.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He saw the accused hitting
somebody with an object.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time,
he was unable to recognize the person being hit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only after reaching the gate of his
house when he heard from a passing tricycle that the complainant was already
dead and therefore he concluded that that person he saw being hit way back by
the accused was the complainant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>One more circumstance is that the underlying causes of the death of
the complainant, according to Dr. Mario D. <span class="SpellE">Cajucom</span>
who examined his body is 'BLOWS ON THE HEAD, blunt instrument' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A)."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Aldeguer</u></span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
we said that in determining the sufficiency of circumstantial evidence to
support a conviction, each case is to be determined on its own peculiar
circumstances and all the facts and circumstances are to be considered together
as a whole and, when so considered, may be sufficient to support a conviction,
although one or more of the facts taken separately might not be sufficient for
this purpose.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No general rule has been
formulated as to the quantity of circumstantial evidence which will suffice for
any case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is required is that the
circumstances proved must be consistent with each other, and at the same time,
inconsistent with the hypothesis that the accused is innocent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforequoted circumstances proved by the
prosecution more than meet the quantum of proof sufficient to support a
conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused–appellant's flight also belies his claim of
innocence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His arrest was effected only
on <st1:date year="1989" day="26" month="6">26 June 1989</st1:date>, or one (1)
year and seven <span style="">(7) </span>months after
the incident happened, because he went into hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The guilty flee when no man <span class="SpellE">pursueth</span> but the innocent are as bold as a lion.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>
