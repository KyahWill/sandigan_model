<p class="BODY">The accused-appellant invokes alibi in his defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is his claim that at the time the crimes
were committed, he, together with some friends, was guarding the house of one <span class="SpellE">Benhur</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, which house
happens to be only 100 meters from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Silway</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the place where the victims were stabbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>To establish alibi as a defense, it must be shown that it was impossible
for the accused to have been at the place where the crime was committed <i>(People
v. <span class="SpellE">Perente</span>, Jr. 143 SCRA 56; People v. <span class="SpellE">Abigan</span>, 144 SCRA 130; People v. Coronado, 145 SCRA 250)</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, the defense of alibi may not be
successfully invoked where the identity of the assailant has been established
by the witnesses <i>(People v. <span class="SpellE">Monteverde</span>, 142 SCRA
668; People v. </i><st1:city><st1:place><i>Palma</i></st1:place></st1:city><i>,
144 SCRA 364)</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Against the preceding
criteria, the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> alibi cannot be possibly
given weight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that the
house of <span class="SpellE">Benhur</span> <span class="SpellE">Bartotome</span>,
which the accused was allegedly guarding with his companions at the time the
crimes were committed, is only 100 meters from the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Silway</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Bridge</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, could have been very easy for the
accused to go the bridge in wait, pounce upon the victim, and return to the
said house of <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> immediately after.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the identities of the accused,
specifically the accused-appellant <span class="SpellE">Ruel</span> Rivera, were
established beyond question by prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span>
<span class="SpellE">Galve</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
trial court found:</p>

<blockquote><i>"To prove their case, the prosecution presented the only
and lone eyewitness to the commission of the crimes charged in the information,
in the person of <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span> <span class="SpellE">Galve</span>,
also the offended party in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 3715, for
Frustrated Murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This witness

Rivera, alias '<span class="SpellE">Ruel</span> <span class="SpellE">Auguis</span>'
alias '<span class="SpellE">Ruel</span> <span class="SpellE">Baguis</span>',
because he had always been in company with him before the incident and he
recognized him as the one who stabbed the victim Alberto <span class="SpellE">Camasora</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Crim</span>. Case No. 3713, for Murder)... While the
stabbing incident happened at around </i><st1:time minute="30" hour="8"><i>8:30</i></st1:time><i>
in the evening, the said witness recognized the said accused as the
perpetrators of the crimes because of the electric light bulb at the </i><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><i>Silway</i></span></st1:placename><i> </i><st1:placetype><i>Bridge</i></st1:placetype></st1:place><i>
which facilitated the identity of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
