				<BR><STRONG>FERNAN, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
resolution of the Court of Appeals promulgated on February 28, 1985 which
reconsidered its previous decision dated July 29, 1984 in A.C. G.R. No. 70261-R
entitled "Socorro <span class="SpellE">Calimbas-Miaco</span> v. de
Jesus" and reversed the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> (Branch II) dismissing an action for "Recovery
of Possession with Damages" for lack of jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal issue posed by petitioner is whether or not he is an
agricultural lessee or a civil law lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is of paramount importance in this case to appreciate the
contradistinction between an agricultural lessee whose security of tenure is
guaranteed by the Tenancy Law (Sec. 5(b) R.A. 1199) and a civil law lessee <span class="GramE">whose</span> right to work on the land expires in accordance with
the terms of the Lease Agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents are owners of some 7.162 hectares of land in <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
known as Lot No. 513 of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pilar</span></span>
cadastre and covered by TCT No. <span class="GramE">T-3975.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About four (4) hectares of the above lot is a
fishpond possession of which has been in petitioner since 1962 as a
lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1972</st1:date>, private respondents, as heirs of Spouses <span class="SpellE">Eustacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Calimbas</span> and <span class="SpellE">Modesta</span> <span class="SpellE">Paguio</span> who in their
lifetime were the registered owners of the land, entered into a civil law
contract of lease, with petitioner de Jesus and one <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span>
Rodriguez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This contract was to be
effective for 2½ years starting <st1:date year="1972" day="1" month="1">January
 1, 1972</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner de Jesus and <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span>
Rodriguez formed a partnership over the fishpond with de Jesus as the
industrial partner and Rodriguez as the capitalist.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the expiration of the civil law lease
contract on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="7">July 1, 1974</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> Rodriguez gave up the lease but petitioner de
Jesus refused to vacate the leased premises despite repeated demands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="12">December
 5, 1975</st1:date>, private respondents filed a complaint for "Recovery
of <span class="SpellE">Posession</span> with Damages" against the
petitioner before the Court of First Instance, now Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> Branch II, docketed as Civil Case No. 4016.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="7">July
 20, 1979</st1:date>, the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
ruled in favor of petitioner and dismissed the complaint for lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises above considered, this case is hereby
dismissed for lack of jurisdiction without prejudice to the filing of the same
with the proper <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">court with respect to
the other incident which is for adjustment and fixing of the rentals."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">According to the lower court, the fishpond is an agricultural
land as held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tawatao</span> &amp; del <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>
v. Garcia, <span class="GramE">et</span>. <span class="GramE">al., G.R. No.</span>
L-17649, <st1:date year="1963" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1963</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It further held that petitioner is an agricultural lessee and not a civil law
lessee, therefore jurisdiction over the dispute belongs to the Court of
Agrarian Relations and not to the Court of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bases for holding that petitioner de
Jesus is an agricultural lessee are the following: [1] the land is
agricultural; [2] <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> Rodriguez testified that
she left the lease after the expiration in 1974 and it was petitioner who
managed the fishpond alone, thereby qualifying as an agricultural lessee; and
[3] the CFI Judge, <span class="SpellE"><u>motu</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>propio</u></span>,
visited the fishpond and saw no one but the petitioner working on the fishpond,
thereby further strengthening the contention that the land is subject to a
one-man cultivation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents filed a Motion for Reconsideration but it was
denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They appealed to the
Intermediate Appellate Court, now Court of Appeals, and on <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1984</st1:date>, the latter rendered a decision
affirming the Court of First Instance of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>;
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Order dated <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1979</st1:date> dismissing the case for lack of jurisdiction
of the lower court, is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">hereby
AFFIRMED”.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On Motion for Reconsideration the Intermediate Appellate Court,
after a thorough review and assessment of the records for any oversight,
realized its error which was to some extent influenced by the lower court's
findings as above discussed and reversed itself in the resolution of February 28,
1985, holding that petitioner is not an agricultural lessee but a civil law
lessee and further ordered the latter to vacate the land.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of stronger evidence, where
petitioner himself admitted that he hired the services of many people other
than the members of his family to cultivate the land, respondent appellate
Court ruled that petitioner failed to qualify as an agricultural lessee under
the doctrine laid down in Gabriel v. <span class="SpellE">Pangilinan</span>, 58
SCRA 590 (1974) and as defined in Paragraph 2, Section 166, Chapter XI of the
Agricultural Land Reform Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, he admitted that he cultivated an adjacent fishpond of 11½ hectares
by employing other laborers, whereby he was more correctly categorized as a
business entrepreneur engaged in the fishpond industry.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the Court of Appeals ruled as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, finding the Motion for Reconsideration
meritorious, the decision sought to be reconsidered is hereby REVERSED and set
aside, except the statement of facts thereof which is hereby incorporated by
reference, and a judgment is hereby entered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="25" month="9">September 25, 1985</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a Motion for Reconsideration which was denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence this Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>
assailing the Resolution of the Intermediate Appellate Court as not supported
by evidence, inconclusive and contrary or <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of applicable laws, Rules of Court, B.P. 129 and established jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule against petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Agricultural Land Reform Code was enacted by Congress to institute
land reforms in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was passed to establish owner-<span class="SpellE">cultivatorship</span> and the family-size farm as the basis of
Philippine agriculture; to achieve a dignified existence for the small farmers
free from pernicious industrial restraints and practices; to make the small
farmers more independent, self-reliant and responsible citizens and a source of
a genuine strength in our democratic society.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In other words, the
Agricultural Land Reform Code was enacted to help the small farmers and to
uplift their economic status by providing them a modest standard of living
sufficient to meet a farm family’s needs for food, clothing, shelter, education
and other basic necessities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law
further protects the small farmer by conferring upon him security of tenure
over the landholding he is working on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The leasehold relation cannot be extinguished by mere expiration of the
term or period in a leasehold contract or by the sale, alienation or transfer
of the legal possession of the landholding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He can only be ejected by the Court for cause.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
But with this benevolence is his obligation to work on the land by himself or
with the aid of his immediate farm household.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By "immediate farm household", the law means the members of
the family of the lessee or <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and other persons
who are dependent upon him for support and who usually help him in his
activities.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner de Jesus contends that he is an agricultural lessee
because a fishpond is an agricultural land as held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Tawatao</span> v. Garcia, <u>supra</u>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>While this is true, the mere fact that the
land is agricultural does not ipso facto make him an agricultural lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law provides conditions or requisites
before he can qualify as one and the land being agricultural is, only one of
them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Among others, the law is explicit,
in requiring the tenant and his immediate family to work the land.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioner also contends that he is the sole cultivator of
the fishpond as supported by the testimony of his former partner, <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> Rodriguez and as found by the trial judge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But on review by the Court of Appeals these
allegations gave way to <span class="GramE">a much</span> stronger evidence --
the judicial admissions of petitioner himself, that he hired many persons to
help him cultivate the fishpond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
pertinent portion of his testimony reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>When
you first took possession of the property, how large was this fishpond in
question?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is only one and a half hectares that could be used sir and this area is the
only one that has water.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>But
according to the complainant, the area is now four hectares, can you explain
why it has grown to four hectares?</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
had it <span class="GramE">constructed,</span> this is <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span>
and grassland before.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Do

to four hectares?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A disclosure made before the court is a judicial admission and
under the rules this cannot be contradicted unless previously shown to have
been made by palpable mistake.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, there is nothing in the records to show that
petitioner committed a palpable mistake in making the above disclosures.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, absent the requisite of personal
cultivation, petitioner de Jesus cannot be considered an agricultural
lessee.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Evangelista v.
Court of Appeals,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that one cannot be said to be an agricultural lessee if he has
not personally or by his farm household cultivated the land in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, it is an undisputed fact that petitioner is cultivating
an adjacent fishpond with a size of 11½ hectares which further proves that he
is not a small farmer but a businessman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Do
you have any other source of income between 1963 and 1969?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">What?</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fishpond also.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Up
to the present?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>What
is the area of the fishpond in question which <span class="GramE">are you</span>
operating at present excluding this one?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eleven
hectares and a half.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Who
owns <span class="GramE">this</span> eleven and a half hectares?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Maximo</span> Reyes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Where
is this located?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"A:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adjacent, sir.</span></blockquote>

plenty, sometimes few.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Q:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>You

sir."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner asserts that the cultivation of another fishpond is
irrelevant as the law does not require or prohibit the total absence of other
sources of income. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>In ruling on this
matter, it is of much significance to look into the spirit of the Agricultural
Land Reform Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First and foremost,
the law is meant to assist and help the small farmers as enunciated in its
Declaration of Policy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case at
bar, petitioner de Jesus is not a small farmer but a businessman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To consider him an agricultural lessee
despite the fact that he is cultivating another fishpond with an area of 11 1/2
hectares, and furthermore despite the fact that he does not cultivate the fishpond
personally and/or with the help of his immediate farm household as defined by
law, would render nugatory the letter and intent of the Agricultural Land
Reform Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further contends that the civil law lease contract he
signed in 1972 is unenforceable because his consent was vitiated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have to disagree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the law on contracts,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
vitiated consent does not make a contract unenforceable but merely <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If indeed
petitioner's consent was vitiated, his remedy would have been to annul the
contract for <span class="SpellE">voidable</span> contracts produce legal effects
until they are annulled.</p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance has also been put
in issue on the assumption that if petitioner is an agricultural lessee, then
the case should been filed in the Court of Agrarian Relations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We hold that this issue has now become moot
and academic in view of the passage of B.P. 129.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 19 of said law provides that the
Court of First Instance, now Regional Trial Court, shall have jurisdiction over
cases cognizable by the Court of Agrarian Relations.</p>
