inquired from the sisters as to the whereabouts of their parents as they were

<p class="BODY">The fundamental axiom underlying a criminal prosecution is that
before the accused may be convicted of any crime, his guilt must be proved
beyond reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, if there
are substantial facts which were overlooked by the trial court but which could

adduced by the prosecution, we find the same to be insufficient to sustain a
conviction.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The uncorroborated testimony of the alleged kidnapped victim,
Aida Villanueva, which was mainly relied upon by the trial court in convicting
the appellant, was not clear and convincing enough <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">to </span>overcome the constitutional presumption of innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no kidnapping in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two minors voluntarily entered the
appellant's residence through the front entrance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact of detention which is an essential
element in the crime <span class="GramE">charged,</span> was not clearly
established.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no showing that
there was actual confinement or restriction of the person of the offended
party.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v.

Phil. 64, 67 [1907]).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant’s residence has a store fronting the street where many customers
presumably come and go.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The place is
busy with a movie house in front.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no indication that Aida was locked up, physically restrained of her liberty
or unable to communicate with anyone. </p>

<p class="BODY">There are other circumstances which create grave doubts in Aida's
version of her two week detention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
her testimony, Aida claimed that she attempted to escape three times but she
was not able to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, July 21, 1987, p. 34).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Just how she tried to escape or why she did not succeed is not explained
clearly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Aida saw her father for
the first time on <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1986</st1:date>,
she inexplicably did not shout for help or run to him but just observed him and
the appellant talk for half an hour.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, July 21, 1987, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">23) </span>The
Solicitor General counters the appellant’s claim stating that Aida did ask for
help from her father when the latter was about to leave, but the appellant
pushed her and refused to let her go with her father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(TSN, July 21, 1987, pp.
25-26).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The actuations of both Aida and her father are highly
incredible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are not the natural
reactions of a ten-year old child who has been detained against her will for
two weeks and who has tried unsuccessfully <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">to </span>escape three times.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that her father was already there was the perfect
opportunity for Aida to try and get away from the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She could have clung to him from the moment
he came in instead of quietly observing him and the appellant talk for some
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aida did not go with her father
because the appellant allegedly told her not to go.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For someone who had been detained against her
will, as between her father <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">and her <span class="SpellE">detainor</span>, </span>Aida would have disregarded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the appellant’s order </span>and would have
run to her father.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither is it
believable that a father who has been desperately looking for his two minor
daughters for two weeks would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">just </span>calmly
accept the appellant’s refusal to let go of his daughter.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

above, the testimony of Aida Villanueva does not inspire credibility.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well-settled is the rule that evidence to be
believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it
must be credible <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No better test has yet been found to measure

of Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Ariate</span> to the questions propounded to him and
the statement in the blotter corroborate the appellant’s testimony that the two
children ran away from home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(TSN, </span>April 22, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1988, </span>pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The unbelievable and conflicting evidence of the prosecution
strengthens the version of the appellant that she took pity on the two runaway
children and decided to give them food and shelter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Whether or not she treated them like unpaid
servants is not in issue.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is
apparent from the records is the absence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of

<p class="BODY">Another circumstance that belies the kidnapping charge is the
unexplained delay in the lodging of the complaint against the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An entire week passed before the complaint
was lodged on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1986</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(See People v. Antonio, 161 SCRA 72, 81

<p class="BODY">The fourth circumstance present which calls for the reversal of
the conviction is that there is no motive whatsoever for the appellant to
kidnap the two children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant
is a woman of sufficient means.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
undisputed that she is the owner of a store and was the employer of two maids
at the time of the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She did not
know the two children <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">prior </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the incident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Had she wanted to hire an additional maid, she could certainly afford to
hire another one </span>without going to the extent of committing a crime as
serious as kidnapping.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There was no need
to kidnap a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">minor and force her </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">work against her will.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
appellant had everything to lose and nothing to gain if it is true that she
kidnapped the two children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No motive
was ever propounded by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">prosecution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
