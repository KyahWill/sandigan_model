				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Plaintiffs-appellants Maria Velasquez <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span> <span class="GramE">de</span> George and her
children, Mary, Nellie, Noble and <span class="SpellE">Maybelle</span>, all
surnamed George, appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, which dismissed their complaint for lack of juris­diction.
According to the trial court, the case falls within the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The appeal was
certified to us by the Court of Appeals as one involving a pure question of
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs-appellants are the widow and legitimate children
of the late Benjamin B. George whose estate is under intestate proceedings. The
case is docketed as Special Proceedings No. 18820 before the then Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> at <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>, Branch XVIII.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their complaint, the plaintiffs-appellants alleged that the
five defendants-mortgagors are officers of the Island Associates Inc. Andres <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, aside from being the treasurer-director of said
corporation, was also appointed and qualified as administrator of the estate of
Benjamin George in the above special proceedings. In life, the latter owned
64.8 percent or 636 shares out of the outstanding 980 shares of stock in the
corporation. Without the proper approval from the probate court and without
notice to the heirs and their counsel, the defendants-mortgagors executed a
Deed of First Real Estate Mortgage in favor of the defendant-mortgagee <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Villanueva, covering three parcels of land owned by
Island Associates. In said Deed, the defendants-mortgagors also expressly
waived their right to redeem the said parcels. Subsequently, <span class="GramE">a
power of attorney was executed by the defendants-mortgagors in favor of Villanueva
whereby the latter was given the full power and authority to cede, transfer,
and convey</span> the parcels of land within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period provided by law for redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">A certificate of sale was executed in favor of Villanueva by the
Provincial Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> after she submitted the
highest bids at the public auction. This led to the execution of a Deed of Sale
and Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership by virtue of which Transfer
Certificates of Titles Nos. T-16717 and T-39162, covering the three parcels of
land, were cancelled and in lieu thereof, Transfer Certificates of Titles Nos.
T-239675 and T-239674 were issued in favor of Villanueva. The
plaintiffs-appellants, therefore, filed the complaint for the annulment of the
- 1.) <span class="GramE">Deed of First Real Estate Mortgage; 2.)</span> <span class="GramE">Power of Attorney; 3.)</span> <span class="GramE">Certificate of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Sale</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">; 4.)</span> <span class="GramE">Amended Certificate of </span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Sale</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">; 5.)</span> <span class="GramE">Affidavit of Consolidation of Ownership; and 6.)</span> Transfer
Certificates of Title Nos. <span class="GramE">T-239674 and T-239675.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">A motion to dismiss was filed by William George, Robert George,
and administrator Andres <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> on the ground that the
trial court had no jurisdiction over the case. The <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
contended that the subject matter of the complaint referred to the corporate
acts of the Board of Directors of Island Associates, and, therefore, falls
within the exclu­sive jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The trial court agreed with the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> and dismissed
the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plaintiffs-appellants contend that the resolution of the
validity of a mortgage contract is within the original and exclusive
jurisdiction of civil courts, and certainly not within the jurisdiction of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and that once jurisdiction of the civil
court whether in a civil or a criminal case, has properly attached, the same
cannot be ousted, divested or removed. The appellants state that the questioned
composition of the board of <span class="GramE">directors,</span> is merely
incidental to the determination of the main issue and is insufficient cause for
the trial court to divest itself of its original and exclusive jurisdiction
that has already been acquired.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>, on the other
hand, maintain that since the complaint questions the validity of a corporate
contract which the appellants contend to have been entered into as a fraudulent
and surreptitious scheme and devise to defraud them, this issue places the
entire case outside the jurisdiction of the civil courts. According to them,
Presidential Decree No. 902-A gives the SEC exclusive jurisdiction over such a
controversy. The relevant provision reads:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Sec. 5.</span> In addition to the
regulatory and adjudicative functions of the Securities and Exchange Com­mission
over corporations, partnerships and other forms of associations re­gistered
with it as expressly granted under existing laws and decrees, it shall have
original and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and decide cases involving:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left:85.5pt;text-indent:-20.7pt">"a) Devices or
schemes employed by any acts of the board of directors, business associations,
its officers or partners amounting to fraud and misrepresentation which may be
detrimental to the interest of the public and/or of the stockholder, partner,
members of associations or organizations registered with the Commission. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</p>

<p class="BODY">Villanueva further contends that the plaintiffs-appellants have
no capacity to file the complaint because the general rule laid down in Rule
87, Section 3 of the Rules of Court states that only the administrator or
executor of the estate may bring actions of such nature as the one in the case
at bar. The only exception is when the executor or administrator is unwilling
or fails or refuses to act, which exception according to the mortgagee-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> does not apply in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the plaintiffs-appellants. What the complaint
sought to annul were documents of title which vested ownership over the three
parcels of land in question to defendant-mortgagee Villanueva, who is neither
an officer, a stockholder nor a director of the corporation, but a third party.
Clearly, the lower court had jurisdiction over the controversy. The fact that
the plaintiffs-appellants subsequently questioned the legality of the
constitution of the board of directors of the cor­poration did not divest the
court of its jurisdiction to take cognizance of the case. What determines
jurisdiction of the court are the allegations in the complaint. If from the
same, the court has already acquired jurisdiction over the subject-matter,
jurisdiction is retained up to the end of the litigation. (See Lat v. Phil.
Long Distance Co., 67 SCRA 425)</p>

<p class="BODY">Whether or not the mortgage contract, with an unusual provision
whereby the mortgagors waived their right to redeem the mortgaged property,
could be executed without proper approval of the probate court and without
notice to the widow and legitimate children of the deceased is a matter clearly
within the authority of a trial court to decide. If in the course of trial, the
court believes that the validity of the composition of the board of directors
is absolutely necessary for resolution of the issues before it, the remedy is,
at most, to require that one issue to be threshed out before the Securities and
Exchange Commission and to hold in abeyance, the trial on the merits of the
principal issues in the meantime. Certainly, the solution is not for the lower
court to surrender its judicial prerogatives and relinquish essentially
judicial questions to an administrative agency for resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also find without merit the defendant-mortgagee's contention
that the proper party to file the complaint is the administrator of the estate
of Benjamin George. The administrator, Andres <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>,
is the same person charged by the plaintiffs-appellants to have voted in the
board of directors without securing the proper authority from the probate court
to which he is accountable as administrator. In <u>Ramirez v. <span class="SpellE">Baltazar</span></u> (24 SCRA 918), we ruled that "since the
ground for the present action to annul the aforesaid foreclosure proceedings is
the fraud resulting from such insidious machinations and collusion in which the
adminis­trator has allegedly participated, it would be far fetched to expect
the said administrator himself to file the action in behalf of the estate. And
who else but the heirs, who have an interest to assert and to protect, would
bring the action? Inevitably, this case should fall under the except­ion,
rather than the general rule that pending proceedings for the settlement of the
estate, the heirs have no right to commence an action arising out of the rights
belonging to the deceased." <span class="GramE">The case at bar falls under
such an exception.</span></p>
