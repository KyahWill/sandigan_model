Presidential Decree No. 626 (1975) with respondent </span>Government <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Service Insurance System (GSIS) for temporary
total disability, was approved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">19
 November 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,
petitioner was admitted again in the same hospital for fever, headache,
dizziness, chest pains and other bodily pains.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner was initially treated for hypertension and chest pains.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon further </span>diagnosis, petitioner was
also found to be suffering from urinary tract infection and gall bladder
disease known as <span class="SpellE">cholecystitis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner was operated on the gall bladder
for <span class="SpellE">cholecystitis</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Three days after, petitioner had an attack of <span class="SpellE">dyspnea</span>
and chest pains for which she was treated with the impression of congestive
heart failure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="12">7 December 1984</st1:date>, petitioner was discharged from
the hospital but under continued medication.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a claim for benefits for her second
confinement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="4">18 April 1985</st1:date>, her claim was denied by the GSIS
on the ground that gall bladder disease is not an occupational disease and
neither did her position as a teacher increase her risk of contracting the
same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner moved for
reconsideration urging that the illness was due to the nature of her job as a
teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon re-evaluation, it was
recommended that petitioner be granted temporary total disability benefits
during the period of her second confinement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, her claim for hospitalization benefits was again disallowed
since the main reason for her confinement was for gall bladder disease which is
not work connected.</p>

<p class="BODY">Reconsideration was again filed, this time with the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>Claim Review Committee, which
similarly disapproved the claim for compensation benefits based on the same
grounds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the Employees'
Compensation Commission (ECC) in a resolution dated 7 July 1989, modified the
Decision and ordered payment of medical expenses in connection with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">petitioner's heart ailment, but denied
hospitalization and other benefits on account of petitioner's gall bladder
disease.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Hence,
this appeal.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The issue </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">whether or not petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">entitled to
medical/hospitalization benefits for her second confinement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner alleges that
her second confinement was not only because of gall bladder disease; that when
she was admitted, there were no findings yet of said disease and that she was,
in fact, treated for hypertension and chest pains; that after her operation on
22 November 1984, she had attacks of hypertension and chest pains and was, in
fact, treated for it; that even after being discharged, medications for
hypertension and chest pains continued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner concludes that she was concurrently treated for gall bladder
disease and hypertension and chest pains.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The foregoing contentions
are supported by the evidence on record, particularly, the medical findings,
which disclose:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"After several days as the patient felt other discomforts, Dr.
Emmanuel Trinidad, the attending physician made referral to another doctor for
other complications.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After referral, the
other doctor suggested laboratory examinations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Findings other than hypertension and chest pains (heart) were revealed
such as urinary tract infection and gall bladder disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Observations and treatment continued for the
rise of BP and blood sugar, and for other ailments.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Operation on the gall bladder was
recommended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But for several days,
further observations and treatment for hypertension, chest pains and <span class="SpellE">diabetis</span> were made to stabilize BP and Blood Sugar.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After 3 or 4 days of treatment to normalize BP and Blood
Sugar, go signal for surgery was given.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Patient was very, very weak.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She
even collapsed before and after operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>She stayed for 2 more days in the surgical recovery room after
operation, before being sent back to the ward where her worried relatives were
anxiously waiting for her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she had
cardiac arrest in the ward because of a weak heart.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her BP and blood sugar were carefully,
continuously checked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Medications
continued in the ward.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The patient was discharged on December 7, after fluctuations
of Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, and fever.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Medications continue at home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Monthly check-up, laboratory examinations, and medications
are going on up to the present."<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Again,
the attending physician's clinical diagnosis (Exhibit W) included "gall
bladder disease, urinary tract infection, hypertension, coronary artery
disease, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">diabetis</span></span>."
Petitioner's past medical history regarding illnesses related to the present
(gall bladder) listed "diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular
disease," or heart ailment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
medical notes further disclose:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Although the patient came in because of gall bladder disease,
we also have to treat concurrently her other illnesses which include
hypertension &amp; coronary artery disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, the said illnesses gave complication during the pre-operation
&amp; post-operation period, thus prolonging her hospital stay, which
ordinarily would be only 3-5 days for gall bladder operation.‚Äù<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Obviously, petitioner was
treated concurrently for heart ailment and gall bladder disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One illness could not be segregated from the
other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, <span class="GramE">an</span>
heart ailment can be aggravated by a gall bladder disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Both had to be attended to at the same
time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was impossible to determine at
what point in time the heart ailment was cured and when <span class="SpellE">cholecystitis</span>
became the only remaining ailment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hypertension and coronary artery disease continued give complications
"during the pre-operation and post-operation period." Medications for
both diseases were administered concurrently as shown by the receipts for
medicines (Annexes L to V, inclusive).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Under the peculiar
circumstances obtaining, it is but fair and just that petitioner's claim for
hospitalization benefits during the entire period of her second confinement
from 19 November to </span><st1:date year="1984" day="7" month="12"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">7 December 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> should be granted, it being impossible to
state conclusively that her confinement for said period was exclusively for <span class="SpellE">cholecystitis</span> alone.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
