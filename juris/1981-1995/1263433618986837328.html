				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The nature of the liability of an insurer sued together with the
insured/operator-owner of a common carrier which figured in an accident causing
the death of <span style="">a </span>third person is
sought to be defined in this petition for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as found by the trial court are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x.  Lope Maglana
was an employee of the Bureau of Customs whose work station was at Lasa, here
in Davao City.  On December 20, 1978,
early morning,Lope Maglana was on his way to his work station, driving a
motorcycle owned by the Bureau of Customs.  At Km. 7, Lanang, he met an accident that resulted in his death.  He died on the spot.  The PUJ jeep that bumped the deceased was
driven by Pepito Into, operated and owned by defendant Destrajo.  From the investigation conducted by the
traffic investigator, the PUJ jeep was overtaking another passenger jeep that
was going towards the city poblacion.  While overtaking, the PUJ jeep of defendant Destrajo running abreast
with the overtaken jeep, bumped the motorcycle driven by the deceased who was
going towards the direction of Lasa, Davao City.  The point of impact was on the lane of the motorcycle and the
deceased was thrown from the road and met his untimely death."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the heirs of Lope Maglana, Sr., herein petitioners,
filed an action for damages and attorney's fees against operator <span style="">Patricio </span>Destrajo and the Afisco
Insurance Corporation (AFISCO for brevity) before the then Court of First
Instance of Davao, <span style="">Branch </span>II.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
An information for homicide thru reckless imprudence was <span style="">also </span>filed against Pepito Into.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the pendency of the civil case, Into was sentenced to
suffer an indeterminate penalty of one (1) year, eight (8) months and one (1)
day of <u>prision</u> <u>correccional</u>, as minimum, to four (4) years, nine
(9) months and eleven (11) days of <u>prision</u> <u>correccional</u>, as
maximum, with all the accessory penalties provided by law, and to indemnify the
heirs of Lope Maglana, Sr. in the amount of twelve thousand pesos (P12,000.00)
with subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, plus five thousand pesos
(P5,000.00) in the concept of moral and exemplary damages with costs.  No appeal was interposed by the accused who
later applied for probation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><span style="">December 14, 1981, the lower court rendered a
decision finding that Destrajo had not exercised sufficient diligence as the
operator of the jeepney.  The
dispositive portion of the decision reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds judgment in favor of the
plaintiffs against defendant Destrajo, ordering him to pay plaintiffs the sum
of P28,000.00 for loss of income; to pay plaintiffs the sum of P12,000.00 which
amount shall be deducted in the event judgment in Criminal Case No. 3527-D
against the driver, accused Into, shall have been enforced; to pay plaintiffs
the sum of P5,901.70 representing funeral and burial expenses of the deceased;
to pay plaintiffs the sum of P5,000.00 as moral damages which shall be deducted
in the event judgment (sic) in Criminal Case No. 3527-D against the driver,
accused Into; to pay plaintiffs the sum of P3,000.00 as attorney's fees and to
pay the costs <span style="">of </span>suit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The defendant insurance company is ordered to reimburse defendant
Destrajo whatever amounts the latter shall have paid only up to the extent of
its insurance coverage.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 6pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed a motion for the reconsideration of the second
paragraph of the dispositive portion of the decision contending that AFISCO
should not merely be held secondarily liable because the Insurance Code
provides that the insurer's liability is “direct and primary and/or jointly and
severally with the operator of the vehicle, although only up to the extent of
the insurance coverage.”<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, they argued that the P20,000.00 coverage of the insurance <span style="">policy </span>issued by AFISCO, should have
been awarded in their favor.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In its comment on the motion for reconsideration, AFISCO argued
that since the Insurance Code does not expressly provide for a solidary
obligation, the presumption is that the obligation is joint.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Order of February 9, 1982, the lower court denied the
motion for reconsideration ruling that since the insurance contract "is in
the nature of suretyship, then the liability of the insurer is secondary only
up to the extent of the insurance coverage.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> </p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners filed a second motion for reconsideration reiterating
that the liability of the insurer is direct, primary and solidary with the
jeepney operator because the petitioners became direct beneficiaries under the
provision of the policy which, in effect, is a stipulation <u>pour</u> <u>autrui</u>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
This motion was likewise denied for lack of merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioners filed the instant petition <span style="">for </span><i>certiorari</i> which, although
it does not seek the reversal of the lower court's decision in its entirety,
prays for the setting aside or modification of the second paragraph of the
dispositive portion of said decision.  Petitioners reassert their position that the insurance company is
directly and solidarily liable with the negligent operator up to the extent of
its insurance coverage.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We grant the petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The particular provision of the insurance policy on which
petitioners base their claim is as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1 –-<b> </b>LIABILITY TO THE PUBLIC</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Company will, subject
to the Limits of Liability, pay all sums necessary to discharge liability of
the insured in respect of </p>

</span><!--[endif]-->x x x.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span> x x x.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the event of the death
of any person entitled to indemnity under this Policy, the Company will, in
respect of the liability incurred to such person indemnify his personal
representatives in terms of, and subject to the terms and conditions
hereof."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The above-quoted provision leads to no other conclusion but that
AFISCO can be held directly liable by petitioners.  As this Court ruled in <u>Shafer</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Judge<i>,</i></u>
<u>RTC</u> <u>of</u> <u>Olongapo</u> <u>City,</u> <u>Br.</u> <u>75</u>,
“[w]here an insurance policy insures directly against liability, the insurer's
liability accrues immediately upon the occurrence of the injury or event upon
which the liability depends, and does not depend on the recovery of judgment by
the injured party against the insured.”<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> The
underlying reason behind the third party liability (TPL) of the Compulsory
Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance is "to protect injured persons against
the insolvency of the insured who causes such injury, and to give such injured
person a certain beneficial interest in the proceeds of the policy x x x.”<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Since petitioners had received from AFISCO the sum of P5,000.00 under the
no-fault clause.  AFISCO's liability is
now limited to P15,000.00.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">However, we cannot agree that AFISCO is likewise solidarily liable
with Destrajo.  In <u>Malayan</u> <u>Insurance</u>
<u>Co.,</u> <u>Inc.</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court had the opportunity to resolve the issue as to the nature of the
liability of the insurer and the insured vis-a-vis the third party injured in
an accident.  We categorically ruled
thus:</p>

<blockquote>"While it is true that where the insurance contract provides
for indemnity against liability to third persons, such third persons can
directly sue the insurer, however, <u>the</u> <u>direct</u> <u>liability</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>insurer</u> <u>under</u> <u>indemnity</u> <u>contracts</u> <u>against</u>
<u>third</u> <u>party</u> <u>liability</u> <u>does</u> <u>not</u> <u>mean</u> <u>that</u>
<u>the</u> <u>insurer</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>held</u> <u>solidarily</u> <u>liable</u>
<u>with</u> <u>the</u> <u>insured</u> <u>and/or</u> <u>the</u> <u>other</u> <u>parties</u>
<u>found</u> <u>at</u> <u>fault.</u>  <u>The</u>
<u>liability</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>insurer</u> <u>is</u> <u>based</u> <u>on</u>
<u>contract;</u> <u>that</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>insured</u> <u>is</u> <u>based</u>
<u>on</u> <u>tort</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, petitioner as insurer of Sio Choy, is liable to
respondent Vallejos (the injured third party), but it cannot, as incorrectly
held by the trial court, be made 'solidarily' liable with the two principal
tortfeasors, namely respondents Sio Choy and San Leon Rice Mill, Inc.  <u>For</u> <u>if</u> <u>petitioner-insurer</u>
<u>were</u> <u>solidarily</u> <u>liable</u> <u>with</u> <u>said</u> <u>two</u> <span style="">(<u>2</u>) </span><u>respondents</u> <u>by</u>
<u>reason</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>indemnity</u> <u>contract</u> <u>against</u>
<u>third</u> <u>party</u> <u>liability</u> - under which an insurer can be
directly sued by a third party - <u>this</u> <u>will</u> <u>result</u> <u>in</u>
<u>a</u> <u>violation</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>principles</u> <u>underlying</u>
<u>solidary</u> <u>obligation</u> <u>and</u> <u>insurance</u> <u>contracts."</u>
(underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="margin-left: 4.5pt; text-indent: 17.1pt;">The Court then
proceeded to distinguish the extent of the liability and manner of enforcing the
same in ordinary contracts from that of insurance contracts.  While in solidary obligations, the creditor
may enforce the entire obligation against one of the solidary debtors, in an
insurance contract, the insurer undertakes for a consideration to indemnify the
insured against loss, damage or liability arising from an unknown or contingent
<span style="">event.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style="">  Thus, petitioner therein, which, under the insurance contract is liable
only up to P20,000.00, can not be made soli­darily liable with the insured for
the entire obligation of P29,013.00 otherwise there would result "an
evident breach of the concept of solidary obligation.”<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, petitioners herein cannot validly claim that AFISCO,
whose liability under the insurance policy is also P20,000.00, can be held <span style="">solidarily </span><span style="">liable </span>with Destrajo for the total amount of P53,901.70 in
accordance with the decision of the lower court.  Since under both the law and the insurance policy, AFISCO's
liability is only up to P20,000.00, the second paragraph of <span style="">the dispositive </span>portion of the
decision in question may have unwittingly sown confusion among the petitioners
and their counsel.  What should have
been clearly <span style="">stressed as </span><span style="">to </span><span style="">leave no </span>room for doubt was the <span style="">liability of </span>AFISCO under the explicit terms of the <span style="">insurance </span>contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, we conclude that the liability of AFISCO based on the
insurance contract is direct, but not solidary with that of Destrajo which is
based on Article 2180 of the Civil Code.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> As
such, petitioners have the option either to claim the P15, 000 from AFISCO and
the balance from Destrajo or enforce the entire judgment from Destrajo subject
to reimbursement from AFISCO to the extent of the insurance coverage.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the petition seeks a definitive ruling only on the nature
of AFISCO's liability, we noticed that the lower court erred in the computation
of the probable loss of income.  Using
the formula:  2/3 of (80-56) x
P12,000.00, it awarded P28,800.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> Upon
recomputation, the correct amount is P192,000.00, Being a "plain
error," we opt to correct the same.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Furthermore, in accordance with prevailing jurisprudence, the death indemnity
is hereby increased to P50,000.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, premises considered, the present petition is
hereby GRANTED.  The award of P28,800.00
representing loss of Income <span style="">is </span>INCREASED
to P192,000.00 and the death indemnity of P12,000.00 to P50,000.00.</p>
