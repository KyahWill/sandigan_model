				<H3>VICTORIA LEGARDA, PETITIONER, VS. COURT OF APPEALS, NEW CATHAY HOUSE, INC. AND REGIONAL TRIAL COURT OF QUEZON CITY, BRANCH 94, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Victoria Legarda was the defendant in a complaint for
specific performance with damages filed by private respondent New Cathay House,
Inc. before the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City.  The complaint was aimed at compelling Victoria Legarda to sign a
lease contract involving her house and lot at 123 West Avenue, Quezon City which
New Cathay House, Inc. intended to use in operating a restaurant.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As prayed for in the complaint, the lower court issued a
temporary restraining order enjoining Victoria Legarda and her agents from
stopping the renovation of the property which was being done by New Cathay
House, Inc.  After hearing, the lower
court issued a writ of preliminary injunction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, Antonio P. Coronel of the Coronel Law Office at 146
Katipunan Road, White Plains, Quezon City, entered his appearance as counsel
for Victoria Legarda.  He also filed an
urgent motion for an extension of ten (10) days from February 6, 1985 within
which to file an answer to the complaint.  The motion was granted by the court which gave Victoria Legarda until
February 20, 1985 to answer the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, Victoria Legarda failed to file her answer within the
extended period granted by the court.  Hence, upon motion of New Cathay House, Inc., she was declared in
default, thereby paving the way for the presentation of evidence <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 25, 1985, the lower court rendered a decision by
default.  It ordered Victoria Legarda to
execute and sign the lease contract and to pay the following:  (a) exemplary damages of P100,000.00, (b)
actual and compensatory damages in the total amount of P278,764.37, and (c)
attorney's fees of P10,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Atty. Coronel received a copy of the lower court's decision on
April 9, 1985 but he did not interpose an appeal therefrom within the
reglementary period.  Consequently, the
decision became final and, upon motion of New Cathay House, Inc., the lower
court issued a writ of execution.  In
compliance with the writ, on June 27, 1985, the sheriff levied upon, and sold
at public auction, the property subject of the litigation to New Cathay House,
Inc., the highest bidder.  The sheriff's
certificate of sale was registered in the Office of the Register of Deeds of
Quezon City.</p>

<p class="BODY">The one-year redemption period having expired on July 8, 1986,
the sheriff issued a final deed of sale which, on July 11, 1986, was duly
registered with the Office of the Register of Deeds.  On November 6, 1986, Victoria Legarda, represented by her
attorney-in-fact Ligaya C. Gomez, filed in the Court of Appeals a petition for
annulment of the judgment against her in Civil Case No. Q-43811.  She alleged therein that the decision was
obtained through fraud and that it is not supported by the allegations in the
pleadings nor by the evidence submitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forthwith, the Court of Appeals issued a temporary restraining
order enjoining the respondents from dispossessing petitioner of the premises in
question.  Private respondent New Cathay
House, Inc. then filed its consolidated comment on the petition with a motion
for the lifting of the temporary restrain足ing order.  Victoria Legarda, through Atty. Coronel, filed a reply to the
consolidated comment.  The petition was
thereafter orally argued.  Required by
the Court of Appeals to manifest if the parties desired to file their
respective memoranda, Dean Coronel informed the appellate court that he was
adopting Victoria Legarda's reply to the consolidated comment as her
memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals promulgated its decision on November 29,
1989.  On the issue of fraud, for which
Victoria Legarda claimed that Roberto V. Cabrera, Jr., who represented New
Cathay House, Inc., made her believe through false pretenses that he was
agreeable to the conditions of the lease she had imposed on the lessee and that
the latter would withdraw the complaint against her, thereby prompting her to
advise her lawyer not to file an answer to the complaint anymore, the Court of
Appeals<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
said:</p>

<blockquote>"On the other hand, petitioner's above allegation of fraud
supposedly practiced upon her by Roberto V. Cabrera, Jr. is so improbable as to
inspire belief.  For the Coronel Law
Office had already entered its appearance as petitioner's counsel by then, so
that if it were true that Cabrera had already agreed to the conditions imposed
by petitioner, said law office would have asked plaintiff to file the proper
motion to dismiss or withdraw complaint with the Court, and if plaintiff had
refused to do so, it would have filed defendant's answer anyway so that she
would not be declared in default.  Or
said law office would have prepared a compromise agreement embodying the
conditions imposed by their client in the lease contract in question which plaintiffs
had allegedly already accepted, so that the same could have been submitted to
the Court and judgment on a compromise could be entered.  All these, any conscientious lawyer of
lesser stature than the Coronel Law Office, headed by no less than a former law
dean, Dean Antonio Coronel, or even a new member of the bar, would normally
have done under the circumstances to protect the interests of their client,
instead of leaving it to the initiative of plaintiff to withdraw its complaint
against defendant, as it had allegedly promised the latter.  <u>Thus,</u> <u>it</u> <u>is</u> <u>our</u> <u>belief</u>
<u>that</u> <u>this</u> <u>case</u> <u>is</u> <u>one</u> <u>of</u> <u>pure</u> <u>and</u>
<u>simple</u> <u>negligence</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u> <u>part</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>defendant's</u> <u>counsel,</u> <u>who</u> <u>simply</u> <u>failed</u> <u>to</u>
<u>file</u> <u>the</u> <u>answer</u> <u>in</u> <u>behalf</u> <u>of</u> <u>defendant</u>.  But counsel's negligence does not stop
here.  For after it had been furnished
with copy of the decision by default against defendant, it should then have
appealed therefrom or file (sic) a petition for relief from the order declar足ing
their client in default or from the judgment by default.  Hence, defendant is bound by the acts of her
counsel in this case and cannot be heard to complain that the result might have
been different if it had proceeded differently (Pulido v. C.A., 122 SCRA 63;
Ayllon v. Sevilla, 156 SCRA 257, among other cases).  And the rationale of this rule is obvious and clear.  For if such grounds were to be admitted as
reasons for opening cases, there would never be an end to a suit so long as new
counsel could be employed who could allege and show that the prior counsel had
not been sufficiently diligent, or experienced, or learned' (Fernandez v. Tan
Tiong Tick, SCRA 1138)." (Underscoring supplied.)<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finding the second ground for the petition to be likewise
unmeritorious, the Court of Appeals dismissed the petition.  Surprisingly, however, inspite of the Court
of Appeals' tirade on his professional competence, Atty. Coronel did not lift a
finger to file a motion for reconsideration.  Neither did he initiate moves towards an appeal to this Court of the
decision which was adverse and prejudicial to his client.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Court of Appeals decision became final.  On December 8, 1989, counsel for New Cathay
House, Inc. sent petitioner through the Coronel Law Office, a letter demanding
that she vacate the property within three days from receipt thereof.  Atty. Coronel did not inform petitioner of
this develop足ment until sometime in March, 1990.  Due to petitioner's persist足ent telephone calls, Atty. Coronel's
secretary informed her of the fact that New Cathay House, Inc. had demanded her
eviction from the property.  Consequently, petitioner had no recourse but to oblige and vacate the
property.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 7, 1990, Victoria Legarda, represented by <i>a </i>new
counsel,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
filed before this Court a petition for <i>certiorari</i> under Rule 65
contending that the decisions of the courts below "are null and void as
petitioner was deprived of her day in court and divested of her property
without due process of law through the gross, pervasive and malicious
negligence of previous counsel, Atty. Antonio Coronel."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision of March 18, 1991, this Court declared as null
and void the decisions of March 25, 1985 And November 29, 1989 of the Regional
Trial Court of Quezon City and the Court of Appeals, respectively, as well as
the sheriff's certificate of sale dated June 27, 1985 of the property involved
and the subse足quent final deed of sale covering the same.  The Court further directed private
respondent New Cathay House, Inc. to reconvey the property to the petitioner
and the Register of Deeds to cancel the registration of said property in the
name of said private respondent and to issue a new one in the name of the
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The same decision required the former counsel of petitioner,
Atty. Antonio Coronel, to show cause within ten (10) days from notice why he
should not be held administatively liable for his acts and omissions which
resulted in grave injustice to the petitioner.  Said counsel having been inadvertently omitted in the service of copies
of said decision,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
on February 11, 1992, the Clerk of Court of this Division to which this case
was transferred, sent Atty. Coronel a copy thereof which he received on
February 12, 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the tenth day from his receipt of said copy, Atty. Coronel
filed an urgent ex-parte motion for an extension of thirty (30) days from
February 22, 1992 within which to file his explanation.  He alleged as reason for the motion pressure
of work "consisting of daily hearings in several forums and preparations
of pleadings in equally urgent cases, such as the more than 80 civil and
criminal cases against the Marcoses."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, in its resolution of March 9, 1992, granted said
motion for extension with warning that no further extension will be given.  Atty. Coronel received a copy of said resolution
on March 27, 1992 but it appears that on March 24, 1992,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
a day after the expiration of the 30-day extended period prayed for in his
first motion for extension, he had mailed another urgent motion for a second
extension of thirty (30) days within which to submit his explanation on the
ground that since March 2, 1992, he had been "treated and confined at the
St. Luke's Hospital." Attached to the motion is a medical certificate
stating that Atty. Coronel had "ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes mellitus,
congestive heart failure class IV and brain infarction, thrombotic."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While off-hand, the reasons cited in the second motion for
reconsideration seem to warrant another extension, the fact that it was filed
one day late, coupled with the circumstances of this case do not call for a
reconsideration of the resolution of March 9, 1992.  Hence, the second motion for extension must be denied.  Lawyers should not presume that their
motions for exten足sion of time will always be granted by the Court.  The granting or denial of motions for
extension of time is addressed to the sound discretion of the Court with a view
to attaining substantial justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It should be emphasized that the show-cause resolution was
addressed to Atty. Coronel <u>not</u> in his capacity as a lawyer of a litigant
in this Court.  It was addressed to him
in his personal capacity as a lawyer subject to the disciplinary powers of this
Court.  That he failed to immediately
heed the directive of the decision of March 18, 1991 to show cause, notwithstanding
the grant of a 30-day extension for him to do so, reflects an unbe足coming
disrespect towards this Court's orders.  We cannot counte足nance such disrespect.  As a lawyer, Atty. Coronel is expected to recognize the authority of
this Court and obey its lawful processes and orders.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the Court considers his failure to show cause,
notwithstanding reasonable notice therefor, as a waiver of his rights to be
heard and to due process, thereby warranting an <u>ex</u> <u>parte</u>
determination of the matter for which he had been required to explain.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case clearly show that Atty. Coronel vio足lated
Canon 18 of the Code of Professional Responsibility which mandates that "a
lawyer shall serve his client with competence and diligence." He failed to
observe particularly Rule 18.03 of the same Code which requires that "a
lawyer shall not neglect a legal matter entrusted to him, and his negligence in
connection therewith shall render him liable."</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, petitioner could not have gone through the travails
attending the disposition of the case against her not to mention the
devastating consequence on her property rights had Dean Coronel exercised even
the ordinary diligence of a member of the Bar.  By neglecting to file the answer to the complaint against petitioner, he
set off the events which resulted in the depriva足tion of petitioner's rights
over her house and lot.  In this regard,
worth quoting is the observation of Justice Emilio A. Gancayco in his <u>ponencia</u>
of March 18, 1991:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioner's counsel is a well-known practicing lawyer and
dean of a<i> </i>law school.  It is to
be expected that he would extend the highest quality of service as a lawyer to
the petitioner.  Unfortunately, counsel
appears to have abandoned the cause of petitioner.  After agreeing to defend the petitioner in the civil case filed
against her by private respondent, said counsel did nothing more than enter his
appearance and seek for an extension of time to file the answer.  Nevertheless, he failed to file the
answer.  Hence, petitioner was declared
in default on the motion of private respondent's counsel.  x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This is not the only case wherein, in dealing with this Court's
orders, Atty. Coronel appears to exhibit a pattern of negligence, inattention
to his obligations as counsel, sloppiness and superciliousness.  In G.R. No. 97418, "Imelda R. Marcos,
et al. v. PCGG, et al.," the Court <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, in its
Resolution of May 28, 1992, imposed upon Atty. Coronel a fine of Five Hundred
Pesos (P500.00) after he was found guilty of inexcusable negli足gence in his
failure to comply with this Court's resolutions.  The Court said:</p>

<blockquote>"We find the explanation for his failure to comply with the
Resolutions of 4 June 1991 and 27 August 1991 unsatisfactory.  <u>Atty.</u> <u>Coronel</u> <u>had</u> <u>obviously</u>
<u>taken</u> <u>this</u> <u>Court</u> <u>for</u> <u>granted.</u>  Although he received a copy of the 4 June
1991 Resolution on 4 July 1991, he nonchalantly let the 10-day period pass and
even deliberately chose to remain silent about it even after he received a copy
of the Resolution of 27 August 1991.  It
was only on the last day of the period granted to, him under said Resolu足tion
that he showed initial efforts to comply with the Resolution by filing a motion
for a 20-day extension from 30 September 1991 to file the Reply.  This was a self-imposed period and,
therefore, <u>he</u> <u>was</u> <u>expected</u> <u>to</u> <u>faithfully</u> <u>comply</u>
<u>with</u> <u>it</u> <u>not</u> <u>only</u> <u>because</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u>
<u>re足spect</u> <u>due</u> <u>this</u> <u>Court,</u> <u>but</u> <u>also</u> <u>because</u>
<u>he</u> <u>had</u> <u>put</u> <u>his</u> <u>honor</u> <u>and</u> <u>virtues</u>
<u>of</u> <u>candor</u> <u>and</u> <u>good</u> <u>faith</u> <u>on</u> <u>the</u>
<u>line</u>.  For reasons only known to
him, he did not.  Worse, de足spite his receipt
on 27 November 1991 of the Resolution of 5 November 1991 which granted his 30
September 1991 motion, Atty. Coronel did not even move for a new period within
which to comply with the Resolutions of 4 June 1991 and 27 August 1991.  This Court had to issue the Resolution of 30
January 1992 to compel compliance.  When
he finally did, he committed, allegedly through inad足vertence, the blunder of
placing his Reply under a wrong caption.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For deliberately failing, if not stubbornly refusing, to
comply with the Resolutions of 4 June 1991 and 27 August 1991 and meet his
self-imposed deadline, <u>Atty.</u> <u>Coronel</u> <u>was</u> <u>both</u> <u>unfair</u>
<u>and</u> <u>disrespectful</u> <u>to</u> <u>this</u> <u>Court</u>.  Furthermore, he has unduly delayed the
disposi足tion of the pending incidents in this case." (Underscor足ing
supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, in the case at hand, Atty. Coronel's failure to
exercise due diligence in protecting and attending to the interest of his
client caused the latter material prejudice.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
It should be remembered that the moment a lawyer takes a client's cause, he
covenants that he will exert all effort for its prose足cution until its final
conclusion.  A lawyer who fails to
exercise due diligence or abandons his client's cause makes him unworthy of the
trust reposed on him by the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Moreover, a lawyer owes fealty, not only to his client, but also to the Court
of which he is an officer.  Atty.
Coronel failed to obey this Court's order even on a matter that personally
affects him, such that one cannot avoid the conclusion that he must be bent on
professional self-destruction.  Be that
as it may, Atty. Coronel cannot escape this Court's disciplinary action for
gross negligence which resulted in depriving petitioner of her property rights,
for, as this Court enunciated in the aforecited <u>Cantiller</u>  <u>v.</u> <u>Potenciano</u> case:</p>

<blockquote>"Lawyers are indispensable part of the whole system of
administering justice in this jurisdiction.  At a time when strong and disturbing criticisms are being hurled at the
legal profession, strict compliance with one's oath of office and the canons of
professional ethics is an imperative.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Lawyers should be fair, honest, respectable, above suspicion
and beyond reproach in dealing with their clients.  The profession is not synonymous with an ordinary business
proposition.  It is a matter of public
interest."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the second motion for an extension of time to
