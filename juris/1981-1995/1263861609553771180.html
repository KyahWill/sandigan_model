respondent Judge of the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="8">7 August 1977</st1:date>,
petitioner filed a complaint before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, Branch XXI, docketed as Civil Case No. 26938,
entitled "<span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> Asuncion vs. Heirs of Spouses
Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
et al. and the Heirs of Spouses <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>, et al."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
The complaint seeks to compel defendants therein (now private respondents) to
execute a Deed of <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span> over 3.5 hectares
located at the north-western portion of that parcel of land situated in <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, covered by
T.C.T. No. 15394 (formerly O.C.T. No. 10) registered in the names of <span class="SpellE">Estanislawa</span> <span class="SpellE">Partoza</span>, <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:328.5pt">The complaint alleges that the property
was held in trust by the private respondents' grandfather, <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, for the benefit of petitioner's father, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> Asuncion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to petitioner, as plaintiff, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> O. Asuncion (his father) is the son of Marcela <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, full-blood sister of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>; that <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
possessed, developed and cultivated the disputed 3.5 hectares of the land
originally covered by O.C.T. No. 10 long before the title was issued; that <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> (his nephew) agreed to consolidate the possession
and cultivation of their respective lands in order that the <span class="SpellE">former's</span>
application with the Bureau of Lands for a Homestead Patent would be approved,
since the possession and cultivation of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> was
incomplete and was then opposed by a third party; that it was also agreed that
the 3.5 hectares of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> would remain registered
in the name of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> to be held in trust and for
the benefit of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>; that after the approval of
the application and issuance of the Homestead Patent in the name of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>, and, later, his only son, herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> Asuncion, continued to cultivate and possess the
3.5 hectares up to the present; that after the death of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>,
O.C.T No. 10 was transferred in the names of his compulsory heirs, namely, his
wife <span class="SpellE">Estanislawa</span> <span class="SpellE">Partoza</span>,
and two children, <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> and Maria, both
surnamed<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents, the Heirs of Spouses Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
moved for the dismissal of the complaint on the ground, among other things, of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Pertinent facts of the case are stated in the here assailed <st1:date year="1977" day="24" month="11">24 November 1977</st1:date> Order of respondent
Judge, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In Civil Case No. 21048 also pending in this <span class="SpellE">sala</span>, the heirs of the spouses Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>

with damages against the heirs of the spouses <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span> concerning a property situated in the Munici­pality
of <span class="SpellE">Antipolo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and
covered by Transfer Certificate of Title No. 15394 (formerly Original
Certificate of Title No. 10 in the name <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of
the Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>)

<blockquote>"Plaintiff herein, <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span>

property, alleging that he and his predecessors-in-interest had been personally
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">in possession and in cultivation of
said property in good faith, openly, continuously, exclusively, publicly and
notoriously and with a <span class="SpellE">bonafide</span> claim of ownership,
Plaintiffs filed an opposition.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This Court, in denying the intervention, ruled:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'<span class="SpellE">Intervenor</span> does not claim to be an heir
of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His claim of ownership based on possession
which is alleged to be open, continuous, exclusive, public and in the concept
of owner since time immemo­rial and long before the issuance of Original
Certificate of Title No. 10, granting that this claim were true, cannot prevail
upon the well-settled rule that the Torrens Title serves as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">evidence <span class="SpellE">undefeasible</span>
[sic] title to the property in favor of the person whose name appears
therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the expiration of the

(CA-G.R. No. SP-015636) seeking the annulment of the order of this Court
denying his motion to intervene.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
denying the petition the Court of Appeals ruled:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Order appealed from is AFFIRMED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petition is hereby DISMISSED and the Restraining
Order issued in connection with this case is ordered LIFTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let the respondent Judge proceed with the

<blockquote>"The decision of the Court of Appeals is already final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The motion to dismiss should be granted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In dismissing petitioner's complaint, respondent Judge found that
the same facts and the same cause of action alleged in petitioner's motion for
intervention in Civil Case No. 21048 are present in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And since the Order denying petitioner's
motion for intervention in Civil Case No. 21048 had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the present complaint is barred by said final
Order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner moved for a reconsideration of the above-said Order of
24 November 1977.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
The motion was likewise denied on 7 February 1978.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a notice of appeal and appeal bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, he withdrew the same, whereupon, the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> dismissed his appeal as per its Order dated 30 June
1978.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In lieu of his withdrawn appeal,
petitioner filed the instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, on the
ground that the issue involves jurisdiction of the lower court and that the
instant petition is more expeditious than the ordinary appeal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 23 April 1979, the Court resolved to give due course to the
petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two issues are raised by petitioner, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether the denial of his Motion To Intervene
in Civil Case No. 21048 for partition is a bar to the petition for <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>, a remedy invoked by petitioner under Section
102 of the Land Registration Law, Act 496;</blockquote>

<blockquote>B.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>whether the action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
for the enforcement of the trust is subject to prescription under Act 496.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crux of petitioner's arguments in support of this petition is
that he is not seeking a remedy under Section 38 of Act 496 (Land Registration
Law) but rather the enforcement of a trust under the provisions of Section 102
of the said Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He maintains that when <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> O. Asuncion (petitioner's father) agreed to have
their respective lands consolidated for the purpose of expediting the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> application for a Homestead Patent, there was
created a fiduciary relationship between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Citing the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Manalang</u></span><u>, et al.
vs. <span class="SpellE">Canlas</span>, et al</u>., L-6307, 20 April 1954, Vol.
No. 50, No. 6, O.G., May 1954, petitioner avers that an action to compel a
trustee to convey the property registered in his name in trust for the benefit
of a <span class="SpellE"><u>cestui</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">que</span></u>
<u>trust</u> does not prescribe.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner further contends that the present complaint is not
barred by the "prior judgment" rendered in Civil Case No. 21048
because the judgment therein was a denial of his "Intervention” and not a
decision on the merits of his contention, while the case at bar is an
independent complaint for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> to enforce the
sacred and inviolable trust between <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> O. Asuncion,
which is affirmed by defendants in Civil Case No. 21048 (Heirs of Spouses <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>) in their Answer
to the Motion for Intervention.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, private respondents, Heirs of Spouses Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span>,
deny that there is such a trust agreement between <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>, their grandfather, and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
O. Asuncion, petitioner's father, contrary to the sworn statement of the other
private respondents, Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents
(Heirs of Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>) argue that if it were
really true that during the lifetime of the Spouses <span class="SpellE">Macario</span>
<span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estanislawa</span> <span class="SpellE">Partoza</span> and <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> O. Asuncion,
there was such a trust agreement, the agreement should have been annotated at
the back of Original Certificate of Title No. 10 and subsequently on T.C.T. No.
15394.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And then, assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that petitioner had a right to recover
title to and possession of the property, respondents (Heirs of Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>) allege that because of the failure of petitioner
and his predecessor-in-interest to take action to recover the disputed property
for <u>sixty (60) years</u> from the issuance of O.C.T. No. 10 in 1917, an
action to recover title to and possession of the property in question has
already prescribed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, respondents (Heirs of Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>)
insist that the denial of petitioner's motion to intervene in Civil Case No.
21048 has become final; hence, a bar to the filing of the present action for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> which was correctly dismissed by respondent
Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is well settled that the essential requisites for the
existence of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>,
are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the former judgment must
be final; (2) it must have been rendered by a court having jurisdiction of the
subject matter and the parties; (3) it must be a judgment on the merits; and
(4) there must be, between the first and second actions, (a) identity of
parties; (b) identity of subject matter; and (c) identity of cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">We note that in Civil Case No. 21048 which was an action for
partition, the complainants were the Heirs of Spouses Maria <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>
and Alejandro <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> against the Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> <span class="SpellE">Alarcon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner filed a motion to intervene
therein which was denied by the court for reasons <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When petitioner's motion for intervention was
denied, resultantly, he did not become a party to the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Order of the court denying his
intervention is not a decision on the merits of Civil Case No. 21048.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said Order, therefore, does not
constitute <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
<span class="SpellE">vis-a-vis</span> the present case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Peti­tioner did not participate in the trial
of Civil Case No. 21048 where he could have presented (but was not allowed)
evidence to support his claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, even granting for the sake of argument that petitioner is a
party in Civil Case No. 21048, yet, as admitted by the parties, the case was
still pending before the same court when the present case (Civil Case No.
26938) for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> was filed by petitioner
herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, there is as yet
no final judgment, to speak of, in Civil Case No. 21048, which would have the
effect of barring the present case, on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The application of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE">j<u>udicata</u></span> is at best not indubitable and the defense
should, if at all, be alleged in the answer and resolved after trial on the
merits, instead of by resolution of a simple motion to dismiss.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
More so, where as in the present case, one set of respondents (Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>) admit
petitioner's claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the foregoing reasons, we believe that the denial of herein
petitioner's Motion To Intervene in Civil Case No. 21048 is not <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> to his
present action.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards, however, the second issue, we rule in the affirmative
and against the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Sinaon</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Sorongon</span></u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that the petitioners therein having been registered owners of
the lot for more than forty (40) years and having possessed it during said
period, their title had become indefeasible and their possession could not be
disturbed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Any pretension as to the
existence of an implied trust should not be countenanced.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, O.C.T. No. 10 in the name of <span class="SpellE">Macario</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span> was issued in
1917, or almost sixty (60) years before the filing of the present
complaint.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even granting that an implied
or constructive trust was created in favor of <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span>
O.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Asuncion, petitioner's father, under
Article 1456 of the Civil Code, still an action to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
real property based upon a constructive or implied trust can be barred by
prescription.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner offers the document<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
wherein the Heirs of <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Oliveros</span>
(the other set of private respondents) acknowledge the claim of petitioner to
the 3.5 hectares of the property under dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the above cited <span class="SpellE"><u>Sinaon</u></span> case, which
involved substantially the same circumstances as in the present case, the Court
declared:</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">trustors</span>, who created the
alleged trust, died a long time ago.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An
attempt to prove the trust was made by unreliable oral evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The title and possession of the <span class="SpellE">Sinaons</span> cannot be defeated by oral evidence which can be
easily fabricated and contradicted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
contradictory oral evidence leaves the court sometimes bothered and bewildered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There was no express trust in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Express trusts concerning real property
cannot be proven by <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence (Art. 1443, Civil
Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An implied trust ‘cannot be
established, contrary to the recitals of a Torrens title, upon vague and
inconclusive proof’ (Suarez v. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
