				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>DAVIDE, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a sworn letter-complaint dated 11 September 1993, the complainant,
who was one of the defendants in Civil Case No. 2833-III of the Municipal Trial
Court in Cities (MTCC) of General Santos City, charged the respondent, the
presiding judge of Branch 3 thereof, with ignorance of law and bribery in that
the respondent (a) issued a writ of execution with respect to the restoration
of possession in the said case despite the fact that it was already on appeal
with Branch 36 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of General Santos City, and
(b) was rumored to have received P20,000.00 in connection with such execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his comment, the respondent admits that although he issued the
writ of execution after his court had lost jurisdiction over the case in view
of the perfection of the appeal, he did so only in compliance with the order of
the RTC directing his court to cause the execution of the judgment with respect
to the restoration of possession.  He
states that there is no truth whatsoever to the unsubstantiated rumor that he
received P20,000.  He avers that since
he assumed office in April 1972, he has not asked, demanded, or received any
amount from any party in a case before his court.</p>

<p class="BODY">He further alleges that Lily Mocles "is the complainant only
in name," and that she is merely "the stooge of her counsel" who
is the real complainant and who has an axe to grind against him.  He contends that the complainant's counsel
is guilty of forum shopping for also filing with the Office of the Deputy
Ombudsman for Mindanao a complaint against him for the violation of Articles
206 and 210 of the Revised Penal Code in connection with the issuance of the
writ of execution.  The respondent then
concludes that this complaint is a "wicked farcical and malicious
imputation which pained him gravely, physically and mentally," and prays
not only for its outright dismissal but also for appropriate action against the
complainant and her counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her Reply-Affidavit, the complainant asserts that the
respondent's admission of the issuance of the writ suggests "not only
clear ignorance of law but deliberate and wanton misapplication of the
law"; that her counsel, Atty. Rodolfo TaÂ­asan, a young practitioner from
Davao City, is noted for his integrity in the legal profession; and that the
charge that she is merely a stooge of her counsel is imaginary and gratuituous.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 June 1994, this Court received from the respondent a copy
of the resolution of the Office of the Deputy Ombudsman for Mindanao which
dismissed the complaint filed by the complainant on the ground that the
questioned writ of execution was regularly issued by the respondent pursuant to
Section 8, Rule 70 of the Rules of Court and that the alleged receipt by the
respondent of P20,000.00 was based on rumor and unsubstantiated by evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the issues had been joined, the Court required the parties
to inform it if they were willing to submit this case for decision on the basis
of the pleadings already filed.  They
expressed their willingness to do so in their separate manifestations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The uncontroverted facts as disclosed by the pleadings are as
follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Civil Case No. 2833-III was decided by the MTCC of General Santos
City (per respondent Judge) on 6 April 1993.  The respondent judge rendered a decision ordering the defendants to, <i style=""><span style="">inter
alia</span></i><span style="">,
</span>"vacate and surrender their respective possession and occupation in
the area in question to plaintiff including their respective improvements
therein within 10 days from notice," and to each pay the amounts indicated
therein as rentals in arrears as of 3 August 1992, and thereafter, from date of
demand on 3 September 1992, the amount of P75.00 a month as rental until they
vacate the premises.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> A
copy thereof was received by the complainant's counsel on 16 April 1993 and on
19 April 1993, the complainant filed a notice of appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the appeal, the respondent issued on 30 April 1993 an
order directing the branch clerk of court to transmit to the clerk of court of
the RTC of General Santos City "a certified copy of the docket entries
together with all the original papers and processes in the case."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
This order was complied with and the appealed case was docketed in the RTC as
Special Civil Case No. 364 and was assigned to Branch 36 thereof, presided over
by Judge Apolinario F. Estoque.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 May 1993, the plaintiff in Special Civil Case No. 364 filed
with the RTC a motion for the issuance of a writ of execution<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
on the ground that the defendants had failed to file the supersedeas bond and
to pay the adjudged monthly rentals and that, hence; pursuant to Section 8,
Rule 70 of the Rules of Court, the judgment had become executory.  The defendants opposed the motion<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
contending that only decisions of the RTC may be immediately executed pursuant
to Section 21 of the Revised Rules on Summary Procedure of 1991 and <span style="">that the </span>motion did not comply with Sections
4 and 5, Rule 15 of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his order of 11 August 1993<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> in
Special Civil Case No. 364, Judge Estoque found that the complainant and her
co-defendants did not file any supersedeas bond and did not pay the adjudged
monthly rentals and held that pursuant to Section 8 of Rule 70, immediate
execution of the judgment appealed from should have been ordered by the trial
court before the appeal was perfected.  He then decreed:</p>

<p class="2Q">"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing and this being an
appealed judgment, the MTCC, Branch 3, General Santos City that rendered said
judgment is ordered to cause the execution thereof with respect to the
restoration of possession only, without prejudice however to whatever will be
the result of the pending appeal.</p>

<p class="2Q">SO ORDERED."</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with the order of Judge Estoque, the respondent
judge issued the writ of execution on 23 August 1993.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 25 August 1993, a day after the receipt of a copy of the order
of Judge Estoque dated 11 August 1993, the complainant and her co-defendants
filed a motion for the reconsideration thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> Judge
Estoque then issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
directing the plaintiff-appellee to comment on the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 August 1993, Judge Estoque issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
directing the parties to submit their respective memoranda within fifteen days
from <span style="">notice, </span>after which the
appeal would be deemed submitted for decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 September 1993, Felizardo Requillos, Sheriff III of the
MTCC of General Santos City, filed a "Sheriff's Return of Service"<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
on the writ of execution stating therein the steps he took to implement the
writ and informing the court of the "total failure of the
implementation" because some of the defendants he approached refused to
vacate their respective houses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 21 September 1993, Judge Estoque issued an order<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
in Special Civil Case No. 364 suspending in the meantime, upon agreement of the
parties, the implementation of the writ of execution issued by the respondent
judge and giving the defendants three days from the said date within which to
deposit the supersedeas bond as well as to deposit the rentals in arrears from
the time of the judgment appealed from "up to the present";
otherwise, upon their failure to do so, the court "shall cause the full
implementation of the order of execution issued by this court." Judge
Estoque also declared as moot and academic the motion for reconsideration of
the order of 11 August 1993 and the motion for preliminary injunction and
restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Court Administrator (OCA), to which this case
was referred for evaluation and report, found that the respondent erred in
issuing the writ of execution because his court had lost its jurisdiction over
the case.  It states that it should have
been the RTC which should issue such writ pursuant to <i>City of Manila vs.
Court of Appeals</i><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>and <i style="">Sy vs. </i><i style=""><span style="">Romero<span style="">.</span></span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>Nevertheless, it is of the opinion
that the respondent should not be blamed solely since it was Judge Estoque who
ordered the MTCC to issue the writ.  Since Judge Estoque is not a respondent in this complaint, the OCA
concludes that it would be "unfair" if it recommends that the
respondent judge "be penalized without Judge Estoque being likewise
penalized." It also found that there is no evidence to support the charge
of bribery.  It then recommends that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">"(a) </span>Judge
Mabini M. Maravilla be ADVISED not to repeat his mistake of issuing a writ of
execution in a case which is pending appeal, even if erroneously ordered by the
RTC judge acting as an appellate judge in such a case, as a repetition of
similar acts will be dealt with more severely; (b) Judge Apolinario F. Estoque
be FURNISHED a copy of the Court's Resolution in this case and be likewise
ADVISED not to order the municipal trial court to issue a writ of execution in
a case which is pending appeal and to issue the writ himself, if the
circumstances warrant its issuance; and (c) the charge that Judge Maravilla
received P20,000.00 from issuing the writ be DISMISSED for lack of evidence to
support such a charge."</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the OCA that there is no evidence of the alleged
bribery.  The complainant herself states
in her complaint that her charge is based on a rumor.  She did not even disclose the source of the rumor and the
occasion, place, and time when she heard it.  Instead of subsequently establishing the truth of the rumor by
volunteering to offer some evidence, the complainant agreed to submit this case
on the basis of the pleadings.  Rumors
are not evidence and the complainant was grossly irresponsible when she imputed
upon the respondent, under her solemn oath, the commission of a grave offense
solely on the basis of a rumor with the full awareness that she could not prove
it.  The lawyer who assisted her in the
preparation of the complaint should have, under his oath as a lawyer, prevented
her from making the wild accusation.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, the respondent judge must be administratively sanctioned
for issuing the writ of execution.  His
court had lost its jurisdiction over Civil Case No. 2833-III after the appeal
to the RTC had been perfected.  He knew
that on 30 April 1993 he had directed his clerk of court to transmit the
records of the case to the RTC, which was duly complied with.  The plaintiff did not file in his court a
motion for execution for failure of the defendants to file a supersedeas
bond.  That motion was filed only with
the RTC.  Since, indeed, no supersedeas
bond was filed and, furthermore, the defendant did not deposit the adjudged
monthly rentals, execution of the judgment with respect to the restoration of
possession was in order pursuant to Section 8, Rule 70 of the Rules of
Court.  It is the RTC which should issue
the writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 8 of Rule 70 is a reproduction of Section 8 of Rule 72 of
the old Rules of Court, which was taken from Section 88 of Act No. 190, as
amended by Act No. 2588.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> In
1918 yet, this Court, applying Act No. 2588,<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
already held that upon failure of the defendant in an unlawful detainer case to
make the payments prescribed from time to time during the pendency of the
appeal in the Court of First Instance, the latter, upon motion, shall order the
execution of the judgment of the court <i style=""><span style="">a quo</span></i><span style=""> </span>relative to the possession of the
property in litigation and that such order for execution shall not be a bar to
the appeal in the Court of First Instance until final decision thereof on its
merits.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the 1991 case of <i>City of Manila vs. Court of Appeals,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court ruled:</p>

<p class="2Q">"The rule is that if the judgment of the metropolitan trial court
is appealed to the regional trial court and the decision of the latter itself
is elevated to the Court of Appeals, whose decision thereafter became final,
the case should be remanded through the regional trial court to the
metropolitan trial court for execution.  <u>The</u> <u>only</u> <u>exception</u> <u>is</u> <u>the</u> <u>execution</u>
<u>pending</u> <u>appeal,</u> <u>which</u> <u>can</u> <u>be</u> <u>issued</u> <u>by</u>
<u>the</u> <u>regional</u> <u>trial</u> <u>court</u> under Sec. 8 of Rule 70 or
the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court under Sec. 10 of the same Rule."</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the RTC was the proper court which could issue the
writ of execution in its Special Civil Case No. 364 -- the appealed case.  Said court, per Judge Estoque, should not
have issued the 11 August 1993 order directing the MTCC to issue the writ of
execution with respect to the restoration of possession.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>Obedience</u> to or "faithful compliance with" the
said 11 August 1993 order of Judge Estoque cannot be pleaded as a justification
to the respondent's issuance of the writ of execution.  He knew that <span style="">his </span>court had lost jurisdiction over the case and, moreover, he
ought to have known that pursuant to the clear language of Section 8 of Rule 70
and the pronouncements of this Court, it was beyond his court's authority to
issue the writ.  He should have informed
the RTC, through appropriate means, of this constraint.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, however, that no damage was done to the defendants
because the writ was returned unsatisfied and in the meantime, during the
pendency of the defendant's motion to reconsider the RTC order of 11 August
1993, the RTC had issued on 21 September 1993, upon agreement by the parties,
an order suspending the implementation of the writ of execution issued by the
respondent; giving the defendants-appellants three days from 21 September 1993
within which to deposit the supersedeas bond and to deposit the rentals in
arrears from the date of the judgment of the MTCC up "to the
present"; ordering them to pay their corresponding monthly rentals of
P75.00 each which should be deposited within the first ten days of the month
during the pendency of the appeal; and declaring as moot and academic the
motion to reconsider the 11 August 1993 order and the motion for preliminary
injunction and restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the absence of any damage to the complainant does
not totally absolve the respondent from any administrative liability for having
wrongfully issued the writ of execution, which amounted to grave abuse of
authority if not ignorance of the rule on execution in ejectment cases.  A mere advice to the respondent not to
repeat the act is not enough.  A fine of
P1,000.00 and a warning would be in order.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered:</p>

<blockquote>1.  DISMISSING, for utter lack of merit, the
charge of bribery against the respondent; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  IMPOSING upon respondent Judge Mabini M.
Maravilla a FINE of One Thousand Pesos (P1,000.00) for grave abuse <span style="">of </span>authority,
with a warning that a subsequent commission of the same or similar acts will be
dealt with <span style="">more
</span>severely.</blockquote>
