Branch 48 of the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of Pampanga and granting private
respondent's motion therein for the issuance of a writ of preliminary

7 February 1988 and addressed to the Commissioner of Customs, one Butch
Martinez informed the former of <span style="">the </span>existence
of both "assembled and disassembled"<span style=""> </span>knocked-down vehicles, particularly Toyota Lite Aces, at the
compound of CVC Trading, which is owned by a certain Mr. Castro and located at
St. Jude Avenue, St. Jude Village, San Fernando, Pampanga.  Martinez requested for an immediate
investigation thereon and prosecution for the violation of customs laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis thereof, Gen. Benjamin C. Cruz, Acting Director of
the National Customs Police, formed a team composed of National Customs Police
(NCP) and Customs Intelligence and Investigation Division (CIID) members,
issuing to the same a Mission Order<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> on 11
February 1988.  The team proceeded to
San Fernando, Pampanga on the same day, giving due notice of their presence to
the PC Region III Command and the PC-INP Station at San Fernando, Pampanga.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arrival at the place pinpointed by Mr. Martinez at around
11:00 p.m., the team found a fenced area containing twenty (20) units of fully
and partly assembled Toyota Lite Ace vans.  It immediately took possession and control of the motor vehicles by
cordoning off the enclosure.  Thereafter, at about 11:30 p.m., two (2) members of the team were
designated to secure a warrant of seizure and detention from the Collector of
Customs of the Subport of Clark,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
herein petitioner Carlos L. Razo.  The
latter instituted seizure proceedings against the abovementioned vehicles
(Seizure Identification No. CAB-01-88), entitled "Republic of the
Philippines versus Twenty (20) units Toyota Lite-Ace, CVC Trading St. Jude
Ave., Dolores Homesite, San Fernando, Pampanga, OWNER/CLAIMANT", for the
violation of "Section 2530 (f) and (1)-1 &amp; 5" of the Tariff and
Customs Code, in relation to Central Bank regulations.  Accordingly, at <span style="">about </span>8:00 a.m. on 12 February 1988, he issued a Warrant of <span style="">Seizure </span>and Detention.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Since receipt of the warrant was refused by the owner/claimant or
any of his representatives, the same was served by substituted service through
the posting of a copy thereof on one of the subject motor vehicles found near
the gate of the stockyard.  An inventory
of the vehicles was conducted and a copy thereof was attached to the return of
the warrant made to the issuing authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">At about 11:00 a.m. on 12 February 1988, when the team was about
to haul the motor vehicles away, two (2) Regional Trial Court sheriffs arrived
with a temporary restraining order issued on that date by the respondent Judge,
as Executive Judge of the Regional Trial Court of San Fernando, Pampanga; the
order was issued <span style="">in </span>connection
with Civil Case No. 8109, entitled "Sonny Carlos, plaintiff, versus Bureau
of Customs and/or Customs Police, defendant," for Damages with Prayer for
Preliminary Injunction and Restraining Order.  The plaintiff in the said case is the private respondent in this
petition.  The order restrained the
Bureau of Customs and/or Customs Police from seizing or confiscating the
vehicles until further ordered, and directed the defendants to attend the
raffle of the case on 26 February 1988 at 9:00 o'clock in the morning and show
cause why a writ of preliminary injunction should not be issued against
them.  It further required plaintiff to
submit within twenty four (24) hours from that date the list of vehicles in
question and "not to dispose any (sic) of them pending further order of
the court."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In his Complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a> in
the above-entitled case, private respondent alleges that he is the owner of
several vehicles which are legally registered in his name and that he has paid
all the taxes and "corresponding licenses" therefor; he further avers
that elements of the defendant Bureau of Customs and/or Customs Police have
surrounded his residence threatening to take possession of the vehicles.  He finally prays that the latter be enjoined
from doing so and that they be ordered to pay damages in the sum of P50,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of the restraining order, the physical transfer of the
vehicles was deferred; however, elements of the National Customs Police and the
PC Regional Command remained deployed in the area to assert possession and
control over the seized motor vehicles by the Bureau of Customs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 February 1988, lawyers of the Bureau of Customs filed a
Motion to Dismiss<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Civil <span style="">Case </span>No. 8109 alleging
therein (a) the lack of jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Court over the
subject vehicles in view of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs over seizure and forfeiture cases, and (b) the failure of the plaintiff
to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 February 1988, the private respondent filed an
Opposition/Comment on the Motion to Dismiss<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
alleging, among others, that the Warrant of Seizure and Detention did not
comply with the requirements for a valid search warrant under the Constitution,
and that taxes for the vehicles have been paid to the Bureau of Internal
Revenue (BIR).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Motion to Dismiss was heard on 19 February 1988 by the
respondent Judge, to whose branch the case, was raffled off.  After said hearing, the private respondent's
motion and application for preliminary injunction were deemed submitted for
resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 February 1988, private respondent filed an Amended
Complaint<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
changing his name from "Sonny Carlos" to "CESAR SONNY
CARLOS" and naming as defendants, in place of the "BUREAU OF CUSTOMS
AND/OR CUSTOMS POLICE", "ATTY. CARLOS L. RAZO, in his capacity as
Collector of Customs; LOUIE ROMERO, BILLY BIBIT, their authorized deputies and
JOHN DOES." In this Amended Complaint, private respondent assails the
subject warrant for being patently "illegal and fatally defective"
and void of any virtue; reiterates his willingness to post a bond "in an
amount the Court may fix conditioned upon the damages that the defendants may
suffer as a consequence of the issuance of the injunction;" and asks for
P500,000.00 as actual damages, P100,000.00 as exemplary and corrective damages,
P50,000.00 as moral damages and P50,000.00 as attorney's fees.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the hearing of Seizure Identification No. CAB-01-88
was set for 18 and 19 February 1988, per Notice of Hearing dated 15 February
1988 and issued by petitioner Collector of Customs.  Since the owner/claimant CVC Trading refused to accept a copy of
the said notice, a follow-up notice of hearing was transmitted to it thru a
telegram; the latter replied also by telegram,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

<blockquote>Moreover elementary due process requires service of documents

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on 18 February 1988, Attys. Napoleon Gatmaitan and
Conrado Unlayao, CIID, Bureau of Customs, appeared for the Government.  No appearance was entered for the
owner/claimant.  Thus, the Government
was allowed to present evidence <i>ex-parte</i>.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 February 1988, petitioner Collector of Customs rendered a

<p class="BODY">Hence, this petition which We find to be meritorious.  It should be granted.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The court <i><span style="">a quo </span></i>has
no jurisdiction over the <i><span style="">res </span></i>subject
of the warrant of seizure and detention.  The respondent Judge, therefore, acted arbitrarily and despotically in
issuing the temporary restraining order, granting the writ of preliminary
injunction and denying the motion to <span style="">dismiss,
</span>thereby removing the <i><span style="">res</span></i><span style=""> from </span>the control of the Collector of
Customs and depriving him of his exclusive original jurisdiction over the
controversy.  Respondent Judge exercised
a power he never had and encroached upon the exclusive original jurisdiction of
the Collector of Customs.  By express
provision of law, amply supported by well-settled jurisprudence, the Collector
of Customs has exclusive jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture proceedings
and regular courts cannot interfere with his exercise thereof or stifle or put
it to naught.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the 1966 case of <i><span style="">Pacis
vs. </span>Averia</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> this
Court, speaking through Mr. <span style="">Justice </span>J.P.
Bengzon, held that:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Tariff and Customs Code, in Section 2530 thereof, lists
the kinds of property subject to forfeiture.  At the same time, <span style="">in</span> Part
2 of Title VI thereof, it provides for the procedure in seizure and forfeiture
cases and vests in the Collector of Customs the authority to hear and decide
said cases.  [Section 2312, R.A. 1937]
The Collector's decision is appealable to the Commissioner of Customs [Section
2313, R.A. 1937] whose decision <span style="">is </span>in
turn appealable to the Court of Tax Appeals.  [Section 2402, R.A. 1937; Sections 7 and 11, R.A. 1125].  An aggrieved party may appeal from a
judgment of the Court of Tax Appeals directly to this Court [Section 18, R.A.
1125; Rule 44, Rules of Court].  On the
other hand, Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 [As amended by R.A.
3828] lodges in the Court of First Instance original jurisdiction in all cases
in which the value of the property in controversy amounts to more than ten
thousand pesos.  This original
jurisdiction of the Court of First Instance, when exercised in an action for
recovery of personal property which is a subject of a forfeiture proceeding in
the Bureau of Customs, tends to encroach upon, and to render futile, the
jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs in seizure and forfeiture
proceedings.  This is precisely what
took place in this case.  The seizure
and forfeiture proceedings against the M/B 'Bukang Liwayway' before the
Collector of Customs of Manila, was stifled by the issuance of a writ of
replevin by the Court of First Instance of Cavite.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Should Section 44(c) of the Judiciary Act of 1948 give way to the
provisions of the Tariff and Customs Code, or vice versa?  In Our <span style="">opinion,
</span>in this particular case, the Court of First <span style="">Instance </span>should yield to the jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs.  The jurisdiction of the
Collector of Customs is provided for in Republic Act 1937 which took effect on
July 1, 1957, much later than the Judiciary Act of 1948.  It is axiomatic that a later law prevails
over a prior statute [Herman v. Radio Corporation of the Philippines, 50 Phil.
490; Pampanga Sugar Mills v. Trinidad, 279 U.S. 211, 73 L. ed. 665].  Moreover, on grounds of public policy, it is
more reasonable to conclude that the legislators intended to divest the Court
of First Instance of the prerogative to replevin <span style="">a </span>property which is a subject of a seizure and forfeiture
proceedings for violation of the Tariff and ‘Customs Code.  Otherwise, actions for forfeiture of
property for violation of Customs <span style="">laws </span>could
easily be undermined by the simple device of replevin.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code requires
the Collector of Customs to give to the owner of the property sought to be
forfeited written notice of the seizure and to give him the opportunity to be
heard in his defense.  This provision
clearly indicates the intention of the law to confine in the Bureau of Customs
the determination of all questions affecting the disposal of property proceeded
against in a seizure and forfeiture case.  The judicial recourse of the property owner is not in the Court of First
Instance but in the Court of Tax Appeals, and <span style="">only </span>after exhausting administrative remedies in the Bureau of
Customs."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span><i>De Joya vs.
Lantin</i>,<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">this Court, speaking again through Mr.
Justice J.P. Bengzon, declared:</span></p>

<blockquote>"The goods in question are imported articles entered at the
Port of Cebu.  Should they be found to
have been released irregularly from Customs custody in Cebu City, they are
subject to seizure and forfeiture, the proceedings for which comes within the
jurisdiction of the Bureau of Customs pursuant to Republic Act 1937.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Said proceedings should be followed; the owner of the goods may set
up defenses therein (Pacis <span style="">vs. </span>Averia,
L-22526, Nov. 29, 1966).  From the
decision of the Commissioner of Customs appeal lies to the Court of Tax
Appeals, as provided in Sec. 2402 of Republic Act 1937 and Sec. 11 of Republic
Act 1125.  To permit recourse to the
Court of First Instance in cases of seizure of imported goods would in effect
render ineffective the power of the Customs authorities under the Tariff Code
and deprive the Court of Tax Appeals of one of its <span style="">exclusive appellate jurisdiction.  As this Court has ruled in Pacis </span><span style="">vs. </span><span style="">Averia, </span><i><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">, </span><span style="">Republic </span>Acts
1937 and 1125 vest jurisdiction over seizure and forfeiture proceedings
exclusively upon the Bureau of Customs and the Court of Tax Appeals.  Such law being special in nature, while the
Judiciary Act defining the jurisdiction of Courts of First Instance is a
general legislation, not to mention that the former are later enactments, the
Court of First Instance should yield to the jurisdiction of the Customs
authorities."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The language of the foregoing rule is simple, clear and <span style="">leaves </span>no doubt as to the Regional
Trial Court's lack of<span style=""> </span>jurisdiction
over the <i>r</i><i><span style="">es</span></i><span style=""> </span>which has already been made the
subject of seizure and forfeiture proceedings.  Frankly, this Court <span style="">is </span>unable
to understand why the respondent Judge misread the same; perhaps, he simply
chose to <span style="">ignore </span>it.  At any rate, such behavior is highly
condemnable.</p>

<p class="BODY">A warrant of seizure and detention having already been issued,
presumably in the regular course of official duty,<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
the Regional <span style="">Trial </span>Court of <span style="">Pampanga </span>was indisputably precluded
from interfering in the said proceedings.  That <span style="">in </span>his complaint in
Civil Case No. 8109 private respondent <span style="">alleges
ownership over </span>several vehicles <span style="">which
</span>are legally registered <span style="">in his </span>name,
having paid all the taxes and corresponding licenses incident thereto, neither
divests the Collector of Customs of such jurisdiction nor confers upon the said
trial court regular jurisdiction over the case.  Ownership of goods or the legality <span style="">of </span>its acquisition can be raised as defenses in a seizure
proceeding;<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
if this were not so, the procedure carefully delineated by law for seizure and
forfeiture cases may easily be thwarted and set to naught<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
by scheming parties.  Even the
illegality of the warrant <span style="">of </span><span style="">seizure </span>and detention cannot justify
the trial court's interference with <span style="">the
</span>Collector's jurisdiction.  In the
first place, <span style="">there </span>is a <span style="">distinction </span>between the existence of
the Collector's power to issue it and the regularity <span style="">of </span>the proceeding taken under such power.  In the second place, even if there be such
an irregularity in the latter, the Regional Trial Court does not have the
competence to review, modify or reverse whatever conclusions may result
therefrom.  In <i><span style="">Ponce Enrile vs. Vinuya</span></i><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>this Court had the occasion to state:</p>

<blockquote>"2.  Respondents, however, notwithstanding the
compelling force of the above doctrines, would assert that respondent Judge
could entertain the replevin suit as the seizure is illegal, allegedly because
the warrant issued is invalid and the seizing officer likewise was devoid of
authority.  This is to lose sight of the
distinction, as earlier made mention of, between the existence of the power and
the regularity of the proceeding taken under it.  The governmental agency concerned, the Bureau of Customs, is
vested with exclusive authority.  Even
if it be assumed that in the exercise of such exclusive competence <span style="">a </span>taint of illegality may be correctly
imputed, the most that can be said is that under certain circumstances the
grave abuse of discretion conferred may oust it of such jurisdiction.  It does not mean however that
correspondingly a court of first instance is vested with competence when
clearly in the light of the above decisions the law has not seen fit to do
so.  The proceeding before the Collector
of Customs is not final.  An appeal lies
to the Commissioner of Customs and thereafter to the Court of Tax Appeals.  It may even reach this Court through the appropriate
petition for review.  The proper
ventilation of the legal issues raised is thus indicated.  Certainly a court of first instance is not
therein included.  It is devoid of
jurisdiction."</blockquote>
