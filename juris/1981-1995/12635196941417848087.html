				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Two constitutional rights – speedy trial and freedom from double
jeopardy – are interposed as defenses by the accused in this petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner asks us to review and annul the orders of the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, Branch V, which
dismissed the criminal cases against accused <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Jardin</span> because his constitutional right to speedy
trial was allegedly violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">The criminal prosecutions originated from a letter-complaint of
the Provincial Auditor of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> requesting the
Provincial Fiscal to file the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">necess</span>ary
criminal action under Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code against <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardin</span> for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> of public funds thru falsification of public
documents on six counts.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cases were assigned to Assistant Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>
V. Angeles who set them for preliminary investigation. The accused moved to
postpone the preliminary investigation twice. On the third time that the
investigation was re-set, the accused and his counsel failed to appear.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the fourth resetting, the accused and his counsel again failed
to appear. In spite of their absence, the preliminary investigation was
conducted and shortly afterwards, six <span class="SpellE">informations</span>
were filed against the accused before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>, Branch II, docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. 16052
(0043-M), 16053 (0044-M), 16054 (0045-M), 16055 (0046-M), 16056 (0047-M), and
16057 (0048-M). The arraignment was set for <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1967</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that from <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="5">May
 9, 1967</st1:date>, the arraignment was <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">re-set </span>for June 6; then re-set for June 26; then from August 16,
the same was re-set for September 5, all because of the motions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">for </span>postponement filed at the instance
of the accused. <span class="GramE">(Original records [0043-M] pp. 54, 61, 66 and
69).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">When the arraignment of the accused was called on <st1:date year="1967" day="5" month="9">September 5, 1967</st1:date>, counsel for the
accused verbally moved for reinvestigation on the ground that the accused was
not given the opportunity to present his defense during the preliminary
investigation. This was granted by the court and the first rein­vestigation was
set on <st1:date year="1967" day="24" month="11">November 24, 1967</st1:date>. On
this date, however, the Investigating Fiscal <span class="SpellE">motu</span> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span> postponed said reinvestigation due to the non-­appearance
of accused and his counsel and re-set the date for <st1:date year="1967" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1967</st1:date>.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A series of postponements was again filed by the accused causing
further delays of the reinvestigation. On <st1:date year="1968" day="27" month="6">June 27, 1968</st1:date>, accused and his counsel appeared together
but requested for a period of fifteen (15) days within which to file a memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the expiration of the 15-day period, the investigating
Fiscal filed a manifestation before the court that the records of these cases
he returned and the trial on the merits of the same be set.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court without acting on said manifestation, issued an order
transferring the six (6) cases to the new branch (Branch V) of the Court of
First Instance at <span class="SpellE">Mauban</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>.
Upon receipt by the latter of the records of these cases, the arraignment and
trial were set for <st1:date year="1968" day="3" month="12">December 3, 1968</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the latter date, the
counsel for the accused sought again the postponement of the arraign­ment and
this was followed by more postponements, all at the instance of the accused. <span class="GramE">(Original records, [0043-M], pp. 90, 93, 120 and 125).</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

the accused moved for the postponement of the arraignment and requested the
court that the records <span class="GramE">be</span> returned again to the Office

failed to appear and thus, the said reinvestigation was re-set for </span><st1:date year="1969" day="2" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June 2,
 1969</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">. On this date,
counsel for accused requested that he be given five (5) days within which to
file a written sworn statement of the accused which would <span class="GramE">constitute
the defense</span> of the latter, subject to the cross-examination of the
Investigating Fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Considering the fact that
the period to file such sworn statement had already expired without anything
being filed, the records of the cases were returned to the court which set said
cases for arraignment and trial on September 2, 1970. On this date, the accused
again moved for postponement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

said criminal cases were called for hearing, no one appeared for the
prosecution, except a state witness, Mr. Cesar <span class="SpellE">Alcala</span>
of the Provincial Auditor's office who remained silent during the proceedings.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Invoking his client's
constitutional right to speedy trial and seizing the opportunity to take
advantage of the prosecution's failure to appear on that day, the defense
counsel moved for the dismissal of the cases. The respondent court granted the
oral motion for dismissal "for reasons of constitutional rights of the
accused <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span> <span class="SpellE">Jardin</span>."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Two questions are now
raised by the People in this appeal:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Considering
the factual setting in the criminal cases at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">bar, was the </span>respondent Court correct in dismissing the cases and
in predicating the dismissal on the right of the defendant to a speedy trial?</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">II.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
Does the present appeal place the respondent accused in double jeopardy?</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court committed a grave abuse of discretion in dismissing
the cases and in basing the dismissal on the constitutional right of the
accused to speedy trial. The right to a speedy trial means that the accused is
free from vexatious, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">capricious, and </span>oppressive
delays, its salutary objective being to assure that an innocent person may be
free <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">from
anxiety </span>and expense of a court litigation or, if otherwise, of having
his guilt determined within the shortest possible time compatible with the
presentation and consideration of whatever legitimate defense he may interpose.
(See Andres v. <span class="SpellE">Cacdac</span>, 113 SCRA 216)</p>

<p class="BODY">From a perusal of the facts, it is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">readily </span>seen that all the delays in the prosecution of the cases
were caused by the accused himself. All the postponements of proceedings were
made at his instance and for his behalf. Hence, the constitutional right to a
speedy trial afforded to an accused by our Constitution cannot be invoked. From
the start of the preliminary investigation of the cases up to the trial on the
merits, the accused always managed to delay the proceedings through
postponements and requests for reinvestigation. It would, therefore, be a
mockery of the criminal justice system if the accused would be allowed to
benefit from his own wrongdoings or tactical maneuvers intended to frustrate
the administration of justice. By his own deliberate acts, he is deemed to have
waived or abandoned his right to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>speedy
trial. In the case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Andres v. </span><span class="SpellE">Cacdac</span></u>, 113 SCRA 216, we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"In this case, however, there was a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">waiver </span>or abandonment of the right to a
speedy trial in the first case when the herein petitioners sought and obtained
several postponements of the trial: first, when they asked for the deferment of
the arraignment because the accused <span class="SpellE">Ladislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Tacipit</span> was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">present;
second, when they asked for the postponement of the trial for March 5, 1968
upon the ground that they have requested the Provincial Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> for a reinvestigation of the ease; and finally,
when they agreed, with the prosecution, to postpone the hearing set for November
28, 1968 to January 4, 1969."<span class="GramE">x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of the criminal cases against the accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">by </span>the respondent court on the ground
that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his </span>right to speedy<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span> trial had been violated was devoid
of factual and legal basis. The order denying the motion for reconsideration is
similarly in firm. There being no basis<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">
</span>for the questioned orders, they are consequently null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Would a reinstatement of the dismissed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">cases place </span>the accused in double jeopardy?</p>

<p class="BODY">In order that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">protection
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">against </span>double jeopardy
may inure to the benefit of an accused, the following requisites must be
present in the first prosecution: (a) <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>valid complaint or information; (b) a competent court;<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>(c) the defendant had pleaded to the
charge; and (d) the defendant was acquitted, or convicted, or the case against
him was dismissed or otherwise terminated without his express consent. <span class="GramE">(Rule 117, Section 9, Rules of Court; People v. <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>,
73 SCRA 77).</span> The last requisite assumes a valid acquittal presupposes a
valid judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction. Since in the instant
cases, the dismissal was void for having been issued without legal basis, it
follows that the acquittal brought about by the dismissal is also void. Hence,
no jeopardy can attach from such acquittal. The act of respondent judge in
dismissing the cases amounted to lack of jurisdiction which would prevent
double jeopardy from attaching. In the case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">People v. Court of Appeals</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>(101, SCRA 450) we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"Private respondents further argue that a judgment of
acquittal ends the case which cannot be appealed nor reopened, otherwise, they
would be put twice <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">in </span>jeopardy
for the same offense. That <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>the
general rule and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">presupposes a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">valid </span>judgment.
As earlier pointed out, however, respondent Courts' Resolution of acquittal was
a void judgment for having been issued<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">without jurisdiction. No double jeopardy
attaches, therefore. A void judgment is, in legal effect, no judgment at all. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">(<span class="SpellE">Comia</span>

<p class="BODY">We also note that the dismissal of the criminal cases was upon
motion and with the express consent of respondent <span class="SpellE">Demetrio</span>

<p class="BODY">If the accused had been denied his right to speedy trial or if

proceedings. In the instant case, however, the defendant had deliberately used
all the available dilatory tactics he could utilize and abused the principle
that the accused must be given every opportunity to disprove the criminal
charge. The doctrine of double jeopardy was never intended for this purpose.</p>
