the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, conspiring,

<p class="BODY">After weighing the evidence respectively adduced by the
prosecution and the defense, the trial court acquitted accused Armando
Villanueva, declaring that "no evidence of conspiracy was sufficiently
shown." The court <i>a quo</i> likewise found that no sufficient evidence
had been adduced to link accused Armando Villanueva to the treacherous act of
his brother, Rogino, considering that the former did nothing except to run away
after the latter's commission of the crime.  However, accused Rogino Villanueva was found guilty beyond reasonable
doubt of the crime of murder, and the fate of both accused was accordingly
adjudged as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the Court finds the accused Rogino Villanueva
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of murder as defined in Art. 248 of
the Revised Penal Code with the qualifying circumstances of treachery and use
of superior strength, and is sentenced to suffer the penalty of reclusion
perpetua, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased Joselito Itona in the amount
of Thirty Thousand Pesos (P30,000.00) without subsidiary imprisonment in case
of insolvency and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused Armando Villanueva is ACQUITTED."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">From the People's brief, we quote the pertinent operative facts
of this case which were established by the prosecution's evidence, cited
therein by way of documentation, and which we have verified from the
transcripts of the notes of the proceedings:</p>

<blockquote>"At around six thirty (6:30) in the evening of November 15,
1986, Venancio Tabobo and Joselito Itona were talking in front of the latter's
house at Sitio Mabua, Cauayan, Negros Oriental (tsn, November 5, 1987, pp.
5-6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At around the same time, the brothers Rogino and Armando
Villanueva, who had been drinking tuba at Armando's house since 9:00 A.M. of
the same day, were seen by Ismael Banson walking toward the house of Joselito
Itona (tsn, December 17, 1987, pp. 3-5, 5-6).  At a certain distance from Joselito's house, Armando Villanueva stayed
behind while Rogino Villanueva continued walking towards the spot where
Joselito Itona and Venancio Tabobo were talking (tsn, December 17, 1987, p.
6).  Ismael Banson noticed that Rogino
was carrying a ‘pugakhang’ or home-made gun in his armpit (Ibid, p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">. </span>7).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Rogino Villanueva suddenly appeared from behind Joselito's
house and he shot Joselito once with a homemade shotgun hitting him in the back
(tsn, November 6, 1987, pp. 6-8; December 17, 1987, p. 7; April 20, 1988, pp.
8-9).  Upon firing the shot, Rogino ran
away together with Armando (tsn, November 6, 1987, p. 8).  Venancio Tabobo chased Rogino but was not
able to catch up with him (Ibid, pp. 18-19).  Meanwhile, Ismael Banson approached Joselito, and upon seeing the latter
sprawled on the ground with his back covered with blood, Ismael lifted him with
the help of Joselito's father (tsn, December 17, 1987, pp. 17-18).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The following day, Dr. Raymundo Guerrero, medical office(r)
of Cauayan, Negros Oriental, conducted an examination of the body of Joselito
and concluded that the bod(ily) injuries caused by the shotgun bullets were so
serious that they caused the immediate death of Joselito (tsn, April 20, 1988,
pp. 9-10).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Also the following day, members of the CHDF arrested Armando
Villanueva while Rogino was arrested on November 19, 1986."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Appellant Rogino Villanueva interposed the defense of alibi.  He claimed that he used to climb coconut
trees almost everyday, being a tuba gatherer by occupation.  He testified that he was gathering tuba at
Cambugsoc, Cauayan, Negros Occidental, two kilometers away from the place of
the incident.  He further contended that
the nature of his work required him to climb the coconut trees from 7:00 A.M.
up to around 12:00 noon and, in the afternoon, he again started climbing the
coconut trees at 2:00 P.M. up to 6:30 P.M.  He had to do this almost everyday, including Sundays, otherwise, his absence
of one or more days would cause his tuba to turn sour and it would not be good
for drinking.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court rejected appellant's defense and opined that
"(i)n the present case, no clear, positive and convincing evidence was
presented by the defense to show that the accused were not at the scene of the
incident when the said incident happened.  They relied on their mere assertions that they were somewhere
else." It then sustained "the unimpeached testimonies of the two (2)
prosecution witnesses that the accused Rogino Villanueva and Armando Villanueva
were present at Sitio Mabua, Barangay Poblacion, Cauayan, Negros Occidental, at
around 6:30 o'clock in the evening and that while there, the accused Rogino
Villanueva treacherously shot Joselito Itona y Nonato at the back with a
home-made shotgun (pugakhang) causing his death."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

accordingly concluded that, from the evidence on record, <i>alevosia</i> and
abuse of superior strength were employed in the commission of the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before us, appellant raises a lone and general assignment of
error faulting the lower court's finding that his guilt for the crime of murder
had been proved beyond reasonable doubt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant merely reiterated the defense of alibi in his brief,
arguing that "it would be impossible for the accused?appellant to be
present at Sitio Bonbon at around 6:30 in the evening when the shooting
incident happened, when at this point of time, he was about to finish or had
just finished gathering his tuba to be delivered to his employer at Cambugsoc,
Cauayan, Negros Occidental."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful assessment of all the evidence on record, we hold
that the foregoing pretensions of appellant do not deserve serious
consideration and do not warrant a reversal of the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The disposition of his appeal basically hinges on the findings of
fact of the court <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a quo</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">.  </span>Corollarily,
we have consistently held that the findings of the trial court as to
credibility of the witnesses are to be given weight and a high degree of
respect by the appellate court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Unless there is a showing that the trial court had overlooked, misunderstood or
misapplied some fact or circumstance of weight and substance that would have
affected the result of the case, the appellate court will not disturb the
factual findings of the lower court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant invokes the discredited defense of alibi.  It is his claim that at the time the crime
was committed, he was gathering tuba in another place two kilometers away from
Sitio Mabua, Cauayan, the place where Joselito Itona was killed.  To establish alibi as a defense, however, it
must be shown that it was impossible for the accused to have been at the place
where the crime was committed.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Likewise, the defense of alibi may not be successfully invoked where the
identity of the assailant has been established by the witness.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Against the foregoing doctrinal criteria, appellant's alibi
cannot possibly be given any weight.  No
clear, positive and convincing evidence was presented to show that appellant
was not at the place where the shooting incident happened.  The defense merely relied on the denials of
appellant without presenting any other evidence to corroborate or substantiate
his disclaimer.  Yet, the rule is that
no less than the clearest proof is required to establish the defense of alibi.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, the identities of appellant and his co-accused were
established beyond question b<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">y </span>the
prosecution witnesses.  As correctly
held by the court below, "(a)gainst these denials of the accused were the
positive testimonies of the prosecution witnesses Venancio Tabobo and Ismael
Banson who identified them with certainty.  In fact, prosecution witness Venancio Tabobo chased the accused after
one of them fired a shot at Joselito Itona in order to be certain who they
really were.  (TSN, Page 19, Nov. 6,
1987).  Said witness could not have been
wrong in identifying both accused since he had known them for a long time.  (TSN, pp. 4-5, Nov. 6, 1987).  Besides, the victim was shot at close range
(TSN, p. 7, Nov. 7, 1989) and the witness was sitting near the victim at the
time of the shooting.  (TSN, p. 7, Nov.
7, 1987)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant claims that the trial court erred in finding him guilty
of murder.  On the basis of the facts
and evidence of record, this Court, like the court below, rules that the
killing was attended by treachery, hence the crime committed was definitely
murder.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that for treachery to be appreciated, there must be
proof that at the time of the attack, the victim was not in a position to
defend himself and that the offender consciously and deliberately adopted the
particular means, method or form of attack which he employed to ensure the
accomplishment of his purpose with impunity.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the killing was clearly committed in a
treacherous manner.  The victim,
Joselito Itona, was completely taken by surprise.  Appellant, armed with a home-made shotgun, came from behind the
house of Joselito and, at close range, suddenly shot the victim at the back
causing his instantaneous death.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is treachery when a victim is attacked by an accused
without warning and with his back turned to his assailant, or when the attack
is sudden and unexpected and without the slightest provocation on the part of
the victim, or is sudden and unexpected that the victim was unable to defend
himself, thus insuring the execution of the criminal act without risk to the
assailant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, the lower court erred in appreciating the aggravating
circumstance of abuse of superior strength.  As held in a long line of cases up to the present,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>the circumstance of abuse of superior
strength is properly deemed absorbed by the qualifying circumstance of
treachery.  This error of the trial
court, however, will not affect the penalty imposed by it on appellant since,
in the absence of any modifying circumstance, the penalty for murder is <i>reclusion</i>
<i>perpetua</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, appellant argues that the reported act of prosecution
witness Venancio Tabobo after the shooting incident contradicts normal human
behavior.  According to appellant,
"common sense will dictate that the first tendency of a man who heard a
shooting near to him is to cover himself or to run away from the scene of
shooting but not chase the shooter."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The said contention is utterly devoid of merit.  We have ruled in a number of cases<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:22.0pt"> </span>that there is no standard form of
human behavioral response when one is confronted with a strange, startling or
frightful experience.  Verily, it is
even preposterous to say that anyone can determine exactly how a person will or
should react to a given situation.  The
testimony of said prosecution eyewitness is evidently neither improbable nor
incredible.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision appealed from is AFFIRMED, with
the modification that the indemnity to the heirs of the victim, Joselito Itona
y Nonato, is hereby increased to P50,000.00 in line with the present case law
thereon.</p>
