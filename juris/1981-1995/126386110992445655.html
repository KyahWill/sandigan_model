Inc. and Joint Venture YV YIT­-VESIPEKKA are hereby ordered to pay jointly and severally
the complainant the following sums:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>US $15,839.99 or its Peso

reimbursement of travel expenses.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Insofar as complainant's other claims, this Office cannot award the
same for lack of merit and without basis.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts, as stated in the comment of the Solicitor General, are
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="6">June 12, 1981</st1:date>,
petitioners hired private respondent <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>, Jr. as camp physician at their <span class="SpellE">Taijat</span> Island Resort or YIT-VESIPEKKA jobsite in <st1:place><st1:city>Baghdad</st1:city>,

of US $1,600.00 for a period of twelve (12) months commencing from the date he
would leave <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1981" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1981</st1:date>,
private respondent departed from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
subject to a probation period of ninety (90) days, to commence from the actual
date of work at the jobsite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
contract of employment pertinently stated:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Probation Period</u></p>

commencing from the actual starting date of the Employee's work in the work <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">location.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>If the employee fails to meet the requirement as to the skill and
willingness to work or fails to adjust himself to the rules and regulations for
the camp and the working conditions, or if he in any way gets in conflict, with
the local laws and regulations', he will immediately be sent back to the
country of recruitment.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

he wrote <span class="SpellE">Seppo</span> <span class="SpellE">Havia</span>, the
Personnel Manager, about the availability for use of a service coaster in
emergency cases for transporting patients to the hospitals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He added that although <span class="SpellE">Havia</span>
had assured him the availa­bility of a service coaster for ambulance use, he had
yet to obtain permission from the Finnish supervisor whenever the need arose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On September 7, 1981, he again wrote <span class="SpellE">Havia</span>
about the need to provide workers with safety boots and heavy duty hand gloves
to minimize, if not prevent, the widespread incidence of punctured wounds of
the feet as well as lacerations and crushing injuries of the hands of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also wrote <span class="SpellE">Borja</span>, officer-in-charge of the
Filipino camp area, on the cleanliness and sanitation of the camp.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He requested receptacles with covers for
waste matter so as to eliminate the sticky <span class="SpellE">pungy</span>
smell of the place.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1981" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1981</st1:date>,
he wrote again to <span class="SpellE">Havia</span> regarding the quality and
variety of food being served on Filipino workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This complaint was answered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A letter was written to the conces­sionaire,
warning on the problems of food served to workers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1981" day="26" month="9">September 26, 1981</st1:date>,
he wrote another letter suggesting that immediate action be taken to correct
the continued serving of spoiled food which had caused diarrhea and loose bowel
movement among the workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
taking immediate action on the complaint, <span class="SpellE">Havia</span> took
samples of the food and sent them to a laboratory to test whether the food was
spoiled or not.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="10">October 16, 1981</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span> employment contract was
terminated by <span class="SpellE">Havia</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon receipt of the letter of termination, he verbally protested
the same, but to no avail.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also
demanded payment of his salaries and overtime pay but was told that the amount
would be sent to him in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>, after
pressing for payment, he was paid first P10,000.00, then after filing a
complaint, later amended, P23,853.09 for salaries <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">up </span>to <st1:date year="1981" day="15" month="10">October 15, 1981</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1982" day="23" month="2">February 23, 1982</st1:date>,
he filed an amended complaint alleging among others, that he was prematurely
and unlawfully terminated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>On <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="2">February 7, 1983</st1:date>,
after the parties had filed their respective position papers and other
pleadings, respondent Director <span class="SpellE">Juridico</span> rendered the
questioned decision."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The motions for reconsideration

 1986</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the NLRC

 June 1986</st1:date>, the NLRC, through a majority <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of two (2) </span>commissioners, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">with
one (1) commissioner dissenting, issued the now assailed resolution dismissing
the appeals of both parties for lack of merit, and affirming the decision of
the POEA.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Hence, this petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The only issue to be
resolved in the petition is whether or not public respondents gravely abused
their discretion in holding that <span class="SpellE">Diosdado</span> P. <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> was illegally dismissed by petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It is the contention of petitioners
that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>, a probationary employee, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">was terminated </span>for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">his failure to meet the performance standards
set by them for regularization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioners argue that in
terminating <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span> services, they were </span>merely
exercising <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">their reserved prero­gative
of probationary termination for, after all, the selection of employees is of
particular importance to any employer, as it affects the enterprise in no small
measure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>Probationary
termination, according to petitioners, is not the same as dismissal for
cause.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They maintain that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>long as an employer does not abuse
his discretion in exercising his reserved prerogative of probationary
termination, the dismissal of an employee under probation who fails to qualify
for regularization is not illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
assert the public respondents should not have substituted their (respondents')
own discretion and judgment in deciding whether an employee is to be terminated
or regularized; and since public respondents did substitute their judgment for
that of the employer, this was grave abuse of discretion tantamount to lack of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">In further support of their position, petitioners contend that
they gave <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> guidelines for the opera­tion of
the clinic, e.g., regular clinic hours; personnel rotation; maintenance of
hygiene and sanitation; medical records; etc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They allege that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> failed to schedule
clinic hours within his eight (8) hour regular work, which resulted in
unnecessary overtime work.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He like­wise
failed to comply with company rules on the observance of prior requests and
authorizations for medical treatment and established procedures for emergency
consultations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, petitioners
state, <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> dismissed these instructions as
impossible to comply with, as he was the only camp physician and that he had to
treat all medical referrals coming to him as emergency cases.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners further allege that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> met with hostility petitio­ners' reminders to him
to keep the first aid kits reple­nished and the clinic surroundings clean and
sanitary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of the quality of food served in the camp,
petitioners maintain that they tried to find solutions to the complaints of the
Filipino workers but, unfor­tunately, <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
instead of cooperating with management in finding solutions to the very
problems he perceived, accused petitioners of maintaining sub-human conditions
in his memorandum to the personnel manager and went so far <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">to circularize these "Memos" not only inside the job site but
even furnished copies thereof to various Philippine government agencies,
including the Office of the President.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Last but not least, petitioners aver that <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span>
performance should reflect not only his skills as a doctor, which they do not
question, but also his overall competence in all areas of activity covered by
his assigned task as camp physician.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
camp physician, they expected <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> not only to
be medically competent but likewise possessed of effective management and
administrative skills in order to effectively run and operate the camp
clinic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In short, <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span>
performance and willingness to work must be judged, according to petitioners,
on his work attitude, relationship with co-employees, adjustment to work and
camp <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">conditions, rapport with other
site officials and the ability to work as a team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners submit that POEA made no express finding that they
(petitioners) were guilty of grave abuse of dis­cretion in terminating <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> but only concluded that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
was dismissed mainly to silence him because of his compilation and distribution
of letters critical of petitio­ners' operation which tended to be detrimental
to the interest of petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On the other hand,
private respondent contends that work at the jobsite was a 24-hour
operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Being the only camp
physician, he had to work beyond the eight (8) regular clinic hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this reason, he avers, he found himself
attending to consultations and treatment of workers as early as </span><st1:time minute="30" hour="5"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">5:30 a.m.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> and as late as </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="23"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">11:00 p.m.</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> or </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">12:00</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="0"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">midnight</span></st1:time><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
alleges that because he noticed the high incidence of punctured wounds in the
feet and lacerations and crushing injuries of the workers' hands, he was
prompted to write to the personnel manager suggesting that safety boots and
heavy duty hand gloves be provided the workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Another memo he had to write concerned food being served to Filipino
workers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged that spoiled food
was served to the Filipino workers with deleterious effect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Villarama</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> maintains that when he wrote
"memos" to the personnel manager, he was merely taking the cudgels
for the workers whose health and safety were his concern as the camp physician
and to "wake up" management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was, he adds, a legitimate exercise of freedom of speech and of
expression equally important to the cause of labor in this country and anywhere
in the world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He insists that his
dismissal is mainly because of his compilation and distribution of letters in
which he criticized the operation of JV <span class="SpellE">Yit</span>? <span class="SpellE">Vesipekka</span> and its sub-contractors, which petitioners
regarded as an intentional action against the employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petition must fail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Undoubtedly, <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Villarama's</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> skill
as a physician is </span>not questioned by petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They, however, submit that the term
"skills" more accurately refers to <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span>
overall<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>competence as a camp
physician, which covers possession of effective management and administrative
ability in supervi­<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">sing </span>and
operating the camp clinic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
petitioners accuse <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> of refusing to cooperate
with the site management and actually discrediting petitioners in the public
eye.</p>

<p class="BODY">Admittedly, <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the only doctor in the camp who could attend
to the medical cases referred to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The locale was a construction site on a 24-hour operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, injuries to the workers could be
expected to occur not only during daytime but even at night time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>True, guide­lines were set regarding clinic
hours but, as already stated, injuries and emergency cases could occur at any </span>time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners, instead of resenting <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span> suggestion to provide the workers with heavy
duty gloves and safety boots, should have welcomed the same, as it would
minimize, if not totally avoid the cases of injuries that the doctor had to
treat.</p>

<p class="BODY">The letters/memos written by private respondent, e.g., the serving
of spoiled food and the short supply of food to the workers, proved that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> was not only concerned with the health of the
workers but showed that he was also concerned with the interest of petitioners
who in the long run would be spared strikes called by workers complaining about
the quality and quantity of food served to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the finding of public respon­dents that <span class="SpellE">Villarama's</span> letters were constructively written, calling
the attention of petitioners to the conditions at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the jobsite.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The tenor of the
letters was informative.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We </span>do
not discern any intent on the part of private respondent to discredit
petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had petitioners taken more
time to implement the suggestions of <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
concerning the problems of the workers, a more pleasant and understanding
working relationship would have developed to their mutual benefit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But, unfortunately, petitioners opted to
dismiss private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">respondent </span>after
only two (2) months, even as they claimed to be working towards a solution to
the problems cited by private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioners cite the case
of </span><u>Grand</u> <u>Motor</u> <u>Parts</u> <u>Corp</u>. <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vs</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There, private respondent was hired
as manager of a branch store, a position he never held before.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On his managerial skills hinged the success
and profitability of the business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was found negligent in submitting reports vital to business operations and lax
in implementing company policies.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the case at bar,
private respondent was hired specifically </span>as a camp <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">physician.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His skills as </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">doctor
were never questioned by petitioners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was not found to be ineffective or inept as a physician.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were no com</span>plaints from the
workers against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What petitioners
allegedly question is the administrative skills of <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
in running the clinic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But these skills
are only corollary to his main work as a camp physician.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In truth, petitioners became unhappy at
having to pay an "alarming claim" for overtime pay by respondent <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
faulted him with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the non-replenishment
of the first-aid kits and the dirty state of the clinic premises.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These conditions were satis­factorily
explained by private respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In fine, petitioners'
dismissal of private respondent was not based on any of the grounds provided in
the contract of employment entered into between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are more inclined to believe and agree
with the respondents that <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span> was dismissed
because petitioners' personnel manager resented the act of <span class="SpellE">Villarama</span>
of writing memos calling the manager's attention to the problems in the camp
site and furnishing copies of said memos to government agencies and the Office
of the President of the Philippines, which act petitioners perceived as
detrimental to their interest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In the final analysis,
petitioners are not raising in the case at bar a question of jurisdiction but
only questions of fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As aptly
observed by the Solicitor General, in reality petitioners are claiming that
