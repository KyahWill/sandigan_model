				<BR><BR><div align="JUSTIFY">I. <i>Government Policy for Recovery <br>of Ill-Gotten Wealth</i><br><br>One of the very first undertakings of the Revolutionary Government swept into power by the so-called EDSA Revolution in February, 1986 was the recovery of "ill-gotten wealth" reputedly amassed by former President and Mrs. Ferdinand Marcos, their relatives, friends and business associates.&nbsp; This surely was an enterprise "of great pith and moment;" it was attended by "great expectations;" it was initiated not only out of considerations of simple justice but also out of sheer necessity -- the national coffers were empty, or nearly so.&nbsp; At the time that the government of former President Marcos was driven from power, the country's debt was over twenty-six billion US dollars; and the indications were that "illegally acquired wealth" of the deposed president alone, not counting that of his relatives and cronies, was in the aggregate amount of from five to ten billion US dollars, the bulk of it being deposited and hidden abroad.<br><br>II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Provisional Remedies in Pursuance<br> of Policy</i><br><br>Special adjective tools or devices were provided by the Revolutionary Government for the recovery of that "ill-gotten wealth."&nbsp; These took the form of provisional remedies akin to preliminary attachment (Rule 57), writ of seizure of personalty (Rule 60) and receivership (Rule 59).&nbsp; They were (a) <span style="font-style: italic;">sequestration </span>and (b) <span style="font-style: italic;">freeze orders</span>, as regards "unearthed instances of ‘ill-gotten wealth;’" and (c) <span style="font-style: italic;">provisional takeover</span>, as regards "business enterprises and properties taken over by the government of the Marcos Administration or by entities or persons close to former President Marcos." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup><br><br>A. <i>Executive Orders Re Sequestration,<br> Freezing and Takeover</i><br><br>These special remedies were prescribed and defined in Executive Orders Numbered 1 and 2, promulgated by President Corazon C. Aquino in March, 1986.&nbsp; Their validity and propriety were sustained by this Court on May 27, 1987, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> against claims that they were unconstitutional as being bills of attainder, or as violative of the right against self-incrimination and the guaranty against unreasonable searches and seizures.&nbsp; In the same case, the Court also set the parameters for and restrictions on the proper exercise of the remedies.<br><br>On the explicit premise that "vast resources of the government have been amassed by former President Ferdinand E. Marcos, his immediate family, relatives, and close associates both here and abroad," the Presidential Commission on Good Government —  PCGG, for short — was created by Executive Order No. 1 to assist the President in the recovery of the ill-gotten wealth thus accumulated, "whether located in the Philippines or abroad." The Commission's powers included "the takeover or sequestration of all business enterprises and entities owned or controlled by ** (President Marcos, his family and close associates) during his administration, directly or through nominees, by taking undue advantage of their public office and/or using their powers, authority, influence, connections or relationship." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup><br><br>Executive Order No. 2 asserted that the ill-gotten "assets and properties are in the form of bank accounts, deposits, trust accounts, shares of stocks, buildings, shopping centers, condominiums, mansions, residences, estates, and other kinds of real and personal properties in the Philippines and in various countries of the world." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>And Executive Order No. 14 <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> conferred on the Sandiganbayan exclusive and original jurisdiction over all cases of ill-gotten wealth, etc., and provided that civil suits involving the same may be filed separately from, and proceed independently of, any criminal proceeding, and that "<i>technical rules of procedure and evidence shall not be strictly applied to ** (said) civil cases</i>." The exclusivity of the jurisdiction of the Sandiganbayan was stressed in <i>BASECO</i> <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> and in PCGG v. Peña, et al. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>B.&nbsp; Relevant Constitutional Provisions<br><br>It appears to have been universally acknowledged that President Aquino had legitimate authority to wield legislative power under the revolutionary regime, at least "(u)ntil a legislature is elected and convened under a new constitution." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Such a new constitution was drawn up very quickly, and promulgated on March 25, 1986. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> The matter of the recovery of ill-gotten wealth was explicitly dealt with therein; and President Aquino was thereby given the right and duty to "give priority to measures to achieve the mandate of the people," among others, to "<span style="font-style: italic;">(r)ecover ill-gotten properties amassed by the leaders and supporters of the previous regime and protect the interest of the people through orders of sequestration or freezing of assets or accounts</span>." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The present (1987) Constitution <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> also treats particularly of the matter of sequestration and recovery of ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; Section 26, Article XVIII thereof provides as follows:<br><br><blockquote>"SECTION 26.&nbsp; The authority to issue sequestration or freeze orders under Proclamation No. 3 dated March 25, 1986 in relation to the recovery of ill-gotten wealth shall remain operative for not more than eighteen months after ratification of this Constitution.&nbsp; However, in the national interest, as certified by the President, the Congress may extend said period.</blockquote><br>A sequestration or freeze order shall be issued only upon showing of a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> case.&nbsp; The order and the list of the sequestered or frozen properties shall forthwith be registered with the proper court.&nbsp; For orders issued before the ratification of this Constitution, the corresponding judicial action or proceeding shall be filed within six months from its ratification.&nbsp; For those issued after such ratification, the judicial action or proceeding shall be commenced within six months from the issuance thereof.<br><br>The sequestration or freeze order is deemed automatically lifted if no judicial action or proceeding is commenced as herein provided."<br><br>III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Orders of Sequestration issued by PCGG</span><br><br>During 1986 and 1987 numerous orders of sequestration, freezing or provisional takeover of companies or properties, real or personal, were issued and implemented.&nbsp; Among those were the orders handed out against the firms or assets hereunder listed, with the dates of sequestration, freezing or take-over, to wit:<br><br><blockquote><table  ="" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%"> <tbody><tr> <td style="font-style: italic;" colspan="2">SUBJECTS/OBJECTS OF SEQUESTRATION</td> <td style="font-style: italic;" width="6%">&nbsp;</td> <td style="font-style: italic;" width="27%"> <div align="CENTER">DATE</div></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="8%">&nbsp;</td> <td width="59%">&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">a.</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">COCOFED, COCOMARK, CIC, etc., shares of stock of 1,405,366 coconut farmers" in UCPB and of the so-called "CIIF companies" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> in the same bank</div></td> <td valign="TOP">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT">March 19; April 21; June 24, 26; July 8, 1986</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER"></div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY"></div></td> <td valign="TOP">&nbsp;</td> <td valign="TOP"><div align="LEFT"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="TOP"> <td><div align="CENTER">b.</div></td> <td><div align="JUSTIFY">Assets of Roberto S.

Jose Bengzon, Jr. and his law partners (namely:&nbsp; Edilberto S. Narciso, Jr., Jose Vicente E. Jimenez, Amado V. Faustino, Jr., and Leonardo C. Cruz); Jose S. Sandejas and his fellow senior managers of FMMC/PNI Holdings groups of companies (such as Leonardo Gamboa, Vicente T. Mills, Jr., Jose M. Mantecon, Abelardo S. Termulo, Rex C. Drillon II and Kurt Bachmann, Jr.) — control of some of the biggest enterprises in the Philippines, such as Manila Electric Company (MERALCO), Benguet Consolidated Mining Corp. (Benguet), Pilipinas Shell Corp. and the Philippine Commercial &amp; International Bank (PCI Bank), through employment of devious financial schemes and techniques entailing the massive infusion (or hemorrhage) of government funds with a minimum or negligible "cash-out" from him (Romualdez), the general features of his classic take-over bid being as follows:<br><br><blockquote>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the take-over assumed as avowed and ostensible objectives, a declared national policy:&nbsp; in MERALCO, it was the diversification of ownership in a vital public utility; in Benguet and Pilipinas Shell, nationalization in anticipation of the expiration of the Laurel-Langley Agreement;<br><br>b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the shares were placed in the name of corporations organized solely for the purpose of holding title to them, said corporations having no operating history or financial track record, and projected cash flow consisting almost solely of future and contingent dividends on the shares held; despite these limitations, the companies somehow came to enjoy excellent credit lines from banks and other financial institutions, as evidenced by the millions of pesos in loans and guarantees outstanding in their books;<br><br>c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the "seed money" used to wrest control came from government and taxpayers’ money in the form of millions of pesos in loans, guarantee and standby L/Cs from government financial institutions, notably the DBP and PNB,&nbsp; which in turn rediscounted the obligations with the Central Bank;<br><br>d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; additional funding was provided from other related interests; and<br><br>e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; this intricate skein of inter-corporate dealings was controlled and administered by an exclusive, interlocking and closely knit directorate and officership.</blockquote><br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; accorded undue advantage to MERALCO (a) by effecting the increase of power rates with automatic authority to tack into the consumers’ electric bills the so-called purchase and currency adjustment, and (b) by reducing in collaboration with others, the electric franchise tax from 5% to 2% of gross receipts and the tariff duty on fuel oil imports by public utilities from 20% to 10%, resulting in substantial savings for MERALCO but without significant benefit to the consumers of electric power, and loss of millions of pesos in much needed revenues to the government;<br><br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; burdened MERALCO consumers with the heavy cost of purchasing, maintaining and operating two airplanes and one helicopter for his (Romualdez) personal use;<br><br>4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; formed the MERALCO Foundation Inc. (MFI) to gain control of the MERALCO group of companies upon a false commitment, among others, to free Eugenio Lopez Jr., from detention and transform MERALCO into a cooperative; in reality, defendants used MFI's tax-exempt status as a convenient tax and financial shelter;<br><br>5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; using public funds, took over and appropriated electric cooperatives, such as (1) Rizal Electric Cooperative and Talim Electric Cooperative, which were owned by the electric consumers in seven Rizal towns; (2) the electric firms in Laguna and Quezon; (3) the First Cavite Electric Cooperative, Inc.; (4) three electric cooperatives in Bulacan; (5) the Communications and Electricity Development Authority in Cavite and (6) the San Mateo Electric Light and Power company -- without just cause and without compensation to the owners thereof;<br><br>6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with the active collaboration of Imelda Marcos, Chairman of the Board of Administrators of the National Electrification Administration (NEA), caused the revocation of the franchise earlier granted to the above-mentioned cooperatives by the National Electric Commission, in order to expand MERALCO operations around Manila, to the exclusion and gross disadvantage of other electric cooperatives;<br><br>7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in a veiled attempt to justify MERALCO's anomalous acquisition of the electric cooperatives, and with the active collaboration of defendants Jose C. Hernandez, Juanito R. Remulla, Isidro Rodriguez, Cesar E.A. Virata, Pedro Dumol, Ricardo C. Galing, Francisco C. Gaitmaitan, Mario D. Camacho, etc., secured the approval by Pres. Marcos and his cabinet of the so-called “Three-year Program for Extension of MERALCO's Services to Areas Within the 60-Kilometer Radius of Manila," which required goverment capital investment amounting to millions of pesos;<br><br>8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manipulated the assumption by MERALCO of the electric cooperatives’ restructured obligations with the National Power Corporation (NPC) and soft loans with the NEA, at an exceedingly low interest rate of 3% per annum, payable in thirty-five years, to further facilitate the unlawful appropriation of the electric cooperatives;<br><br>9)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; caused the Issuance of PD 40 which commanded (1) the sale of MERALCO base load power plants to the National Power Corporation (NPC) at an exorbitant price, generating for MERALCO a net profit of more than P208.2 Million, and (2) the assumption by NPC of the foreign loans and other obligations of MERALCO;<br><br>10)&nbsp;&nbsp; with the active collaboration of his co-defendants, effected the sale of the shareholdings of the First Philippine Holding Corp. in the Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB) to Trans Middle East Philippine Equities Inc., a front organization of his (Romualdez), in order to gain control of PCIB with a minimum or negligible "cash out;" the acquisition of said PCIB shares was packaged by PCIB, and financed by PCIB and the Philippine Commercial Capital, Inc. through loans extended to SOLOIL Inc., for and in behalf of Trans Middle East Philippines Equities, Inc.; the funding by PCIB of the purchase of shares of its own capital stock violated banking laws, rules and regulations concerning (1) loans to Directors, Officers, Stockholders and Other Related Interests (DOSRI), (2) single borrowers limit (SBL), (3) disclosure requirements, and (4) the duty to ascertain identity of borrower and purpose of loan;<br><br>11)&nbsp;&nbsp; took over and appropriated for his own personal gain and benefit the business and publication of daily newspapers belonging to critics or opponents of the Marcos dictatorship;<br><br>12)&nbsp;&nbsp; with the active collaboration of defendants Jose Sandejas, Francisco Tantuico and Dominador G. Ingco, caused the National Investment and Development Corporation (NIDC) to dispose of its interest in the oil plants located in Tanauan, Leyte -- owned and operated by its subsidiary, the NIDC Oil Mills, Inc. -- in favor of the SOLOIL, Inc., a corporation beneficially held and controlled by him (Romualdez), under terms and conditions grossly disadvantageous to the NIDC;<br><br>13)&nbsp;&nbsp; with the support, assistance and collaboration of Philguarantee officials and the senior managers of FMMC/PNI Holdings, Inc. led by Jose S. Sandejas, Jr., Jose M. Mantecon and Kurt S. Bachmann, Jr. among others -- manipulated the formation of Erectors Holdings, Inc. without infusing additional capital, solely for the purpose of making it assume the obligation of Erectors Inc. with Philguarantee in the amount of P527,387,440.71, with insufficient security, and thus make Erectors Inc. appear viable and enable it to borrow more capital, with the result that its obligation with Philguarantee reached a total of more than P2 Billion as of June 30, 1987;<br><br>14)&nbsp;&nbsp; at the onset of the present Administration and/or within the week following the February 1986 People's Revolution, in conspiracy with and with the support, assistance and collaboration of, the above-named lawyers of the Bengzon Law Offices, manipulated, schemed, and/or executed a series of devices intended to conceal and place beyond the inquiry and jurisdiction of the PCGG the defendants' individual and collective funds, properties and assets subject of and/or involved in the instant complaint;<br><br>15)&nbsp;&nbsp; with the technical know-how and legalistic talents of the FMMC senior managers and retained lawyers, maneuvered the purported sale of his (Romualdez's) interests in the (1) Professional Managers, Inc., (2) A &amp; International Corp (A &amp; E) (3) First Manila Management Corp. (FMMC), (4) Maguindanao Navigation (MNI), (5) SOLOIL Inc., (6) Philippine World Travel Inc. (PWTI) and its subsidiaries (consisting of 36 corporations in all) to PNI Holdings, Inc. (whose purported incorporators are all members of his retained law firm) for only P5 million, on March 3, 1986 or three days after the creation of the PCGG on February 28,1986; this, for the sole purpose of deceiving the Government particularly the PCGG, and making it appear that the defendant Romualdez had already divested himself of his ownership of the same when in truth and in fact, his interests are well intact and protected by his retained attorneys together with FMMC senior managers, who still control and run the affairs of said corporations, and in order to entice the PCGG to approve the said fictitious sale, the above-named defendants offered P20 million as "donation" to the Government;<br><br>16)&nbsp;&nbsp; with the connivance, support and technical assistance of his retained law firm, together with defendants Cesar Zalamea, Antonio Ozaeta, Mario D. Camacho and Senen J. Gabaldon as members of the Board of Directors of the Philippine Commercial International Bank (PCIB), misused the Meralco Pension Fund in the amount of P25 million by causing it to be invested in the PCIB, and through the Bank's TSG, assigned to PCI Development and PCI Equity at 50% each, the Fund's (a) 8,028.0011 common shares in the Bank and (b) "Deposit in Subscription" in the amount of P4,929,972.50, but of the agreed consideration of P28 million for the said assignment, PCI Development and PCI Equity were able to pay only P5,500 down payment and the first amortization of P3,937,500.00, thus prompting the Fund to rescind its assignment, and the consequent reversion of the assigned shares brought the total shareholdings of the Fund to 11,470,555 voting shares or 36.8% of the voting stock at PCIB; and this development (which the defendants themselves orchestrated or allowed to happen) was used by them as an excuse for the unlawful dismantling or cancellation of the Fund's 10 million shares for allegedly exceeding the 30-percent ceiling prescribed by Section 12-B of the General Banking Act, although they knew for a fact that what the law declares as unlawful and void ab initio are the subscriptions in excess of the 30% ceiling "to the extent of the excess over any of the ceilings prescribed .. " and not the whole or entire stockholding which they allowed to stay for six years (from June 30, 1980 to March 24, 1986);<br><br>17)&nbsp;&nbsp; through the use of the names and managerial expertise of the FMMC senior managers identified as Jose B. Sandejas, Leonardo Gamboa, Vicente T. Mills, Abelardo S. Termulo, Edilberto S. Narciso, Jr., Jose M. Mantecon, Rex C Drilon II, Kurt Bachmann, Jr., together with the legal talents of corporate lawyers, cleverly hid behind the veil of corporate entities, his ill-gotten wealth including among others, the 6,229,177 shares in PCIB registered in the names of Trans Middle East Phils. Equities, Inc. and Edilberto S. Narciso, Jr., which they refused to surrender to PCGG despite their disclosure, as they tried and continue to exert efforts in getting hold of the same, as well as the shares in Benguet registered in the names of Palm Avenue Holdings and Palm Avenue Realty Development Corp. purportedly to be applied as payment for the claim of P70 million of "a member company of the First Manila Management Corp. group" supposedly owned by them although in truth, all said firms are still beneficially owned by said defendant Benjamin Romualdez.<br><br>The assets alleged to have been illegally acquired by Romualdez are enumerated in a list attached to the complaint as Annex "A," consisting of shares of stock in sixty-one (61) corporations, to wit:<br><br><ol><li>Phil-Commercial Capital Inc.</li><li>Erectors Inc.</li><li>Erincor Development Corp.</li><li>Professional Management Inc.</li><li>Pilipinas Automotive Credit Corp.</li><li>Philhino Sales Corp.</li><li>Pilipinas Transport Industries Inc.</li><li>Agro-Tech Corporation</li><li>Filmarine Shipping Corp.</li><li>&nbsp;Integrated Industrial Agronomics Inc.</li><li>Maranao Navigation Corp.</li><li>Gamma Realty Corporation</li><li>Philworld Charter &amp; Travel Services Inc.</li><li>Pilipinas Maintenence Services Corporation</li><li>Pilipinas Magnetics Incorporated</li><li>Metro Motors Incorporated</li><li>Data Systems Services Incorporated</li><li>Service Systems Incorporated</li><li>A &amp; E International Corporation</li><li>&nbsp;PSEI Holding Incorporated</li><li>Genesia Management and Development Corp.</li><li>International Heavy Equipment Corporation</li><li>St. Bernard Services Corporation</li><li>Philippine Hawk Transport Corporation</li><li>Mantrade Development Corporation</li><li>Badjao Navigation Corporation</li><li>Power Contractors Incorporated</li><li>Asian Specialists Contractors Incorporated</li><li>PSEI Transport Corporation</li><li>Maguindanao Navigation</li><li>Manila World Traders</li><li>Meralco Foundation Incorporated</li><li>Tacloban City Ice Plant</li><li>East Visayan Broadcasting Station</li><li>Chinatown Publishing Corporation</li><li>Central Citigas Station</li><li>Philippine Commercial and Industrial Bank</li><li>First Philippine Holdings Corporation</li><li>MERALCO</li><li>Busali Stud Farms</li><li>Travel Agency New York</li><li>Aviles Realty Corporation</li><li>Benguet Corporation</li><li>Capital City Realty Development Corporation</li><li>First Manila Management Corporation</li><li>First Phil.

or to acquire substantial holdings in, and control of, existing corporations; and generally, through or with the aid of these firms, to manipulate or misappropriate public funds and property and employ pressure and undue influence to amass immense assets and wealth.&nbsp; The complaints commonly assert that the defendants acted "singly or collectively and in unlawful concert with one another," and their reprehensible activities included "the misappropriation and theft of public funds, plunder of the nation's wealth, extortion, blackmail, bribery, embezzlement and other acts of corruption, betrayal of public trust and brazen abuse of power," at the expense and to the grave and irreparable damage of the Government and the Filipino people.<br><br>The cognate reliefs sought by the PCGG in its complaints are the return and reconveyance to the Government of all funds and other property unlawfully acquired by the defendants, and consequently impressed with a constructive trust in favor of the Government and the Filipino people, as well as of the funds and other property acquired by their abuse of right and power through unjust enrichment; and the requirement or command that said defendants account for all legal or beneficial interests in funds properties and assets of whatever kind and wherever located, in excess of their lawful earnings.<br><br>VI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i> Omission to Implead Corporations Referred to in PCGG Complaints</i><br><br>The corporations in which the defendants (natural persons) allegedly own substantial interests and which are subject to their control — whether organized by them, their dummies or co-­conspirators, or previously existing but subsequently coming under their power -- were not impleaded as defendants but were merely mentioned or listed, and specifically described in the complaints as instruments for illegal acquisition of wealth, or as depositaries of illegal wealth, or as constituting the fruits thereof.<br><br>VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Lifting of Sequestration by Sandiganbayan on Account of Said Omission, and Actions in this Court for Review Thereof</i><br><br>This negative circumstance, perceivable in all the complaints -- i.e., that the sequestered corporations were simply listed and described in the complaints (as the instruments, depositaries or fruits of ill-gotten wealth) but were not explicitly impleaded as parties defendant -- was to prove procedurally calamitous to the PCGG.&nbsp; For that omission was seized upon by the defendants as the basic premise of motions for the lifting of the orders of sequestration effected on those corporations, on the theory that as to them no proper judicial actions had been filed within the time and in the manner required by Section 26, Article XVIII of the 1987 Constitution and, therefore, their sequestration should be deemed automatically lifted.<br><br>Said constitutional provision, quoted earlier in this opinion, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> pertinently provides the following: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><br>"A sequestration or freeze order shall be issued only upon showing of a <i>prima facie</i> case.&nbsp;

(COCOFED), Coconut Investment Company (CIC), COCOFED Marketing Corporation (COCOMARK), and the shares of stock of over one million coconut producers/farmers (except those registered in the names of the individual defendants in Case No. 0033) in the United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) and in the so-called "CIIF companies," <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> on the ground that said companies were not impleaded as party defendants within the 6-month period fixed in the Constitution, ending on August 2, 1987 -- but were merely mentioned as entities organized, controlled or used by the defendants (i.e., as instruments for acquisition, or depositaries, or the fruits, of illegal wealth).<br><br>1.&nbsp; <i>G.R.

No. 86989).&nbsp; The matter was however referred for proper disposition to the Sandiganbayan, which docketed the same as Case No. 0086.&nbsp; After due hearing, the Sandiganbayan rendered judgment thereon, dated March 29, 1990, sustaining the theory of the petitioner firms that the orders of sequestration effected on them had been rendered ineffective as a result of the PCGG's failure to file the proper judicial action or proceeding against them within the time prescribed by Section 26 of Article XVIII of the Constitution.<br><br>The Judgment of March 29, 1990 was upheld by this Court in a special civil action of certiorari initiated by the PCGG, docketed as G.R. No. 92755, in an unsigned but extended resolution dated October 2, 1990.&nbsp; The resolution pointed out that the inclusion of Enrique Luy, ostensible principal stockholder of the corporations involved, as defendant in Case No. 0033 could not be deemed substantial compliance with the constitutional requirement above mentioned, since corporations have legal personalities distinct and separate from their stockholders; and that there was no evidence that "the shareholdings of Enrique Luy are beneficially owned by Eduardo Cojuangco Jr.," this being a matter still to be established in Civil Case No. 0033." <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup><br><br>3.&nbsp; <i>G.R.

Basic Issue in All Cases</span><br><br>The crucial question underlying all these cases may be put in this wise:<br><br><blockquote>DOES INCLUSION IN THE COMPLAINTS FILED BY THE PCGG BEFORE THE SANDIGANBAYAN OF SPECIFIC ALLEGATIONS OF CORPORATIONS BEING "DUMMIES" OR UNDER THE CONTROL OF ONE OR ANOTHER OF THE DEFENDANTS NAMED THEREIN AND USED AS INSTRUMENTS FOR ACQUISITION, OR AS BEING DEPOSITARIES OR PRODUCTS, OF ILL-GOTTEN WEALTH; OR THE ANNEXING TO SAID COMPLAINTS OF A LIST OF SAID FIRMS, BUT WITHOUT ACTUALLY IMPLEADING THEM AS DEFENDANTS, SATISFY THE CONSTITUTIONAL REQUIREMENT THAT IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN A SEIZURE EFFECTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 1, s. 1986, THE CORRESPONDING "JUDICIAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING" SHOULD BE FILED WITHIN THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRESCRIBED IN SECTION 26, ARTICLE XVIII, OF THE (1987) CONSTITUTION?</blockquote><br>The contending parties have expectedly taken opposing sides on the question.&nbsp; The PCGG maintains the affirmative of the issue.&nbsp; The various private respondents say "No," that contemplated enabling or saving effect could only be brought about by the actual, formal impleading of the sequestered entities or the ostensible holders of the sequestered assets, and asserting that sequestrations affecting persons or entities not so impleaded automatically lapsed upon expiration of either of the six-month periods, whichever was applicable, specified in the cited provision of the Constitution.<br><br>That issue submits to resolution upon equally basic and familiar principles of procedural and substantive law and of the interpretation of statutes.<br><br>X.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Purpose of Constitutional Requirement for filing of "Judicial Action or Proceeding" Within Fixed Period Re Orders of Sequestration, Etc.</span><br><br>The purpose of the constitutional requirement that the corresponding judicial action or proceeding be filed within a definite period as regards orders of sequestration, freezing or provisional takeover, is not difficult to discern.&nbsp; Sequestration, freezing, provisional takeover are fundamentally remedies which are temporary, interim, provisional.&nbsp; In the very nature of things, as emphasized in BASECO, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> they are not meant to bring about a permanent state of affairs.&nbsp; They are severe, radical measures taken against apparent, ostensible owners of property, or parties against whom, at the worst, there are merely prima facie indications of having amassed "ill-gotten wealth," indications which must still be shown to lead towards actual facts in accordance with the judicial procedures of the land.<br><br>Thus, the <span style="font-style: italic;">rationale </span>for the limitations placed upon the power of sequestration, etc. by the Constitution, these being the following: <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[48]</sup><br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; The authority to issue such orders was made "operative for not more than eighteen months after ratification of ** (the) Constitution;" i.e., not beyond 18 months from February 2, 1987, unless extended by the Congress "in the national interest, as certified by the President;" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[49]</sup><br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Said orders could issue only upon showing of a prima facie case;<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The order and the list of sequestered or frozen properties had to be registered forthwith with the proper court:&nbsp; the Sandiganbayan, according to law; <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[50]</sup><br><br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">For orders issued before ratification of the 1987 Constitution</span>, the corresponding judicial action or proceeding should be filed within six months therefrom (i.e., six months from February 2, 1987); and <span style="font-style: italic;">for those issued thereafter</span>, within six months from issuance of the order of sequestration, etc.<br><br>The issue in all the cases at bar chiefly concerns the fourth limitation pursuant to which the PCGG had to file "the corresponding judicial action or proceeding" within a fixed period of six months.&nbsp; The evident purpose was to preclude the possibility that the PCGG indefinitely maintain its orders of sequestration, etc. and to compel it, within a reasonable time, to bring them into the realm of judicial oversight, evaluation and control, to the end that excesses of the officials and agents enforcing and implementing said orders might be prevented and avoided and private rights duly protected and vindicated, while the main business of determining the character of the property as "ill-gotten wealth" or not was being attended to.<br><br>XI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Nature of Contemplated "Judicial Action or Proceeding"</span><br><br>There is no particular description or specification of the kind and character of the "judicial action or proceeding" contemplated, much less an explicit requirement for the impleading of the corporations sequestered, or of the ostensible owners of property suspected to be ill-gotten.&nbsp; The only modifying or qualifying requirement in the constitution is that the action or proceeding be filed "for" — i.e., <span style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">with regard or in relation to, in respect of, or in connection with, or concerning </span>—  orders of sequestration, freezing, or provisional takeover. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[51]</sup> What is apparently contemplated is that the action or proceeding concern or involve the matter of sequestration, freezing or provisional takeover of specific property, corporeal or incorporeal, personal or real; and should have as objective, the demonstration by competent evidence that the property thus sequestered, frozen or taken over is indeed "ill-gotten wealth" over which the government has a legitimate claim for recovery and other relief.&nbsp; Stated otherwise, the action or proceeding contemplated is one for the final substantiation or proof of the prima facie showing on the basis of which a particular order of sequestration, freezing or takeover was issued.<br><br>XII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Characters of Actions Actually Brought</span><br><br>Now, there would seem to be no dispute about the fact that in all the cases at bench, an "action or proceeding" was actually filed with regard or in relation to, in respect of, <span style="font-style: italic;">in connection with, or concerning</span> the sequestration, freezing or provisional takeover of corporations and other property, and that said "action or proceeding" was filed within the six-month period provided by the Constitution.<br><br>As regards the sequestered corporations, the complaints in the actions thus brought all alleged that said entities were either the instruments or conduits for personal aggrandizement or the acquisition of ill-gotten wealth, or were the depositaries, or were <span style="font-style: italic;">themselves </span>the fruits, of ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; In other words, they were organized so that they could be used for improper, illegal and anomalous availment of financial or other advantage; or were formed or being operated or manipulated by public officers sub rosa, or by private individuals, with the use of public funds or property or assets otherwise illegally acquired, or in breach of public trust or violation of fiduciary duty; or in the case of existing firms, that their stock had been purchased by or for public officers and their relatives, friends, and associates, with the use of public funds or illegally acquired money, or in violation of law or fiduciary duty, etc.&nbsp; Elsewise stated, following the classic pattern of a money-laundering operation, they were either sham, "shell" "dummy" corporations serving as fraudulent devices or conduits for private gain of public officers and employees; or companies from which stock had been acquired, or firms into which capital had been infused, or shares of stock purchased, with the use of illegally acquired assets, and which therefore constituted the res:&nbsp; the thing or object treated of in the action.<br><br>Without belaboring the obvious, some illustrations may not be amiss, and may serve to make clear the PCGG theory as the Court sees it, of sequestered companies organized to serve as tools for acquiring, or being depositaries or the fruits of, ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>A.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Cases Where Corporations Used as Instruments to Illegally Amass Wealth</span><br><br>For instance, in the following cases, the PCGG contends that corporations were used as conduits or instruments to obtain favored contracts from government institutions or agencies, through undue influence, fraud or other illegal means, invariably with the omission of burdensome requisites and conditions imposed by law.&nbsp; In Civil Case No. 0007, the PCGG alleges that the defendants (Fe Gimenez Roa, et al.) used corporations organized and controlled by them to obtain favorable construction contracts from the Government.&nbsp; In Civil Case No. 0009, the PCGG theory is that the defendants therein (Jose Africa, et al.) used the companies controlled by them to set up a monopoly in the telecommunications industry, and acquire substantial shareholdings in POTC-PHILCOMSAT.&nbsp; In Civil Case No. 0014, the PCGG contends that the defendants (Enriquez Spouses, et al.) illicitly took control of several corporations which they afterwards used as instruments to obtain unconscionable loans and financial accommodation from the GSIS and DBP, and sell land at a bloated price to the GSIS.&nbsp; In Civil Case No. 0016, the PCGG asserts that the defendants (Cuenca, et al.) utilized corporations controlled by them to procure favored contracts from such government agencies as the Department of Public Works and the National Irrigation Authority for many construction projects costing billions of pesos; obtain financial assistance without sufficient collateral or under anomalous terms from such government institutions as the Philippine National Bank; and transfer US dollars to a foreign account for eventual use by the Marcoses to buy property in New York.&nbsp; In Case No. 0024, the PCGG position is that the defendants (Peter Sabido, Luis Yulo, et al.) made use of corporations controlled by them to obtain huge loans (in domestic and foreign currencies) under anomalously one-sided conditions; and in Case No. 0025, that the defendants (Antonio Martel, et al.) utilized their controlled company to get favored contracts with the Department of National Defense and huge dollar loans from the DBP.<br><br>B.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Cases of Corporation as Depositaries or Fruits of Ill-Gotten Wealth</span><br><br>In other instances, the PCGG theory is that companies in which alleged Marcos cronies or dummies own substantial beneficial interests, received Government property or public funds misappropriated or converted by public officers or other persons and were used for said companies' commercial advancement (Civil Cases Nos. 0014. 0023).<br><br>In still other instances, according to the PCGG, substantial or controlling blocks of stock of highly profitable business enterprises were purchased with Government funds or illegally acquired wealth in the names of the purchasers themselves or their "dummies" or "nominees" (e.g., San Miguel Corporation, Benguet Mining Corporation, MERALCO).<br><br>C.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Common Prayer of Complaints</span><br><br>The complaints in the cases at bar all pray either that the shares of stock illegally acquired or the public funds deposited or invested in banking or other existing companies, through fraud or anomalous machinations by public officers and employees, or through the use of undue influence and pressure or other illegitimate means and methods, or the corporations controlled by the defendants and used for nefarious purposes, be conveyed to and forfeited in favor of the Government.<br><br>Now, it would seem a self-evident proposition that if the material averments of the complaints are shown to be true by competent proof, the ill-gotten wealth thereby described and identified should justly be forfeited in favor of the Government, and other appropriate remedy granted by the Court to the Republic and the Filipino people.<br><br>This is precisely the relief prayed for by the PCGG on the strength of the specific and express allegations of its several complaints.&nbsp; No reason of substance or significance exists to deny it the opportunity to obtain that relief.<br><br>XIII.&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Postulated Procedural Error<br> in PCGG Complaints</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>It is postulated, however, that the judicial actions instituted by the PCGG in relation to or in connection with its orders of sequestration or seizure against corporations or shares of stock held by supposed dummies, suffered from a grave procedural defect.&nbsp; The sequestered corporations -- which, in the above mentioned view of the PCGG had served as tools or instruments for acquisition of ill-gotten wealth, or were the depositaries or fruits thereof -- or the natural persons ostensibly owning stock as "dummies," had not been impleaded as defendants in the various complaints.<br><br>A.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Error Immaterial to Requirement to <br>File Actions or Proceedings within<br> Constitutional Time Limits</span><br><br>Such a procedural defect, however, conceding its existence for the nonce, does not contradict or adversely affect the actuality that judicial actions or proceedings had been brought within the time limits laid down by the Constitution "for" them; i.e., <span style="font-style: italic;">with regard or in relation to, in connection with, or involving or concerning</span> the sequestration or seizure by the PCGG of the assets or properties in question.<br><br>Other considerations bearing upon the matter should also be taken into account.<br><br>B.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Impleading Unnecessary in Cases for Recovery of Shares of Stock or Bank Deposits</span><br><br>As regards actions in which the complaints seek recovery of defendants' shares of stock in existing corporations (e.g., San Miguel Corporation, Benguet Corporation, Meralco, etc.) because allegedly purchased with misappropriated public funds, in breach of fiduciary duty, or otherwise under illicit or anomalous conditions, the impleading of said firms would clearly appear to be unnecessary.&nbsp; If warranted by the evidence, judgments may be handed down against the corresponding defendants divesting them of ownership of their stock, the acquisition thereof being illegal and consequently burdened with a constructive trust, and imposing on them the obligation of surrendering them to the Government.<br><br>Quite the same thing may be said of illegally obtained funds deposited in banks.&nbsp; The impleading of the banks would also appear unnecessary.&nbsp; Indeed, there would exist no cause of action against them.&nbsp; Judgment may properly be rendered on the basis of competent evidence, that said funds are ill-gotten wealth over which the defendants have no right, and should consequently be surrendered to their rightful owner, the Government.&nbsp; The judgment would constitute sufficient warrant for the bank to make the corresponding transfer of the funds.<br><br>C.&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Impleading Unnecessary Re Firms <br>Which are the Res of the Actions</span><br style="font-style: italic;"><br>And as to corporations organized with ill-gotten wealth, but are not themselves guilty of misappropriation, fraud or other illicit conduct — in other words, the companies themselves are the object or thing involved in the action, the res thereof — there is no need to implead them either.&nbsp; Indeed, their impleading is not proper on the strength alone of their having been formed with ill-gotten funds, absent any other particular wrongdoing on their part.&nbsp; The judgment may simply be directed against the shares of stock shown to have been issued in consideration of ill-gotten wealth.<br><br>Such showing of having been formed with, or having received ill-gotten funds, however strong or convincing, does not, without more, warrant identifying the corporations in question with the persons who formed or made use of them to give the color or appearance of lawful, innocent acquisition to illegally amassed wealth — at the least, not so as place on the Government the <span style="font-style: italic;">onus </span>of impleading the former together with the latter in actions to recover such wealth.&nbsp; Distinguished, in terms of juridical personality and legal culpability from their erring members or stockholders, said corporations are not themselves guilty of the sins of the latter, of the embezzlement, asportation, etc., that gave rise to the Government's cause of action for recovery; their creation or organization was merely the result of their members' (or stockholders') manipulations and maneuvers to conceal the illegal origins of the assets or monies invested therein.&nbsp; In this light, <span style="font-style: italic;">they are simply the res in the actions for the recovery of illegally acquired wealth</span>, and there is, in principle, no cause of action against them and no ground to implead them as defendants in said actions.<br><br>The Government is, thus, not to be faulted for not making such corporations defendants in the actions referred to.&nbsp; It is even conceivable that had this been attempted motions to dismiss would have lain to frustrate such attempts.<br><br>D.&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">In any Case, Omission to Implead firms not Fatal, but Curable Error</span><br><br>Even in those cases where it might reasonably be argued that the failure of the Government to implead the sequestered corporations as defendants is indeed a procedural aberration, as where said firms were allegedly used, and actively cooperated with the defendants, as instruments or conduits for conversion of public funds or property or illicit or fraudulent obtention of favored Government contracts, etc., slight reflection would nevertheless lead to the conclusion that the defect is not fatal, but one correctible under applicable adjective rules — e.g., Section 10, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court [specifying the remedy of amendment during trial to authorize or to conform to the evidence <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[52]</sup>]; Section 1, Rule 20 [governing amendments before trial], in relation to the rule respecting the omission of so-called necessary or indispensable parties, set out in Section 11, Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[53]</sup> It is relevant in this context to advert to the old, familiar doctrines that the omission to implead such parties "is a mere technical defect which can be cured at any stage of the proceedings even after judgment;" <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[54]</sup> and that, particularly in the case of indispensable parties, <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[55]</sup> since their presence and participation is essential to the very life of the action, for without them no judgment may be rendered, amendments of the complaint in order to implead them should be freely allowed, even on appeal, in fact even after rendition of judgment by this Court, where it appears that the complaint otherwise indicates their identity and character as such indispensable parties. <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[56]</sup><br><br>Again, even conceding the adjective imperfection of the omission to implead the sequestered corporations as indispensable or necessary parties, it bears repeating that their sequestration would not thereby be rendered <span style="font-style: italic;">functus officio</span>, since, as already pointed out, judicial actions or proceedings have in truth been filed concerning or regarding said sequestration in literal and faithful compliance with Section 26, Article XVIII of the Constitution.<br><br>XIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Effect of Sequestration<br> on Corporations Concerned</span><br><br>Moreover, the fact of sequestration clearly placed the corporations subjected thereto on notice that in the Government's view, they were instruments for acquisition of "ill-gotten wealth," or their formation, organization and operation were tainted by impropriety and wrongdoing (e.g., by infusion of stolen funds or property); and that therefore, they should expect some form of Government action for redress and relief.&nbsp; In any event, in common with everybody else, they were charged with notice of the State policy, enunciated by the Revolutionary Government, reiterated in the Freedom Constitution, and explicitly set forth in the 1987 Constitution, that preferential attention should be given to the mission of recovering ill-gotten wealth.&nbsp; It might even be theorized, not unreasonably, that these circumstances placed on them the <span style="font-style: italic;">onus </span>of intervening in the corresponding action, to quash the writs of sequestration by proof that they are not "ill-gotten wealth," that they are legitimate corporations, engaged in licit business.<br><br>XV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"> Continuing Vitality of State Policy <br>For Recovery of Ill-Gotten Wealth</span><br><br>Political normalization of the country — which fortunately came not too long after the EDSA Revolution of 1986 — did not abrogate, or diminish the strength of the lofty state policy for recovery of ill-gotten wealth, no matter that its prosecution has thus far yielded what not a few are disposed to regard as at best only mixed results, or was attended by much abuse on the part of some of its officers or "fiscal agents;" indeed, that circumstance should vigorously argue for its more sustained and effective pursuit and implementation.<br><br>And equally, if not more, important, strong paramount public policy is not to be set at naught by technical rules of procedure or by narrow constructions of constitutional provisions that frustrate their clear intent or unreasonably restrict their scope.&nbsp; This, of course, even on the premise that impleading sequestered firms is necessary to the maintenance of their sequestration — a premise that is of doubtful validity, as already pointed out, given the language of the constitutional provision.<br><br>Furthermore, if actions are not to be dismissed for lack of an indispensable party, where the latter may be subsequently joined by amendment of the pleadings, no reason appears why provisional remedies in those actions, such as sequestrations, should be affected by the initial non-inclusion of an indispensable party, the obvious remedy being to allow amendment of the complaint to effect the impleading.<br><br>XVI.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">&nbsp; The "Interco" and "PJI" Rulings</span><br><br>This Court is not unmindful of the fact that its Resolution of July 26, 1991 on the petitioner's motion for reconsideration in G.R. No. 92755 (<span style="font-style: italic;">PCGG vs. Interco</span>) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[57]</sup> appears to sustain the proposition that actual impleading in the recovery action of a corporation, under sequestration for being a repository of illegally-acquired wealth, is necessary and requisite for such proposed or pending seizure to come under the protective umbrella of the Constitution.&nbsp; But <span style="font-style: italic;">Interco </span>is to be differentiated from the cases now under review in that in the former, as already elsewhere herein made clear, there was a lack of proof, even of the <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> kind, that Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr. owned any stock in Interco, the evidence on record being in fact that said corporation had been organized as a family corporation of the Luys.<br><br>So, too, this Court's judgment in the so-called "PJI Case" (<span style="font-style: italic;">Republic of the Philippines (PCGG] v. Sandiganbayan and Rosario Olivares </span>) <sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[58]</sup> may not be regarded as on all fours with the cases under consideration.&nbsp; The PJI Case involved the shares of stock in the name of eight (8) natural persons which had never been sequestered at all.&nbsp; What happened was that the PCGG simply arrogated unto itself the right to vote those unsequestered shares on the bare claim that the eight (8) registered owners thereof were "dummies" of Benjamin Romualdez, the real owner of the shares; and all that the PCGG had done as predicate for that act of appropriation of the stock, was to include all the shares of PJI in a list (Annex A) appended to its complaint in Sandiganbayan Case No. 0035, describing them as among the properties illegally acquired by Romualdez.&nbsp; Unfortunately, as in <span style="font-style: italic;">Interco</span>, the PCGG failed to substantiate by competent evidence its theory of clandestine ownership of Romualdez; and since moreover, there had been no sequestration of the alleged dummies' shares of stock, it was undoubtedly correct for the Sandiganbayan to grant the latter's motion for them to be recognized and declared as the true owners of the stock in question, which judgment this Court subsequently pronounced to be free from grave abuse of discretion.<br><br>It is obvious that the now-questioned rulings of the Sandiganbayan merely hewed to what that tribunal perceived to be the doctrine laid down in <span style="font-style: italic;">Interco </span>and <span style="font-style: italic;">PJI</span>.&nbsp; That was error, as already explained in some detail but, all things considered, one not easily avoided.<br><br>XVII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-style: italic;">Final Dispositions</span><br><br>It is thus both needful and timely to pronounce that:<br><br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Section 26, Article XVIII of the Constitution does not, by its terms or any fair interpretation thereof, require that corporations or business enterprises alleged to be repositories of "ill-gotten wealth," as the term is used in said provision, be actually and formally impleaded in the actions for the recovery thereof, in order to maintain in effect existing sequestrations thereof;<br><br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Complaints for the recovery of ill-gotten wealth which merely identify and/or allege said corporations or enterprises to be the instruments, repositories or the fruits of ill-gotten wealth, without more, come within the meaning of the phrase "corresponding judicial action or proceeding" contemplated by the constitutional provision referred to; the more so, that normally, said corporations, as distinguished from their stockholders or members, are not generally suable for the latter's illegal or criminal actuations in the acquisition of the assets invested by them in the former;<br><br>3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; even assuming the impleading of said corporations to be necessary and proper so that judgment may comprehensively and effectively be rendered in the actions, amendment of the complaints to implead them as defendants may, under existing rules of procedure, be done at any time during the pendency of the actions thereby initiated, and even during the pendency of an appeal to the Supreme Court -- a procedure that, in any case, is not inconsistent with or proscribed by the constitutional time limits to the filing of the corresponding complaints "<span style="font-style: italic;">for</span>" -- i.e., <span style="font-style: italic;">with regard or in relation to, in respect of, or in connection with, or concerning -- orders of sequestration, freezing, or provisional takeover.</span>"<br><br>WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered:<br><br>A.

In the very nature of things, as emphasized in BASECO, they are not meant to bring about a permanent state of affairs. They are severe, radical measures taken against apparent, ostensible owners of property, or parties against whom, at the worst, there are merely <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> indications of having amassed 'ill-gotten wealth', indications which must still be shown to lead towards actual facts in accordance with the judicial procedures of the land".</blockquote><br>Hence, the <span style="font-style: italic;">limitations </span>placed upon the power of sequestration, etc. by the Constitution, among them being the following:<br><br>1. The authority to issue such orders of sequestration was made 'operative for not more than eighteen months after ratification of x x [the] Constitution;' i.e. not beyond 18 months from 02 February 1987, unless extended by the Congress 'in the national interest', as certified by the President;<br><br>2. Said orders of sequestration could issue only upon showing of a<span style="font-style: italic;"> prima facie</span> case;<br><br>3. An order of sequestration and the list of sequestered or frozen properties had to be registered forthwith with the proper court: the Sandiganbayan, according to law;<br><br>4.&nbsp; For orders of sequestration issued before ratification of the 1987 Constitution, the corresponding judicial action or proceeding should be filed within six (6) months therefrom (i.e., six (6) months from 02 February 1987); and for orders issued thereafter, within six (6) months from issuance of the order of sequestration, etc.<br><br>The issue in all the cases at bar chiefly concerns the fourth limitation, above-mentioned, pursuant to which the PCGG would have to file ‘the corresponding judicial action or proceeding’ within a fixed period of six (6) months. The evident purpose was to preclude the possibility that the PCGG would indefinitely maintain its orders of sequestration, etc. and to compel it, within a reasonable time, to bring them into the realm of judicial oversight, evaluation and control, to the end that excesses of the officials and agents enforcing and implementing said orders might be prevented and avoided and private rights duly protected and vindicated, while the main business of determining the character of the properties as 'ill-gotten wealth' or not was being attended to in court.<br><br>While the Court's decision recognizes that the constitutional provisions limiting the PCGG's powers of sequestration were designed to protect private property rights, the decision goes on to posit the theory that the "judicial action or proceeding" contemplated by the Constitution is any action concerning or involving the property under sequestration, i.e. a proceeding to prove that the property is ill-gotten, <span style="font-style: italic;">without the necessity of impleading in said actions, the sequestered companies themselves.</span><br><br>It is suggested that in cases of recovery of shares of stock or bank deposits, the corporation or bank involved need not be impleaded since there would in fact exist no cause of action against them as the holders (stockholders or depositors) merely hold the shares or deposits in constructive trust in favor of the government.<br><br>In cases of corporations allegedly organized using ill-gotten wealth, it is also suggested that they (the corporations) need not be impleaded since the corporations themselves are merely the object or <span style="font-style: italic;">res </span>of the action.<br><br>As an alternative, it is argued that the corporations may still be impleaded by amending the complaints under appropriate provisions of the Rules of Court. Also, it is stated that the corporations involved were clearly put on notice, by virtue of the sequestration, that they could be instruments for acquisition of ill-gotten wealth and that said corporations had the <span style="font-style: italic;">onus </span>of intervening in the cases.<br><br>It should be remembered, in this connection, that orders of sequestration are extraordinary writs by which the government, through the PCGG, secured properties and assets alleged to have been illegally acquired during the period prior to the 1986 EDSA Revolution which ousted then President Marcos. Sequestration (Philippine-style) involved the seizure by the government of specified properties and assets of private persons and likewise included the take-over of the management and/or control of sequestered corporations, without the need of prior notice to the owner of the properties or corporation to be sequestered. The PCGG was empowered to issue writs of sequestration by virtue of Executive Orders Nos. 1 and 2 and Proclamation No. 3 issued in 1986 by then President Aquino.<br><br>Sequestration therefore is akin to the provisional remedies of preliminary attachment and receivership. However, it should be pointed out that unlike said two (2) provisional remedies, writs of sequestration are issued not by a judicial body but by the PCGG itself, upon its own determination that there exists a <span style="font-style: italic;">prima facie</span> factual foundation for the writs. Unlike in ordinary civil cases where specific grounds are provided for by the Rules of Court for the issuance of the writs, no definite or s<span style="font-style: italic;">pecific grounds</span> are required for the issuance of writs of sequestration. If applied to civil cases, it would be allowing the plaintiff to take control of a defendant's assets even prior to the filing of a complaint based on the former's own belief or assertion that he has a better right to such assets. Also, unlike the two (2) provisional remedies, aforementioned, no bond is required to indemnify a defendant for any undue damage which might be suffered by him as a consequence of the issuance of the writ.<br><br>It thus cannot be denied that the authority of the PCGG then to issue writs of sequestration was an invasion upon a private person's right against deprivation of property <span style="font-style: italic;">without due process of law.</span><br><br>The framers of the Constitution were evidently concerned with such irregular procedures inherent in sequestration so that they included Sec. 26, Article XVIII in the Constitution, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"The authority to issue sequestration or freeze orders under Proclamation No. 3 dated March 25, 1986 in relation to the recovery of ill-gotten wealth shall remain operative for not more than eighteen months after the ratification of this Constitution. However, in the national interest, as certified by the President, the Congress may extend said period.<br><br>A sequestration or freeze order shall be issued only upon showing of a prima facie case. The order and list of the sequestered or frozen properties shall forthwith be registered with the proper court. For orders issued before the ratification of this Constitution, the corresponding judicial action or proceeding shall be filed within six months from its ratification. For those issued after such ratification, the judicial action or proceeding shall be commenced within six months from the issuance thereof.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">The sequestration or freeze order is deemed automatically lifted if no judicial action or proceeding is commenced as herein provided</span>." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>This constitutional safeguard cannot and should not be given such a strict and narrow construction as to render it ineffective.<br><br>In the case of corporations allegedly organized using ill-gotten wealth, the Court's decision agrees that such corporations have personalities distinct and separate from the alleged beneficial owners who are named defendants in the complaints. I submit that failure to implead these corporations as defendants and merely annexing a list of such corporations to the complaints is a violation of their right to due process for it would in effect be disregarding their distinct and separate personality without a hearing.<br><br>In cases where stocks of a corporation were allegedly the fruits of ill-gotten wealth, it should be remembered that in most of these cases the stocks involved constitute a substantial if not controlling interest in the corporations. The basic tenets of fair play demand that these corporations be impleaded as defendants since a judgment in favor of the government will undoubtedly substantially and decisively affect the corporations as distinct entities. The judgment could strip them of everything without being previously heard as they are not parties to the action in which the judgment is rendered.<br><br>The issue in these consolidated cases cannot be disposed of by simply holding, as the Court does, that corporations merely hold stocks in a constructive trust for the government or are but the res of the complaints. Holding that the "corresponding judicial action or proceeding" contemplated by the Constitution is any action concerning or involving the corporation under sequestration is oversimplifying the solution, the result of which is antagonistic to the principles of justice and fair play.<br><br><span style="font-style: italic;">I submit that the actions contemplated by the Constitution should be those which include the corporation not as a mere annex to the complaint but as defendant. This is the minimum requirement of the due process guarantee</span>. Short of being impleaded, the corporation has no standing in the judicial action. It cannot adequately defend itself. It may not even be heard.<br><br>On the Court's opinion that alternatively the corporations can be impleaded as defendants by amendment of the complaint, Section 26, Article XVIII of the Constitution would appear to preclude this procedure, for allowing amendment of the complaint to implead theretofore unimpleaded corporations would in effect allow complaints against the corporations to be filed beyond the periods fixed by said Section 26.<br><br>Justice Amuerfina Melencio-Herrera in her separate opinion in B<span style="font-style: italic;">ataan Shipyard and Engineering Corporation, Inc. v. PCGG </span>(150 SCRA 181, 253) correctly stated what should be the rule, thus:<br><br><blockquote>"Sequestration is an extraordinary, harsh and severe remedy. It should be confined to its lawful parameters and exercised, with due regard, in the words of its enabling laws, to the requirements of<span style="font-style: italic;"> fairness, due process, and Justice</span>." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote><br>While government efforts to recover illegally amassed wealth should have support from all its branches, eagerness and zeal should not be allowed to run berserk, overriding in the process the very principles that it is sworn to uphold. In our legal system, the ends do not always justify the means. Wrongs are never corrected by committing other wrongs, and as above-discussed the recovery of ill-gotten wealth does not and should never justify unreasonable intrusions into constitutionally forbidden grounds. It is for these reasons that, in my view, the writs of sequestration involved in these cases should now be lifted in accordance with the last paragraph of Section 26, Article XVIII of the Constitution.<br></div>
