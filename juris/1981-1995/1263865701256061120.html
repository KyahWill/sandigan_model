				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">These cases have been unusually difficult for the Court, not
because the issues posed are in themselves intellectually demanding, but
because of problems generated by the procedure adopted by the parties in coming
before this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The incidents subject
of these cases spawned multiple cases and petitions before the National Labor
Relations Commission ("NLRC").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After the NLRC rendered a consolidated decision, the parties, in turn,
filed multiple separate <i>certiorari</i> petitions to the Court -- on a
staggered and piecemeal basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This
situation resulted in a number of discrete discussions of issues actually
inter-related, since the Court, at any one time, could only see a small part of
the whole picture and decide only on the basis of what it could see.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In what follows, we have tried to put the
whole picture together and to render comprehensive and substantial justice to
all the parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 October 1984, petitioner Associated Workers Union
("AWU") - PTGWO, the then bargaining representative of the
dockworkers at South Harbor, Port Area, Manila, filed a Notice of Strike
against respondent Metro Port Service, Inc. ("Metro"), the then <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> contractor in the South Harbor, on the issues,
among others, of unfilled vacancies and union busting.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was docketed as NLRC Case No. <span class="GramE">NCR-NS-10-288-84.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="4">3 April 1985</st1:date>,
the abovementioned case was certified in an Order by the then Minister of Labor
and Employment to the NLRC for compulsory arbitration; the Order also forbade
the holding of strikes or lockouts.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The case was docketed as Certified NLRC Case No. 0403-85.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the latter case, one of the demands raised
by AWU was that Metro <span class="GramE">terminate</span> the employment of
respondents Adriano <span class="SpellE">Yumul</span> and ten (10) others
(individual respondents), for having organized, on <st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="10">26 October 1984</st1:date>, the Associated Workers Union in
<span class="SpellE">Metroport</span> ("AWUM") among the rank-and-file
employees of Metro, ostensibly as a local or chapter of AWU.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>AWU had earlier expelled individual
respondents from membership in AWU for disloyalty and, pursuant to the
closed-shop provision of the existing AWU-Metro collective bargaining agreement
("CHA"), sought the termination of their employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">Metro initially resisted <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> request
to terminate the employment of individual respondents, contending that the
termination would be premature as individual respondents had not been afforded
due process, and that the termination would be <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the <u>status</u> <u>quo</u> agreement in NLRC Case No. <span class="GramE">NCR-NS-10-288-84.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Metro, however, eventually relented and suspended individual respondents after
AWU -- despite the express prohibition in the Order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="4">3 April 1985</st1:date> -- staged a strike against it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="18" month="4">18
 April 1985</st1:date>, Metro executed a Compromise Agreement
("Agreement") with AWU to end the strike, item No. 2 of which
stipulated:</p>

<blockquote>"At the instance of the union, [Metro] agrees to preventively
suspend (individual respondents] effective immediately."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The Agreement was attested to by then
Deputy Labor Minister <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of Metro's implementation of the Agreement,
individual respondents on <st1:date year="1985" day="30" month="4">30 April
 1985</st1:date> filed a complaint against Metro, docketed as NLRC Case No. <span class="GramE">NCR-4-1372-85.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Metro
in that case filed in turn a third-party complaint against AWU and its
officers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Metro in April 1985 also filed a complaint for illegal strike
with damages against AWU and its officers, docketed as NLRC Case No. <span class="GramE">NCR-4-1341-85.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="6">21 June 1985</st1:date>, Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Ceferina</span> <span class="SpellE">Diosana</span> in an Order
directed Metro provisionally to reinstate individual respondents pending
resolution of the issues raised therein, with which Order Metro complied.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="15" month="7">15 July 1985</st1:date>,
AWU filed a petition for injunction against Metro, docketed as NLRC Injunction
Case No. 993, praying for issuance of a temporary restraining order stopping
the implementation of the Order of provisional reinstatement, and for Metro's
compliance with the Agreement providing for the suspension of individual respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="8">1
 August 1985</st1:date>, the NLRC in an <u>En</u> <u>Banc</u> Resolution
directed Metro to comply with the Agreement, and Metro complied and
re-suspended individual respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Individual respondents' petition before the NLRC for preliminary
mandatory injunction on 30 August 1985, praying "that pursuant to the
Implementing Rules of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 130, [Metro] be ordered to pay their salaries and
allowances from and after their initial preventive suspension of thirty (30)
days and until their actual reinstatement," was not acted upon.</p>

<p class="BODY">All the above-mentioned cases, to wit:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) Certified NLRC Case No. 0403-85 (NCR No. <span class="GramE">NS-10-288-84); (b) NLRC Case No.</span> <span class="GramE">NCR-4-1341-85;
(c) NLRC Case No.</span> NCR-4-1372-85; and (d) NLRC Injunction Case No. 993, <span class="GramE">were</span> ordered consolidated before the NLRC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="9">4 September 1986</st1:date>,
the NLRC rendered a consolidated Decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In Certified NLRC Case No. 0403-85, the NLRC ruled that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) respondent Metro cannot be compelled to
fill up vacancies with <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span>;
(b) respondent Metro cannot be held liable for union busting, the issue of the
medically impaired workers having become moot and academic; and (c) the
compulsory retirement of <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> members who have
reached the age of 60 years is a valid exercise of management prerogative.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In NLRC Case No.</span> NCR-4-1372-85, the
NLRC, finding that AWU was a national union, and that individual respondents
have the right to organize themselves into a local chapter thereof, the
formation of which was a protected activity and could not be considered as
disloyalty, held the suspension or dismissal of individual respondents as
illegal and, in relation to NLRC Injunction Case No. 993, ordered their
reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, to be paid <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> by AWU and respondent Metro.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In NLRC Case No.</span> NCR-4-1341-85, the NLRC
found the strike staged by AWU not illegal, holding that AWU was of the belief,
although erroneously, that it could validly stage a strike during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of its motion for reconsideration of the
Minister's Order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="4">3 April 1985</st1:date>
enjoining a strike or lockout.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both AWU and Metro filed separate motions for reconsider­ation of
the consolidated Decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, on <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="7">21 July
 1986</st1:date>, petitioner Marina Port Services, Inc. ("Marina"),
by virtue of a Special Permit issued by the Philippine Ports Authority, started
operations as the <span class="SpellE">arrastre</span> operator at the <st1:place><st1:placename>Manila</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>South</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Harbor</st1:placetype></st1:place>
vice Metro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On November 1986, individual
respondents in a Motion/Manifestation prayed that <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>
be included as party-respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 27 July 1987, the NLRC in a Resolution denied <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> and Metro's motions for reconsideration of the
consolidated Decision dated 4 September 1986, but (acting on individual
respondents' Motion/Manifestation) with the modification limiting <u>Metro's</u>
liability for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to wages accruing <u>up to July
20, 1986</u> and ordering <u>Marina</u> to reinstate individual respondents

July 1986</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>
complied with the Resolution by reinstating individual respondents through its
payroll retroactive to <st1:date year="1986" day="21" month="7">21 July 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">AWU thereafter in G.R. Nos. 87266-69 filed with the Court a
Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> on <st1:date year="1989" day="14" month="3">14
 March 1989</st1:date> praying for the reversal of the decision of the NLRC in
NLRC Case No. NCR-NS-10-288-84 and NLRC Injunction Case No. 993 (praying
principally for reversal of the order holding that respondent Metro could not
be compelled to fill up vacancies with <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span>) and in NLRC Case No. NCR-4-1372-85 (praying
chiefly for reversal of the order reinstating the eleven [11] private
respondents to their former positions with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
payable <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> by AWU and respondent Metro).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These cases (G.R. Nos. 87266-69) were
assigned to the Third Division of the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Marina, meantime, had gone to the Court on <i>certiorari</i> on
14 June 1988 in G.R. Nos. 81256-59 (entitled "Marina Port Services, Inc.
v. National Labor Relations Commission, Metro Port Service, Inc, Associated
Workers Union [AWU-PTGWO], and Associated Workers Union in Metro Port
[AWUM]") protesting, on grounds of alleged denial of due process, its

Services, Inc. v. National Labor Relations Commission, Associated Workers

[and 10 others]”) went to this Court again and assailed the NLRC ruling in NLRC
Case No. NCR-4-1372-85 and NLRC Injunction Case No. 993, Metro claimed that it
should not have been held <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liable with AWU
because it had merely suspended individual respondents pursuant to the
Agreement dated 18 April 1985 it had executed with AWU and, later, had merely
obeyed the Resolution of the NLRC dated 1 August 1985 ordering Metro to
re-suspend individual respondents.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
similarly dismissing Metro's petition, the Court in G.R. No. 82705, held:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Considering that the petitioner was a party to the compromise agreement with
AWU which provided that 'at the instance of the union, the company agrees to

associates effective immediately' and accordingly suspended the private
respondents despite the suspension being contrary to law, the petitioner <u>should

have been entitled</u> to during their suspension.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner's liability, however, <u>should

<p class="BODY">Judgment was entered in G.R. Nos. 81256-59 and G.R. No. 82705 on <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="9">23 September 1988</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1989" day="4" month="7">4 July 1989</st1:date>, respectively, and the
cases were remanded to the Labor Arbiter of origin for execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="9">18 September 1989</st1:date>,
the Labor Arbiter issued a writ of execution against <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>

Labor Arbiter dated 15 November 1989, requiring the release of any garnished

within the 10-day <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 6 December 1989, the Executive Labor Arbiter issued a writ of
execution requiring Marina:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a) to
reinstate individual respondents and to pay them the amount of P154,357.00
representing salary adjustments; and (b) to implement and honor the legality of
the organization and registration of AWUM as the local chapter of AWU.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marina then once more went to the Court in
G.R. Nos. 91223-26 and filed a Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> to invalidate the
writ of execution, pleading that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(a)
execution had been ordered without due regard for its right of appeal from the
Labor Arbiter's Order; and (b) execution would result in its being made to pay
more than what is called for by the ruling of the Court in G.R. No. 82705,
where the Court affirmed the NLRC ruling that Marina "should be made <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with AWU for the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and allowances that the private respondents may have been entitled to during
their suspension [<u>although liability] should not extend to the time that

<p class="BODY">1.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Deliberating on the
instant Petition for <i>Certiorari</i>, the Court in <u>G.R. Nos. 87266-69</u>
considers that petitioner AWU has failed to show grave abuse of discretion or
any act without or in excess of jurisdiction on the part of the NLRC in
Certified NLRC Case No. 0403-85 (NCR No. NS-10-288-84).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC was correct there in holding that
respondent Metro cannot be compelled to fill up vacancies with <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> <span class="SpellE">recommendees</span>, as the CBA
between AWU and respondent Metro granted the latter the right to "fill or
not to fill-up vacancies"; that the issue of the medically impaired
employees had already been raised in another Notice of Strike filed by AWU
against respondent Metro on 16 September 1985, and both parties had agreed to
abide by the recommendation and decision of an examining physician selected by
them; and that the existing CBA grants respondent Metro the right to
compulsorily retire any member of AWU who had reached 60 years of age, which
right has been exercised by Metro.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC, however, <span class="SpellE">misappreciated</span> the relevant facts in NLRC Case No.
NCR-4-1372-85 and NLRC Injunction Case No. 993.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that AWUM as a local union, being an entity separate
and distinct from AWU, is free to serve the interest of all its members and
enjoys the freedom to disaffiliate, such right to disaffiliate may be
exercised, and is thus considered a protected labor activity, <u>only when
warranted by circumstances</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Generally</u>,
a labor union may disaffiliate from the mother union to form a local or
independent union <u>only during the 60-day freedom period</u> immediately
preceding the expiration of the CBA.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
Even before the onset of the freedom period (and despite the closed-shop
provision in the CBA between the mother union and management) disaffiliation
may still be carried out, but <u>such disaffiliation must be effected by a
majority of the members in the bargaining unit</u>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
This happens when there is a substantial shift in allegiance on the part of the
majority of the members of the union.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
such a case, however, the CBA continues to bind the members of the new or
disaffiliated and independent union up to the <span class="SpellE">CBA's</span>
expiration date.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The record does not show that individual respondents had
disaffiliated during the freedom period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The record does, however, show that only eleven (11) members of AWU
(individual respondents) had decided to disaffiliate from AWU and form AWUM.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Metro had about 4,000 employees,
and around 2,000 of these were members of AWU.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
It is evident that individual respondents had failed to muster the necessary
majority in order to justify their disaffiliation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(In fact, it was only on <st1:date year="1985" day="5" month="12">5 December 1985</st1:date> that individual respondents were
finally able to register an independent union called <span class="SpellE">Metroport</span>
Workers Union [MWU].<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Even then, in the absence of allegation by AWUM [MWU] of the exact number of
its members, the Court presumes that only twenty percent [20%] of the employees
of Metro had joined MWU.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>)
Thus, in the referendum held on <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="1">7
 January 1985</st1:date> at the PTGWO compound (where representatives of the
Ministry of Labor and Employment were present) to determine whether individual
respondents should be expelled from AWU, 1,229 members (out of 1,695 members
present) voted for expulsion of individual respondents.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The individual respondents here have failed to present proof of
their allegation that the 1,695 members of AWU were not employees of respondent
Metro alone; the Court therefore presumes that those who voted for their
expulsion were <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> employees of respondent Metro.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, individual respondents failed to
allege that their expulsion for disloyalty violated <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span>
constitution and by-laws.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
In sum, the attempted disaffiliation of the eleven (11) private respondents
from the petitioner mother union and the effort to organize either a new local
of the mother union or an entirely new and separate union, did not, under the
circumstances of this case, constitute protected activities of the eleven (11)
individual respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the conclusion reached above in G.R. Nos. 87266-69,
i.e., that AWU was justified in expelling from its membership the eleven (11)
individual respondents, the question now arises:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>how and to what extent does such conclusion
affect the liability of Metro, and Marina (as successor-employer)?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It will be recalled that the Resolutions of
this Court in G.R. Nos. 81256-59 and 82705 dismissing the Petitions for <i>Certiorari</i>
of both Metro and Marina assailing the NLRC consolidated Decision of 4
September 1986 insofar as their (Metro's and Marina's) liability for
reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of the individual
respondents <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> is concerned, became final and
judgment entered therein, sometime ago.</p>

<p class="BODY">1. So far as concerns <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> liability
under the NLRC consolidated Decision, it should in the first place be pointed
out that the Court did not make any pronouncement either in G.R. Nos. 81256-59
or in G.R. No. 82705 concerning <span class="SpellE"><u>AWU's</u></span>
liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. No. 82705, the Court
merely acted on the issue raised by petitioner Metro:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that Metro should not be liable at all for
reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> considering that Metro
was only pressed into suspending individual respondents because of <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> threat to strike.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In dismissing Metro's Petition, the Court in G.R. No. 82705 in effect
merely held that Metro, whatever the liability of AWU might be in respect of
the expulsion of individual respondents, could not escape liability by throwing
all responsibility upon AWU; and that Metro could not validly plead that it was
under duress when it executed the Agreement with AWU providing for, among other
things, the preventive suspension of individual respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is, of course, aware that AWU was a party-respondent in
both G.R. Nos. 81256-59 and 82705, and that AWU had in fact filed a Comment in
both G.R. Nos. 81256-59 and 82705.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, the Court did not either in G.R. Nos. 82156-59 or in G.R.
No. 82705 in fact <span class="GramE">make</span> a determin­ation of the
legality of <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> expulsion of individual respondents
from its membership.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court in G.R.
No. 82705 held only that the liability of Metro was <span class="SpellE">solidary</span>
in nature, i.e., <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> with AWU, whatever <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> liability might be; and it may be well to recall that
<span class="SpellE"><u>solidary</u></span> liability is different from <u>secondary</u>
liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In G.R. Nos. 81256­-59, the
Court simply held that <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city> was
properly <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the underlying cases and could
not be absolved from responsibility for reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
upon the ground of denial of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, so far as
concerns the liability of Metro and <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>
for reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of individual
respondents under the consolidated NLRC Decision, the pre­eminent fact is that
the Court's Resolutions in G.R. Nos. 81256-59 and 82705 dismissing their
Petitions are already final.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
liabilities of Metro and <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city> for
reinstate­ment and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> under the consolidated
NLRC Decision have become fixed and definite, with the modification decreed by
the Court in G.R. No. 82705 in so far as <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
were concerned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the conclusion we
today have reached in G.R. Nos. 87266-69 cannot benefit Metro and <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>
and will not dissolve their already fixed and definite liabilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Turning to the question
of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due to the eleven (11) individual
respondents, three (3) different time periods are relevant here and must be
distinguished from one another:</p>

<blockquote>First Period:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>From 18 April 1985 to 21 June 1985</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the Compromise Agreement between Metro and
AWU to end the strike, in which Metro agreed to preventively suspend the eleven
(11) individual respondents, was effected on 18 April 1985 and implemented
immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter on <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="6">21 June 1985</st1:date> ordered Metro to
reinstate provisionally the eleven (11) individual respondents and Metro
complied.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Second Period:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>From 1 August 1985 up to 27 July 1987</u>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the NLRC, pursuant to the urging of AWU,
ordered Metro to re-suspend the individual respondents on 1 August 1985 and
Metro again complied with this Order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Approximately two (2) years later, on <st1:date year="1987" day="27" month="7">27 July 1987</st1:date>, NLRC ordered Metro/Marina to reinstate the
individual respondents and <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>
complied by reinstating the individual respondents on the payroll, i.e., paying
their salaries although they were not allowed to work on their jobs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Third Period:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>From </u><st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="7"><u>28 July 1987</u></st1:date><u> to </u><st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="9"><u>18 September 1989</u></st1:date>:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>on <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="9">18
 September 1989</st1:date>, the Labor Arbiter issued the questioned writ of
execution ordering, among other things, <st1:city><st1:place>Marina</st1:place></st1:city>
to reinstate formally the individual respondents.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Under the consolidated NLRC Decision, Metro/Marina <span class="GramE">are</span> liable for the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
accruing during the First and Third Periods above indicated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In respect of the Second Period, however, the
Court in G.R. No. 82705, as already pointed out earlier, held that Metro/Marina
should not be held liable for <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> accruing
during that period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Strictly speaking,
in view of our conclusion above that AWU was justified in expelling individual
respondents from its membership, neither AWU nor Metro/Marina would be liable
to individual respondents for the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> accruing
during this Second Period.</p>

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In the interest of
substantial and expeditious justice, however, we believe that the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> accruing during the Second Period should be paid
and shared by AWU and by Metro/Marina, on a 50-50 basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We here establish this equitable allocation
of ultimate responsibility in order to forestall further litigation between AWU
and Metro/Marina and individual respondents in respect of claims and countering
claims for payment or reimbursement or contribution and to put a definite end
to this prolonged and costly confrontation among the several parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The equitable considerations which impel us to hold AWU liable
for one-half (1/2) of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> during the Second
Period include:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo6;

</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->the fact that Metro had been reluctant to comply
with the demand of AWU to terminate the services of individual respondents and
had wanted to give the latter procedural due process, but gave in to the
demands of AWU;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.55in;text-indent:-.25in;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo6;

tab-stops:list .55in"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span class="GramE">that</span> AWU, instead of
waiting for final judicial determination of the legality of its expulsion of
individual respondents, chose to importune the NLRC to issue the order requiring
the re-suspension of the individual respondents on <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="8">1 August 1985</st1:date>, with which order Metro eventually complied.</p>

<p class="BODY">5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Turning to
Metro/Marina, we note that, apart from the finality of the Court's Resolutions
in G.R. Nos. 81256-59 and 82705, there is independent basis for holding
Metro/Marina responsible for reinstatement with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
accruing throughout the three (3) periods above indicated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The equitable considerations which lead us to
hold Metro/Marina responsible for one-half (1/2) of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
accruing during the above Second Period relate to the failure of Metro to
accord individual respondents procedural due process by giving them reasonable
opportunity to explain their side before suspending or dismissing them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such dismissal was accordingly in violation
of the Labor Code.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt">13</span></span></a> Notwithstanding <span class="SpellE">AWU's</span> closed-shop clause in the CBA, Metro was bound to
conduct its own inquiry to determine the existence of substantial basis for
terminating the employment of individual respondents.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

That AWU, disregarding the Minister of Labor and Employment's express order,
had threatened to go on strike, and indeed actually went on strike, if Metro
had continued with the services of individual respondents, did <u>not</u>
relieve Metro from the duty to accord procedural due process to individual respondents.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The portion of the Writ
of Execution issued by the Executive Labor Arbiter requiring Marina to pay
salary differentials in the total amount of P154<span class="GramE">,357.00</span>
accruing during the period from 20 July 1986 up to October 1989, should be
modified to conform with the above legal and equitable allocation of liability

(3) Periods above mentioned during which the individual respondents were
suspended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The salary differentials, as

during the Second Period and partly during the Third Period as above
indicated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the salary
differentials accruing from 20 July 1986 up to 27 July 1987 should be borne on
a 50-50 basis by AWU on the one hand and Metro/Marina on the other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The salary differentials accruing from <st1:date year="1987" day="28" month="7">28 July 1987</st1:date> up to <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="9">18 September 1989</st1:date> shall be borne

MWU) as a local chapter of <span class="GramE">AWU,</span> is inconsistent with
the conclusions we have set forth in Part I above, and must be deleted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What was in fact eventually established by
individual respondents was a separate, independent union called Metro Port
