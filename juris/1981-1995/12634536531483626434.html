				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
respondent court's decision declaring null and void the decision of the
Collector of Customs in an administrative case "Seizure Identification No.
70­027" entitled "RP vs. LCT-759 Together With 103 Pieces of Logs <span class="GramE">Aboard</span> Same Vessel".</p>

<p class="BODY">The case originated from the issuance by the petitioner,
Collector <span class="SpellE">Sabino</span> Rigor, of a Warrant of Seizure and
Detention in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2301 and 2205, in
relation to Sections 2530(g), 906 and 908 of Republic Act No. 1937, otherwise
known as the Tariff and Customs Code of the Philippines, against the vessel
LCT-759 and its cargo, consisting of 103 pieces of logs for failure to pre­sent
a manifest for the said logs within the period prescribed by the Code.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">A notice of hearing was
issued by petitioner Rodolfo M. <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, Investigation
Hearing Officer, on the Warrant of Seizure and Detention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">parties</span> who were
duly notified and represented, voluntarily submitted to the jurisdiction of the
respondent Collector of Customs for the </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Port</span></st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> of </span><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Davao</span></span></st1:placename></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">After hearing the
parties, the respondent Collector of Customs rendered a decision ordering </span>the
seized logs forfeited in favor of the government to be disposed of according to
law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the same decision, the
respondent Collector imposed a P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> fine against
the vessel in accordance with the provisions of Section 2521 of Republic Act
No. 1937.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Instead of appealing the
Collector's decision to the Commissioner of Customs, the private respondents
filed an original petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Branch II, praying that the
Collector's decision in Seizure Identification No. 70-027 be annulled for
having been issued without or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of
discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In their answer, herein
petitioners, in turn, pointed out the court's lack of jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In their reply, the
private respondents averred that Section 2530 of the Tariff and Customs Code,
which gives the petitioners the power to seize and to declare forfeitures,
refers to imported articles which should be covered by manifest and since the
logs in question were not imported nor smuggled articles from a foreign
country, the petitioners had no business collecting customs duties thereon nor
did they have the power to seize and to declare the same forfeited.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">After requiring the
parties to submit supplementary pleadings and subsequent to the <span class="GramE">petitioners</span> submission of a "Memorandum of Evidence
with Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings", the respondent court
promulgated the judgment now subject of this petition, reversing </span>and
declaring null and void the decision of the Collector of Customs in Seizure
Identification No. 70-027.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
further directed the withdrawal of the proceeds of the sale of the 103 pieces
of seized logs from the Philippine National Bank for delivery to the private
respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Their motion for
reconsideration having been denied, the petitioners filed the present petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">At issue in this petition
is the jurisdiction of a Court of First Instance to review the decision of a
Collector of Customs in seizure and detention proceedings under the Tariff and
Customs Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> (R.A. No. 1937).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The petitioners argue
that the respondent court's review of the decision in Seizure Identification
No. 70-027 was devoid of validity as under Section 2313 of the Tariff and
Customs Code of the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, the Collector of Customs' decision should
have been brought on appeal to the Commissioner of Customs, not before the
Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the Commissioner of Customs,
on the other hand, would have been <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> to the
Court of Tax Appeals pursuant to Section 2402 of the Code and Section 7 of
Republic Act No. 1125.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Branch II, did not
validly acquire jurisdiction over Special Civil Case No. 7114, the proceedings
taken therein and the decision rendered by the respondent court were a nullity
which cannot be validly enforced nor effectively executed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Private respondents on
the other hand, contend that their petition before the Court of First Instance
was not an appeal but a special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> under
Section 1, Rule 65 of the Rules of Court where the </span>court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">may review the records and the entire
proceedings conducted by the petitioners.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The private respondents
try to make out a case of the administrative authorities having acted without
or in excess of jurisdiction or with grave abuse of discretion to justify their
invocation of judicial power which is, of course, available whenever administrative
officials transgress the bounds of the jurisdiction or the powers given to them
by law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The respondents'
arguments have no merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The provisions of the
Tariff and Customs Code empowering the customs authorities to act as they did

clearance manifests of cargo and passengers for said port granted at any port
or ports of entry from which said vessel may have cleared during the
voyage."'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Contrary to the stand of
the private respondents, articles subject to seizure do not have to be goods
imported from a foreign country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
provisions of </span>the Code refer to <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span>
articles found on vessels or aircraft engaged in the coastwise trade.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The customs authorities do not have to prove
to the satisfaction of a court of first instance that the articles on board a
vessel were imported from abroad or are intended to be shipped abroad before
they may exercise the power to effect customs' searches, seizures, or arrests <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">provided by law and to continue with the
administrative hear­ings on whether or not the law may have been violated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Regarding the nature of
the port of origin and the port of destination, it is enough if one of the
ports </span>is a port of entry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the

is included in the <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>
port of entry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court's
finding that "port of entry" must be limited to the wharves of Sta.
Ana and <span class="SpellE">Sasa</span> where the customs house is located and
not extended "to every inch of the City of <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Davao</span></st1:place></st1:city>" would unduly hamper if
not cripple the effective enforcement of customs and tariff laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Customs officials cannot stand by helplessly
for want of jurisdiction simply because a restrictive interpretation of
"port of entry" would enable coastwise vessels to load or unload <span class="SpellE">unmanifested</span> goods with impunity outside of the specific
area where the wharves and the customs house are located.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The records also show
that the requirements on cargo manifest were not followed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">But more important than
our sustaining the correctness of the findings and conclusions made by the
customs' officials is to state clearly their authority under the law to make
the initial determination on the limits of their administrative jurisdiction,
to act speedily and to make decisions on the basis of that determination, and
to have such act or decision <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> only in the
manner provided by the Customs and Tariff Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is our consistent
ruling that the Collector's decisions are <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Commissioner of Customs, whose decisions, in cases involving seizure,
detention or release of property, may in turn be reviewed only by the Court of
Tax Appeals.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u>Señeres</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Frias</span></u>
(39 SCRA 536) that:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The collector's decision may be appealed to the commissioner

<blockquote>"As held by the Court in the 1966 leading case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span></u>,
18 SCRA 907, - where the court empha­sized the need of the cooperation of all
branches of the Government for the success of the law enforcement agencies in
curbing smuggling — by virtue of the enactment of the Tariff and Customs Code
(Rep. Act 1937) as well as the Court of Tax Appeals Law (Rep. Act 1125), 'on
grounds of public policy, it is more reasonable to con­clude <u>that the
legislators intended to divest the Court of First Instance of the prerogative
to <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> a pro­perty which is a subject of a
seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Other­wise, actions for forfeiture
of pro­perty for violation of Customs laws could easily be undermined by the
simple device of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span></u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"'Furthermore, Section 2303 of the Tariff and Customs Code
requires the Collector of Customs to give to the owner of the property sought
to be forfeited written notice of the seizure and to give him the opportunity
to be heard in his defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>This
provision clearly indicates the intention of the law to confine in the Bureau
of Customs the determination of all questions affecting the disposal of
property proceeded against in a seizure and forfeiture case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judicial recourse of the property owner
is not in the Court of First Instance but in the Court of Tax Appeals, and only
after exhausting administrative remedies in the Bureau of Customs</u>.'"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Hadji</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">Mohamad</span> <span class="SpellE">Daud</span> v. Collector of Customs of the Port of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> City</u> (68 SCRA 157) this Court reiterated the
doctrine as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"As early as June 30, 1955, the Court had already announced in
<span class="SpellE"><u>Millarez</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span></u>,
97 Phil. 284-85, that 'Republic Act No. 1125, Section 7, effective June 16,
1954 gave the Court of Tax Appeals <u>exclusive</u> <u>appellate</u>
jurisdiction to review an appeal, decisions of the Commissioner of Customs,
involving <u>seizure</u>, deten­tion or <u>release</u> of property affected ***
or other matter arising under the Customs Law or other law administered by the
Bureau of Customs'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Specifically, in <span class="SpellE"><u>Caltex</u></span><u> (Philippines) Inc. v. City of Manila</u>,
25 SCRA 840, it was held that the law affords the Collector of Customs
sufficient latitude in determining whether or not a certain article is subject
to seizure or forfeiture and his decision on the matter is <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>
to the Commissioner of Customs and then to the Court of Tax Appeals, not to the
Court of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fundamental
reason is that the Collector of Customs consti­tutes a tribunal when sitting in
forfeiture proceedings (Commissioner of Customs v. <span class="SpellE">Cloribel</span>,
19 SCRA 234) beyond the interference of the Court of First Instance (Lopez v.
Commissioner of Customs, 37 SCRA 33-34).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As expressed in <span class="SpellE"><u>Pacis</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span></u>, 18 SCRA 907,'* * * the Court of First Instance
should yield to the jurisdiction of the Collector of Customs is provided for in
Republic Act 1937 which took effect on July 1, 1957, much later than the
Judiciary Act of 1948.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic
that a later law prevails over a prior statute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, on grounds of public policy, it is more reasonable to conclude
that the legislators intended to divest the Court of First Instance of the
prerogative to <span class="SpellE">replevin</span> a property which is a subject
of a seizure and forfeiture proceedings for violation of the Tariff and Customs
Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, actions for forfeiture
of property for violation of Customs laws could easily be undermined by the
simple device of <span class="SpellE">replevin</span>'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The judicial recourse of the owner of a
personal property which has been the subject of a seizure and forfeiture
proceedings before the Collector of Customs is not in the Court of First
Instance but in the Court of Tax Appeals, and only after exhausting
administrative remedies in the Bureau of Customs (Collector of Customs v.
Torres, 45 SCRA 281).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the property
owner believes that the Collector's conclusion was erroneous, the remedy is by
appeal to the Commissioner of Customs, and then to the Court of Tax Appeals
should the Commissioner uphold the Collector's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Tax Appeals exercises exclusive
appellate jurisdiction to review the ruling of the Commissioner in seizure and
confiscation cases, and that power is to the exclusion of the Court of First
Instance, which may not interfere with the Commissioner's decisions even in the
form of proceedings for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition or <i>mandamus</i> which
are in reality attempts to review the Commissioner's actuations (General Travel
Service, Ltd. v. David, 18 SCRA 66-67)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Again, in <u>Republic v. <span class="SpellE">Bocar</span></u> (93
SCRA 78) the Court said:</p>

<blockquote>“1. The Congress of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was vested with 'the power to define, prescribe, and apportion the jurisdiction
of the various courts' of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Now it is the National Assembly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where the matter involved is a seizure and
forfeiture proceeding, a court of first instance is devoid of power to
act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The customs authorities possess
such competence with an appeal to the Court of Tax Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In appropriate cases, there may be further
judicial review by this Court in the exercise of its certiorari
jurisdiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdictional limits
thus defined and apportioned, according to the Constitution, must be
respected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent judges clearly did
not do so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No deference was paid to a
host of cases that left no doubt as to their lack of authority to assume
jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. An excerpt from a recent decision, Commissioner of Customs v.
Navarro, 77 SCRA 264, possesses relevance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'That such jurisdic­tion of
the customs authorities is exclusive was made clear in <span class="SpellE">Pacis</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Averia</span>, decided in 1966.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court, speaking through Justice J.P. <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, realistically observed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'This original jurisdiction of the Court of
First Instance, when exercised in an action for recovery of personal property
which is a subject of forfeiture proceeding in the Bureau of <span class="SpellE">Bustoms</span>, tends to encroach upon, and to render futile, the
jurisdic­tion of the Collector of Customs in seizure and forfeiture
proceedings.' The court 'should yield to the jurisdiction of the Collector of
Customs.' Such a ruling, as pointed out by Justice <span class="SpellE">Zaldivar</span>
in <span class="SpellE">Auyong</span> <span class="SpellE">Hian</span> v. Court of
Tax Appeals, promulgated less than a year later, could be traced to Government
v. Gale, a 1913 decision, where there was a recognition in the opinion of
Justice Carson that a Collector of Customs when sitting in forfeiture proceedings
constitutes a tribunal upon which the law expressly confers juris­diction to
hear and determine all questions touching the forfeiture and further
disposition of the subject matter of such proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The controlling principle was set forth anew
in Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Vinuya</span>,
decided in 1971.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'The prevailing doctrine is that the
exclusive jurisdiction in seizure and forfeiture cases vested in the Collector
of Customs precludes a court of first instance from assuming cognizance over
such a matter.' Reference was then made in the opinion to previous
cases.'"<o:p></o:p></blockquote>
