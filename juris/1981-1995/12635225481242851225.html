Accused Rodolfo Quibate appeals the decision of the Court of First 
Instance of Capiz finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the 
crime of parricide and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> and to indemnify the heirs of Prima Baltar-Quibate.
<p>
Around 4:00 in the early morning of July 22, 1978, the accused-appellant
 stabbed his wife Prima Baltar to death in a fit of jealousy.  The 
couple's ten-year old daughter, Imelda Quibate, testified that her 
father stabbed her mother to death with a knife while the two were 
quarreling in the balcony of their house at Aranguel, President Roxas, 
Capiz.  The daughter stated that the quarrel arose from her father's 
jealousy of "Gabi" their neighbor.  Imelda ran to the house of her 
uncle, Alberto Baltar who immediately went to his sister's house.  
Alberto saw his sister already dead, the accused-appellant drumming the 
death weapon against the window sill.  When the police arrived at the 
scene, Quibate was still holding the knife.  The accused tried to kill 
himself with the knife pointed at his chest but when Corporal Calixto 
Morales fired a shot with his revolver, the accused surrendered the 
knife.
</p><p>
The wounds suffered by the deceased were stated by Dr. Manuel 
Buenvenida, rural health physician of President Roxas, Capiz, in his 
autopsy report as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "1.  Incised wound at the left side of the chest above nipple, per­forating, 1" wide. </p>
  <p> "2.  Incised wound at the right side of the chest below the nipple, perforating, 1" wide. </p>
  <p> "3.  Incised wound at the left side of abdomen, at the iliac side, 4" below the navel, perforating, 1" wide. </p>
  <p> "4.  Incised wound at the medial and posterior aspect of the left forearm, 1 cm. wide, gapping, (sic) involving the skin. </p>
  <p> "5.  Abrasions-hematoma at the right arms and forearms. </p>
  <p> "The deceased died of shock secondary to profuse hemorrhage.'"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The accused-appellant raised two assignments of errors in this appeal, namely -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I.    THE COURT ERRED IN MOTO PROPRIO CANCELLING THE PROMULGATION OF DECISION OF MARCH 4, 1980. </p>
  <p> "II.   THE COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED OF THE CRIME OF PARRICIDE."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The trial court promulgated its decision on March 4, 1980 sentencing the
 accused to an inde­terminate period of imprisonment of 12 years minimum
 to 17 years maximum.  However, immediately after promulgating it on 
that day, the court had second thoughts and issued the following order:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "After the promulgation of this case, the court moto proprio cancels the promulgation upon noting that the regular counsel <em>de oficio</em>,
 Atty. Antonio Bisnar was not around at the time and the accused refused
 to sign receipt of a copy of the decision and upon noting that there 
was a typographical error in the decision consisting of the wrong 
penalty and the court noting further that the decision have not been 
filed. </p>
  <p> "Notifying accused and counsel of the new date of promulgation which is hereby set for March 20, 1980."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It may be noted that apart from cancelling the promulgation, the court 
ordered that the accused and his missing counsel be notified of the new 
date of promulgation which was set for March 20, 1980.
</p><p>
On March 20, 1980, the counsel <em>de oficio</em> was again absent so 
the court appointed a well-known practitioner in the area, Atty. Jose 
Alovera, to assist the accused in the promulgation and to coor­dinate 
with the other counsel Atty. Antonio Bisnar.  Promulgation was re-set to
 April 1, 1980.
</p><p>
On March 27, 1980, Atty. Alovera filed a motion to advance the date of 
promulgation to March 31, 1980 as counsel had to leave for Iloilo City 
on April 1, 1980.  The motion to advance the date of promulgation was 
considered on April 1, 1980.  Promulgation was re-set to April 11, 1980.
</p><p>
On April 11, 1980, an oral motion to quash promulgation was made.  No 
memorandum in support of the motion was filed and the records fail to 
indicate the grounds relied upon by counsel.  On June 9, 1980, the 
motion to quash promulgation was denied.  The promulgation was reset to 
June 13, 1980 on which date the questioned decision imposing <em>reclusion perpetua</em> instead of the earlier indeterminate period of imprisonment of 12 years as minimum and 17 years as maximum was rendered.
</p><p>
We resolve the second assignment of error first.  The allegation that 
the marriage of the accused-appellant and the deceased was not 
established has no merit.
</p><p>
The marriage contract (Exhibit B) evidencing the marriage solemnized on 
May 16, 1954 was intro­duced in evidence.  Father Gaudioso Tropico of 
the Roman Catholic church testified that he solemnized the marriage of 
the accused and Prima Baltar and that the newly married couple, the 
witnesses, and himself signed the said marriage contract in each others 
presence.  True, the contract shows that Prima Baltar was married to 
"Teodulfo" Quibate but defense witness Atty. Jose Azarraga testified 
that the accused used the name "Teodulfo" when they were classmates.  
The accused himself admitted that he used to be called "Teodulfo".  On 
the fact of marriage, Alberto Baltar testified that he was present in 
church when his sister and the accused were married.  Father Gaudioso 
Tropico, on re-direct examination was asked to go around the courtroom 
and identify the "Teodulfo Quibate" whose marriage he solemnized.  He 
did so and picked out the accused-appellant.  The accused-appellant did 
not deny the marriage but admitted during trial that he and his late 
wife were married, that they were married by Father Tropico who 
testi­fied in the case.
</p><p>
The appellant raises no issue in this appeal regarding his main defense 
during the trial below that he acted in self-defense.  We have 
nonetheless examined the records on this point because of the serious 
nature of the crime.  We find no error in the court's rejecting this 
defense.  The allegation of self-defense has no basis.
</p><p>
The accused-appellant testified that two months before the fatal 
incident, he caught his wife having sexual intercourse with their 
neighbor "Gabi" or "Gabe" and that he called her to come up their house.
  He was so angry that he boxed her.  Gabi was not only bigger than the 
accused, but he also had a gun.  Yet when he wanted to have sexual 
intercourse with his wife, she refused.  When he insisted, she still 
refused.  According to the accused, he begged for almost two hours to 
have sex with his wife but she refused.  Later on, he noticed that she 
took a knife from a "baul" or clothes trunk by her side and tried to 
stab him.  They grappled for the knife and she was hit.  The trial court
 found the story of self-defense not believable.  We agree.  The 
accused-appellant, in a fit of jealousy, stabbed his wife inflicting the
 four separate incised wounds described in the autopsy report, which 
resulted in shock, profuse hemorrhage, and death.
</p><p>
The appellant states in his first assignment of error that the lower 
court erred in cancelling the March 4, 1980 promulgation because the 
grounds given by the court do not warrant such a cancellation.
</p><p>
The appellant questions the cancellation and resetting of promulgation 
stating that the counsel did not have to be present during the 
promulgation of judgment and that there was no need to nullify a 
pro­mulgation already effected simply because the accused refused to 
sign.  According to the appellant's brief, the appellant refused to sign
 because he did not know how to write.
</p><p>
It is not required that counsel for the accused must be present when 
judgment is promulgated for it to be valid and effective.  However, 
considering the level of intelligence of the accused and the serious 
nature of the offense, the Court had reason to require counsel's 
presence during promulgation.  The court, however, followed a manifestly
 strange procedure when it pronounced the sentence of conviction and 
then immediately afterwards, reconsidered and cancelled the whole thing 
on the ground, among others, that the lawyer was not present.  On 
noticing that there was no lawyer for the accused, the Court should have
 deferred the promulga­tion of the decision if it wanted counsel to be 
around.
</p><p>
It is obvious from the appealed decision that the presiding Judge had 
conflicting feelings in his mind when the date for promulgation arrived.
  If so, he should have resolved them before going ahead.
</p><p>
The decision reads, in part:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The Court finds in accordance with Art. 13, of the Revised Penal 
Code, mental weakness, and voluntary surrender.  Likewise, the Court 
considers the history of infidelity of the victim's wife, coupled with 
her refusal to perform her marital duties, after accused had begged for 
two (2) hours, immediately preceding the stabbing, as analogous to an 
aggression and should also be considered mitigating.  The Court believes
 that the attitude and behaviour of the accused, such as the tenderness 
he showed to his daughter Imelda after the latter's testimony, shows 
remorse and lack of real malice. </p>
  <p> "In view thereof, the Court recom­mends Executive Clemency, such as would reduce the imprisonment to a lesser period."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The procedure followed by the lower court is not the most appropriate 
under the circumstances but it does not constitute a ground to nullify 
the decision later promulgated.
</p><p>
The second reason about the refusal to sign may have been insufficient 
to warrant postponement of promulgation of judgment but, under the 
circumstances, it is not a basis to set aside or modify the appealed 
decision.
</p><p>
Regarding the last ground for the first assign­ment of error, it is 
unlikely that the imposition of a sentence of 12 to 17 years 
imprisonment instead of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> would be a 
typographical error.  It was not.  It was an error of hasty judgment 
based on a misapprehension of the provisions of the Revised Penal Code 
applicable to the facts of the case.  The lower court made a mistake and
 it should have taken immediate steps to rectify it instead of waiting 
for more than three months.
</p><p>
The more serious questions arising from the facts of this case are not 
raised in the appellant's brief but the Court has decided to resolve 
them considering that a man's liberty is at stake and the lower court 
itself has recommended executive clemency for the appellant.
</p><p>
What was the effect of the cancellation of promulgation on March 4, 
1980?  Did the decision whose promulgation was cancelled become final 
and executory fifteen days later on March 19, 1980?  Did the court have 
jurisdiction to impose the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em> on June 13, 1980?
</p><p>
Under Section 7 of Rule 120 of the Rules of Court, a judgment of 
conviction may be modified or set aside by the court rendering it before
 the judgment becomes final or an appeal is perfected.  In the instant 
case, no appeal had been perfected when the trial court set aside its 
judgment and cancelled its promulgation.  But had the judgment become 
final?  The cited section provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A judgment in a criminal case becomes final after the lapse of 
the period for perfecting an appeal, or when the sentence has been 
partially or totally satisfied or served, or the defendant has expressly
 waived in writing his right to appeal."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In the case at bar, the judgment of conviction and its promulgation were
 set aside on the very day that the judgment was promulgated.  At that 
time, the period for perfecting an appeal had not lapsed; and the 
accused had not waived his right to appeal.  Only if he were deemed to 
have commenced service of his sentence could the judgment be deemed 
final.
</p><p>
The law gives the accused 15 days after promulgation of a judgment of 
conviction within which to decide whether he will take an appeal or not;
 and unless he has expressly waived in writing his right to appeal or 
has voluntarily commenced service of his sentence, the accused may yet 
take an appeal within the 15-day period.  (See People vs. Valle, 7 SCRA 
1025; Mabuhay Insurance and Guaranty, Inc. vs. Court of Appeals, 32 SCRA
 245).  The accused was returned to the same detention cell where he was
 confined pending trial.  He never intimated acceptance of the judgment 
or that he would no longer appeal.
</p><p>
From the above considerations, it follows that when the trial court 
cancelled the promulgation it had just concluded, it were as if no 
decision had been rendered and no judgment had been imposed.  The 
promulgation or the entire process had been set aside to be effected on a
 future date.  The decision promulgated on June 13, 1980 would not 
merely be an amendment of the sentence imposed earlier but would be the 
decision itself being promulgated in the case.  Consequently, there was 
no judgment to become final and executory except from June 13, 1980.  If
 the court had decided to commit the accused to jail on March 19, 1980, 
there would have been no basis for the execution of judgment and the 
commitment as the decision promulgated earlier had been cancelled and 
set aside.  The accused could not have accepted a judgment or commenced 
to serve a sentence based on a cancelled and, therefore, non-existent 
promulgation.
</p><p>
We find in this case an opportune occasion to remind all trial courts to
 devote a little more time to the study of the penalty provisions of the
 Revised Penal Code immediately before promulgating each decision, to 
obviate the necessity of issuing amended or "repromulgated" decisions 
increasing sentences of imprisonment.  Trial courts should likewise note
 the dictum in Flores v. Dalisay (84 SCRA 46, 48).
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "What the trial court should have done was to have categorically asked the counsel <em>de oficio</em> of the accused (who was not the counsel <em>de oficio</em>
 who handled the defense of the accused) whether or not he would appeal.
  Because the accused did not file any notice of appeal immediately 
after the judgment was promulgated, the trial court jumped to the 
conclusion that he had no intention of taking an appeal.  x x x  x x x  x
 x x."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Considering the factual circumstances of this case, the low intelligence
 of the accused, and the gravity of the offense of parricide, it was the
 duty of the lower court on March 4, 1980 to ascertain whether or not 
the detention prisoner whose sentence of convic­tion had just been read 
intended to appeal.  Upon the answer would have defended its power to 
modify the deci­sion but within the period for the taking of an appeal.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Capiz finding 
the accused-appellant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of 
parricide and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion 
per­petua is hereby AFFIRMED.  The accused-appellant is also ordered to 
indemnify the heirs of Prima Baltar Quibate in the sum of THIRTY 
THOUSAND (P30,000.00) PESOS.

<p align="center"><strong>CONCURRING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
AQUINO, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
Judge Oscar Leviste's decision dated March 3, 1980 was promulgated on 
the following day, March 4, in the absence of accused's counsel, Antonio
 Bisnar. The accused (a registered voter who studied at the Elizalde 
Academy) refused to sign on the original copy of the decision as proof 
that he received a copy of the decision.
</p><p>
It is stated in the handwritten minutes of the incident that "when this 
case was called for promulga­tion of decision, the court interpreter 
read the whole decision and after which the dispositive part of the 
decision was translated to the accused. The Court sentences the accused 
(to) 12 years to 17 years. Later, the Court discovered that Atty. 
Bisnar, counsel <em>de oficio</em> for the accused, was not present in court. The Court appointed Atty. Jose Brotario as counsel <em>de oficio</em> for the purpose of promulgation. The dispo­sitive portion of the decision was read to the accused."
</p><p>
The said minutes were signed by the court inter­preter. The deputy clerk
 of court executed a certi­fication as to the promulgation and the 
refusal of the accused to affix his signature on the original copy.
</p><p>
<em>A few hours later on that same day,</em> March 4, 1980, Judge Leviste issued an order <em>cancelling the promulgation</em> (1) due to the absence of Bisnar, the regular counsel <em>de oficio</em>,
 (2) the refusal of accused to sign as proof that he received a copy of 
the decision, (3) the im­position of the wrong penalty and (4) the fact 
"that the decision has not been filed".
</p><p>
In fact, the said decision is in the record but it contains numerous 
handwritten corrections made by Judge Leviste. It was retyped. The 
retyped decision, imposing <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, dated March 5, 1980, and the original decision of March 3, 1980 (with corrections) were <em>both refiled in court at 4:30 p.m. on March 5, 1980.</em>
</p><p>
Later, or on April 11, 1980, there was an oral motion to quash the 
second promulgation. It was denied by Judge Leviste in his order of June
 9, 1980.
</p><p>
The corrected decision of March 5, 1980 was pro­mulgated on <em>June 13, 1980</em>. The accused and his counsel <em>signed</em>
 the original copy of the said decision. The clerk of court certified to
 the promulgation on June 13, 1980. This was also signed by the accused 
(pp. 126-7, Record).
</p><p>
Written notices of the decision were sent to the fiscal, the warden and 
Bisnar on June 16, 1980. Bisnar filed his notice of appeal to the Court 
of Appeals.
</p><p>
The minutes of the proceeding on June 13, 1980 show that Bisnar objected
 to the promulgation of the corrected decision and insisted that the 
promulgation of the first decision was valid.
</p><p>
Judge Leviste had the power and jurisdiction to correct his decision of 
March 3, 1980 which was not yet officially filed. He corrected it on the
 same day and filed the corrected copy on March 5, 1980 together with 
the original decision of March 3, 1980.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A judgment of conviction may be modified or set aside by the 
court rendering it before the judgment has become final or appeal has 
been perfected. A judgment in a criminal case becomes final after the 
lapse of the period for perfecting an appeal, or when the sentence has 
been partially or totally satisfied or served, or the defendant has 
expressly waived in writing his right to appeal." (Sec. 7, Rule 120, 
Rules of Court.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The accused or his counsel should expressly inform the court that he 
does not want to appeal or is going to start serving his sentence. In 
the absence of such manifestation, the judge can change his decision 
within the reglementary fifteen-day period. It is not right to 
conjecture from the silence of the accused-detainee in the absence of 
his counsel that he started to serve his sentence. (People vs. Español, 
G. R. No. 57597-99, June 29, 1982, 114 SCRA 911.)
</p><p>
In this case, counsel <em>de oficio</em>'s absence during the first 
promulgation rendered it uncertain whether or not the accused was going 
to appeal. The fact that he was a detention prisoner does not justify 
the con­jecture that he did not appeal and that he had started the 
service of his sentence on March 4, 1980.
</p><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" width="60%" align="center">
<p align="center"><strong>DISSENTING OPINION
</strong>

</p><p><strong>
ESCOLIN, J.:
</strong>
</p><p>
I dissent. The records disclose that after the promulgation of the first
 decision on March 4, 1980, petitioner did not manifest his desire to 
appeal and was therefore committed to jail; that the 15-day period to 
appeal lapsed without petitioner having perfected his appeal; and that 
before the promulgation of the new decision on June 30, 1980, he 
vehemently objected to the cancellation of the March 4, 1980 
promulgation as well as the promul­gation of the new judgment. Surely, 
any doubt as to the conclusion to be drawn from this factual setting 
should be resolved in favor of the peti­tioner's posture that he 
immediately commenced service of sentence after the promulgation of the 
first decision, and that therefore the same became final in accordance 
with the rule that a judgment in a criminal case becomes final when the 
sentence has been partially served. [Section 7, Rule 120 of the Rules of
 Court].
