<p class="BODY">The verbal agreement regarding the disposition of the property
was confirmed in a letter of China Bank signed by four of the children and one
daughter-in-law on <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The heirs were given the right to repurchase

<p class="BODY">There are allegations that some of the heirs tried to buy the

unable to do so.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, on August 30, 1974, or one day before the end of, the
period to buy back, petitioner D. Annie Tan went to the office of Mr. Dee K. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> of China Bank <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
tendered her China Bank Manager's Check for P180,000.00 as payment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon the insistence of the bank official, the
deed of sale returning the property to the heirs was executed in favor, not of
D. Annie Tan who alone paid for the property but of all the six heirs of Tan <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> Tick who would, therefore, share and share alike.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

EXERCISED BY THE HEIRS SINGLY OR COLLECTIVELY.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 21-22)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The decision of the trial court, affirmed by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the Court of Appeals, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">is </span>based on the principle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">that the heirs of Mr. and </span>Mrs. Tan <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Tick </span>being

This explains why the courts below ordered four of the heirs -- George </span>Laurel

Tan, and Rosita Tan -- <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>reimburse

petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The petitioner contends
that there was no co-ownership </span>and no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">creditor-debtor relationship between her and the other children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner states:</p>

<blockquote>"This controversy addresses itself to the question of whether
or not the co-ownership among the heirs over a parcel of land formerly
belonging to their parents had been dissolved by the foreclosure and
consolidation of title by a bank after the redemption period of one (1) year
had expired, such that a unilateral obligation given by the bank to the heirs
to buy back the foreclosed property out of liberality is actually an option to
buy given to the heirs as group of persons singly or collectively, and not
strictly a right of re-purchase to be exercised by the heirs as co-owners.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If it is admitted that the co-ownership of
the heirs over the foreclosed property of their parents had been dissolved by
the consolidation of the title in the mortgagee's name, which in this case is
respondent Bank, and that there exists no creditor-debtor relationship between
respondent Bank and the heirs, then the bank may not impose an obligation to
the heirs that they should purchase back the property only as former co-owners
or as <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors, but as groups of persons,
singly or collectively.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bank would
then be imposing an onerous condition upon the heirs of going back to the
dissolved co-ownership which the law frowns upon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To settle this case once and for all, herein
petitioner anchors her claim <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">on </span>the
theory that when the respondent Bank foreclosed the property and consolidated
its title on August 16, 1973 and T.C.T. No. 112924 was issued in its name, the
co-ownership of the heirs of the deceased parents of petitioner and private
respondents over the pro­perty in question have been dissolved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this wise, the decision of the respondent
court premised on the existence of a co-ownership or in a creditor-debtor
relationship, and ordering the reimbursement to petitioner of the money for the
purchase of the property in question which allegedly redounded to the benefits
of her co-heirs as co-owners or <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> debtors has
no leg to stand on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is this erroneous
decision of respondent court based on a misapprehension of facts and contrary
to settled jurisprudence that petitioner comes to this Honorable Court, for
relief.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Sese</span>

<p class="BODY">The first question which arises is the correctness of the
assumption that there was a co-ownership among the children of Tan <span class="SpellE">Tiong</span> Tick and Tan <span class="SpellE">Ong</span> Hun when
the peti­tioner purchased the property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the lot and its improvement were mortgaged by the deceased
parents, there can be no question that a co-ownership existed among the heirs
during the period given by law to redeem the foreclosed property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Redemp­tion by one during this period would
have inured to the benefit of all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Adille</span> v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.

148 SCRA 75 [1987]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The records show, however, that when the petitioner purchased the
disputed property on <st1:date year="1974" day="30" month="8">August 30, 1974</st1:date>,
any co-ownership among the brothers and sisters no longer existed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The period to redeem had expired more than
one year earlier, on <st1:date year="1973" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1973</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent China Bank consolidated its
ownership and a new title was issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in
</span>the bank's name.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When the heirs
allowed the one year redemption period to expire without redeeming their
parents' former property and permitted the consolidation of ownership and the
issuance of a new title, the co-ownership was extinguished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The challenged ruling of the respondent court
is, therefore, based on erroneous premises.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 63-B of Presidential Decree No. 1529, the Property
Registration Decree, in case of non-redemption, the purchaser at the

of the land and improvements to all the heirs "in equal undivided
shares."</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no such stipulation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">in </span>the letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is
reference to a verbal agreement to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">"<u>heirs</u></span> of your late
father" but no requirement that every­body must share in the purchase or
the offer would be withdrawn.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is clear is that the bank's general manager, Mr. Dee K. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> tried to impose the above requirement when the one
year period to buy back was about to expire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Mr. Dee rejected the offer of D. Annie, Tan to buy the property for
herself alone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He insisted that the
money brought by the petitioner would be considered a joint fund of all the heirs
and ordered the same annotated on the back of the check given as payment for
the pro­perty.</p>

<p class="BODY">This attitude of Mr. Dee K. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> is
in sharp con­trast to the bank's official stand embodied in a letter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to </span>the Central Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Asked to comment on a
letter-complaint filed by </span>D. Annie Tan with <span class="SpellE">Malacanang</span>
and forwarded to the Central Bank, the respondent bank through its Legal
Officer wrote the Director, Department of Commercial and Savings Bank, Central
Bank an explanation, part of which states:</p>

<blockquote>"To our mind, the dispute is not
between the Bank and the heirs or any one of them, but among the heirs
themselves, for as far as the Bank is concerned, it makes no difference whether
the property is <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to all the heirs or to any
one of them alone as they may agree.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
a matter of fact the complainant has already filed a Petition under the
Cadastral Case now pending in the CFI, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
involving the property and all the heirs, (Copy of the Petition is hereto
attached as Annex "10").</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At any rate, it is our honest
conviction that the charges filed by the complainant and the interpretation
Articles 1302 and 1303 of the New Civil Code properly belong to the Courts
where the complainant can always have her right, if any, vindicated, and if
only to re-solve the issue, we shall welcome any court action to clear the
matter." (Folder of Exhibits, pp. 97-98)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner questions the unusual interest shown by China Bank
in the case when its stand should be one of neutrality.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She claims that there is an orchestrated alliance
between the bank and the other private respondents as shown by the fact that
the bank seems to be mote eager and vigorous than the other heirs to win, the
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 310).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, there is nothing in the <st1:date year="1973" day="3" month="8">August 3, 1973</st1:date> letter-agreement which called for
either a purchase by all the heirs or no purchase at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But could not Mr. Dee K. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span>
validly impose such a requirement at the time the tender of money to buy the
property was made?</p>

<p class="BODY">Again, the answer is in the negative.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the petitioner that her agreeing to sign an
annotation at the back of the check was a case of vitiated consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She states that her conformity was null and
void because it was made under duress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The records show that up to the last hour the petitioner was pleading
with Mr. Dee K. <span class="SpellE">Chiong</span> to buy the property for
herself alone as the money she had raised was not in any way owned by the other
heirs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since the period was expir­ing,
the petitioner had no choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was a
case of either agreeing to the bank executive's requirement or losing the
family property forever to strangers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Mr. Dee could not impose a new co-ownership upon the petitioner,
her brothers and sisters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Co-ownership
is discouraged by law.</p>
