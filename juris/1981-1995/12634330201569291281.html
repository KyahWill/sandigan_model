				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for the
issuance of a temporary restraining order to annul the order<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a> of the public respondent National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC) in NLRC Case No. SR-BIV­-1-2345-89 entitled “BLUE BAR COCONUT
SUPERVISORS' UNION, represented by its President versus BLUE BAR COCONUT
PHILS., INC.” for having been issued with grave abuse of discretion amounting
to lack of jurisdiction in denying the Omnibus Motion to Dismiss filed by
petitioner Blue Bar Coconut Phils., Inc.<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts as culled from the records of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 18, 1984, the Blue Bar Coconut Workers' Union
(BBCWU, for brevity) composing the rank and file employees of petitioner Blue
Bar Coconut Phils., Inc. (BBCP, for brevity) staged a strike.  The <span style="">supervisors
of petitioner </span>BBCP who were not then <span style="">formally organized into </span>a union, individually abstained from
joining the strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the continuing financial pressures brought about by this
labor dispute which gave rise to serious labor problems, petitioner BBCP, in
the exercise of its sound business judgment filed with the then Ministry of
Labor and Employment (MOLE) a Formal Notice of Closure of Business dated March
21, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">In accordance with Article 264 (g) of the Labor Code as<i> </i>amended,
the MOLE, <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u> assumed jurisdiction over the labor
dispute and accordingly on March 27, 1985 issued an order directing all
striking workers “to report for work and management to accept them under the
same terms and conditions <span style="">prevailing </span>before
the work stoppage.”</p>

<p class="BODY">In compliance with said Order of the MOLE, petitioner BBCP
resumed its operations <span style="">and requested </span>all
employees including the supervisors to return to their respective posts and
assignments.  However, on the day of the
resumption of operations, the striking union, BBCWU staged a mass rally which
resulted in a shooting incident causing havoc and panic in BBCP's compound.  Hence, petitioner BBCP ceased its operations
and for the second time closed its business.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 10, 1985, a return to work order was again issued by the
then Ministry of Labor which order was allegedly disregarded by petitioner
BBCP.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 11, 1986 or after a year of its temporary closure of
business, the petitioner <span style="">BBCP </span>and
the BBCWU representing the striking rank and file workers with the mediation of
the MOLE entered into a compromise agreement (Annex “C”).</p>

<p class="BODY">In an Order dated November 13, 1986, the then Minister of Labor
and Employment approved the compromise agreement (Rollo, p. 47; Annex “D”).</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the members of BBCWU executed releases and
quitclaims in favor of petitioner BBCP in consideration of the benefits
received by way of settlement for any and all claims that they may have against
petitioner BBCP accruing from March 27, 1985, the day petitioner BBCP ceased
its business operations up to and including November 11, 1986, the day the
compromise agreement was entered into by and between petitioner BBCP and BBCWU.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The individual supervisors were also made to execute releases and
quitclaims in favor of petitioner <span style="">BBCP </span>after
receiving the monetary awards provided for in the said compromise agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 13, 1989, the supervisors formally organized into a
union with Blue Bar Coconut Supervisors' Union (BBSU, for brevity) as its
registered name.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 9, 1989, private respondent BBSU filed a complaint
for "all monies lawfully due them during the period of the illegal lockout
committed by <span style="">petitioner </span>BBCP
during the period 1984 to 1986" with the Sub-Regional Arbitration Branch
No. IV of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) (Rollo, p. 171).</p>

<p class="BODY">Trial of the case ensued.  During the proceedings on August 14, 1990, private respondent BBSU
amended the period from March 27, 1985 to November 11, 1986 in order to conform
with its evidence (Rollo, p. 171).</p>

<p class="BODY">After<i> </i><span style="">private
respondent BBSU </span>rested<i> </i><span style="">its
case, </span>petitioner BBCP filed on September 6, 1990 an Omnibus Motion to
Dismiss <span style="">the case on grounds of <u>res</u>
</span><u>judicata</u> and prescription (Rollo, p. 25; Annex “A”).</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 20, 1990, the public respondent rendered its Order
denying the motion on the ground that “(t)o evaluate the merits and demerits of
the case <span style="">at </span>this point in time,
would only constitute prejudg­ment <span style="">notwithstanding
the </span>respondent's right to present its evidence <span style="">in case of denial.  This kind of
procedure </span>if allowed runs counter to the mandate of summary nature of
proceedings in labor cases.” Hence it set the continuation of the hearing of
the case (Rollo, p. 41, Annex “B”).</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence this petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its resolution dated July 31, 1991, the Second Division of
this Court gave due course to this petition (Rollo, p. 180).<span style="font-size: 5pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner BBCP contends
that the public respondent committed grave abuse of discretion tantamount to
lack of jurisdiction and crucial error in denying the Omnibus Motion of
petitioner without delving into the propriety of the arguments stated therein
despite the provisions of the rules of procedure of the NLRC on the immediate
resolution of a motion to dismiss on the ground of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u>
and prescription (Rollo, p. 7; Petition, p. 6).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner BBCP asserts that private respondent BBSU's money
claim is barred by <u>res</u> <u>j</u><u><span style="">udicata</span></u><span style=""> </span>and prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following must concur for a prior judgment to constitute a
bar to a subsequent case:  (1) the
judgment must be final; (2) the judgment must have been rendered by a court
having jurisdiction over the subject matter and the parties; (3) the judgment
must be on the merits; and (4) there must be between the first and second
actions, identity of parties, of subject matter, and of cause of action (Sta.
Monica Industrial and Development Corporation v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No.
83290, September 21, 1990; 189 SCRA 792).</p>

<p class="BODY">As admitted by petitioner BBCP, the compromise agreement dated
November 11, 1986 was executed by and between the petitioner BBCP and
BBCWU.  Private respondent BBSU was not
a signatory to the compromise agreement.  Hence there was no identity of the parties.  <u>Res</u><b> </b><u>judicata</u> does not lie.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner BBCP contends that private respondent BBSU bound
themselves to the provisions of the compromise agreement by accepting the
benefits stated therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that each of the members of BBSU received the benefits
from petitioner BBCP and executed quitclaims does not bar them from demanding
the benefits to which they are legally entitled.  Acceptance of those benefits does not amount to estoppel (De Leon
v. NLRC, G.R. No. 52056, October 30, 1980; 100 SCRA 691; Mercury Drug Co., Inc.
v. CFI, G.R. No. L-23357, April 30, 1974; 56 SCRA 694).  Furthermore, quitclaims executed by laborers
are commonly frowned upon as contrary to public policy and ineffective to bar
claims for the full measure of the workers' legal rights (Lopez Sugar Corp. v.
FFW, G.R. No. 75700-01, August 30, 1990; 189 SCRA 179).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, with regard to prescription, petitioner BBCP correctly
argues that private respondent BBSU's money, claim since March 27, 1985 has
already <span style="">prescribed.  Under Article 292 (now 291) of the Labor
Code, all money claims arising from employer-employee </span>relations must be
filed within three (3) years from the time the cause of action accrued,
otherwise they shall forever be barred.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled jurisprudence that a cause of action has three
elements, to wit:  (1) a right in favor
of the plaintiff by whatever means and under whatever law it arises or is
created; (2) an obligation on the part of the named defendant to respect or not
to violate such right; and (3) an act or omission on the part of such defendant
violative of the right of the plaintiff or constituting a breach of the
obligation of the defendant to the plaintiff (Baliwag Transit, Inc. v. Ople,
G.R. No. 57642, March 16, 1989; 171 SCRA 250).  It is only when the last element occurs or takes place that it can be
said in law that a cause of action has arisen (Kramer, Jr. v. Court of Appeals,
G.R. No. 83524, October 13, 1989, 178 SCRA 518).</p>

<p class="BODY">From the foregoing, it is clear that private respondent BBSU's
cause of action accrued on March 27, 1985, the day petitioner BBCP ceased its
business operations.  Thus, when private
respondent BBSU filed its complaint for payment of money claims on November 11,
1989, more than four (4) years had already elapsed from the time its cause of
action accrued.  Hence, prescription has
already set in.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the filing of the Omnibus Motion to Dismiss on the
grounds of <u>res</u> <u>judicata</u> and prescription even after the private
respondent had rested its case should have been resolved by the public
respondent.  This is in consonance with
Section 14 of the Revised Rules of the NLRC (which was the rule in force at the
time the complaint was filed) thus -</p>

<blockquote>“Section 14.  Motion to
Dismiss. - Any motion to dismiss a complaint or petition on the ground that ...
the cause of action is barred by prior judgment or by prescription shall be
immediately acted upon by the Labor Arbiter if the acts strongly indicate
dismissal.  x x x”<b><o:p></o:p></b></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The filing of the Omnibus Motion to Dismiss only after the
private respondent had rested its case does not constitute a waiver of the
defense of prescription.  It will be
noted that the above-cited section does not provide for the specific period
within which to file a motion to dismiss (Pepsi-Cola v. Guanzon, G.R. No.
81162, April 19, 1989; 172 SCRA 571).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, (1) the Order of the public
respondent dated September 20, 1990 is SET ASIDE; and (2) public respondent is
ordered to dismiss the complaint.</p>
