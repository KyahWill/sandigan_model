				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On
April 28, 1992, Executive Judge Roger A. <span class="SpellE">Domagas</span>,
Regional Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span>, <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>,
thru a telegram, conveyed to the Supreme Court his decision to suspend for one
year respondent Delia <span class="SpellE">Malana</span>, stenographer of Branch
3, RTC, <span class="SpellE">Tuguegarao</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Cagayan</span></span> for having admitted committing acts of
falsification of records in Administrative Cases Nos. 3242 and 3162.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Upon
investigation by Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Domagas</span>, it appears
that Administrative Case No. 3242 was originally entitled "In Re: Petition
for Issuance of New Certificate of Title in Lieu of Lost One," with <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span> <span class="SpellE">Taguba</span> as petitioner.
Respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span>, however, changed the title of the
Administrative Case No. 3242 to "In Re: Petition For Issuance of Another
Copy of Original Certificate of Title No. 1268, Catalina <span class="SpellE">Maribbay</span>,
Petitioner" in order to make it appear that the following documents,
actually issued in connection with the petition of <span class="SpellE">Rufo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Taguba</span>, were issued in relation to the petition of
Catalina <span class="SpellE">Maribbay</span>, to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Order dated November 21, 1991 of Judge <span class="SpellE">Domagas</span> granting the petition for issuance of another owner's
copy of OCT No. 1268 and further directing the Register of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> to issue OCT No. 1268. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span> without any authority affixed the rubber stamp
"ORIGINAL SIGNED" above the typewritten name of Judge <span class="SpellE">Domagas</span> to create the impression that said judge issued and
signed the Order aforementioned.<o:p></o:p></span></font></blockquote>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certification dated </span></font><st1:date year="1991" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1991</st1:date> bearing the
signature of Clerk of Court Consuelo A. Rodriguez, forged by respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span>. This document states that the aforementioned order
of <st1:date year="1991" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1991</st1:date>, issued
in Administrative Case No. 3242 has not been amended, supplemented or modified
by any subsequent order or process of the court and that the same has become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as of <st1:date year="1991" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1991</st1:date>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">In
Administrative Case No. 3162 entitled "In Re: Petition for the Issuance of
<span class="GramE">Another</span> Owner's Copy of TCT Nos. T-54574, T-54575 and
T-54372, <span class="SpellE">Benigna</span> Ballad, Petitioner," respondent
<span class="SpellE">Malana</span> employed similar acts of falsification, by
changing the title of said case to "In Re: Petition for the Issuance of <span class="GramE">Another</span> Owner's Copy of TCT Nos. <span class="GramE">T-54574,
T-54575 and T-54372, Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Roca</span>, petitioner.</span>
This was done again to achieve the purpose of making it appear that the
following documents were issued in relation to the petition filed by Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Roca</span> instead of <span class="SpellE">Benigna</span> Ballad,
to wit:<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<span class="SpellE">TCTs</span> and directing the Register of Deeds to issue another
owner's copy thereof. Respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span> again affixed
the rubber stamp "ORIGINAL SIGNED" above the typewritten name of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Domagas</span>, making it appear that he issued and
signed the Order of <st1:date year="1991" day="22" month="1">January 22, 1991</st1:date>
in connection with the petition of Benjamin <span class="SpellE">Roca</span>.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

signature of <span class="SpellE">Tita</span> N. <span class="SpellE">Narag</span>,
to the effect-that the Order of January 22, 1991 has not been amended, supplemented
or modified by any subsequent order or process of the court and that the same
has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> as of February 5,
1991.</span></font></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Respondent
<span class="SpellE">Malana</span>, in this Court's Resolution of </span></font><st1:date year="1992" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1992</st1:date> was required to explain
why she should not be held administratively liable for the acts of
falsification she committed. She was further placed under preventive suspension
for ninety (90) days due to the gravity of the offense perpetrated.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On
</span></font><st1:date year="1992" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1992</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span>, by way of compliance with this
Court's Resolution of <st1:date year="1992" day="15" month="7">July 15, 1992</st1:date>,
explained in her letter of <st1:date year="1992" day="16" month="9">September
 16, 1992</st1:date>, that both petitioners <span class="SpellE">Maribbay</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Roco</span> never informed her that the titles which
they claim to have lost were actually sold or mortgaged to other persons. She
claims that she was simply made to understand that the titles thereto are clean
and in fact appear to be clean as shown in the records of the Register of
Deeds.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">On
</span></font><st1:date year="1993" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1993</st1:date>,
this case was referred to the Office of the Court Administrator for evaluation,
report and recommendation. Thus, on <st1:date year="1993" day="13" month="4">April
 13, 1993</st1:date>, in a memorandum for the Chief Justice, the Office of the
Court Administrator found the explanation of respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span>
unsatisfactory and unconvincing. It observed that "respondent
stenographer's justifications are grossly inconsistent with and materially
contradictory to the statements given and documents submitted showing that she
actually resorted to falsifying certain documents .with the objective of
facilitating the issuance of new titles in petitioners' favor without the
latter having to go through the normal proceedings required for such purpose.
Moreover, respondent stenographer's admission of culpability is a clear
indication of violation of public trust and confidence, resulting in the
suppression of the truth regarding the matter."<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">The
Office of the Court Administrator cited the case of <span class="SpellE">Caubang</span>
v People, 210 SCRA 377 where it was held that:<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<blockquote><font face="Arial" color="black" size="2"><span style="font-size:11.0pt">"In
a crime of falsification of a public document, the principal thing punished is
the violation of public faith and the destruction of truth as therein solemnly
proclaimed."<o:p></o:p></span></font></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">Considering
the foregoing, the Office of the Court Administrator recommended to this Court
the dismissal from the service of respondent-stenographer reporter Delia <span class="SpellE">Lasam</span> <span class="SpellE">Malana</span> with prejudice to
re-employment in any branch or agency of the government, including government
owned and controlled corporations; the forfeiture of all retirement benefits,
except the monetary value of her leave credits, if any.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<p class="BODY"><font face="Arial" color="black" size="3"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">After
a thorough study of the established facts in this case, we find that the acts
of falsification specified herein were positively committed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span> who has admitted the same before Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Domagas</span> and has failed to provide a satisfactory
explanation that will totally exonerate her of the charge of falsification of
public documents. Consequently, this Court considers as proper and warranted
the recommendation of the Office of the Court Administrator and accordingly adopts
the penalty imposed therein on respondent <span class="SpellE">Malana</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
