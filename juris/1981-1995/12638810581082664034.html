				<H3>STRONGHOLD INSURANCE COMPANY, INC., PETITIONER, VS.
HON. COURT OF APPEALS AND DIESEL INJECTION AND MAGNETO SERVICE COMPANY, RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Private respondent Diesel Injection and Magneto Service Co.
(DIMSCO) sued Lepol Trading and Stronghold Insurance Co. (formerly Mabuhay
Insurance and Guaranty Co.), as principal debtor and surety, respectively, for
the sum of P49,217.62, representing the former's unpaid accounts, including
interests and attorney's fees.  Both
defendants filed separate answers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pre-trial was scheduled but postponed several times, and the
parties <span style="">finally </span>agreed to
proceed to trial on the merits.  Before
this could begin, however, the plaintiff filed a motion for judgment on the
pleadin<span style="">g</span>s, which both defendants
opposed.  When the parties failed to
appear at the hearing of the motion, the same was considered submitted for
resolution.  In a decision dated May 2,
1987, the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City held both defendants solidarily
liable for the amount demanded.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Both defendants appealed to the respondent court, but the appeal
was dismissed.  Only Stronghold moved
for reconsideration, which was denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Stronghold then came to us for relief in this petition for review on <i><u><span style="">certiorari</span></u></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue for resolution is the propriety <span style="">of </span>the judgment on the pleadings
rendered against th<span style="">e</span> petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not elaborate on this issue and simply said
in its decision that it was being rendered "in accordance with Section 1,
Rule 19, of the Rules of Court." The respondent court sustained it,
holding that the averments in the complaint had not been specifically denied
(although it did not specify by whom).  It went on to say that "If the principal debtor, like Lepol in this
case, has admitted its liability, the Surety or Mabuhay cannot assume an
inconsistent stance."</p>

<p class="BODY">In so <span style="">saying, </span>the <span style="">resp</span>ondent court practically suggested
that the surety was bound by the answer of the principal debtor and could not
or need not file its own answer to plead its own defenses.  We hold at the outset that this was
erroneous.  In fact, the surety has the
right to resist the complaint independently of the principal debtor and, if it
sees fit, may even set up <span style="">a </span>cross-claim
against the former.  The answer of the
surety has its own separate existence and function and may not be faulted or
disregarded solely on the basis of the answer filed by the principal debtor.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its Comment on the petition, the private respondent discussed
at length the failure only of <u>Lepol</u> to specifically deny the allegations
in the complaint filed by Dimsco.  Thus,
it spoke of "the answer of LEPOL,"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
"the reason for LEPOL's denial of paragraph 2.1,"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>  <span style="">"a
mere </span>perusal of LEPOL's answer,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and
"an admission by LEPOL,"<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> to
justify the judgment on the pleadings.  But nowhere was it asserted that the petitioner did not adequately
traverse or otherwise admitted the plaintiff's averments to justify <span style="">a </span>judgment on the pleadings against Stronghold.</p>

<p class="BODY">A careful scrutiny of Stronghold's answer discloses that it has
tendered an issue which precludes judgment on the pleadings insofar as it is
concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 3 of its answer stated that for "lack of knowledge
or information sufficient to form a belief <span style="">as </span>to the truth or falsity of the allegation set forth in
paragraph 2.1 (of the complaint) the same are specifically denied, subject to
its Special and Affirmative Defenses hereinbelow indicated."</p>

<p class="BODY">In an action filed against a contractor and his surety to recover
for materials furnished, it was held that the answer of the surety stating that
it was without knowledge or information to form a belief as to the truth of the
allegations with respect to the work and materials supplied by the plaintiff and
the amount due was sufficient and had the effect of a denial.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 14 of Stronghold's answer, under the heading Special
and Affirmative defenses, alleged "that some of the obligations of
co-defendant Lepol Trading during the effectivity of the bond had been
paid." The petitioner thus also raised a genuine issue by pleading this
affirmative defense.  It has also been
held that it is sufficient to allege payment generally without stating the
amount paid, the date of payment, or the person to whom made.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The following excerpt from Santiago v. Conde<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> is in
point:</p>

<blockquote>When it appears that not all the material allegations of the
complaint were admitted in the answer for some of them were either denied or
disputed, the defendant going to the extent of setting up certain special
defenses which, if proven, would have the effect of nullifying plaintiff's main
cause of action, judgment on the pleadings cannot be rendered.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case before us, the petitioner's answer tendered an issue,
for it did not only deny the material allegations of the complaint but even set
up certain special and affirmative defenses.  As the nature of the answer called for <span style="">presentation </span>of evidence, it was error for the lower court to
simply render a decision thereon without <span style="">a
trial.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Lepol's liability </span><span style="">as </span>principal debtor has clearly been
conceded because of its failure to adequately deny the allegations in the
complaint, but this cannot be said also of Stronghold.  The defendant's assertions, such as the
payments already made by Lepol, the inapplicability of the 1-1/2% interest to
the surety, and the invalidity of the award of attorney's fees against it, are
matters appropriate for <span style="">a </span>full-blown
trial on the merits.  It was clearly
incorrect for the trial court to foreclose all these defenses by rendering
judgment on the pleadings against both Lepol <u>and</u> Stronghold.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision of the respondent court
sustaining the ju<span style="">dgment </span>on the
pleadings of the trial court is SET ASIDE.  <span style="">Civil </span>Case No. 0807-P is
remanded to the Regional Trial Court of Pasay City, Branch 108, for trial on
the merits of the complaint against petitioner Stronghold Insurance Co.,
Inc.  No costs.</p>
