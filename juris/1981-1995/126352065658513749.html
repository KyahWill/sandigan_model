taken against lawyer <span class="SpellE">Timoteo</span> A. David (admitted to
the bar in 1945) for not giving Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span>, a <span class="SpellE">nonlawyer</span> (alleged
missionary of the Seventh Day Adventists), one-half of the attorney's fees

<p class="BODY">The foregoing was a reiteration of an agreement dated <st1:date year="1969" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Note that in said agreement lawyer David not
only agreed to give one-half of his professional fees to an intermediary or
commission agent but he also bound himself not to deal directly with the
clients.</p>

<p class="BODY">The business relationship between David and Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> did not last.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There were mutual accusations of <span class="SpellE">doublecross</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For
allegedly not living up to the agreement, Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> in 1973 denounced David to Presidential Assistant <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> B. Zamora, to the Office of Civil Relations at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place> and
to this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not file any civil
action to enforce the agreement.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his 1974 comment, David clarified that the partnership was
composed of himself as manager, Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> as assistant manager and lawyer Pedro Jacinto as
president and financier.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Jacinto
became ill and the costs of office maintenance mounted, David suggested that
Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> should also
invest some money or shoulder a part of the business expenses but Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> refused.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case was referred to the Solicitor General for
investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hearings were scheduled from 1974 to 1981.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was proposed that respondent should submit
a stipulation of facts but that did not materialize because the scheduled
hearings were not held due to the <span class="SpellE">nonavailability</span> of
Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> and his
counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="9">September 16, 1977</st1:date>
Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span> died at the

informed of that fact.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A report on this
case dated </span><st1:date year="1983" day="21" month="3"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">March 21, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> was submitted by the Solicitor General to
this Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that the said agreement is void <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">because </span>it was tantamount to malpractice which is "the
practice <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of soliciting cases at law for
the purpose of gain, either personally or through paid agents or brokers"
(Sec. 27, Rule 138, <span class="GramE">Rules</span> of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Malpractice ordinarily refers to any
malfeasance or dereliction of duty committed by a lawyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 27 gives a special and technical
meaning to the term "malpractice" (Act No. 2828, amending sec. 21 of
Act No. 190).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">That meaning is in consonance with the elementary notion that the
practice of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">law </span>is a profession,
not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>business.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"The lawyer may not seek or obtain
employment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">by </span>himself or through
others for to do so would <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>unprofessional"
(2 R. C. L. 1097 cited in <span class="SpellE"><u>In</u></span><u> re</u> <span class="SpellE">Tagorda</span>, 53 Phil. 37, 42; Malcolm, <u>J</u>., <span class="SpellE">Jayme</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bualan</span>, 58 Phil. 422; <span class="SpellE">Arce</span> vs. Philippine National Bank, 62 Phil. 569).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The commercialization of law practice is
condemned in certain canons of professional ethics adopted by the American Bar
Association:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"34.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><u>Division of Fees</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">- <u>No division of fees
for legal services is proper</u>, except with another lawyer, based upon a
division of service or responsibility."</span></blockquote>

should not be </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">controlled or
exploited </span>by any lay agency, personal or corporate</u>, <u>which
intervenes between client and lawyer</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>A lawyer's responsibilities and qualifications are individual.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He should avoid all relations which direct
the performance of his duties by or in the interest of such intermediary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A lawyer's relation to his client should be
personal, and the responsibility should be direct to the client.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"38.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span><u>Compensation,
Commissions and Rebates</u>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- A
lawyer should accept no compensation, commissions, rebates or other advantages
from others without the knowledge and consent of his client after full
disclosure." (Appendix, Malcolm, Legal Ethics).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We censure lawyer David for having entered and acted upon such
void and unethical agreement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We
discountenance his conduct, not because of the complaint of Tan <span class="SpellE">Tek</span> <span class="SpellE">Beng</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">"Unprofessional conduct in an attorney is that which
