				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">In the complaint for disbarment filed with this
Court by Mr. Sergio V. Bautista, dated </span><st1:date year="1979" day="10" month="9"><span class="GramE">September 10, 1979</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, against then Municipal Judge Loreto <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>.</span> Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
it is alleged that said respondent received tome the complainant the amount of
P600.00 asked for by said respondent in order that the complainant herein can
obtain the dismissal of a criminal complaint filed by the local PC authorities
against him and his nephew for Violation of Art. <span class="GramE">195 of the
Revised Penal Code (<span class="SpellE">Jueteng</span>).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Complainant further averred that in
connection with this same matter, the respondent Judge had previously received
from him an amount of P500.00; that due to the initiative taken by herein
complainant, the respondent Judge was, on October 4, 1978, arrested by NBI
agents while in the act of receiving at the 3M Kitchenette, <span class="SpellE">Poblacion</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="GramE">Tomas.</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Batangas</span></span><span class="GramE">, the
marked money of P600.00 being asked for from complainant Sergio Bautista.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the respondent's Comment to the complaint was received by
the Court and acting on the Memorandum of Deputy Court Administrator Arturo B.
Buena, the Court, in its resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1982</st1:date>, ordered respondent Judge to refrain from
performing the duties of his office during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span>
of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The instant case for
disbarment and suspension from office of respondent Judge <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Guevarra</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> was then referred
to Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Flordelis</span> O. Navarro, of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, at <span class="SpellE">Lipa</span>
City, for investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, Branch VI, this administrative matter was docketed
as Administrative Case No. <span class="GramE">T-317.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">In his motion to dismiss dated <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1983</st1:date>, filed in the court below, respondent
Judge prayed therein that the complaint against him be dismissed for _ being
patently politically inspired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also
disclosed that:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="">"2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
instant complaint of Sergio Bautista, dated September 10, 1979, refers to the
same incident complained of by the same Sergio Bautista in <span class="SpellE">Crim</span>.
Case No. 687 of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> entitled People vs.
Loreto M. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>; judgment of conviction was rendered
in that case, which was eventually brought to the Supreme Court on appeal by <i>certiorari</i>
in G.R. No. L-56692 entitled Loreto M. <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> vs.
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> and the People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;
said <i>certiorari</i> case, which may be taken judicial notice of by this
Court, is still pending decision in the Supreme Court, and is therefore <u>sub</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judice</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">xxx</span> <span class="SpellE">xxx</span>."</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Judge averred in his motion that the duty of the said
Executive Judge should be to refer and bring to the attention of the Supreme
Court his motion to dismiss for appropriate resol­ution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1983</st1:date>,
Executive Judge Navarro, however, issued an order which <span class="GramE">We</span>
hereunder quote:</p>

<blockquote>"With the implementation of Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129 the instant administrative case has become
moot and academic as of <st1:date year="1983" day="17" month="1">January 17,
 1983</st1:date> and is considered dismissed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Let the records of the instant case be returned to the
Supreme Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>,
<st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="2">24 February 1983</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, Executive Judge <span class="SpellE">Flordelis</span>
O. Navarro took the view that all administrative cases against justices,
judges, and court personnel pending as of January 17, 1983, should be
considered moot and academic on account of the implementation of the judicial
revamp provided for in Batas <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>. 129, in line with a pronouncement in this regard made
by this Court in an <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> resolution dated February 15,
1983.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said resolution of the Court, however,
provides in itself the exception and that is, "where there are compelling
reasons to the contrary."</p>

<p class="BODY">We find said Order of Executive Judge Navarro dated <st1:date year="1983" day="24" month="2">February 24, 1983</st1:date>, untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the resolution of this Court dated <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="10">October 4, <span class="GramE">1982</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,</span> We referred this case to Executive Judge Navarro for her
to submit to this Court after conducting an investigation, her findings of
facts and conclusions of law, together with the corresponding
recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it is this
Court alone that should be left to decide the appropriate action to be taken in
this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The order issued by Executive
Judge Navarro, dated February 24, 1983, dismissing this administrative case for
being moot and academic is, therefore, not proper nor wall-taken.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ultimate action on this case should have
been left to this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dismissal of this administrative case would be all the more
highly improper because respondent Judge was convicted for violation of the
Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act, by the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
in Criminal Case No. 687 and the same judgment was affirmed by this Court in
G.R. No. 56692 when the petition for review by way of <i>certiorari</i> of said
decision of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, was dismissed for lack
of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court ruled that the
questions raised in said petition for review are factual and there is no
showing that the lower court's findings of facts are unsupported by substan­tial
evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent motion for
reconsideration filed by respondent Judge Loreto <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
was denied under the resolution of this Court dated <st1:date year="1984" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In another resolution dated <span class="SpellE">Februry</span> 2, 1984,
this Court directed entry of final judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court takes notice that in the final judgment rendered by the
<span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> against herein respondent Judge Loreto <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> in Criminal Case No. 687-MJ, the latter was found
guilty of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and sentenced
to serve the penalty of an indeterminate prison term of from four (4) years and
one (1) day, as minimum to seven (7) years and one (1) day, as maximum, and to
further suffer perpetual disqualifica­tion from public office and to pay the
costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Our resolution dated <st1:date year="1982" day="4" month="10">October 4, 1982</st1:date>, respondent Judge Loreto <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> was ordered to refrain from performing the duties
of his office of Municipal Judge of <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. Tomas, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
this case, and <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the said position is now
being occupied by Municipal Trial Court Judge <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>
B. <span class="SpellE">Gonzaga</span>, as of <st1:date year="1985" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING,</b> the Court resolved to
consider the aforesaid judgment against respondent Loreto <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
as sufficient ground for his disbarment and, therefore, ORDERS his name
stricken from the Roll of Attorneys.</p>
