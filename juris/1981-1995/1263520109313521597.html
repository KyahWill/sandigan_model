				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The charge imputed to respondent,
a member of the bar, is that he changed his name, without any authority from
the courts, from <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> Lim Antonio <span class="SpellE">Clemente</span>, as appearing in his birth certificate, to
Francisco G. Antonio. Such an act, complainant contends, was contrary </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to law.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Respondent was required
to answer. He was quite categorical in such answer that at <span class="GramE">no</span>
time had he used an alias and that, therefore, he had not violated the Act in
question. Much less had he committed falsi­fication of public <span class="GramE">documents.</span> He pointed out that his correct surname of
Antonio was likewise included in his birth certificate, a <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">photostatic</span></span> copy of which was en­closed. Submitted
likewise was his diploma from <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> High School in
1953; his certificate of <span class="SpellE">confernment</span> of Bachelor of
Business Administration at the University of the East in 1956; his certificate
of conferment of Bachelor of Laws from the University of the East in 1961; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">his </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">official transcript of record from the University of the East; a
certification from the Board of Examiners of the Bureau of Civil Service as a
registered Certified Public Accountant dated July 22, 1957; and lastly, his
certification from the Clerk of Court of the Supreme Court of his admission to
the bar in 1962. In all such annexes, the surname mentioned was that of Antonio.
He contended that no court order was required because the </span>change of
surname amounted to correction of errors in the school records, pointing out
that the court order for change or correction of entry must be in connection
with that appearing in the civil register. He explained why in his birth
certificate the nick­name <span class="SpellE">Paquito</span> was used rather
than the correct appella­tion. No question, according to him, can be raised as
to his using the correct name Francisco from birth in all his public or private
dealings. He made reference to a previous case, Administrative Case No. 848,
which was filed by the same complainant and based on the same evidence. This
Court, according to him, dismissed the case in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="9">September 30, 1971</st1:date>. The prayer was for
the dismissal of the complaint. A reply was required from complainant. It was
submitted. Thereafter the case was referred to the Solicitor General for
investigation, report and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In the Report of
Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span> P. Mendoza,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> submitted on </span><st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">July 18, 1983</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">, the following appears: "Actually, this
is a second case for disbarment filed by the same complainant against the same
respondent."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> The previous complaint against respondent
was that he is a Chinese citizen and therefore disqualified to be </span>a
member of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">bar. </span>This Court
dismissed the case on <st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="9">September 30,
 1971</st1:date>. The Report further stated that he was likewise accused of
violating Common­wealth Act No. 142 before the City Court of Manila in Criminal
Case No. E-148817, which case was dismissed by Judge Antonio Padua <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span> in a decision dated <st1:date year="1974" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1974</st1:date>. It turned out that the principal prosecution
witness in such case was the complainant. It was he who was also responsible
for filing Criminal Case No. 307 before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Masbate</span> again for an alleged violation of the same Act. On <st1:date year="1974" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1974</st1:date>, the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Masbate</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> granted a motion to quash. His persistence in harassing is
thus quite evident.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Finally, the Report made
clear why there is justification to the allegation of respondent "that
complainant has been motivated by 'revenge and bad faith.'” </span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> <span class="GramE">For respondent was the
private prosecutor for the falsification of a public document in which the
complainant was the accused, the result being the conviction of complainant,
and in another case, also for falsification of a public document, with the same
result.</span></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> Moreover, when the complainant was the
adverse party, it was respon­dent who was the defense counsel.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General concluded: "It is clear from all the
foregoing that there is no basis in proceeding against respondent."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Report recommended the dismissal of the complaint. It did not
stop there. The Report also called for complainant being admonished. Dismissal
of the complaint is warranted. Admonition, however, is too mild a response for
the irresponsible conduct of complainant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dignity and the honor of the profession require that acts
unworthy of membership in the bar should be visited with the appropriate
penalty. The charge against respondent is of a serious character. If in fact
there was such a violation of the law as charged, he should be duly penalized.
It is quite clear, however, that the complaint is unfounded. It was the product
of ill-will, the desire of complainant to avenge <span class="GramE">himself</span>.
It certainly was not made in good faith. If it were so, its dismissal would
have sufficed. To repeat, such is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">not
the case. As the Report made clear, the complaint arose from a feeling of
resentment, even of hate. </span>To allow complainant to trifle with the Court,
to make use of the judicial process as an instrument of retaliation, would be a
reflection on the rule <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">law. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">He </span>should be held to strict accountability, considering that
this is his second attempt. Such stubbornness compounds the gravity of his
offense. He appears to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">be </span>incorrigible.
At the very least, therefore, he should be censured.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">WHEREFORE</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">, </span>the complaint against respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">Attorney Francisco G. Antonio is dismissed
