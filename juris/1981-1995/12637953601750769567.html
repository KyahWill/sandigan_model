				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for certiorari seeking to set aside the decision
of the Court of Appeals which dismissed the Development Bank of <span class="SpellE">Rizal’s</span> petition and affirmed the trial court’s order for
the issuance of a writ of execution in favor of the private respondent on the
ground that the decision below has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="3" day="30" year="1984">March 30, 1984</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Ibrahim</span> Omar filed a complaint with the
Regional Trial Court of Manila for collection of <span style="text-transform:
uppercase">sub </span>of money against the petitioner Development Bank of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> and the Central Bank. The Central Bank filed a motion
to dismiss on the ground of lack of cause of action. The trial court granted
the motion and thus, the petitioner became the only defendant in the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="19" month="5">May 19, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioner likewise filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and
lack of cause of action. On <st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="8">August 6,
 1984</st1:date>, the motion was denied. A copy of the court order denying the
motion was received by the petitioner on <st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="8">August 13, 1984</st1:date>. However, it failed to file an answer
within the <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period as a consequence of
which it was declared in default and the respondent was allowed to present his
evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span> on <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1984</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1984</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed motion to lift the order of default. The motion was denied
by the trial court on <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="5">May 3, 1985</st1:date>.
The petitioner moved to reconsider but the same was also denied on <st1:date year="1985" day="19" month="7">July 19, 1985</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="12" month="11">November 12, 1985</st1:date>,
the trial court rendered a judgment by default against the petitioner, the
dispositive portion of which states:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment is hereby rendered ordering the defendant
to pay the plaintiff:</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The sum of P10<span class="GramE">,119.14</span> with legal interests from <st1:date year="1984" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1984</st1:date> until the same is fully paid;</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED."</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 80)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner did not appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="2" day="12" year="1986">February 12, 1986</st1:date>,
the respondent filed an Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span> Motion for Execution
and to Approve Bill of Costs. This was granted by the trial court on <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1986</st1:date>,
the trial court issued a writ of execution and, on <st1:date year="1986" day="14" month="3">March 14, 1986</st1:date>, the writ was served on the

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1986</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the court's order granting
execution and to lift the writ <span class="SpellE">isued</span> pursuant thereto,
with temporary restraining order.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="4" month="4">April 4, 1986</st1:date>,
the trial court denied the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="4">April 9, 1986</st1:date>,
a notice of sale on execution of the petitioner's personal properties which
were levied upon was issued setting the sale for <st1:date year="1986" day="16" month="4">April 16, 1986</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner filed a petition for certiorari before the
appellate court contending that the writ of execution was null and void for
having been issued without any hearing. It likewise alleged that it did not
receive a copy of the trial court's order granting the motion for execution.
Furthermore, petitioner contended that its assets are being held in trust by
the Monetary Board of the Central Bank and, therefore, the judgment cannot be
executed against it.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="9">September 10, 1986</st1:date>,
the appellate court dismissed the petition stating that inasmuch as the
petitioner is not contesting the trial court's decision on the merits and the
said decision has become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, the
respondent can have it executed as a matter of right and the grant of execution
was but a ministerial duty of the trial court. Hence, the petitioner need not
be given advance notice of the application for execution nor may it be afforded
prior hearing. As to the question of its assets being held by the Monetary
Board, the appellate court ruled that since the petition for liquidation had
not yet been actually filed as of the date of the issuance of the writ of
execution, it cannot truly be said that the respondent has gained undue or
fraudulent preference over the petitioner's other creditors and depositors.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition before us, the petitioner raises the following
issues:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in">WHETHER OR NOT A PARTY
DECLARED IN DEFAULT IS ENTITLED TO NOTICE OF ALL PROCEEDINGS SUBSEQUENT TO HIS
FILING A MOTION TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER OF DEFAULT;</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in">WHETHER OR NOT IT IS THE
MINISTERIAL DUTY OF THE COURT TO ORDER THE EXECUTION OF A JUDGMENT WHICH HAS
BECOME FINAL AND EXECUTORY; AND</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:.3in;text-indent:0in">WHETHER OR NOT THE CASE
OF CENTRAL BANK V. MORFE, (63 SCRA 114) IS APPLICABLE TO THE PRESENT CASE AND
THEREFORE, THE WRIT OF EXECUTION CANNOT BE ENFORCED AGAINST IT.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first and second assignments of error, the petitioner
contends that a party who is declared in default is entitled to all notice of
proceedings subsequent to his filing of a motion to set aside the order of
default as mandated by Section 9, Rule 13 of the Revised Rules of Court.
Therefore, the writ of execution issued against it by the trial court is null
and void since the same was issued without prior notice and hearing. The
petitioner further contends that the rule that once a decision becomes final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> it is the ministerial duty of the court
to order its execution admits of certain exceptions.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that a party who is declared in default is entitled to
notice of all further proceedings upon his filing of a motion to set aside the
order of default but the failure to furnish copy of the motion for the issuance
of a writ of execution to the party does not render null and <span class="SpellE">roid</span> the writ issued pursuant thereto because upon finality
of judgment, the prevailing party becomes entitled to its execution as a matter
of right.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we have ruled in <span class="SpellE"><u>Pamintuan</u></span><u>
v. Munoz,</u> (22 SCRA 1109, <span class="GramE">1111</span>-1112):</p>

<blockquote>"Regarding the first point, it is by now axiomatic that a
judgment on a compromise - like the one in the case at bar - is at once final
and immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. Also of the same stature
is the rule that once a judgment becomes final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>,
the prevailing party can have it executed as a matter of right and the granting
of execution becomes a ministerial duty of the <span class="GramE">court.</span>
Otherwise stated, once sought by the prevailing party, execution of a final
judgment will just follow as a matter of course. Hence, the judgment debtor
need not be given advance notice of the application for execution nor be
afforded prior hearing. (Rule 39, Sec. 1, Rules of Court; Luther v. Clay, 100 <st1:state><st1:place>Ga.</st1:place></st1:state>
236, 28 S.E. 46) This renders of little significance then the fact alleged by
petitioners that they received copy of respondent's motion for execution only
on the afternoon of the day set for its hearing."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, in this case, claims that it was served the writ
of execution without notice or hearing prior to its issuance. However, it filed
a motion for reconsideration to lift the writ. Assuming, therefore, that the
writ was irregularly issued because of lack of notice, the defect was cured
upon the petitioner's filing of its motion for reconsideration. Furthermore,
the petitioner admits that it was served the writ of execution and the notice
of sale on execution of personal property. In the <span class="SpellE"><u>Pamintuan</u></span>
case, (<u>supra</u>, p. 1112-1113) we further said:</p>

<blockquote>"Petitioners finally argue that they had not been served a
notice of the levy <span class="GramE">nor</span> a notice of the sale as
required by the Rules. The sheriff's return, however, shows that the notice of
levy had been registered with the Register of Deeds pursuant to Rule 57, Sec. 7
in connection with Rule 39, Sec. 15 of the Rules, and that the notice of sale
had been sent by registered mail on <st1:date year="1964" day="28" month="12">December
 28, 1964</st1:date>, to petitioners. Even assuming then that petitioners were
not served a copy of the notice of levy, yet <span class="GramE">We</span> have
already ruled in Philippine Bank of Commerce v. <span class="SpellE">Macadaeg</span>,
L-14174, <st1:date year="1960" day="31" month="10">October 31, 1960</st1:date>,
that this defect is cured by service of notice of sale upon the judgment
debtors prior to the sale, which was done here. The levy was validly <span class="GramE">effected</span> then."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unless there <span class="GramE">exists</span> a compelling reason
therefore, for holding in abeyance the writ of execution, the same will issue
as a matter of right in favor of the prevailing party upon finality of the
decision. <span class="GramE">Thus in the case of <u>Roman Santos, Jr. &amp; <span class="SpellE">Herminia</span> Santos v.</u></span><u> The Hon. Court of Appeals
and Francisco S. <span class="SpellE">Nigos</span>,</u> (G.R. No. 56614, July 28,
1987) we ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"xxx As this Court held in <u>Agricultural
and Industrial Marketing, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</u>, (118 SCRA 49) it is
beyond question that the perfection of an appeal or the filing of a petition
for review, within the statutory or <span class="SpellE">reglementary</span>
period is mandatory and jurisdictional; and that failure to so perfect an
appeal renders final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> the questioned decision
and deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction to entertain appeal. The lapse
of the appeal period deprives the courts of jurisdiction to alter the final
judgment, and the prevailing party becomes entitled as a matter of right to its
execution, and for the court, it becomes its ministerial duty to order the
execution of judgment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The question which, thus, confronts us now is whether or not
there exists a compelling reason for staying the execution of judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third assignment of error, the petitioner contends that it
is immaterial that no liquidation proceedings had been instituted as of the
issuance of the writ of execution and that precisely because actual liquidation
had not yet begun, there was still the possibility that the petitioner could be
rehabilitated and reopened for business so that to allow execution of judgment
against it would be to unduly dissipate its assets and hamper any ongoing
efforts toward its rehabilitation. The petitioner argues that the remedy of the
private respondent who is not necessarily elevated to the status of a preferred
creditor by virtue of the judgment, is to wait, along with other creditors, for
the eventual liquidation, or rehabilitation of the bank and then present his
claim to the duly appointed liquidator or the rehabilitated bank in case of
rehabilitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are constrained to agree with the petitioner. True, the
questioned writ was issued prior to the filing of the liquidation proceedings
of the petitioner bank. However, the respondent became aware that the
petitioner was in a distressed position with the possibility of being subjected
to liquidation as early as the date when said petitioner failed to cash the
respondent's checks notwithstanding the fact that the latter still had a
deposit with the petitioner in the amount of more than P10<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>,
sufficient to cover the issued checks. At this point, the respondent was
prompted to file a collection case below and, rightly so, was able to obtain a
favorable judgment therein. Be that as it may, to allow the execution of said
judgment would unduly cause prejudice to the other depositors of the bank who
were caught unaware by its distressed situation and sudden closure. As
correctly contended by the petitioner, the respondent would be placed in the
status of a preferred creditor over his other co-depositors, a situation which
we sought to prevent in the case of <u>Central Bank of the Philippines v. <span class="SpellE">Morfe</span></u> (63 SCRA 114). In that case, we said:</p>

<blockquote>"A contrary rule or practice would be productive of injustice,
mischief and confusion. To recognize such judgments as entitled to priority
would mean that depositors in insolvent banks, after learning that the bank is
insolvent as shown by the fact that it can no longer pay withdrawals or that it
has closed its doors or has been enjoined by the Monetary Board from doing
business, would rush to the courts to secure judgments for the payment of their
deposits.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In such an eventuality, the courts would be swamped with
suits of that character. Some of the judgments would be default judgments.
Depositors armed with such judgments would pester the liquidation court with
claims for preference on the basis of article 2244 (14<span class="GramE">)(</span>b).
Less alert depositors would be prejudiced. That inequitable situation could not
have been contemplated by the framers of section 29."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, in this case, has manifested that the
"Petition for Assistance in the Liquidation of Development Bank of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>" was filed with the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Makati</span> and was approved on November 25, 1985; and that soon
after the completion of the ongoing inventory and appraisal of assets, a notice
to creditors will be published once a week for three consecutive weeks in a
newspaper of general circulation requiring creditors to file their claims
including, final judgments, with the liquidator, or his assistant, who will
then collate all submitted claims, including final judgments, in a project of
distribution for approval by the liquidation court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The remedy of the respondent then is to present the final
judgment in his favor before the liquidation court after the proper notice has
been given to all of the petitioner Bank's creditors and depositors.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the
petition is GRANTED. The trial court's orders of <st1:date year="1986" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1986</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1986" day="9" month="4">April
