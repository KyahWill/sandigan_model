the decision of the Court of Appeals (CA-G.R. CV. No. 09842), which set aside
the order of dismissal on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u>
<span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> of Civil Case No. 6779-M of the Regional
Trial Court, Branch XVI, <span class="SpellE">Malolos</span> <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in 1980, respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>
commenced with the Court of First Instance of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
Civil Case No. 1120-V-80 (entitled "Maria Clara <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>
versus Spouses Luis <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span>, Jr. and Rosario <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz") to declare null and void the donation
given to petitioners Luis <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span> and Rosario <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz by <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz
and the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of the one-half portion of the
same to respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her complaint, respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>
alleged: (a) <span class="GramE">Her</span> widowed grandmother, Asuncion Laurel,
who died on <st1:date year="1943" day="23" month="6">June 23, 1943</st1:date>,
had two sons, Nicolas and <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>. Nicolas predeceased <st1:city><st1:place>Asuncion</st1:place></st1:city>,
having died on <st1:date year="1942" day="25" month="12">December 25, 1942</st1:date>.
‘Nicolas' sole heir was respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>, his daughter;
(b) Upon the death of Asuncion, her heirs, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
and respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> succeeded to the entire estate
as co-heirs, the latter inheriting by right of representation; (c) Inasmuch as
respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> was a minor at the time of the
death of Asuncion, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> acted as her trustee who
administered her interests in the estate; (d) <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
executed a document entitled "<span class="SpellE">Paglilipat</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">Sarili</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pag-aari</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Namatay</span>," falsely stating therein that he was the only
heir of Asuncion and adjudicating to himself the entire estate left by the
deceased; and (e) On June 16, 1978, <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span> and his
wife, Victoria <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, donated the other half
portion of the land to petitioner spouses, Luis <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span>
and Rosario <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> prayed that the
document entitled "<span class="SpellE">Paglilipat</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">sa</span></span> <span class="SpellE">Sarili</span>
<span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Pag-aari</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">Namatay</span>" and the donation
made in favor of petitioner Luis <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span> and <st1:city><st1:place>Rosario</st1:place></st1:city>
<span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz be declared null and void; and that the
donated property be <span class="SpellE">reconveyed</span> to her.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finding difficulty in serving the summonses on petitioners <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span> and <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz, who were
residents of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> filed a Motion for Leave to
Archive Case dated <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="8">August 6, 1980</st1:date>.
The Court of First Instance of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>,
issued an order dated <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="8">August 8, 1980</st1:date>
approving the motion.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1981</st1:date>,
respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> filed an Ex-<span class="SpellE">Parte</span>
Motion to Revive Case which was granted by the trial court on <st1:date year="1981" day="13" month="10">October 13, 1981</st1:date>. As no further
action was taken by respondent Maria Clara <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>,
petitioners <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span> and <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz filed a Motion to Dismiss and for Cancellation of Notice of <span class="SpellE">Lis</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendens</span>. The motion was
granted in an order dated <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="3">March 27,
 1982</st1:date>, which reads:</p>

<blockquote>“Acting on the ‘Motion to Dismiss and for, Cancellation of Notices
of <span class="SpellE">Lis</span> <span class="SpellE">Pendens</span>’ filed by
Atty. Juan B. <span class="SpellE">Bañez</span>, Jr., counsel for the defendants,
and it appearing that despite the order of revival granted by the Court in its
Order of October 13, 1981, plaintiff has not done anything in this case and as
a matter of fact, the lawyer who filed the motion for revival, Atty. Eli <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span>, withdrew as counsel for the plaintiff with the
conformity of the plaintiff, for lack of interest, this case is hereby
DISMISSED and the notices of <span class="SpellE">lis</span> <span class="SpellE">pendens</span>
on defendants’ Transfer Certificate of Title Nos. <span class="GramE">T-30-384(M)
and T-30-386(M) arising from this case are hereby ordered CANCELLED” (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 48).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> filed a Motion for
Reconsideration, which was denied on <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="4">April
 29, 1982</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">No appeal was taken from the Orders dated <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="3">March 27, 1982</st1:date> and <st1:date year="1982" day="29" month="4">April 29, 1982</st1:date>. Instead, on March 9, 1983, respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> commenced in the Regional Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span>, Civil Case No. 6779-M (entitled: ‘Maria Clara <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> versus Spouses Luis <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span>,
Jr. and Rosario <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz and Spouses <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mutya</span> and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners <span class="SpellE">Ilasco</span> and <span class="SpellE">dela</span> Cruz moved for the dismissal of the case against them
on the ground of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>.
In granting the motion, the trial court reasoned out:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> It
was shown that Civil Case No. 1120-V-80 was filed at the then Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> (Valenzuela) by plaintiff Maria
Clara <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> against <span class="SpellE">movants</span>
in this instant case. <span class="SpellE">Eusebio</span> <span class="SpellE">Mutya</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Estelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> were
however added as defendants in this instant case. Although the civil case filed
at Valenzuela was for 'Action to Declare the Donation Null and Void' and this
instant case is for ‘Annulment of Document and <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>,’
the prayers in both cases are identical: to declare as nullity (sic) the
donation executed by <span class="SpellE">Sps</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cipriano</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> and Victoria <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz in favor of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span> and the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of one-half portion of the same to the
plaintiff. The Civil Case filed with the Valenzuela Court was ordered
terminated in the order of Judge Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>
dated March 27, 1982 and the order of dismissal is now final" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 27).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the trial court and
reinstated the complaint, holding that while all the elements of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> were
present such principle was inapplicable to the case, considering the
"environmental circumstances" thereof. By "environmental
circumstances," the Court of Appeals meant the utter dependence of
respondent <span class="SpellE">Rodillo</span> on her counsel and the failure to
prosecute the case due to the failure to summon the defendants, who were
residing abroad.</p>

<p class="BODY">In pertinent part, the decision of the Court of Appeals states:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
<span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="mso-tab-count:
3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE"><u>Res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>
is to be disregarded if its application would involve the sacrifice of justice
to technicality (Republic, et al. v. Judge de <st1:city><st1:place>Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:city>,
G.R. No. 30240, <st1:date year="1988" day="23" month="3">23 March 88</st1:date>).
While procedurally speaking since the dismissal was unqualified, it had the
effect of an adjudication on the merits, given the equities of the case it
would be more in keeping with substantial justice if the controversy between
the parties were resolved on the merits rather than on a procedural
technicality in the light of the express mandate of the rules that they be
liberally construed in order to promote their object and to assist the parties
in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive determination of every action and
proceeding. (Olivares v. Gonzales, et al., G.R. No. 34500, <st1:date year="1988" day="18" month="3">18 March 88</st1:date>).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The dismissal of actions is based on sound judicial discretion and
such discretion must be exercised wisely and prudently with a view to
substantial justice (supra). While the first case was pending for almost two
years, the inability to prosecute was not really due to an unwillingness of the
plaintiff to proceed with the case but the difficulty in serving defendants
with summons for being non-residents. While this could not have been a legal
obstacle to its prosecution given the nature of the case, as aptly stated in <span class="SpellE">Tandoc</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Tensuan</span>, 93 SCRA 880,
it was not fair to visit this error of counsel on the poor petitioner-litigant
(who depended only on her counsel's advice and judgment) and inflict upon her
just suit the capital penalty of dismissal. Rule 17, Section 3 permits such
dismissal which has 'the effect of an adjudication on the merits' only if
plaintiff fails to prosecute (her) action for an unreasonable length of time'
and under the environmental circumstances of this case, as duly explained by
counsel, petitioner could not be adjudged guilty of failure to prosecute for an
unreasonable length of time (p. 883, supra)" (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 29)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners assail the decision of the Court of Appeals, assigning
the following errors:</p>

<blockquote>1)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent court
erred in not applying the doctrine of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> despite its own finding that all the elements
of said doctrine are present in the instant case;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent court
erred in denying the Motion for Reconsideration without stating the legal basis
therefore in violation of Sec. 14, Art. <span class="GramE">VIII of the 1986
Constitution.</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Compresent</span> in the case at bench are the
elements of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>,
which are the following:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There must be a final
judgment or order;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court rendering
the judgment must have jurisdiction over the subject matter;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The former judgment
is a judgment on the merits;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is between the first
and second actions identity of the parties, subject matter and of causes of
action (<span class="SpellE">Ipekdjian</span> Merchandising Co. Inc. v. Court of
Tax Appeals, 9 SCRA 72 [1963]; <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Rodil</span>, 17 SCRA 822 [1966]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The judgment in Civil Case No. 1120-V-80 is a final judgment,
since plaintiff failed to appeal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> within the
<span class="SpellE">reglementary</span> period.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court which rendered the judgment has jurisdiction over
the subject matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">The dismissal of Civil Case No. 1120-V-80 on the ground of lack
of interest or failure to prosecute on the part of the plaintiff has the effect
of judgment on the merits (Revised Rules of Court, Rule 17, <span class="GramE">Sec</span>.
3). It has the force of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> against the revival of substantially the same
action originally filed in another court (Insular Veneer, Inc. v. Plan, 73 SCRA
1 [1976]; De La Cruz v. <span class="SpellE">Paras</span>, 69 SCRA 556 [1976]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court and the Court of Appeals agreed that the prayers
in both cases are identical. There was no showing that the additional
defendants could not have been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> in the first
case or that their interests in the subject of the case were derived from
parties other than the original defendants. There was, therefore, only a change
in the form and name of the action and nothing less.</p>

<p class="BODY">A party, by varying the form of the action or by bringing forward
in a second action additional parties or arguments, cannot escape the effects
of the principle of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u>
when the facts remain the same at least where such new parties or matter could
have been <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> or pleaded in the prior action (<span class="SpellE">Sangalang</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Caparas</span>, 151 SCRA 53
[1987]; <span class="SpellE">Filinvest</span> Credit Corporation v. Intermediate
Appellate Court, 207 SCRA 59 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals fell into error because of its wrong
appreciation of the issue before it. The issue was whether the Order dated
March 27, 1982 of the Court of First Instance of Valenzuela, <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> in Civil Case No. 1120-V-80 operated as <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">judicata</span></u> to
Civil Case No. 6779-M. What the Court of Appeals resolved was the question of
whether the trial court erred in dismissing Civil Case No. 1120-V-80 without
stating that the dismissal was "without prejudice." Invoking the rule
that justice should not be sacrificed to technicality, the Court of Appeals set
aside the Order of the dismissal dated <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="3">March
 27, 1982</st1:date> and the Order dated <span class="SpellE">ApriI</span> 27,
1982, denying the motion for reconsideration in Civil Case No. 1120-V-80.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court of Appeals would have been correct if the plaintiff
(private respondent herein) in Civil Case No. 1120-V-80 had timely appealed the
Order of dismissal dated <st1:date year="1982" day="27" month="3">March 27,
 1982</st1:date> and raised the issue that the trial court had gravely abused
its discretion in dismissing the case with prejudice in view of the
"environmental circumstances" of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent has only herself to blame for her present predicament.
Instead of appealing from the order of dismissal in Civil Case No. 1120-V-80,
she filed another case (Civil Case No. 6779-M) almost one year later.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before procedural rules can be relaxed to give way to substantive
justice, it is implicit that such liberality be applied in a proper case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent is bound by the negligence and mistakes in
procedural matters of her counsel (B.R. Sebastian Enterprises, Inc. v. Court of
Appeals, 206 SCRA 28 [1992]; Mobil Oil Philippines, Inc. v. Court of First
Instance, 208 SCRA 523 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a principle of public policy that at the risk of occasional
errors, judgments of court should become final at some definite time fixed by
law. The very object of which the courts were constituted was to put an end to
controversies (<span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Kilayko</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Tengco</span>, 207 SCRA 600 [1992]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">WHEREFORE</b>, the
