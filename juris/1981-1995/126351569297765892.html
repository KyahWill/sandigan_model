				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class=BODY>The novel issues presented in this petition may be reduced to (1)
the legality and constitutionality of Section 24, Resolution No. 2499 of the
Commission on Elections (COMELEC) creating, for purposes of the elections in
the Sangguniang Kabataan (SK), the Boards of Election Supervisors (BES) and
making it the final arbiter of all election protests, and (2) the jurisdiction
of Regional Trial Courts over contests involving sangguniang kabataan
elections.</p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner Jose M. Mercado was proclaimed winner in the 4
December 1992 election for chairman of the SK of Barangay Mabalor, Ibaan,
Batangas.  The proclamation was made by
the Board of Election Tellers (BET), acting as the Board of Canvassers, on the
basis of its tally which showed Mercado winning by one vote (49 to 48) over his
rival, private respondent Crisanto P. Pangilinan.<a style='mso-footnote-id:
ftn1' href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class=BODY>Mercado's victory was, however, short-lived.  Immediately after Mercado's proclamation as
the winner by the BET, Pangilinan filed a formal protest with the BES
questioning the results of the election.  He alleged that the BET Chairman, drinking gin and Coke during the
counting, had invalidated some votes without consulting the other board
members.  The BES ordered the reopening
of the ballot box and the recount of the votes for SK Chairman.  The recount reversed the earlier tally to 51
to 49 in favor of Pangilinan, who was thereupon proclaimed the duly elected SK
Chairman by the BES, which issued for that purpose its own Certificate of
Canvass and Proclamation.</p>

<p class=BODY>Mercado then filed with the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of
Batangas City a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> praying for
the annulment of Pangilinan's proclamation by the BES, and for the issuance of
an order to compel the Department of Interior and Local Government (DILG) to
recognize him as the duly elected SK Chairman of Barangay Mabalor and to allow
him to take his oath of office and discharge his duties as such.</p>

<p class=BODY>In his petition docketed as Civil Case No. 3565, Mercado assailed
the jurisdiction of the BES to act on the protest filed by Pangilinan as the
ground cited therein was allegedly in the nature of an election protest
properly cognizable by the Metropolitan or Municipal Trial Court in accordance
with Section 252 of the Omnibus Election Code.  He further claimed that, assuming that the BES has jurisdiction over the
protest, the grounds raised therein were deemed waived by Pangilinan's failure
to invoke them at the level of the BET, and that the BES acted with grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in denying the
petitioner of due process when it ordered the reopening of the ballot box and
the recounting of the votes without affording him the opportunity to be heard.</p>

<p class=BODY>In its Order dated 13 January 1993, the RTC dismissed the
petition for lack of jurisdiction.  The
trial court stated that it was not aware of any law by which it could act on
the matters raised in Mercado's petition since Resolution No. 2499 of the
COMELEC did not vest in the RTC jurisdiction over controversies affecting
Sangguniang Kabataan elections, constituting instead the BES, which is under
COMELEC jurisdiction, as the final arbiter of all election controversies within
its level.</p>

<p class=BODY>Mercado moved for a reconsideration of the dismissal order.  He argued that the RTC was competent to act
on his petition because: (a) one mode of seeking judicial review is through the
writ of <i>certiorari</i> which may be issued by the RTC under B.P. Blg. 129;
(b) under its Resolutions Nos. 2499 and 2520, the COMELEC was to provide only
technical assistance in the conduct of the SK election and therefore could not
grant any relief from the action of the BES; moreover, under said Resolution
No. 2499, no appeal to a higher administrative level was allowed from the
action of the BES; and (c) the principle of exhaustion of administrative remedies
did not apply to the case at bar, the jurisdictional and due process issues
raised therein being legal in nature.</p>

<p class=BODY>Unconvinced, the RTC, in its Order dated 2 March 1993, denied the
motion for reconsideration for lack of merit.  It ruled that the reopening of the ballot box for Barangay Mabalor and
the recounting of the votes cast therein were perfectly within the ambit of the
BES's authority, and that Mercado should have gone to the DILG which has direct
control and supervision of the SK elections.</p>

<p class=BODY>Hence, Mercado's present petition under Rule 45 of the Rules of
Court for the review on pure questions of law of the Orders of 13 January 1993
and 2 March 1993 of the Batangas RTC.  He initially raises the same issues he presented in Civil Case No. 3565
on the competency of the BES to take cognizance of Pangilinan's protest and his
right to due process, and he reiterates the arguments he adduced in his motion
for reconsideration regarding the jurisdiction of the RTC over Civil Case No.
3565.  However, in refutation of the
Solicitor General's defense of the BES jurisdiction as conferred by COMELEC
Resolution No. 2499, Mercado, in his Consolidated Reply, now contends that
COMELEC Resolution No. 2499 is null and void because: (a) it prescribes a
separate set of rules for the election of the SK Chairman different from and
inconsistent with that set forth in the Omnibus Election Code, thereby
contravening Section 2, Article I of the said Code which explicitly provides
that &quot;it shall govern all elections of public officers&quot;; and, (b) it
constitutes a total, absolute, and complete abdication by the COMELEC of its
constitutionally and statutorily mandated duty to enforce and administer all
election laws as provided for in Section 2(1), Article IX-C of the Constitution;
Section 52,  Article VIII of the Omnibus
Election Code; and Section 2, Chapter 1, Subtitle C, Title I, Book V of the
1987 Administrative Code.</p>

<p class=BODY>The issues presented require a flashback into the history of the
SK.  It was initially organized by P.D.
No. 684 (15 April 1975) as the Kabataang Barangay (KB), a youth organization
composed of all barangay residents who were less than 18 years of age which
aims to provide its members with the opportunity to express their views and
opinions on issues of transcendental importance.  Its affairs were administered by a barangay youth chairman
together with six barangay youth leaders, who should at least be 15 years of
age or over but less than 18.  The then
Secretary of Local Government and Community Development was authorized to
promulgate the implementing rules and regulations.</p>

<p class=BODY>Pursuant to P.D. No. 1191 (1 September 1977), the Pambansang
Katipunan ng Kabataang Barangay ng Pilipinas was constituted as &quot;a body
corporate” with &quot;the powers and attributes of a corporation&quot; and placed
directly under the Office of the President.  Its affairs were to be administered by the Executive Committee which was
empowered to promulgate rules and regulations governing the KB.  This youth organization was recognized in
B.P. Blg. 337 (The Local Government Code),<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn2'

raised the maximum age requirement of the members from 18 to 21.<span

<p class=BODY>Under<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt'> </span>R.A. No. 7160
<span style='mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt'>(The Local Government Code of 1991), the

It remains as a youth organization in every barangay, composed of a chairman
and seven members to be elected by the katipunan ng kabataan, and the secretary

the SK.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn4' href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

Election Tellers, with the former having direct general supervision in the
conduct of such election and as the final arbiter of all election

<p class=BODY>These were the laws on elective barangay officials which the
Constitutional Commission took into account when it debated on that portion of
paragraph (2), Section 2, Article IX-C of the Constitution relating to contests
involving elective barangay officials.  During such debates, the following discussions took place:</p>

<blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Madam President and
members of the Committee, I understand from the sponsorship speech that in
matters of contests of barangay, municipal and provincial officials, the
jurisdiction is all exclusive to the Commission on Elections.  Under the present law that we have, cases
involving election contests of barangay officials are initiated in the
municipal trial court or metropolitan trial court, subject to appeal to the
Regional Trial Court whose decision is final.  In other words, when it comes to barangay officials, the COMELEC has
nothing to do at all with the election contest.  In the case, however, of municipal officials, under the present
law, the Omnibus Election Code, the original jurisdiction is with the Regional
Trial Court, and the decision is appealable to the Commission on
Elections.  We are suggesting -- and we
would like the Committee to take note of this that while we admit that in all
contests, whether it be barangay, municipal, provincial or city officials, the
sole authority should be the Commission on Elections -- that there should be a
two-tiered resolution of cases in the sense that when it comes to barangay
officials, the municipal trial court or the metropolitan trial court should
have jurisdiction first, then it is appealable to the COMELEC.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of municipal
officials, we are thinking that the regional trial court should have
jurisdiction, and then it is appealable to the COMELEC.  And in the case of provincial or city
officials, the first jurisdiction, which is exclusive, would be the
COMELEC.  I wonder if the Committee
would take that into consideration considering these facts.  If we will allow the COMELEC to have
executive [sic] jurisdiction over cases involving barangay and municipal
officials, one can just imagine the difficulty of the COMELEC, considering that
we have thousands of barangay and municipal officials.  And as I understand from my private
conversation with the Chairman of the COMELEC, the Honorable Ramon Felipe, when
it comes to contests involving barangay and municipal officials, the COMELEC
may have to send hearing officers; whereas if we will allow the municipal trial
court and the metropolitan trial court to have jurisdiction over these cases,
they will be given the proper consideration by the court.  In the case of contests involving municipal
officials, the regional trial court, which is also a court, should have
jurisdiction, not the hearing officers of the COMELEC.  So, we have a two-tiered situation here
which we lawyers think would be the best remedy considering again my allusion
to the fact that there are so many barangays and municipalities all over the
country.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That is just my
suggestion.  I do not know if the
Committee could respond to it so that we could perhaps present some amendments.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. REGALADO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In other words, insofar
as the appellate jurisdiction of the Commission on Elections is concerned, it
is still preserved despite the fact that it involves barangay, municipal, city
or provincial officials.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yes, we would rather
insist on that because that is a constitutional mandate.<span style='font-size:
5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. REGALADO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Commissioner's
proposal is only with respect to the original jurisdiction; that is, insofar as
election contests involving barangay officials are concerned, the municipal
trial courts have the original jurisdiction; whereas in the case of city and
provincial officials, the original jurisdiction is vested in the regional trial
courts.<span style='font-size:4.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG:</blockquote>

<blockquote>No, Madam President.  In the case of provincial and city
officials, the original and exclusive jurisdiction should be with the
Commission on Elections.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. REGALADO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of municipal
officials, then it will be the regional trial courts which will exercise
original jurisdiction.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That is correctly put,
Madam President.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. REGALADO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>But altogether, in the
ultimate analysis on appellate jurisdiction, they will all have to go to the
Commission on Elections eventually.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yes, Madam
President.  They will still be the sole
judge of all election contests.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn14' href="#_ftn14"

Maambong a question?<span style='font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Courier New"'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Yes, Madam President.</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. REGALADO:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Is it his concern that
we vest in the municipal trial courts the matter of election contests for
barangay officials and in the regional trial courts election contests involving
municipal officials thereby requiring a judicial officer to handle these cases,
heightened by the fact that the decisions of the municipal trial court or the
regional trial court in those election contests involving barangay and
municipal officials are final and immediately executory?</blockquote>

<blockquote>MR. MAAMBONG:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Under the present law,
when it comes to appeals from the municipal trial court to the regional trial
court, these become final and executory, and we feel that in this regard, the
jurisdiction of the COMELEC has been diluted.  And we do not like that, Madam President.<span style='font-size:4.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class=BODY>In the light of the foregoing, it is indisputable that contests
involving elections of SK (formerly KB) officials do not fall within Section
252 of the Omnibus Election Code and paragraph 2, Section 2, Article IX-C of
the Constitution and that no law in effect prior to the ratification of the
Constitution had made the SK chairman an elective barangay official.  His being an ex-officio member of the
sangguniang barangay does not make him one for the law specifically provides
who are its elective members, viz., the punong barangay and the seven regular
sangguniang barangay members<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn17' href="#_ftn17"

are elected at large by those who are qualified to exercise the right of
suffrage under Article V<span style='font-size:8.0pt'> </span>of the
Constitution and who are duly registered voters of the barangay.</p>

<p class=BODY>The Court recognizes the consequences of the quasi-judicial acts
performed by the BES pursuant to Section 24 of COMELEC Resolution No. 2499
under the operative fact doctrine; thus, we hold that the Regional Trial Court
is competent to review the decision of the BES in election controversies within
its level.  As correctly stated by the
petitioner, it is a basic principle in administrative law that the absence of a
provision for the review of an administrative action does not preclude recourse
to the courts.</p>

<blockquote>It is generally understood
that as to administrative agencies exercising quasi-judicial or legislative
power there is an underlying power in the courts to scrutinize the acts of such
agencies on questions of law and jurisdiction even though no right of review is
given by statute.  The purpose of
judicial review is to keep the administrative agency within its jurisdiction
and protect substantial rights of parties affected by its decisions.  It is part of the system of checks and
balances which restricts the separation of powers and forestalls arbitrary and
unjust adjudications.<a style='mso-footnote-id:ftn18' href="#_ftn18"

Resolution No. 2499 did not provide for recourse to a higher administrative
body; and secondly, the petitioner's cause falls within the exception to the
rule in that his petition in Civil Case No. 3565, aside from raising pure

The title and numbers of the elective barangay officials had undergone several
changes.  In R.A. No. 2370 (An Act
Granting Autonomy to Barrios of the Philippines [20 June 1959]), elective
barrio officials were the barrio lieutenant and four council members and the
exclusive jurisdiction over contests relating to their election was vested in
the justice of the peace courts.  In
R.A. No. 3590 (Revised Barrio Charter), the elective barangay officials were
the barrio lieutenant and six barrio councilmen.  By virtue of P.D. No. 557, the barrios were converted to <u><span
style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>barangays</span></u><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt'> </span>and the official designation of the elective officials were
changed to barangay captain and barangay councilmen. Thereafter, B.P. Blg. 222
changed the titles of the barangay captain to punong barangay and the barangay
councilmen to kagawad ng sangguniang barangay.</p>
