is that part of the decision of the Director of Mines, affirmed by the Minister
of Natural Resources, which declared that petitioners have abandoned and lost
their rights over their <span class="GramE">mining</span> claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">This case originated from a protest case for alleged overlapping
or encroachment between two mining claims.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The relevant facts are </span>as
<span style="">follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" mining claim was
located by Pedro <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> in January, 1932.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After <span class="SpellE">Sibayan's</span>
death, his heirs <span class="SpellE">Miguela</span> and <span class="SpellE">Aleja</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span> executed a Deed of Extra-Judicial Settlement
wherein they waived their rights and interest over the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim, among others, in favor of co-heir <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Feliza</span></span><span style=""> <span class="SpellE">Sibayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Feliza</span> then
transferred said claims to Sofia Reyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The "<span class="SpellE">Ullmann</span>" mining claim
was located by Elvira <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> in February, 1932, and
was subsequently transferred to Joseph <span class="SpellE">Palengaoan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In 1962, Reyes, <span class="SpellE">Palengaoan</span> and several others formed the KM. 21 Mining
Association, later converted into the KM. 21 Exploration Corporation, to which
the members conveyed their respective mining claims, including the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Ullmann</span>"
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the claims were
assigned to the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> Gold Mining Company for
operation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">During this time, an
amended declaration of location for the "<span class="SpellE">Ullmann</span>"
claim was registered.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span>Petitioners claimed that the Deed of Extra-Judicial Settlement from
which private respondents derived their ownership and possession over the
"<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim was maliciously falsified
[Annex "I" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
78-79] and prayed </span>for annulment of all subsequent transfers involving
the mining claims.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">During the pre-trial of Civil Case No.</span>
Q-17136, the parties entered into an amicable settlement, agreeing that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) private respondents will return to
petitioners the disputed mining claims, including the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
claim; (2) petitioners will reimburse private respondents all expenses, like
assessment taxes, incurred in the preservation of the claims; and (3) private
respondents shall execute the necessary documents to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span>
the mining claims to petitioners [Annex "I" to the Petition,<span style="">&nbsp; </span>pp. 4-5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
78-79.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the Court of First Instance rendered a decision on <st1:date year="1974" day="11" month="11">November 11, 1974</st1:date> ordering the
parties to comply with the above settlement [Decision of the Minister of
Natural Resources, p. 4; Annex "E" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 52.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="7">July 20, 1974</st1:date>,
petitioners filed with the Bureau of Mines a letter-complaint (Mines
Administrative Case No. <span class="GramE">V-784) against private respondents
for alleged overlapping and encroachment of the "<span class="SpellE">Ullmann</span>"
claim over the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1977</st1:date>,
the Director of Mines rendered a decision declaring that there was no conflict
between the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" and "<span class="SpellE">Ullmann</span>" claims, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"VIEWED IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOREGOING, the protest and

preferential right to possess, explore, develop, exploit and operate the area
covered by their "<span class="SpellE">Ullmann</span>" claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>[Decision of the Director of Mines, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 32.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the protest case was filed after Pres. Decree No. 463
(Mineral Resources Development Decree of 1974) took effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1974</st1:date>, the provisions of the
law were made applicable to petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Pres. Decree No. 463 mandates compliance with certain requirements in
order for subsisting mining claims, such as the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
claim, to avail of the benefits granted under the Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, mining rights to the claim will be
lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The requirements are embodied in
Sections 100 and 101, and Section 180 of the implementing regulations, quoted
as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 100.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><b>Old Valid Mining Rights May Come Under This Decree.</b> - Holders of

date of approval of this Decree.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 101.</span><span style="">&nbsp;

located and registered under the Act of the United States Congress of July 1,
1902, as amended, otherwise known as the "Philippine Bill", shall be
surveyed within one (1) year from the approval of this Decree:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><b style="">Provided</b>,

filed with the period provided in Section 176 hereof shall be considered to
have lapsed, and the area covered thereby, shall be open to relocation as if no
grant, patent, location, lease, p<span style="">ermit </span>and
other mining rights have been made or granted thereon.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finding that petitioners failed to comply with the above-cited
provisions, respondent director declared in the impugned portion of the
decision that:</p>

<blockquote>The records of this case show that respondents submitted in
evidence (Exhibit 16) a certification dated <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1976</st1:date> issued by our Mines Regional Officer in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
to the effect that <span class="GramE"><b style="">protestants</b></span>
[petitioners] <b style=""><span style="">failed </span>to file the required application to avail for "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" mineral claim.</b><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, and considering that
the period for the filing of said application has already expired as of <st1:date year="1976" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1976</st1:date>, <span class="GramE"><b style="">protestants</b></span> [petitioners] <b style="">have lost whatever rights they have over
their mining claim involved in this case</b>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, <span class="GramE"><b style="">protestants</b></span>
[petitioners] <b style="">failed to perform the
required annual assessment work since 1952</b> as evidenced by the
certification issued by the Mining Recorder of <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span> 17).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Needless to state that failure to perform the required annual assessment
work <b style="">constitutes abandonment of the
mining claim</b> (Emphasis supplied; Decision of the Director of Mines, pp.
3-4; Annex "C" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
31-32.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal to the Minister of Natural Resources, petitioners
argued that respondent Director was without jurisdiction or exceeded his
jurisdiction in ruling that they have lost their rights over the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" mining claim, since the case was only for
overlapping or encroachment and the question of whether they complied with the
provisions of Pres. Decree No. 463 was never placed at issue in the pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On </span><st1:date year="1980" day="19" month="11"><span style="">November
 19, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">, then
Minister of Natural Resources Jose J. <span class="SpellE">Leido</span> disposed
of the appeal thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>PREMISES CONSIDERED, the instant appeal is hereby dismissed and the
decision, dated <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1977</st1:date>,
of the Director of Mines affirmed.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>[Decision of Secretary of Natural
Resources, p. 10; Annex "E" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 58.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration was likewise denied by
respondent Minister in an Order dated <st1:date year="1981" day="10" month="7">July
 10, 1981</st1:date> [Order, p. 2; Annex "L" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 110.]<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners pray for an order to (1) annul that portion of the
decision which declared them to have abandoned and lost their rights on their
"<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim; (2) require public respondents
to recognize petitioners' vested rights on their "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
mining claim; (3) enjoin private respondents to confine themselves within the
boundaries of their "<span class="SpellE">Ullmann</span>" claim; and
(4) require private respondents to return to petitioners' possession the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" mineral claim [Petition, p. 18; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 19.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents and the Solicitor General filed their
respective Comments, the Solicitor General adopting petitioners' position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents then filed their Comment
to the Solicitor General's Comment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereafter, the Solicitor General submitted his Reply.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon, the case was
deemed submitted for decision.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners reiterate that the portion of the decision which
declared petitioners to have lost and/or abandoned their rights to the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" mining claim was issued without jurisdiction, in
violation of due process and in grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">As counter-argument, private respondents assert that under
Section 49 of Pres. Decree No. 463, when petitioners filed their protest case
for overlapping of mining claims, they automatically subjected their "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim to questions on the validity of its
location and on the locator's having complied with all the requirements of the
Decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues to be resolved in this case are (1) whether or not
public respondents have jurisdiction to pass upon the validity of the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim in a protest case of overlapping of mining
claims; and (2) should public respondents have such jurisdiction, whether or
not they committed grave abuse of discretion or excess of jurisdiction in
declaring petitioners to have abandoned their mining claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of jurisdiction, petitioners contend that public
respondents may not validly and legally take cognizance of an issue not raised
in the complaint, i.e., the issue of the validity of the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" mining claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">This assertion is mistaken.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners had filed the protest case pursuant to Pres. Decree No. 463
which vests the Bureau of Mines with jurisdiction over protests involving
mining claims [Section 48, Pres. Decree No. 463.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the same Decree, Section 90 confers upon the Secretary of
Natural Resources, upon recommendation of the Director of Mines, the authority
to issue rules, regulations and orders necessary to carry out the provisions
and purposes of the Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance
with the statutory grant of rule-making power, the Department Secretary on <st1:date year="1975" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1975</st1:date> issued the Consolidated
Mines Administrative Order Implementing Pres. Decree No. 463, which was
published in the Official Gazette on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="6">June
 16, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">One such implementing rule is Section 128, which respondent
Minister of Natural Resources relied upon in his decision to dispose of the
jurisdictional issue raised by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 128 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SEC. 128.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><b style="">Issues Joined</b>.<span style=""> </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>The Director, or the Secretary, in case of appeals, may <span class="SpellE"><b style="">motu</b></span><b style=""> <span class="SpellE">proprio</span></b> look
into the validity of mining claims, whether raised as an issue or not.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is established in jurisprudence that Congress may validly
delegate to administrative agencies the authority to promulgate rules and
regulations to implement a given legislation and effectuate its policies
[People v. <span class="SpellE">Exconde</span>, 101 Phil 1125 (1957); Director of
Forestry v. Munoz G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-24796, </span><st1:date year="1968" day="28" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 28, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 23 SCRA 1183.]</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
order to be valid, the administrative regulation must be germane to the objects
and purposes of the law, conform to the standards that the law prescribes
[People v. <span class="SpellE">Exconde</span>, <u>supra</u>, citing <span class="SpellE">Calalang</span> v. Williams, 70 Phil 727 (1940); <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation v. Public Service Commission, 70
Phil 221 (1940),] and must relate solely to carrying into effect the general
provisions of the law [U.S. v. <span class="SpellE">Tupasi</span> Molina, 29 Phil
119 (1914).]</p>

<p class="BODY">With these guidelines, Section 128 of the implementing rules
invoked by public respondents as basis for their jurisdiction cannot be tainted
with invalidity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>First, it was issued by
the Department Head pursuant to validly delegated rule-making powers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, it does not contravene the provisions
of Pres. Decree No. 463, nor does it expand the coverage of the Decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 128 merely prescribes a procedural
rule to implement the general provisions of the enabling law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not amend or extend the provisions of
the statute [People v. <span class="SpellE">Maceren</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-32166, </span><st1:date year="1977" day="18" month="10"><span class="GramE">October 18, 1977</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 79 SCRA 450,

<p class="BODY">Neither can it be maintained that such an implementing rule
results in a denial of procedural due process, for it is axiomatic in
administrative law that what the law prohibits is not the absence of previous
notice, but the absolute absence thereof and lack of opportunity to be heard [<span class="SpellE">Catura</span> v. Court of Industrial Relations, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-27392, </span><st1:date year="1971" day="30" month="1"><span class="GramE">January 30, 1971</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 37 SCRA 303,
citing De <span class="SpellE">Borja</span> v. Tan, 93 Phil. 167 (1953).]</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case, petitioners were afforded the
opportunity to be heard on the validity of the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
mining claim when they submitted rebuttal evidence on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 128, being a valid implementing rule, has the force and
effect of law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, public respondents
were duly empowered to inquire into the validity of the mining claims involved
in the protest case, even if not raised in issue.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Having resolved the question of jurisdiction, the Court shall
next determine if public respondents acted within their jurisdiction, or if
they committed grave abuse of discretion which would warrant the issuance of
the writs prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span style="">a </span>rule, the
courts will not interfere with purely administrative matters involving the
exercise of judgment and discretion, and findings of fact, of the
administrative agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exception is
when there is a clear showing that the agency acted arbitrarily or with grave
abuse of discretion or when it acted in a capricious manner such that its
action may amount to an excess or lack of jurisdiction [<span class="SpellE">Pajo</span>
v. Ago, 108 Phil. 905 (1960); <span class="SpellE">Ganitano</span> v. Secretary
of Agriculture, G.R. No. L-21167, March 31, 1966, 16 SCRA 543; <span class="SpellE">Beautifont</span>, Inc. v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 50141,
January 29, 1988, 157 SCRA 481.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Public respondents found that petitioners failed to comply with
the requirements set by law, and thus declared petitioners to have abandoned
and lost their rights over the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, respondent director's <span style="">finding </span>that petitioners failed to file the <span class="SpellE">availment</span>-application
was based solely on evidence submitted by private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This consisted of <span style="">a </span>certification issued by the Mines Regional Officer in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
dated <st1:date year="1976" day="24" month="8">August 24, 1976</st1:date>
stating that petitioners failed to file the <span class="SpellE">availment</span>-­application
for the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim within the period
provided by law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The finding is
effectively contradicted by the rebuttal evidence submitted by petitioners on
appeal consisting of an "Affidavit to Avail of Benefits" and an
"Application for Order of Survey of Mining Claim" (Appeal?Annex
"B" and "B-1", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 47-48)
filed by petitioners with the Bureau of Mines office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
on <st1:date year="1975" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The certification issued by the Mines Regional Officer of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
cannot prevail over the documents clearly evidencing the petitioners' filing
the application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not only was the
application filed within the prescriptive period, it was also duly filed with
the Bureau of Mines Office in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>,
the venue specified under Section 176 of the implementing rules.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents argue that the documents were not filed at
the proper time since they were not formally offered in evidence when the case
was still before the respondent Director, and were only submitted on appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is clearly untenable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners precisely were unaware that the
validity of the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim would be passed
upon in the protest case since such was not raised as an issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence it was only after the decision in the
protest case was rendered that petitioners found the need to present evidence
on appeal relating to the validity of the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
claim.</p>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, respondent Minister gravely abused his discretion when
he disregarded the rebuttal evidence submitted by petitioners which otherwise
would have had the effect of reversing respondent Director's finding.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">As to petitioners' supposed failure to
perform annual work obligations on the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
claim since 1952, the conclusion is only partly correct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Annual work obligations, consisting of
payment of assessment and taxes, had in fact been paid up to the year 1975,
although not by petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The record
shows that the <span class="SpellE">payor</span> was the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
Gold Mining Company, to which the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
claim, among others, had been assigned by private respondents for operation (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 93-98.)<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And subsequent to 1975, petitioners paid the taxes due up to 1981, in
compliance with the law's mandate (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
100-101.) All the documents showing these decisive facts were annexed to
petitioners' "Rejoinder to Motion to Strike Out Appellants' Motion for
Reconsideration" dated February 25, 1981, and submitted to respondent
Minister [Annex "I" to the Petition, pp. 8-9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp.81-82.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">That petitioners</span> were not the actual <span class="SpellE">payors</span> of the assessment due up to 1975 can be attributed
to the fact that possession of the subject claim, even up to the date when the
present petition was submitted for decision, remained with private respondents,
and its ownership had been in dispute in Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">Q-17136.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>By the terms of the amicable settlement
contained in the November 11, 1974 decision in said civil case, which had long
attained finality, private respondents promised to return possession of the
"<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim to petitioners, subject to
reimbursement by petitioners of all assessments and necessary expenses paid for
by private respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
therefore cannot be faulted with non-payment of the assessment works, since
such payment was in fact made, at least until 1975, by the party to which such
payment pertained.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, such
payment inures to the benefit of petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Minister evidently knew of the existence of the
amicable settlement, since he discussed the terms thereof in his decision
[Decision of the Minister of Natural Resources, p. 4; Annex "E" to
the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 52.] Nevertheless, respondent
Minister overlooked the fact that from the terms of the settlement, petitioners
clearly were not liable to pay the assessment works for the years in <span class="GramE">question,</span> and that consequently there was no basis for a
finding of abandonment of the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim
by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, the Court holds that public
respondents had the authority to ascertain the validity of the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, in affirming that portion of the decision of the Director
of Mines declaring petitioners to have "abandoned and lost their
rights" over the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>" claim,
respondent Minister committed grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of
jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That part of the decision of the Director of
Mines dated <st1:date year="1977" day="10" month="1">January 10, 1977</st1:date>
in Mines Administrative Case No. V-784 declaring petitioners to have
"abandoned and lost their rights" over the "<span class="SpellE">Ped</span>"
mineral claim is hereby declared NULL and VOID and SET ASIDE.</p>
