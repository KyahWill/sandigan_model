				<H3>GENARO R. REYES CONSTRUCTION, INC. AND UNIVERSAL DOCKYARD LTD., PETITIONERS, VS. THE HONORABLE COURT OF APPEALS, THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS AND HIGHWAYS, JOSE P. DE JESUS, ROMULO M. DEL ROSARIO, ET AL. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>MELO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Herein petitioners Genaro G. Reyes Construction, Inc. (or GGRCI)
and Universal Dockyard Ltd. (or UDL) seek the nullification of the decision
dated October 20, 1992 and the resolution dated January 20, 1993 of the Eighth
Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 28632.  The said decision and resolution affirmed
the two orders issued by the Regional Trial Court of the National Capital
Judicial Region (Branch 15) dated June 22, 1992 and August 5, 1992 in its Civil
Case No. 92-61345 which denied herein petitioners' application for a temporary
restraining order and a writ of preliminary injunction to enjoin the Department
of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and then DPWH Secretary Jose P. de Jesus,
and others therein impleaded from enforcing and implementing the notice of
pre-termination of petitioners' contract for the implementation of Lower Agusan
Development Project, Stage I, Phase 1, Butuan <span style="">City, or any part </span>thereof, to any person; and prohibiting said
defendants from bidding said project or any part thereof, or awarding it to any
person.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 1, 1992, the Government through respondent DPWH on one
hand, and the joint venture of Genaro G. Reyes Construction, Inc. (GGRCI),
Universal Dockyard, Ltd. (UDL), a British construction firm, Home Construction
(HC), and JPL Construction (JPLC), (represented by petitioner Genaro G. Reyes,
as President of lead contractor GGRCI) on the other hand, entered into a
"Contract for the construction of the flood control facilities and land
improvement works of the Lower Agusan Development Project, Stage 1, Phase 1,
Butuan City" (Annex B, Petition; pp. 75-88, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the bidding which preceded the awards by the DPWH of the
contract to the GGRCI, et al. Joint Venture, petitioners submitted the lowest
bid below the Approved Government Estimate (AGE) of P492,563,998.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following bids were submitted:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.   Petitioner --
P445,858,196.02 -- 9.45% below approved government estimate of P492,563,998.00.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.  D.M. Wenceslao &amp;
Associates -- P659,980,029.00 33.99% above government estimate.</p>

<p class="NUM">3.  Hanil Development
Corporation -- P696,524,897.91 - 41% above government estimate.</p>

<p class="NUM">4.  F.F. Cruz and China
Stage Engineering -- backed out.</p>

<p class="NUM">5.  C.M. Pancho and A.M.
Oreta - disqualified.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 8, 1992 the Notice to Proceed (Annex C, Petition; p. 89,
Rollo) was issued by DPWH Undersecretary Romulo Del Rosario.  It was received by petitioners on May 9,
1992 and they forthwith mobilized and deployed their men and equipment.  The notice to proceed specifically stated
that the contract would take effect not later than thirty days from its receipt
by petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 23, 1992, the other respondents, DPWH Project Engineers
Japanese Eiichiro Araide and Engineer Aquiles C. Sollano recommended
termination of the contract alleging that as of that date "the project
work progress is already 9.50 percent behind schedule (negative slippage)"
(Annex F, Petition; pp. 92-93, Rollo).  Four days later, or on April 27, 1992, Consultant Eiichiro Araide gave
another figure of 9.8% negative slippage (Annex G, Petition; pp. 93-96, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY" style="">Under the law, specifically Presidential
Decree No. 1870, the Government (herein represented by the DPWH) is authorized
to take over delayed infrastructure projects only whenever a contractor is
behind schedule in its contract and <u>incurs 15% or more negative slippage</u>
based on its approved PERT/CM, and the implementing agency, at the discretion
of the Minister concerned, may undertake the administration of the whole or a
portion of the unfinished work or have the whole or portion of such unfinished
work done by another contractor through a negotiated contract at the current
valuation price.</p>

<p class="BODY">Also, Department Order No. 102, Series of 1988 of the DPWH,
provides:</p>

<blockquote>To insure timely and effective remedial steps in response to delays
in project implementation, all Project Managers (PMs), Regional Directors (RDs)
and District Engineers (DEs) concerned shall undertake the following calibrated
actions where contracts for infrastructure projects reach the levels of
negative slippage (attributable to the contractor) indicated below:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.  Negative Slippage of 5% (Early Warning
Stage).  The contractor shall be given a
warning and required to submit a "catch-up" program to eliminate the
slippage.  The PM/RD/DE shall provide
temporary supervision and monitoring of the work.</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  Negative Slippage of 10% ("ICU"
Stage).  The contractor shall be given a
second warning and required to submit a detailed action program on a
fortnightly (two weeks) basis which commits him to accelerate the work and
accomplish specific physical targets which will reduce the slippage over a
definite time period.  Furthermore, the
contractor shall be instructed to specify the additional input resources --
money, manpower, materials, machines, and management in which he should
mobilize for this action program.  The
PM/RD/DE shall exercise closer supervision and meet the contractor every other
week to evaluate the progress of work and resolve any problems and bottlenecks.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  Negative Slippage of 15% ("make or
break" stage).  The contractor
shall be issued a final warning and required to come up with a more detailed
program of activities with weekly physical targets together with the required
additional input resources.  On-site
supervision shall be intensified, and evaluation of project performance will be
done at least once a week.  At the same
time the PM/RD/DE shall prepare contingency plans for the termination and
rescission of the contract and/or take over of the work by administration or
contract.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4. <u>Negative
Slippage beyond 15% ("terminal" stage).  The PM/RD/DE shall contract and/or take over of the remaining
work by administration or assignment to another contractor/appropriate
agency.  Proper transitory measures
shall be taken to minimize work disruptions, e.g.., take over by administration
while rebidding is going on</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Because of negative slippage of 9.50% as of April 23, 1992, or
9.86% as revised on April 27, 1992, respondent Project Director Antonio A.
Alpasan wrote a memorandum (Annex H, Petition; p. 98, Rollo) dated May 8, 1992
to respondent DPWH Undersecretary Romulo Del Rosario recommending either of two
alternatives:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Negotiate
the entire balance of the work with the second lowest bidder, but if the second
lowest bidder is blacklisted, then to the third lowest bidder; or</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rebid the whole balance
of the work or divide it into contract packages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 14, 1992, DPWH Acting Secretary Gregorio Alvarez notified
petitioner GGRCI that its contract is being terminated (Annex D, Petition; p.
90, Rollo).  Also on May 14, 1992,
respondent DPWH Undersecretary Romulo Del Rosario wrote respondent Secretary De
Jesus a memorandum (Annex I, Petition; p. 99, Rollo), "recommending that
the balance of the work be offered to the third lowest bidder, the Korean firm
of Hanil Development Corporation and that in the event that the negotiation
with Hanil fails, the balance of the work be repackaged into several components
for rebidding as soon as possible.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, note must be taken of the circumstance that the
bid price of Hanil of P696,524,897.96 was 41.4% over and above the approved
government estimate (AGE) of P492,563,998.00 for the project.  Hanil's bid was higher by P254,666,701.94
vis-a-vis petitioners' bid and contract price.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 14, 1992, respondent DPWH Secretary De Jesus wrote
petitioners that its contract for the project was terminated (Annex E, Petition;
p. 91, Rollo).  On May 22, 1992,
petitioners wrote a letter requesting reconsideration of the termination order,
pointing out, <u>inter alia</u>, that:</p>

<blockquote>…the bid of Hanil Corp. when the project was bidded <u>15 October
1990</u> was already P696,524,897.00, 41.4% above the Approved Agency Estimate
(AAE), which amounts to P492,563,998.00.  Categorically, we are taking a price difference of P203,960,849.00,
which is obviously much to the disadvantage of the Department and the Filipino
people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In comparison to the contract price of P445,858,196.00, 9.48% below
the <span style="">AAE, </span>the government and
Filipino people stand to earn a savings of P46,705,802.00 and P250,666,651
compared to Hanil's bid price.</blockquote>

<blockquote>... Reviewing the incurred negative slippage in detail, it can
clearly be seen that the bulk can be attributed to the unaccomplished spoilbank
and dredging section of the project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The spoilbank section, supposedly 100 hectares in area had right of
way problems; that is, only 40 hectares or 40% of the total area have been
acquired.  (Annex <span style="">J, </span>Petition; pp. 100-­101, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The request for reconsideration was reiterated on May 26, 1992
and June 14, 1992 (Annexes K and L, Petition; pp. 102-106, Rollo) inviting the
DPWH's attention that:  (a) based on
Hanil's bid price the government stands to lose P250,666,651.00, apart from the
additional P100 Million worth in escalation price as indicated in the
recommendation of respondents Alpasa (Annex H, Petition) and Del Rosario (Annex
I, <u><span style="">supra</span></u><span style="">); </span>(b) the delay and failure of the
DPWH Project Office (PMO) to procure the 100 hectares right of way for the
project's spoilbank area (only 40 hectares was acquired by the DPWH) as
provided for in the tender documents, thereby contributing to a negative
slippage equivalent to 3% due to the suspension of work in that area because of
right of way problems.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 2, 1992, DPWH Secretary De Jesus terminated the contract
of the GGRCI, et al. Joint Venture (Annex M, Petition; p. 107, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 8, 1992, respondent DPWH Undersecretary Romulo del
Rosario sent a letter (Annex N, Petition; pp. 108-110, Rollo) to Mr. Hideo
Tanaka, Chief Representative of Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund (or
OECF) recommending that the termination of petitioners' contract be <u><span style="">lifted</span></u><span style=""> </span>upon the following observations:</p>

<blockquote>... some reasons contributed to the delay
covering the negative slippage was also due to the government's fault, such as:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="">a.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overlapping
of duties and responsibilities among the expatriates, the local consultants and
the field PMO.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">b.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unauthorized variation order with the project
manager and the expatriate consultant issuing it without prior authority from
the central office reducing the length of the flood wall from 5.825 km. to
1.868 km. and change it to levee, with a total cost reduction of P75,458,091.03.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">c.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The right of way problem where the project
has a so-called spoiled bank section which is supposed to be 100 hectares and
the government has to secure the right-of-way.  But as of the present, only about 40 hectares or 40% has been acquired,
out of which, about 20 hectares are contiguous while the remaining are
scattered.  Because of this the
contractor found it difficult to pursue the project as it is quite unrealistic
to dispose of the dredged materials.  Aside from this, there is also the right-of-way problems encountered in
the floodwall and levee construction.</p>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With the termination effected, the
contractor filed a case in the trial court twice denied by the trial
court.  Right now the case has been
appealed to the Court of Appeals.</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The DPWH sent an investigating team to
verify the allegations of the contractor on the faults of the Government and
found to have been true.</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To resolve the issue, we have studied and
came up with three options to continue the project as presented in our report
to Secretary De Jesus (copy attached).  Considering the advantages and disadvantages presented, we recommend
that the termination order be lifted and the contract with the joint venture be
pursued on the premise that the vigorous action of the contractor in pursuing
the case, it is evident that they have all the intention to finish the
project.  Otherwise all their actions
would prove nothing and futile.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The above recommendation was based on the report of Andres
Canlas, <span style="">DPWH Project Manager </span>IV,
dated September 8, 1992 (Annex C-2, Urgent Motion for Issuance of Temporary
Restraining Order; p. 196, Rollo) <u>that the negative slippage of the </u><u><span style="">project </span>was caused not only by the
contractor but also by the government side</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 28, 1992 GGRCI, et al. Joint Venture filed a case for
prohibition, specific performance, and injunction against respondent DPWH as
the sole defendant before the Regional Trial Court of Manila (Civil Case No.
92-61345).  The joint venture
subsequently filed an Amended Petition impleading additional defendants
(respondents herein) and including claims for damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">On June 25, 1992 and August 5, 1992, the regional trial court
issued orders denying the joint venture's prayer for preliminary injunction
citing Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1818 providing that:</p>

<blockquote>No court in the Philippines shall have jurisdiction to issue any
restraining order, preliminary injunction, or preliminary mandatory injunction
in any case, dispute or controversy involving any infrastructure project or a
mining, fishery, forest or other natural resource development of the government
or any public utility operated by the government including any other public
utilities for the transport of the goods or commodities, stevedoring and
arrastre contracts, to prohibit any person or persons, entity or government
official from proceeding with, or continuing the execution or implementation of
any such project, or the operation of such public utility, or pursuing any
lawful activity necessary for such execution, implementation or operation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On August 11, 1992 the joint venture filed with the Court of
Appeals a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with a prayer for a
writ of preliminary injunction to set aside the trial court's orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition in CA-G.R. 28632 was dismissed by respondent Court
of Appeals in a decision dated October 20, 1992 (Annex A, Petition; pp. 68-75,
Rollo) and a subsequent motion for reconsideration was denied in a resolution
dated January 20, 1993 (Annex A-1, Petition; p. 77, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Much reliance is placed on the prohibition embodied in Section 1
of Presidential Decree No. 1818 which forbids any Court in the Philippines,
including this Court, from issuing any restraining order, preliminary
injunction, or preliminary mandatory injunction in any case, dispute or
controversy involving, as in the case at bar, an infrastructure project, to
prohibit any person or entity from continuing with the execution or
implementation of such project.  It is
on the basis of such provision that the door is being closed on petitioners'
prayer for redress.</p>

<p class="BODY">Such proposition is not well-taken.</p>

<p class="BODY">Against the backdrop of the undisputed facts that (a) respondents
terminated petitioners' contract based on slippage of 9.86% and (b) the
contributory fault of the government which substantially added to the slippage
-- the primary question that presents itself is whether the termination was
proper even if the slippage had not reached the 15% level mentioned by the law
as to justify termination.  This is a
legal, not a factual question.  In
consequence, if the termination be adjudged unjustified, are the courts
powerless to intervene due to the <u>caveat</u> under the aforequoted Section 1
of Presidential Decree No. 1818?</p>

<p class="BODY">Although we entertain serious doubts in regard to the
constitutionality of Presidential Decree No. 1818, we nonetheless feel that
said decree finds no application to the case at bench.  It will be observed that what Presidential
Decree No. 1818 proscribes is the issuance of a writ of injunction to impede
or, in the language of the statute:</p>

<blockquote>. . . to prohibit any person or persons, entity or government
official <u>from proceeding with, or continuing the execution or implementation
of any such project</u>, or the operation of such public utility, or pursuing
any lawful activity necessary for such execution, implementation or operation.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In the case at bench, the net effect of
granting the petition is <u>not</u> to stave off <u>implementation</u> of a
government project but precisely to say to public respondents that they ought
to implement the award and should not thus cancel the contract of petitioners
inasmuch as the negative slippage is less than the minimum level specified by
Presidential Decree No. 1870.  Hence,
the proscription under Presidential Decree No. 1818 is inapplicable since we
are not restraining implementation of a government project.  Verily, we are instructing public
respondents to allow petitioners to proceed with the project.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the determination of whether respondents have acted within the
bounds of the law when they terminated the contract based on the admitted 9.86%
slippage, resort must be had to the very law, Presidential Decree No. 1870 and
DPWH Circular No. 102, upon which respondents anchor their authority to
terminate the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The pertinent provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1870 give the
implementing agency (in this instance, the DPWH) authority to terminate the
contract whenever the contractor is behind schedule in its contract work and
incurs 15% or more negative slippage based on its approved PERT/CPM.  Section 1 of Presidential Decree No. 1870
reads thus:</p>

<blockquote>1. Whenever a
contractor is behind schedule in the contract work and <u>incurs 15% or more
negative slippage</u> based on its approved PERT/CPM, the implementing agency,
at the discretion of the Ministry concerned, may undertake by administration
the whole or a portion of the unfinished work <u>done by another qualified
contractor through negotiated contract at the current valuation prices</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Now Circular No. 102, Series of 1988, promulgated to implement
Presidential Decree No. 1870, provides four stages of negative slippage with
which calibrated action, at each stage, has to be undertaken as remedial steps
to correct delays in project implementation, as follows:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 42.75pt; text-indent: -21.15pt;">1)  Negative slippage of 5% ("early
warning" stage).  Contractor is
given a warning;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">2)  Negative slippage of 10% ("ICU"
stage).  The contractor is given a
second warning.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">3)  Negative slippage of 15% ("make or
break" stage).  The contractor
shall be issued a final warning;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 37.35pt; text-indent: -15.75pt;">4)  Negative slippage beyond 15%
("terminal" stage).  The
PM/RD/DE shall initiate termination/rescission of the contract and/or take-over
of the remaining work by administration or assignment to another
contractor/appropriate agency.</p>

<p class="BODY">The discretion, therefore, of the DPWH to terminate or rescind
the contract comes into play only in the event the contractor shall have
incurred a negative slippage of 15% or more.  In the instant case, the negative slippage of petitioners at the time they
were served the notice of termination was only 9.86%.  Hence, respondents violated the law and committed an illegal act
and abused their discretion when they terminated petitioners' contract based on
negative slippage of only 9.86%.  Such
wrongful and illegal act is in derogation of petitioners' right not to be
deprived of property without due process of law.  Petitioners' contract with the <span style="">DPWH </span>covering the project in question is a proprietary right
within the meaning of the Constitution and can only be rescinded strictly in
accordance with the governing law, Presidential Decree No. 1870, as implemented
by DPWH Circular No. 102.  And relative
to this axiom, it has been previously emphasized that courts may declare an
action or resolution of an administrative authority to be illegal because it
violates or fails to comply with some mandatory provision of the law or because
it is corrupt, arbitrary, or capricious (<u>Borromeo vs. City of Manila and
Rodriguez Lanuza</u>, 62 Phil. 512; 516 [1935]; Annotation on the Power of
Judicial Review of Public Bidding and Awards of Government Contracts, 50 SCRA
491; 498 [1973])</p>

<p class="BODY">The Office of the Solicitor General maintains that under
Paragraph 2 of Presidential Decree No. 1870, the DPWH may take over or award a
project to another contractor whenever work is not done on schedule, meaning
anywhere from zero slippage to 15% slippage.  This would lead to hopeless contradiction between Paragraph 1 and
Paragraph 2.  A law cannot possibly
negate in one paragraph what it grants in another.  Paragraph 2 can only be interpreted as allowing discretion after
the 15% limit in Paragraph 1 is exceeded.  It cannot be doubted that in cases of force majeure, revolution,
anomalous transactions in the DPWH itself, and other similar reasons, the Department
Head may still extend the contract beyond 15% slippage.  Only then may sound discretion come in.</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraph 3 of Presidential <span style="">Decree
</span>No. 1870 refers to specific causes -- (a) refusal of the contractor to
provide tools, equipment, and workers; (b) subletting or assigning the contract
to subcontractors without DPWH permission; and (c) willful violation of
covenants and agreements.  Not one of
the above exists in the case at bench.  Respondents cannot, as they allege, rely on the ordinary rules of
contract under the Civil Code that if the obligor does not comply with the
terms and conditions of the contract, the obligee has the right to ask for
rescission with damages.  A special law
fixes the condition of slippage at 15%.  This has to be followed.  The law
on contracts cannot also penalize the obligor for faults of the obligee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 15% slippage required by Presidential Decree No. 1870 can be
likened to the 15-day reglementary period for appealing that cannot co-exist
with a contradictory provision allowing a court, in its discretion, to reduce the
period to one or two days.  Fifteen days
means fifteen days.  Fifteen percent
slippage does not mean 9.5%.</p>

<p class="BODY">The six (6) instances cited as capable of offsetting or negating
the first requirement of 15% slippage would give the DPWH blanket prerogative
to terminate a contract at anytime and on the slightest pretext, including
those created by DPWH itself as in this case.  It is a grant of arbitrary power.  It is delegation running riot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The requirement of public bidding might as well be
abolished.  DPWH officials are compelled
by law to accept only the best bid in the award of contract.  However, what is the point in conducting a
public bidding if, only a short while later, a winning bidder can be
disqualified on a one or two percent slippage caused by DPWH itself or a claim
that certain tools and equipment have not been provided or a pretext that any
term or condition has been violated.  The 15% limiting point must be followed.  The other provisions come in only if they caused the slippage to
go beyond 15%.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is argued that this Court is not a trier of facts.  However, neither can this Court ignore facts
coming from DPWH itself.  Except for
general statements and conclusions, there is nothing presented by respondents
to show that the logical and convincing assertions of petitioner are not true.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to respondents, petitioners failed to mobilize the
minimum equipment for the project and to send a sufficient number of
engineers.  Respondents state that from
Day One, there should have been thirty-four (34) pieces of light and heavy
equipment but that petitioners dispatched only fourteen (14) to the job
site.  Precisely, all these alleged
shortcomings of petitioners were clearly taken into consideration in arriving at
a conclusion that the negative slippage is only 9.50%.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners, </span>of
course, deny the allegation of delay.  They state that they mobilized surveyors, engineers, and laborers;
brought all the necessary equipment to the job site, constructed bunk houses,
relocated buildings such as those of the Pagatpatan Elementary School.  Petitioners' engineers were old hands of
DPWH and familiar with every aspect of the construction.  The best evidence that the statements of
petitioners are more accurate than those of respondents is that the DPWH
Investigating <span style="">Team went </span>to the
jobsite and thereafter filed a lengthy report.  It was on the basis of the report that then Undersecretary del Rosario
later recommended that the termination order be reconsidered and revoked and
that petitioners should be allowed to continue with the construction under the
original contract.  The Undersecretary
did not mention what respondents now allege in their memorandum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Common sense also dictates that 34 pieces of light <span style="">and </span>heavy equipment cannot all be used
simultaneously on Day One.  More so,
because the right of way was admittedly not secured by DPWH.  The machinery would only be idle or get in
each other's way.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming respondents to be correct that there was a three-month
delay in commencing the job, the slippage is still 9.86% inspite of all
petitioners' alleged shortcomings.  Petitioners claim to have mobilized the men and the materials on time
and attribute the delay to DPWH but emphasize that "whatever dates are
chosen and whatever causes are adduced by the respondents and given the worst
scenario, the slippage does not go beyond 9.85%, still not a basis to cancel
the contract" (p. 4, Petitioners' Memorandum dated February 2, 1994).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents keep on blaming petitioners for delay but their own DPWH
Investigating Team and the second highest official of the DPWH laid the blame
on the government engineers and purchasing officials.</p>

<p class="BODY">The right of way problem calls for special mention.  The letter of DPWH Undersecretary Romulo del
Rosario dated October 8, 1992 recommended the lifting of the cancellation of
the contract, because of, among other things, the right-of-way problem.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was ascertained during the hearing conducted by the Court on
January 12, 1994 that of the 100-hectare spoiled bank section, only 40 hectares
have been acquired.  Half of this 40
hectares is broken down into small parcels separate from each other.  In the other half, DPWH paid the landowners
but took no steps to attend to the tenants who refused and continue to refuse
to vacate their farms unless compensated.  The dredging on the river shall result in 1,300,000 cubic meters of mud,
silt, and debris flowing into the area.  Unless a ring embankment is constructed around the entire 100 hectares,
the mud and silt would inundate neighboring areas.  Petitioners cannot possibly start dredging until after the 100
hectares are acquired because this would drown or bury the people, work
animals, and farms in the still-to-be acquired 60 hectares, not to mention the
tenants who refuse to leave their farms in the 40 hectares already purchased
until compensation benefits are given to them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General has also failed to explain the purchase of
non-essential areas.  There was no
explanation for the sudden change from a reinforced concrete floodwall to an
earthen levee along a six kilometer stretch of the project.  The concrete floodwall calls for the
purchase of a 10-meter wide strip of land along it.  The earthen levee requires a 35-meter wide adjacent strip of
land.  Anywhere up to 25 meters wide and
six kilometers long of expensive urban land had to be purchased to cover up the
use of right-of-way funds where it is not essential.</p>

<p class="BODY">There should likewise be an explanation why an extra P71,000,000
in addition to the earlier amount of P51,000,000 had to be appropriated for
right of way.</p>

<p class="BODY">What is appalling and seemingly anomalous is the recommendation
of respondent officials to offer the project to <span style="">Hanil </span>Corporation, the third lowest bidder, and whose bid had
been previously disqualified for being 41.40% over and above the government
estimate for the project of P492,563,998.00.  Indeed, the Hanil bid was P696,524,897.96, or higher by P254,666,701.94
as compared to petitioners' bid and contract price of P445,858,196.02.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents' wrongful termination of the contract which
petitioners agreed to execute, and have in fact executed partially, at the
price of P445,858,196.02 and in offering it to Hanil, a disqualified bidder
which previously entered with a bid of P696,524,817.96, would result in a financial
loss to the government in the amount of no less than P254,666,201.94, Hence,
respondents would seem to appear to be entering into a negotiated contract
grossly disadvantageous to the government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The intent of the law (P.D. 1870) in allowing the government to
take over delayed construction projects with negative slippage of 15% or more
is primarily "to save money and to avoid dislocation of the financial
projections and/or cash flow of the government", as clearly stated in the
3rd preambulatory clause of said decree, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Whereas, any delay in the completion of the contract in accordance
with the approved PERT/CPM and/or contract time as stipulated, will not only <u>dislocate
the financial projections and/or the cash flow of the Government on these
projects</u>, but also unduly prejudice the public interest sought to be
subserved by the timely completion of the infrastructure project.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The termination of petitioners' contract does not, therefore,
subserve public interest.  On the other
hand, it would result in a huge dislocation of the financial projections and/or
cash flow of the Government.  On this
score, it has been said as a general doctrine that though the law be fair on
its face, and impartial in appearance, yet if it is applied and administered by
the public authorities charged with their administration and thus representing
the government itself, with an evil eye and unequal hand so as practically to
make unjust and illegal discrimination, the denial of equal justice is still
within the prohibition of the Constitution.  (<u>Yick Wo vs. Hopkins</u>, 128 U.S. 356; <u>Ex parte Virginia</u>, 100
U.S. 339; <u>Henderson vs. Mayor</u>, 92 U.S. 259; <u>Chy Lung vs. Freeman</u>,
92 U.S. 175; <u>Ned vs. Delaware</u>, 103 U.S. 320; <u>Soon Hing vs. Crowley</u>,
113 U.S. 703).</p>

<p class="BODY">If the unjust and unlawful acts of respondents are not struck
down and respondents are not restrained, the Government stands to lose from
Three Hundred Fifty Million (P350 Million) Pesos additional expenditures.  Under Presidential Decree No. 1870 when the
project is rebidded or awarded through negotiated contract, <span style="">compensation </span>is at "current
valuation price" (Sec. 1, P.D. 1870).  Considering the increase in prices of labor and materials, it is a
certainty that any new bidder would ask for prices much higher than the already
high prices which the losing bidders offered in the March 1, 1991 bidding.  Tremendous loss of taxpayers' money thus is
inevitable.  This Court cannot,
therefore, close its eyes to the resultant evil which will be inflicted not
only upon petitioners, but also on the Filipino people and the dissipation of
taxpayers' money arising from the unjust termination of petitioners' contract
and the rebidding to or renegotiation with other parties of the project.  Public interest and the stakes of the
Government dictate the issuance of the writs of injunction and prohibition
restraining respondents from enforcing the order terminating petitioners'
contract for the construction of the flood control facilities and land
improvement works of the Lower Agusan Development Project, Stage I, Phase 1.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be emphasized that the law fixing the stages of negative
slippage before termination of a contract may be effected and the undisputed
loss of P350 million if the termination is pushed through are not the only
reasons why this petition should be granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the very admissions of respondent DPWH, such as the October 8,
1992 letter of Undersecretary Roberto del Rosario to the Japanese consultant,
earlier cited, the main cause of the delay was due to respondent DPWH officials
and not to petitioner.  A total of P51
million was appropriated and released to acquire rights of way or to buy the
lands upon which the flood control project would be constructed.  The farmers and landowners refused to move
out when the funds to compensate them were not forthcoming.  This was the main cause of the 9.6% slippage
and it is not attributable to petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">DPWH </span>Team which
investigated the causes of slippage further found that there was an overlapping
of duties and responsibilities among the Japanese consultant, the local
consultants, and the Field Project Manager, thus sustaining petitioners' claim
of unwarranted delays in the approval of work and equipment, not to mention
changes of orders which left petitioners wondering what to do and whom to
follow.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is ample evidence in the record before us to show that the <span style="">DPWH </span>was responsible for the main
causes of the delay.  As stated by
petitioners, <span style="">DPWH, </span>in failing to
comply with its obligations seemingly wants the contractors to work in a most
unorthodox <span style="">if </span>not unthinkable <span style="">manner </span>to justify irregular purchases
which should not have been made.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, not only was the slippage within legally tolerable
limits but the causes of the slippage are attributable to respondent <span style="">DPWH </span>officials.  The inflexible stance of respondents towards
the compromise offers of petitioners, even before this Court ordered them to
explore such a possibility, but especially after we asked them to do so,
convinces the Court all the more that there are irregularities which
respondents are sweeping under the rug.  The record also shows that even after the stop-work order was given and
while petitioners were trying to have it reconsidered, they continued working
full force on the project thus minimizing or eliminating the slippage which
caused the disputed problems.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby GRANTED and the decision
dated October 20, 1992, as well as the resolution dated January 20, 1993 of the
Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 28632 are hereby SET ASIDE.</p>

Trial Court (RTC) committed a grave abuse of discretion in denying the
petitioner companies' application for a temporary restraining order or a writ
of preliminary injunction, and that the Court of Appeals' refusal to set aside
the RTC's order of denial constituted reversible error on the part of the
appellate court.  This would be
straightforward enough.  However, it
should be noted that the RTC denied petitioners' application <u>on legal
grounds</u>, that is, that the RTC had no lawful authority to grant that
application.  Assuming, for purposes of
argument merely, that the RTC had erred in reaching its legal conclusion, it is
very difficult to suppose that the RTC's error of law constituted grave abuse
of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction.  And that is precisely what the Court of
Appeals held.</p>

<p class="BODY">It would appear, however, that the majority opinion is also
saying something else:  that the
Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) committed either an unlawful act
or a grave abuse of discretion in terminating its contract with petitioner
Construction Company.</p>

<p class="BODY">A principal problem with this position is that there has as yet
been no trial on the merits in the lower court.  Petitioners' application for a temporary restraining order or a
preliminary writ of injunction was made very early in the case, such that the
RTC could not, and did not, make any findings of fact, and denied the application
solely on legal grounds.  The majority
opinion is, however, replete with descriptive, fact-type, statements which
cannot be said to reflect findings of fact, <u>since none were made either by
the RTC or by the Court of Appeals</u>.  It would, accordingly, appear that the majority opinion has treated the
allegations of one or the other party (but principally the petitioners) <u>as
if</u> such allegations constituted statements of established facts.  They can scarcely be regarded as <u>undisputed
facts</u>, since the respondents, defendants before the RTC, have not yet even
filed their answer.  I fear, therefore,
that this Court, which is, of course, not a trier of facts, will, among other
things, be pre-empting the results of the still forthcoming trial before the
RTC.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i> should be denied,
and I so vote.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">VITUG, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I regret inability to
join my esteemed colleagues in their majority opinion.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts and the events
that led to petitioners' recourse to this Court, as far as I can gather from the
available records of the case, could be detailed </span>thusly:</p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 October 1990, a joint venture agreement was entered into by
and among Genaro R. Reyes Construction, Inc. (GRRCI), Universal Dockyard
Limited (UDL), Home Construction, and JPL Construction for the purpose of
engaging in the construction business.  On 01 March 1991, respondent Department of Public Works and Highways
(DPWH), represented by then Secretary Jose P. de Jesus, executed a contract
with the joint venture, represented by GRRCI President Genaro R. Reyes, for the
construction of flood control facilities and land improvement works at the
Lower Agusan Development Project, Stage I, Phase I, Butuan City.  The project was to be completed within
fifty-two (52) calendar months from the date of the receipt of the formal
notice to proceed.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 14 May 1992, GRRCI, through Genaro R. Reyes, received
identical notices from the DPWH, one from Undersecretary Gregorio S. Alvarez
and another from Secretary Jose P. de Jesus, informing him of DPWH's decision
to terminate the contract in "view of the minimal accomplishment of the
Joint Venture despite x x x repeated granting of grace period x x x to register
substantial accomplishment x x x."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> The
notices were issued in response to the memorandum, dated 23 April 1992,
addressed by Project Engineers Eiichiro Araida and Aquiles Sollano, to DPWH
Regional Director Julio M. Luspo, recommending said termination.  The memorandum, in part, expressed:</p>

<blockquote>"Please be informed that as of April
23, 1992, the project work progress is already 9.50 percent behind schedule
(negative slippage), and it has been observed that there is no indication at
present that the situation will improve.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the present situation, we
believe that sooner or later, the negative slippage of the work progress will
continue to increase beyond negative 15 percent.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 27 April 1992, Project Engineer Araida issued another
Memorandum to Regional Director Luspo, in which he indicated the individual
performances of the joint venture, except UDL, and forecasted negative
slippages for the succeeding months, which would reach 16.86% by October 1992.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 May 1992, the joint venture filed a Petition (Civil Case
No. 92-61345) for "Prohibition, Specific Performance and Injunction, with
Prayer for the Issuance of a Writ of Preliminary Injunction and/or <span style="">Temporary Restraining Order," with the
Regional Trial Court (RTC), Branch 15, of Manila, seeking to prohibit </span><span style="">DPWH </span><span style="">from terminating the contract and rebidding the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On 22 June 1992, the RTC
denied the prayer for the issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction.  On 08 July 1992, respondent </span><span style="">DPWH </span><span style="">filed a "Manifestation (In Lieu of Answer)," praying that it
be relieved from filing an answer considering that the 22nd June 1992 order of the
court has rendered the issues raised in the petition moot and academic.  The petitioners filed an amended petition by
adding other respondent officials of </span><span style="">DPWH.  </span><span style="">On 05 August 1992, the RTC issued another
order to the following effect:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Anent the ground that there is no basis for <span style="">DPWH </span>to terminate its contract with
plaintiff as this is depriving the latter of their right to property without
due process, this Court believes that <span style="">DPWH
</span>being an agency of the government is presumed to have performed a lawful
activity.  That, in fact, the acts done
or to be done by DPWH is unlawful is for plaintiff to prove after due
hearing.  In the meantime, this Court
following the directive of <span style="">PD 1818, </span>has
no power to enjoin <span style="">DPWH </span>from
pursuing any lawful act relative to the implementation of the infrastructure
project.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, motion for the issuance of preliminary injunction
is hereby DENIED.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A petition for "<i>Certiorari</i> and Prohibition, with
Prayer for Preliminary Injunction and Temporary Restraining Order," was
filed with the Court of Appeals, followed, on 17 August 1992, by an
"Extremely Urgent Motion for Issuance of Temporary Restraining
Order."</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the Solicitor-General, in his comment to the petition
before the Court of Appeals, manifested that Home Construction and JPL
Construction "had already signified their willingness to adhere to the

1981, is aimed at avoiding disruptions in the undertaking of essential
government infrastructure projects.  Letter of Instructions No. 1186 defines the term "infrastructure
project," to include -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x all projects of all the Ministries of Government, those
of offices and agencies under their supervision and those of corporations and

control and drainage, water <span style="">supply and
sewerage systems, shore protection, power facilities, national </span>buildings,
school buildings, hospital buildings, and other related construction projects
that form part of the government capital investment."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">There
can hardly be any dispute that the project covered by the contract in question
is embraced by Presidential Decree No. 1818.  Section 1 of the Decree reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

(Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">On
the above score, the respondent appellate court elucidated, as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"PD 1818 was promulgated to prohibit the courts from issuing
restraining orders or preliminary injunctions in cases involving infrastructure
projects in order not to disrupt or hamper the pursuit of essential government
projects critical to the economic development effort of the nation (Second 'Whereas'
clause).  The injunction sought seeks to
restrain the DPWH and its officials from carrying out the order terminating the
contract of petitioners, and if granted would in effect amount to an
interference by the court or the substitution of its judgment for that of the
said administrative agency in the discharge of its functions in pursuing the <span style="">infrastructure project in question.  The issuance of an injunction is clearly
covered by the peremptory language of PD 1818.  While the prohibition is by no means absolute, as </span>the courts are
not prevented from exercising jurisdiction where questions of law are involved
(Datiles &amp; Co. vs. Sucaldito, 186 SCRA 704) or when the administrative
agency violates a citizen's constitutional right, or commits a grave abuse of
discretion, or acts in excess of or without jurisdiction (Mantruste System,
Inc. vs. CA, 179 SCRA 136) We are not convinced that petitioners' plea of a
violation of its contractual/property rights is sufficient to override the
letter and legislative purpose behind PD 1818.  The arguments raised by petitioner in questioning the percentage of
negative slippage and the computation of days of delay due to the various
problems encountered which are allegedly attributable to respondent DPWH,
involve questions of fact and the exercise of official discretion on the part
of the administrative officials concerned, and do not justify judicial
interference.  As stated in Datiles and
Co. vs. Sucaldito, supra., which involves a similar statutory prohibition
contained in PD 605:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“‘The prohibition pertains to the issuance by the courts of
injunctions or restraining orders, against administrative acts or controversies
which involves facts or exercise of discretion in technical cases because to
allow courts to judge these matters would disturb the smooth functioning of the
administrative machinery.’</p>

<blockquote>"We are not convinced that the issues
raised fall outside of the above dimension so that the courts will not be
prevented by PD 1818 from exercising its power to restrain or prohibit
administrative acts.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The allegation that petitioners' constitutional right is
being violated cannot be upheld.  Its right
to continue with the contract should be considered in light of the DPWH's
official prerogative to terminate the same, and until the merits of this issue
are fully litigated, the issuance of the preliminary injunction must be deemed
covered by PD 1818, if the purpose of the latter issuance is to be served at
all.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The petitioner's insistence that its negative slippage of 10%
as of May, 1992 is below the 15% negative slippage that would authorize
take-over of its contract pursuant to PD 1870 and its implementing Circular No.
102 goes into the merits of the legality of the termination order, which merely
adverted to petitioner's 'minimal accomplishment.' The idea behind PD 1818 to
restrain the courts from interfering with administrative decisions arrived at
in the pursuit of infrastructure projects is to enable the agency concerned,
which is presumably more knowledgeable with respect to the technical matters
involved in such critical projects, to utilize its technical expertise in the
pursuit of the essential infrastructure projects.  Courts should not block by an injunction the discharge of the
agency's functions and the implementation of its decisions, in the absence of a
clear violation of constitutional right.  We are not convinced that there is such a violation."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, as the majority opinion (concurring with the petitioners)
so well point out, one can take issue on what the respondents would assume to
be a limitless application of the aforequoted provision.  Section 5, Article VIII, of the 1987
Constitution explicitly vests in the Supreme Court original jurisdiction
"x x x over petitions for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>, prohibition, <i><u>mandamus</u></i>,
<u>quo</u> <u>warranto</u> and <u>habeas</u> <u>corpus</u>." The
conferment of that jurisdiction may be contended to likewise implicitly vest in
the Court the ancillary remedies incidental to the proper exercise
thereof.  So, also, Section 1 of the
same Article VIII provides that judicial power, this time residing in all courts
of competent <span style="">jurisdiction, includes the
duty "x x x to determine whether or not there has a been grave abuse of
discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction on the part of any
branch or instrumentality of the government."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court need not, in my view, pass upon this constitutional question,
albeit submitted by the parties, there being neither urgency nor necessity for
it at this time.  The settled rule is
that if there are other grounds upon which a case may be disposed of and
resolved, such as, I believe, in this case at bench, courts must refrain from
ruling on constitutional issues.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What should be <u>apropos</u>, instead of now making a peremptory
<u>dictum</u> on the question of the constitutionality or scope of application
of the decree, is an inquiry beforehand <span style="">on
</span>the legal propriety, on the basis of Rule 65 of the Rules of Court, of
the petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i> and prohibition itself.  For the extraordinary writ to issue, the
rules require the attendance, among other conditions <u>sine</u> <u>qua</u> <u>non</u>,
of "grave abuse of discretion." Has there really been one in the case
at bench?  This is the prejudicial
question to be asked.</p>

<p class="BODY">Grave abuse of discretion, albeit an "elastic phrase,"<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
has always been understood as a capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment
as is equivalent to lack of jurisdiction, such as, to exemplify, "where
the power is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion
or<span style=""> </span>personal hostility, x x so
patent and gross as to amount to an evasion of positive duty or to a virtual
refusal to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of
law."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Looking at the several propositions advanced to support the
petition, concededly well presented and skillfully argued by counsel, on the
one hand, and evaluating the same on the basis of the foregoing standard, on
the other hand, I can not see my way clear to holding the appellate court
guilty of reversible error in not attributing grave abuse of discretion on the
part of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in refusing to grant the extraordinary
writ prayed for.  In terminating the
contract, said respondents have acted on the basis, preclusive of unessential
details, of an official report to the effect that the pace of work <span style="">on </span>the project, despite "repeated
grantings of grace period," has been unsatisfactory and behind
schedule.  The fear on their part of
further delays in the completion of the projects has not at all been
imaginary.  To say that they have acted
whimsically or capriciously I find hard to accept.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners allege that under Presidential Decree No. 1870,
signed on 12 July 1983, the authority to take over a delayed infrastructure
project may be done only when the negative slippage, which must be actual and
not merely anticipated, is more than 15%; hence -</p>

<blockquote>"1. Whenever
a contractor is behind schedule in its contract work and incur 15% or more
negative slippage based on its approved PERT/CPM, the implementing agency, at
the discretion of the Minister concerned, may undertake by administration the
whole or a portion of the unfinished work, or have the whole or a portion of such
unfinished work done by another qualified contractor through negotiated
contract at the current valuation price."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Petitioners' invocation is poorly placed
according to public respondents who, on their part, strongly <span style="">maintain that the termination of the contract
is based on paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same Presidential Decree, providing
thusly -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“2. Whenever a
work activity in the project is not being done on schedule per approved
PERT/CPM, the Minister concerned/Head of Implementing Agency shall notify and direct
the contractor to immediately undertake such work activity.  If, within fifteen (15) days from receipt of
such notice, the contractor fails to start the work and to show satisfactory
performance, the Government may take over the whole or a portion of such work
and, at the discretion of the Minister concerned, have such work done by
administration or award the same to another qualified contractor through
negotiated contract at the current valuation price.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“3.  If, at any time during the progress of the
contract work, the contractor should fail, refuse or neglect to supply and
provide the required tools, materials, supplies, equipment, facilities and
labor-workmen; or if the contract or any part thereof is being sublet or
assigned without the previous written consent of the Government; or if the
contractor is willfully violating any of the terms, conditions, covements,
agreements or technical requirements of the project, the Government shall have
the option to take over the project in whole or in part and to complete the
same.  The Government, at the discretion
of the Minister/Head of Implementing Agency concerned, may have the contract
work done by administration or award the same to another qualified contractor through
negotiated contract at the current valuation price."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Additionally,
the Solicitor General cites Section 11 of Presidential Decree 1594, which
reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Section 11. <u>Government's</u>
<u>Right</u> <u>to</u> <u>Take</u> <u>Over</u> <u>Contract</u> <u>Work</u>.  </span>The Government may take over the
contract work should the contractor abandon the contract work, or unduly delay
the prosecution of the contract work, or become insolvent, or assign his assets
for the benefit of his creditors, or be adjudged bankrupt, or assign the
contract work without written approval by the Government, or violate any
condition or term of the contract.  In
any of these cases, the Government may terminate the employment of the
contractor and take over the contract work after giving due notice to the
contractor and his sureties."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The above-quoted
provisions of Presidential Decree No. 1594 and Presidential Decree No. 1870
must be deemed to form part of, and to co-exist with, the contract, even if the
parties did not explicitly provide for them.  Applicable peremptory provisions of law of this nature, affecting as
they do public policy or impressed as they are with public interest, are held
to be written into the contract.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In Commissioner of Internal Revenue vs.

<p class="BODY">Looking closely at Presidential Decree No. 1594 and Presidential
Decree No. 1870, relied upon by DPWH, it is obvious that the government can
terminate or take over a contract work in any of the following cases:</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">1.  Whenever a contractor is behind schedule in
its contract work and incurs a 15% or more negative slippage based on the
approved PERT/CPM;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">2.  Whenever a work activity in the project is
not being done on schedule per approved PERT/CPM and the Contractor fails,
within fifteen (15) days from receipt of notice, to undertake the work and to
show satisfactory performance;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">3.  If, at any time during the progress of the
contract work, the contractor should fail, refuse or neglect to supply and
provide the required tools, materials, supplies, equipment, facilities and
labor-workmen;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">4.  If the contract or any part thereof is
being sublet or assigned without the previous written consent of the
Government;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">5.  If the contractor is willfully violating
any of the terms, conditions, covements, agreements or technical requirements
of the project;</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">6.  If the contractor abandons the contract
work, or unduly delays the prosecution of the contract work; or</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.3in; text-indent: 0in;">7.  If the contractor becomes insolvent, or
assigns his assets for the benefit of creditors, or be adjudged a bankrupt.</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">It cannot be seriously disputed that
petitioners' work has been behind schedule, and that said petitioners' attention
to such delays has more than once been called.  It is rather on the extent and on the cause of such delays, both factual
matters, that the parties strongly differ (reiterated by the parties during the
hearing held by the Court on 12 January 1994 and again stressed in their
respective memoranda).  It should be
understandable if courts would in the first place, and pending the judicial
determination of the facts after due hearing, count on the findings of agencies
equipped with the manpower, as well as technical competence, such as the DPWH
in this case, to make that evaluation.  This Court itself is not a trier of facts, and it must accord due
respect and weight to their conclusions.  And even if I were to assume, for the sake of argument, <span style="">that there has been on the part of the public
respondents, including both the trial court and the appellate court which
sustained them, a misappreciation of the facts here involved, I cannot view
such flaw, given the circumstances, as amounting to grave abuse of discretion
more than, if at all, as mere error of judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In </span>sum, I <span style="">fail </span>to see a clear case that can
justify the grant of the petition and the issuance of the extraordinary writs
prayed for.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court's attention is called by herein petitioners on another
matter.  It is averred that there has
been a recommendation by Undersecretary Romulo del Rosario to award the balance
of the project to the third lowest bidder, the Hanil Construction (Hanil),
whose bid is 41.4% (P203,960,899.96) over and above the government estimate for
the venture;<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, the petitioners' apprehension that the ultimate losers could be the
government itself.  There is absolutely
no reason for <span style="">such fear.  T</span>he DPWH "Resolution
