<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">As Appellant was able to return to
Complainant jewelry worth P35,000.00, that amount was eventually deducted from
the indemnity ordered by the trial Court to be paid to complainant in Criminal Case
No. Q-8079 thereby reducing her civil liability therein to P32,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction but
imposed the new and heavier penalties prescribed by Presidential Decree No.
818, which had taken effect on October 22, 1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The dispositive portion of the Appellate
Court Decision reads:</p>

Sentence Law as the penalties imposable for the frauds she had committed fall
within the range of life imprisonment or <u>reclusion perpetua</u> (Sec. 2,
Indeterminate Sentence Law)." (Court of Appeals Decision, p.32, Record,
CA-G.R. Nos. 22632-33-CR).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, instead of
entering judgment the Court of Appeals certified the two cases to this Court

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The facts as found by the
trial Court, adopted by Appellant, restated in the Court of Appeals Decision,
and as borne out by the records, are quoted hereunder:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span style="">"Purita Comandante </span>first
met the two accused on May 16, 1977 at about 10:00 o'clock a.m., in the
Tanbunting Pawn Shop in Cubao, Quezon City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were introduced to her by a certain Aida, an appraiser of the pawn
shop, as buyers of jewelries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As she had
no jewelry for sale at the time, she told the two accused who had offered to
make some purchase <i>'bukas na lang'</i>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>She then met the two accused again on the following morning in the same
pawn <span style="">shop and </span>showed to them a
set of a pair of earrings and a ring.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The two accused paid for the same in cash and asked her to show them
more items of jewelry as they want to buy more.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After agreeing with them to meet again in the after­noon, she returned
to the pawn shop bringing along a bracelet and nine stones (90 points and 220
'chispas') valued at P35,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two
accused bought them and gave to her in payment four (4) postdated checks -
Philippine Banking Corporation Check No. 2753 for the amount of P10,000.00 and
dated May 23,1977 (Exh. 'A'), PBC Check No. 2755 for the amount of P10,000.00
and dated June 10, 1977 (Exh. 'B'), PBC Check No. 2756 for the amount of
P5,000.00 and dated June 15, 1977 (Exh. 'C'), and PNB Check No. 71189 for the
amount of P10,000.00 and dated <span style="">May 23,
1977 </span>(Exh. 'D').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Philippine
Banking Corporation checks were drawn by accused Leonora Dy alone while the
Philippine National Bank checks were jointly drawn and signed by the two
accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A receipt (Exh. 'E') for the
purchase and the payment therefor with four postdated checks was issued and
signed by the two accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Also, both
accused noted down in a piece of paper (Exh. 'E-3') their respective addresses
and the telephone number of Leonora Dy and gave the same to Purita
Comandante.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the following day, May
18, 1977, at 11:00 o'clock a.m., the two accused saw her in her resi­dence at
367 De la Alas Street in Pasay City.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They wanted more pieces of jewelry.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As she had no jewelry at the time, they agreed to meet again.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, she showed a set of a ring and
a pair of earrings, 'brilliante &amp; baget stone'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again the accused bought and paid for them
with PBC Check No. 2759 issued by Leonora Dy for the amount of P10,000.00 and
dated May 23, 1977 (Exh. 'F').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
corresponding receipt showing the purchase and mode of pay­ment was issued and
signed by both accused (Exh. 'G').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
check was given by Comandante to a certain Mrs. Nancy Ventura who is her
supplier.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A ring valued at P7,000.00 was
also bought by the accused and paid for with another postdated check which was
subsequently retrieved by them and the value thereof incorporated and included in
three other postdated checks given for subsequent purchases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Comandante got a necklace with a 'brilliante'
cross and a pair of dia­mond earrings from Mrs. Nancy Ventura.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two pieces of jewelry were shown to the
accused and they also agreed to buy them at the given price of P35,000.00
each.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused first had the
jewelries appraised at the Tambunting Pawn Shop and being satisfied with their
quality, they paid for the same with three post­dated checks - PNB Check No.
71190 for amount of P57,000.00 and dated May 23, 1977 (Exh. 'H'), PBC Check No.
2758 for the amount of P10,000.00 and dated May 21, 1977 (Exh. 'I'), and PBC
Check No. 2754 for the amount of P10,000.00 and dated May 30, 1977 (Exh.
'J').<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The amounts of these three checks
sum up to P77,000.00 as they included the other postdated check in the amount
of P7,000.00 which was taken back by the accused to be consolidated with said
three checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This last transaction is
evidenced by a receipt (Exh. 'L') signed by both accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All these transactions were consummated in
three days, from May 17 to May 19, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While the receipt marked as Exh. 'G' is dated May 20, 1977 and the
receipt marked as Exh. 'L' is dated May 23, 1977, they are not reflective of the
true dates of their execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The receipt
marked Exh. 'I' is dated May 23, 1977, because it was on this date that the
accused promised to pay for all the jewelries or return them if unsold by
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When presented for payment, all
the eight (8) checks given by the accused to Comandante were dishonored by the
drawee bank (Exhs. 'A-5', 'B-A', 'C-4', 'D-5', 'F-3', 'H-3', 'I-3' &amp;
'J-3'), for reasons of 'insufficient fund' or 'no arrangement'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the PBC Check dated May 21, 1977 was dis­honored
when presented for payment on that date, Comandante became apprehen­sive and
immediately made arrangements with Leonora Dy to meet with her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They met at a place near the New Frontier
theater at Cubao, Quezon City, and Dy told Comandante to wait until the follow­ing
day as Elizabeth Salen was not around.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When they met on the following day, Comandante told Dy to just return
her jewelries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Dy then brought
Comandante to the house of Salen at San Mateo, Rizal, where Comandante again
told both accused this time that they return her jewelries and she in turn will
return their checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused then
brought Comandante to Lerma St. in Sampaloc, Manila, ostensibly to look for
their buyer who had taken the pieces of jewelry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After going around the block of the Far
Eastern University, the accused, however, returned to San Mateo, Rizal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They told Comandante that the jewelries were
with a certain Josie Paz, also of San Mateo.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When Comandante and the two accused went to the house of Josie Paz, this
Josie Paz showed surprise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Elizabeth
Salen then whispered to the ears of Paz and after that Paz stated that the
jewelries were with Nena Carpio of Quirino District.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Again, Comandante with the two accused
proceeded to the house of Nena Carpio at Caimito Street in Quirino District.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked to give the jewelries, Carpio
blurted out:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'I do not have the
jewelries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You sue them.' Comandante
then told the two accused that they go to the Metrocom and they proceeded
thereto toge­ther with Bobot Reyes and Cecerina Coman­dante, daughter of
Purita.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the Metrocom headquarters,
the two accused gave written statements (Exhs. 'M' &amp; 'N') admitting receipt
by them of the jewelries and their issuance of all the postdated checks in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two accused were pointing
to each other as the one responsible for the disappearance of the jewelries.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Purita Comandante identified the accused Leonora Dy as the
person who took her jewelries and issued and delivered to her the postdated
checks in question, and two photographs (Exhs. 'P' &amp; 'P-1') as those of
Elizabeth Salen.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Leonora Dy, taking the witness stand in her defense, denied
responsibility for Comandante's jewelries and the dishonored checks, stating
that it was with Elizabeth Salen alone that Comandante transacted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She further stated that she met Elizabeth
Salen on May 7, 1977 at the Tambunting Pawn Shop where she (Dy) was then
pawning a Seiko wrist watch and a ring.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Salen proposed to buy the watch and ring and after agreement, Salen paid
her right then and there the amount of P350.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The balance of P300.00 was paid at the house of Salen in San Mateo,
Rizal where they proceeded to immediately.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, Salen called her on the telephone and meeting at the
Tambunting Pawn Shop, Salen returned to her the wrist watch because it was of some
sentimental value to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Salen asked
her to accompany her to the Philippine Banking Corporation for the purpose of
opening a checking account.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failing
there, they proceeded to the Philippine National Bank where they succeeded with
the help of a friend, Cesar Untalan, but with the condition that it be a joint
account with her as Salen was not known to the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She acceded to the arrangement and a joint
checking account was opened with an initial deposit of P1,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The PNB checks (Exhs. 'D' &amp; 'H') were
signed by her only because it was a joint account with Elizabeth Salen.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the PBC Checks (Exhs. 'A',
'B', 'C', 'F', 'I' &amp; 'J'), she explained that they were borrowed by
Elizabeth Salen to pay the latter's purchases from Purita Comandante with the
assurance that Salen will make the corresponding deposit at their due
dates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With the help of the Metrocom the
pair of earrings valued at P35,000.00 was recovered and returned to Purita
Comandante (Exh. '5')."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The defense charges the
trial Court with having erred in convicting Appellant of the crime of Estafa
contending that the sale of jewelries was null and void since complainant
Purita Comandante was not the owner of those items and, therefore, Appellant
was under no obligation to pay, and committed no deceit in issuing the rubber
checks.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These checks, the defense adds,
were intended merely as "security or guaranty for the eventual sale of the
jewelries."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit in those arguments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The elements of the crime of Estafa committed <span style="">by means of bouncing checks defined under
Article 315, paragraph 2(d) of the Revised Penal Code, are the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) postdating or issuance of a check in
payment of an obligation contracted at the time the check was issued; (2) lack
or insufficiency of funds to cover the check; and (3) damage to the payee
thereof.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Ownership is not a necessary element of the crime <span style="">of Estafa.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As aptly pointed out by the Court of Appeals:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x In estafa, the person prejudiced or the immediate victim
of the fraud need not be the owner of the goods.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, article 315 of the Revised Penal Code

delivered those jewelries as the owner herself or on behalf of the true owner

<p class="BODY">There is no question that Appellant issued the postdated checks
to Complainant in payment for the jewelries handed to them on the same occasion
and not as mere guaranty or security for their return or eventual sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Appellant herself admitted in her
extrajudicial statement, Exhibit "N", the checks were given by them
to Purita Comandante <i>in payment</i> for the pieces of jewelry they received
from the latter.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Even in her direct testimony in Court, Appellant also declared that her checks
were used by Elizabeth Salen <i>to pay</i> for the pieces of jewelry.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no question either about the presence of deceit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Were it not for the issuance by Appellant of
checks, which she falsely pretended to be covered by sufficient funds,
Complainant would not have parted with the jewelry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Insufficiency of funds to cover the checks
was substantiated by the evidence which showed that some of the postdated
checks in question were dishonored by the drawee banks for having been
"drawn against insufficient fund" and others for "no arrange­ment".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Further, appellant's testimony showed that
with an initial deposit of only P1,000.00, she and Elizabeth Salen opened a
joint checking account with the Philippine National Bank in May 1977 and issued
<span style="">in the same month postdated checks
against said checking account amounting to P67,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony also disclosed that the highest
deposit she had in her per­sonal checking account at the Philippine Banking
Corpo­ration was only P2,000.00, yet, she issued against said checking account
postdated checks amounting to P55,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Lastly, the third essential element of this kind of Estafa, <i>i.e.,</i>
damage to the payee of the worthless checks, is also clearly present.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except for the jewelry recovered worth
P35,000.00, Complainant was damaged and prejudiced in the total amount of
P87,000.00 in the two cases.</p>
