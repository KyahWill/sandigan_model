to Discourage Destruction of Forests, Further Amending for this Purpose Section
2751 of the Revised Administrative Code" docketed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">as </span>Criminal Case No. 1183, was filed on 10 October 1970 before
the Municipal Court of Balungao, Pangasinan against private respondent
Bartolome Padilla y Domingo.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 29 November 1972, Judge Amando G. Lazaro of the Municipal
Trial Court rendered a decision finding respondent Padilla guilty as charged
and sentencing him to suffer imprisonment of seven (7) months and to pay a fine
of P1,200.00 as the value of the forest products destroyed by appellee, with
subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Padilla filed his notice of appeal, and in an order
dated 13 February 1973, the Municipal Trial Court ordered the case elevated to
the higher court.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">The appealed case, docketed as Criminal Case No. 148-R in the
Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch XIV, was tried <u>de</u> <u>novo</u>.  The Provincial Fiscal filed a new informa­tion,
dated 20 March 1973, which read:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the month of September 17 to 19, 1970 at
Sitio Catilaongan, Barrio Kita-kita, Municipality of Balungao, Province of
Pangasinan, Philippines, and within the jurisdic­tion of this Honorable Court,
the said accused, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously
enter, and make kaingin in an area of approximately 20.0 hectares, which is
within the Balungao forest reserve, Balungao, Pangasinan, and as a result
thereof 500 cubic meters of firewood growing therein were destroyed to the
damage and prejudice of the government in the amount of ONE THOUSAND THREE
HUNDRED FIFTY PESOS (P1,350.00), Philippine Currency.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Contrary to Section 2751 of the Revised Administrative Code (Act
No. 2711), as amended by Republic Act No. 3701."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Private respondent Padilla was arraigned
anew, and again pleaded not guilty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent Padilla then filed a motion to dismiss, dated 14 July
1974, claiming that upon inspection of the land involved by the Municipal
Treasurer of Balungao, Pangasinan for the 1964 tax declaration, it was found
that the land was not public land.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Respondent also argued that assuming the land to be public, the 12 June 1974
proclamation of the then President Ferdinand Marcos promised to recognize
private rights acquired in respect of alienable and disposable public lands.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Assistant Provincial Fiscal Juanito R. Morante filed an
opposition to the motion to dismiss, dated 8 August 1974, arguing that since
R.A. No. 3701 had not been repealed, that statute must be enforced.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 22 August 1974, public respondent Judge Narciso A. Aquino
issued an order dismissing the case on the ground <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">that </span>the proclamation cited by private respondent Padilla had
given him the opportunity to apply for a homestead patent, thus, rendering the
case against him moot and academic.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> The
respondent judge further ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court is inclined to sustain the theory of the accused
that the Court has lost jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case
inasmuch as in consonance with the spirit of the New Society to implement the
land reform program and/or giving land to the landless, and to resolve in favor
of the accused the benefit of the doubt, this case can no longer prosper under
the aforesaid circums­tances."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The People, through the Solicitor-General, then filed with this
Court a Petition for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Review.  In a </span>Resolution, dated 30 October
1974, the Petition was given due course.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent, however, failed to file his answer.  On 13 January 1975, the Court issued a
Resolution requiring petitioner to file its brief.  A copy of the petitioner's brief was sent to private respondent<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
who nonetheless failed to file his own brief.  The case was considered submitted for decision without private
respondent's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">brief.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Petitioner raises the following issues for resolution of the
Court:</p>

<blockquote>"1.     Whether or not the respondent court, which was possessed of
uncontroverted jurisdiction over the subject matter of this case, had
thereafter lost such jurisdiction by reason of the 'spirit and meaning of
various Presidential Decrees, Orders and Proclamations issued by his
Excellency, the President of the Philippines, in implementing the Land Reform
Program and/or giving land to the landless' that allegedly rendered this case
'moot and academic'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>  2.    Whether or not the dismissal of this case by
reason of the 'spirit and meaning of various Presidential Decrees, Orders and
Proclamations issued by his Excellency, the President of the Philippines, in
implementing the Land Reform Program and/or giving land to the landless' is an
act without or in excess of the respondent court's jurisdiction, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>with grave abuse of discretion,
amounting to lack of jurisdiction."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor-General argues that since Section 2751 of the
Revised Administrative Code as amended by R.A. No. 3701, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">made it </span>a criminal act to enter into
forest reserves without permission from the Director of Foresty, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">had not been repealed, it should have

Solicitor-General further argues that the so-called "proclamation"
was but a part of the independence day speech of then President Marcos and
cannot be considered in the same light as the martial law decrees recognized to
have legislative effect,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
hence, the same cannot be used as a basis for depriving the Court of First Instance
of its jurisdiction over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Deliberating on the instant Petition for Review on <i>Certiorari</i>,
the Court considers that petitioner has shown clear reversible error on the
part of Judge Narciso A. Aquino warranting reversal of the questioned decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier mentioned, respondent Padilla did not file his
brief.  To forestall any contention from
respondent Padilla that the People's appeal violated his right against double
jeopardy, it should be recalled that that protection is not available in cases
where the dismissal was effected at the instance of the accused.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can respondent Padilla raise any claim of denial of due
process.  The Court has constantly held
that what is repugnant to due process is an absolute lack of an opportu­nity to
be heard.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
In the present case, respondent was given all the opportunity to be heard but
he chose not to file any pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Article 7 of the Civil Code, a law may be repealed only by
a subsequent law.  Accordingly, in the
absence of a law repealing Section 2751 of the Revised Administrative Code,
quoted above, a judge has no choice save to apply and enforce Section 2751.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, Judge Aquino stated in his decision:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court considers that although the accused, in supporting
the ground of his motion to dismiss, may have no legal basis inasmuch as
Republic Act 3701 has not yet been repealed or abrogated and still enforceable,
yet the Court shall take into consideration the spirit and meaning of various
presidential decrees, orders and proclamation (sic) issued by His Excellency,
the President of the Philippines, in implementing the reform program and/or
giving land to the landless."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Thus, while Judge Aquino was obviously
aware of the applica­ble legal principle, he chose to disregard that principle <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>invoking "the spirit and
meaning" of various presidential decrees.  This constitutes a rejection of the principle of legality so fundamental
in criminal law that it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is </span>very
difficult to understand how a judge could reach such a conclusion.  No "spirit and meaning" that are
not given statutory form and content can be invoked as over-turning a prior
statute or as giving rise to new legal rights and duties.  The "proclamation" relied upon by
Judge Aquino was not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">a </span>law and
did not purport to be a law.  In fact,
that "proclamation" was merely an extraction from a speech of the
then President of the Philippines, a speech in which some proposed policies
concerning the disposition of public lands were announced.  No decree or legislative enactment exempting
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">"<u>kaingineros</u>" </span>from
liability for destruction of forest resources was promulgated after the
presidential speech.  As a matter of
fact, Presidential Decrees Nos. 389<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a> and
705,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
enacted subsequently to that Independence Day Speech of former President Marcos,
penalized the practice of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">kaingin</span></u>
in forest reserves.</p>

<p class="BODY">In his motion to dismiss in the court below, private respondent
Padilla asserted that he had an oral assurance of the Municipal Treasurer of
Balungao, Pangasinan, that the area here involved did not form part of public
land, possibly hoping to establish mistake of fact.  We need only to note that Padilla admitted in his motion that he
had started occupying the land here involved in 1962 but commenced paying real
estate taxes only two (2) years later.   In any case, any such claim is properly presented as a defense
during the trial of the case; such claim certainly cannot affect the
jurisdiction of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Court Resolved to GRANT DUE COURSE to the
Petition for Review and to REVERSE and SET ASIDE the Order of public respondent
Judge Narciso A. Aquino dated 22 August 1974.  The trial court is hereby ORDERED to resume proceedings in Criminal Case
No. 148-R of the then Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch 14, against
private respondent Bartolome D. Padilla.  Costs against private respondent.</p>
