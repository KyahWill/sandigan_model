				<H3>PHILIPPINE AIR LINES EMPLOYEES' ASSOCIATION (PALEA) AND
FORTUNATO F. BIANGCO, FOR HIMSELF AND IN HIS CAPACITY AS PRESIDENT OF PALEA, PETITIONERS,
VS. JUDGE FRANCISCO DE LA ROSA OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, BRANCH VII, PASAY CITY;

INC., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>FERNANDO, C.J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This special proceeding for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>
was given due course notwithstanding the questions raised being primarily
procedural in view of the allegations that the grant of a preliminary mandatory
injunction by then respondent Judge Francisco de la Rosa, now deceased,
amounted to a judicial interference with a labor dispute, the petitioners being
the Philippine Air Lines Employees' Association and <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
F. <span class="SpellE">Biangco</span>, then the incumbent President of such
labor organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The answer submitted
denied that the grant of such preliminary mandatory injunction could be
characterized as a grave abuse of discretion and denied further that it was a
result of a bias or prejudice against petitioner <span class="SpellE">Biangco</span>,
who, in the elections of officers in such labor organization, won over a <span class="SpellE">reelectionist</span> candidate. Thereafter, memoranda of both
sides were filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the reply
memorandum for private respondent Philippine Air Lines, Inc., after a recital
of the facts by its then counsel, the late Crispin D. <span class="SpellE">Baizas</span>,
there was a summary of the relevant facts justifying the issuance of the writ
of preliminary mandatory injunction and the absence of any taint of inflicting
damage or prejudice to any labor <span class="GramE">organization.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus: "1. Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span>
<span class="SpellE">Biangco</span> was elected PALEA president somewhere in
April, 1967.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He succeeded as president of the petitioner
PALEA, Vicente <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> who in turn succeeded Emilio
F. <span class="SpellE">Saño</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner PALEA under the
presidency of Vicente <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Balajadia</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> did not hold office at the premises in question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Vicente <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span>
removed their offices when this respondent advised them to vacate the
premises.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When petitioner <span class="SpellE">Fortunato</span> <span class="SpellE">Biangco</span> then assumed
the presidency, the offices of petitioner PALEA were not in the premises in
question.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the petitioners' offices were
transferred by Vicente <span class="SpellE">Balajadia</span> from the premises in
question, <span class="SpellE">Saño</span> remained, for which reason <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> proceedings were taken against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>5.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners filed an urgent motion for <span class="GramE">a
reconsideration</span> of the order of the court dated <st1:date year="1967" day="1" month="9">September 1, 1967</st1:date> and to stay the execution of the
alias writ of preliminary mandatory injunction which was heard by the
respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the said urgent motion was heard and
submitted for resolution, petitioners by way of a second thought filed the
instant petition on grounds not sanctioned by the Rules of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>7.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That petitioners have a remedy in the lower court but to use their own
words – 'it was improper for peti­tioners to intervene in the case at that
stage, for it was already on appeal from the inferior court and to do the same
would be to raise issues not raised on or in the inferior court – this matter
not allowed by the Rules of Court.' The petitioners, however, forgot that the
appeal to the Court of First Instance would involve a trial de novo of the
case."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is clear from the
petition itself that this action is intertwined with Civil Case No. 2742</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
against the aforesaid Emilio F. </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Saño</span></span><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">It was as an incident of such action that the assailed preliminary
mandatory injunction was issued.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What
the petition failed to state was that such a case was then on appeal before
respondent Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
defendant-appellant <span class="SpellE">Saño</span> filed a motion to dismiss
appeal which was granted not by the late respondent Judge but by the Judge then
presiding, Judge Enrique A. <span class="SpellE">Agana</span>, Sr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There </span><span style="">is, </span><span style="">therefore, ample
support for the view advanced by private respondent that no right of a labor
organization or of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Biangco</span> as the then
President was violated by the issuance of the preliminary mandatory
injunction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is equally far-fetched,
although a semblance of plausibility was sought to be imparted to the petition,
to impute to the late respondent Judge failure to manifest fidelity to the
protection that the Constitution accords to labor,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> as interpreted by a host of decisions of
this Tribunal notable for their unfailing sympathy with its objective.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

According to Article II, Section 9 of the Constitution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The State shall afford protection to
labor, promote full employment and equality in employ­ment, ensure equal work
opportunities regardless of sex, race, or creed, and regulate the relations
between workers and employers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State
shall assure the rights of workers to self-organi­zation, collective
bargaining, security of tenure, and just and humane conditions of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State may provide for compulsory
arbitration." Under the 1935 Constitution, Article XIV, Section 6, the
provision reads: "The State shall afford protection to labor, espe­cially
to working women and minors, and shall regulate the relations between landowner
and tenant, and between labor and capital in industry and in agriculture.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The State may provide for compulsory
arbitration."</p>
