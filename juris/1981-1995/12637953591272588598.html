the Solicitor General, thus:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> Petitioners, instead of cooperating with respondent PCGG
in its task of investigating and recovering ill-gotten wealth of the former President,
his immediate family, close relatives, associates or cronies, frustrated and
hampered the investigation or otherwise prevented the Commission from
accomplishing its task, by withholding documents covering substantial past
shipments, which hold the key to the question earlier posed:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where have all the dollars gone?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Have they gone a flying one by one to <st1:country-region><st1:place>Switzerland</st1:place></st1:country-region>?</blockquote>

letters of credit resulting in the lapse thereof; failed to remit payments due
for past shipments; obstructed the release of funds needed for operations of
the two garment firms, orchestrated acts to discredit the officer-in-charge of
the garment firms and respondent PCGG; and obstructed the smooth operations of
the garment firms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To state that all the
above acts of petitioners, in one way or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">another,
frustrated, hampered or otherwise </span>prevented respondent Commission from
accomplishing its task under Executive Order No. 1 is to state here a <span class="SpellE">consumate</span> understatement.</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The validity of the Hold-Orders issued

reasons" for doing so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>The grounds for the
issuance of the Hold-Orders have become stale.</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:45.0pt;text-indent:-23.4pt">(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The PCGG Order denying petitioners' Motion to
Lift the Hold Orders against them states that "there is need for their
presence in this country to resolve the issues (listed <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span>),
in order that operations of the corporations are not obstructed, production
will not be delayed and corporate funds may be released." The enumerated
issues read:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">unexplained</span> withholding of documents
covering substantial past shipments,</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">deliberate</span> delay in cashing letters of
credit resulting in the lapse thereof,</blockquote>

Officer-in-Charge of the garments firms and the Commission and to obstruct the
smooth operations of the garment firms x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> " (Paragraphing supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It strikes the Court,
however, that although the business malpractices attributed to petitioners may
have furnished sufficient basis for the issuance of the Hold-Orders against
them, subsequent developments have apparently rendered them no longer
controlling.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, as a result of the
sequestration, the PCGG has already appointed an Officer-in-Charge for the two
firms, with full authority to operate and manage the same (Annex "B",
Petitioner); it has taken over the "management and operations of the
sequestered corporations";</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> it has "initiated changes in the

accomplish the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"a.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Halted the losses in the operations of the two
corporations as declared by the <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> investors
during the last two years, by posting a modest profit thereby enabling the
corporations to pay the government some P697<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> in
taxes i.e. from American Inter-Fashion alone.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"b.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Discontinued the marketing agreement with <span class="SpellE">Ringo</span> Garments-<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> and
organized a Manila-based marketing and procurement office.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"c.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Firmed up new orders through the said local
marketing office enough to sustain the full production of the two companies up
to the end of the year at prices 30-50% higher than the orders previously
coursed by the minority <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span> investors through <span class="SpellE">Ringo</span> Garments, their own conduit company in <span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It would appear, therefore, that with the changes made and the
accomplishments achieved, operations of the sequestered firms are no longer
obstructed, production no longer delayed and funding is available.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, if petitioners have "obstructed the smooth
operations" of the sequestered garment firms and "discredited their
Officer-in-Charge"<span class="GramE">,</span> might it not be preferable
that they be out of the country to ensure the cessation of their acts allegedly
inimical to the operations of the sequestered garment firms?</p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left:40.5pt;text-indent:-18.9pt">(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Another reason given for the issuance of the
Hold-Orders is that petitioners had "frustrated and hampered the
investigation or otherwise prevented the Commission from accomplishing its
task".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court takes judicial
notice of the fact, however, that Civil Case No. 0002 entitled "Republic
of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
vs. Ferdinand E. Marcos, et <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">als</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span>" has been filed by the PCGG before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> on <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="7">16
 July 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To all appearances,
therefore, the <span class="SpellE">PCGG's</span> investigative task relative to
the sequestered garment firms and their involvement, if any, in ill-gotten
wealth or in any transactions connected therewith, has terminated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another reason, therefore, for petitioners'
continued presence in the country has been virtually eliminated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We likewise find that petitioners have been denied the rudiments
of fair play.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Rules and Regulations
of the PCGG specifically provide:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 5.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Who may <span class="GramE">contest<span style="text-decoration:none;text-underline:none">.</span></span></u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- The person against whom a writ of
sequestration or freeze or hold order is directed may request the lifting
thereof in writing, either personally or through counsel within five (5) days
from receipt of the writ or order, or in the case of a hold order, from date of
knowledge thereof."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SECTION 6.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE"><u>Procedure for review of

</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">x</span></span><span class="GramE"> "</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And yet, the PCGG has not given petitioners any opportunity to
contest the Hold-Orders issued against them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After their issuance, no hearing had been set; a request for the same
had been disregarded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners'
Motion to Lift the Hold-Orders was summarily denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The "issues" spelled out against
petitioners have remained unresolved over a period of nine (9) months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PCGG must thus be faulted for a disregard
of the requirements of "fairness and due process" expressly mandated
by Executive Order No. 14, reading:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the overriding considerations of national interest
and national survival require that the Presidential Commission on Good Government
achieve its vital task efficiently and effectively, <u>with due regard to the
requirements of fairness and due process</u> (5th Whereas clause).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">While such right is not absolute but must yield to the State's
inherent police power upon which the Hold-Orders were premised, no "good
reasons" have been advanced which could justify the continued enforcement
of the Hold-Orders.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners are foreign nationals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their 33% interest in the sequestered firms
is recognized by the PCGG itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no showing that those interests appear <u>prima facie</u> to be ill-gotten
wealth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No charges have been filed
against them before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They face no criminal indictment nor have
they been provisionally released on bail that their right to travel might be
restricted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although, as averred by respondents, the recognized rule is that,
in the performance of an official duty or act involving discretion, the
corresponding official can only be directed by <i>Mandamus</i> to act but not
to act one way or the other, "yet it is not accurate to say that the writ
will never issue to control his discretion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>There is an exception to the rule if the case is otherwise proper, as in
cases of gross abuse of discretion, manifest injustice, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In this case, for reasons already stated, we find that the PCGG
acted with gross abuse of discretion in maintaining the Hold-Orders against
petitioners for an indefinite length of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>By so doing it has arbitrarily excluded petitioners from the enjoyment
of a fundamental right - the right to freedom of movement - to which they are
entitled.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
