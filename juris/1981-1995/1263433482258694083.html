				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner issued Personal Accident Policy No. 05687 to Felix
Lim, Jr. with a face value of P200,000.00.  Two months later, he was dead with a bullet wound in his head.  As beneficiary, his wife Nerissa Lim sought
payment on the policy but her claim was rejected.  The petitioner agreed that there was no suicide.  It argued, however, that there was no
accident either.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pilar Nalagon, Lim's secretary, was the only eyewitness to his
death.  It happened on October 6, 1982,
at about 10 o'clock in the evening, after his mother's birthday party.  According to Nalagon, Lim was in a happy
mood (but not drunk) and was playing with his handgun, from which he had
previously removed the magazine.  As she
watched television, he stood in front of her and pointed the gun at her.  She pushed it aside and said it might be
loaded.  He assured her it was not and
then pointed it to his temple.  The next
moment there was an explosion and Lim slumped to the floor.  He was dead before he fell.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The widow sued the petitioner in the Regional Trial Court of
Zamboanga City and was sustained.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>  The petitioner was sentenced to pay her
P200,000.00, representing the face value of the policy, with interest at the
legal rate; P10,000.00 as moral damages; P5,000.00 as exemplary damages;
P5,000.00 as actual and compensatory damages; and P5,000.00 as attorney's fees,
plus the costs of the suit.  This
decision was affirmed on appeal, and the motion for reconsideration was denied.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The petitioner then came to this Court to fault the Court of Appeals for
approving the payment of the claim and the award of damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">The term “accident” has been defined as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The words “accident” and “accidental” have never acquired any
technical signification in law, and when used in an insurance contract are to
be construed and considered according to the ordinary understanding and common
usage and speech of people generally.  In substance, the courts are practically agreed that the words
“accident” and “accidental” mean that which happens by chance or fortuitously,
without intention or design, and which is unexpected, unusual, and
unforeseen.  The definition that has
usually been adopted by the courts is that an accident is an event that takes
place without one's foresight or expectation - an event that proceeds from an
unknown cause, or is an unusual effect of a known case, and therefore not
expected.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>An accident is an event which happens without any human agency or,
if happening through human agency, an event which, under the circumstances, is
unusual to and not expected by the person to whom it happens.  It has also been defined as an injury which
happens by reason of some violence or casualty to the insured without his
design, consent, or voluntary co-operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In light of these definitions, the Court is convinced that the
incident that resulted in Lim's death was indeed an accident.  The petitioner, invoking the case of De la
Cruz v. Capital Insurance,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a> says
that “there is no accident when a deliberate act is performed unless some
additional, unexpected, independent and unforeseen happening occurs which
produces or brings about their injury or death.” There was such a
happening.  This was the firing of the
gun, which was the additional unexpected and independent and unforeseen
occurrence that led to the insured person's death.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also cites one of the four exceptions provided for
in the insurance contract and contends that the private petitioner's claim is
barred by such provision.  It is there
stated:</p>

<blockquote>Exceptions - -</blockquote>

<blockquote>The company shall not be liable in respect of</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->Bodily injury</blockquote>

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">b.  consequent upon</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">i)  The insured person attempting to commit
suicide or willfully exposing himself to needless peril except in an attempt to
save human life.</p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, the parties agree that Lim did not commit
suicide.  Nevertheless, the petitioner
contends that the insured willfully exposed himself to needless peril and thus
removed himself from the coverage of the insurance policy.</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be noted at the outset that suicide and willful
exposure to needless peril are <u style="">in</u> <u style="">pari</u> <u style="">materia</u>
because they both signify a disregard for one's life.  The only difference is in degree, as suicide imports a positive
act of ending such life whereas the second act indicates a reckless risking of
it that is almost suicidal in intent.  To illustrate, a person who walks a tightrope one thousand meters above
the ground and without any safety device may not actually be intending to
commit suicide, but his act is nonetheless suicidal.  He would thus be considered as “willfully exposing himself to
needless peril” within the meaning of the exception in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner maintains that by the mere act of pointing the gun
to his temple, Lim had willfully exposed himself to needless peril and so came
under the exception.  The theory is that
a gun is <u style="">per</u> <u style="">se</u>
dangerous and should therefore be handled cautiously in every case.</p>

<p class="BODY">That posture is arguable.  But what is not is that as the secretary testified, Lim had removed the
magazine from the gun and believed it was no longer dangerous.  He expressly assured her that the gun was
not loaded.  It is submitted that Lim
did not willfully expose himself to needless peril when he pointed the gun to
his temple because the fact is that he thought it was not unsafe to do so.  The act was precisely intended to assure Nalagon
that the gun was indeed harmless.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contrary view is expressed by the petitioner thus:</p>

<blockquote>Accident insurance policies were never intended to reward the
insured for his tendency to show off or for his miscalculations.  They were intended to provide for
contingencies, Hence, when I miscalculate and jump from the Quezon Bridge into
the Pasig River in the belief that I can overcome the current.  I have wilfully exposed myself to peril and
must accept the consequences of my act.  If I drown I cannot go to the insurance company to ask them to compensate
me for my failure to swim as well as I thought I could.  The insured in the case at bar deliberately
put the gun to his head and pulled the trigger.  He wilfully exposed himself to peril.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court certainly agrees that a drowned man cannot go to the
insurance company to ask for compensation.  That might frighten the insurance people to death.  We also agree that under the circumstances
narrated, his beneficiary would not be able to collect on the insurance policy
for it is clear that when he braved the currents below, he <u>deliberately</u>
exposed himself to a <u>known</u> peril.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent maintains that Lim did not.  That is where she says the analogy
fails.  The petitioner's hypothetical
swimmer knew when he dived off the Quezon Bridge, that the currents below were
dangerous.  By contrast, Lim did not
know that the gun he put to his head was loaded.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim was unquestionably negligent and that negligence cost him his
own life.  But it should not prevent his
widow from recovering from the insurance policy he obtained precisely against
accident.  There is nothing in the
policy that relieves the insurer of the responsibility to pay the indemnity
agreed upon if the insured is shown to have contributed to his own
accident.  Indeed, most accidents are
caused by negligence.  There are only
four exceptions expressly made in the contract to relieve the insurer from
liability, and none of these exceptions is applicable in the case at bar.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">*</span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It bears noting that insurance contracts are as a rule supposed
to be interpreted liberally in favor of the assured.  There is no reason to deviate from this rule, especially in view
of the circumstances of this case as above analyzed.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second assigned error, however, the Court must rule in
favor of the petitioner.  The basic
issue raised in this case is, as the petitioner correctly observed, one of
first impression.  It is evident that
the petitioner was acting in good faith when it resisted the private
respondent's claim on the ground that the death of the insured was covered by
the exception.  The issue was indeed
debatable and was clearly not raised only for the purpose of evading a
legitimate obligation.  We hold
therefore that the award of moral and exemplary damages and of attorney's fees
is unjust and so must be disapproved.</p>

<blockquote>In order that a person may be made liable to the payment of moral
damages, the law requires that his act be wrongful.  The adverse result of an action does not <u style="">per</u> <u style="">se</u> make the act wrongful and
subject the act or to the payment of moral damages.  The law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to
litigate; such right is so precious that moral damages may not be charged on
those who may exercise it erroneously.  For these the law taxes costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<blockquote>The fact that the results of the trial were adverse to Barreto did
not alone make his act in bringing the action wrongful because in most cases
one party will lose; we would be imposing an unjust condition or limitation on
the right to litigate.  We hold that the
award of moral damages in the case at bar is not justified by the facts and
circumstances, as well as the law.</blockquote>

<blockquote>If a party wins, he cannot, as a rule, recover attorney's fees and
litigation expenses, since it is not the fact of winning alone that entitles
him to recover such damages of the exceptional circumstances enumerated in Art.
2208.  Otherwise, every time a defendant
wins, automatically the plaintiff must pay attorney's fees thereby putting a
premium on the right to litigate which should not be so.  For those expenses, the law deems the award
of costs as sufficient.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the challenged decision of the Court of Appeals
is AFFIRMED insofar as it holds the petitioner liable to the private respondent
in the sum of P200,000.00 representing the face value of the insurance contract,
with interest at the legal rate from the date of the filing of the complaint
until the full amount is paid, but MODIFIED with the deletion of all awards for
damages, including attorney's fees, except the costs of the suit.</p>
