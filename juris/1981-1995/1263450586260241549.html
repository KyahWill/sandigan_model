Labor Code regarding strikes "affecting the national interest"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
is assailed in this petition which partakes of the nature of a pro­hibition
proceeding filed by the Free Telephone Workers Union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As amended, the Article now reads:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"In labor disputes causing or likely to
cause strikes or lockouts adversely affecting the national interest, such as
may occur in but not limited to public utilities, companies engaged in the
generation or distribution of energy, banks, hospitals, and those <span style="">within export processing zones, </span>the
Minister of Labor and Employment may assume jurisdiction over the dispute and
decide it or certify the same to the Commission for compulsory arbitration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such assumption or certification shall have
the effect of automatically enjoining the intended or impending strike or lock­out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If one has already taken place at the time of
assumption or certification, all striking or locked out employees shall immediately
return to work and the employers shall immediately resume operations and
readmit all workers under the same terms and conditions prevail­ing before the
strike or lockout.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Minister may seek
the <span style="">assist­ance </span>of law
enforcement agencies to ensure compliance with this provision as well as with
such orders as he may issue to enforce the <span style="">same."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> It is the submission of petitioner labor

article 264 of the Labor Code delegating to the Honorable Minister of Labor and
</span>Employ­ment the power and discretion <span style="">to </span>assume jurisdiction and/or certify strikes for compulsory

There is likewise the assertion that such conferment of authority "may
also ran (sic) contrary to the assurance of the State to the workers' right to
self-organization and collective bargaining."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the crucial issue presented, the Court holds that petitioner
was not able <span style="">to </span>make out a case
of an undue delegation of legis­lative power.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There could be, however, an unconstitutional applica­tion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">For while the Constitution
allows compulsory arbitration, it must be stressed that the exercise of such
competence cannot ignore the basic fundamental principle and state policy that
the state should afford protection to labor.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
Whenever, therefore, it is resorted to in labor disputes causing or likely to
cause strikes or lockouts affect­ing national interest, the State still is
required to "assure the rights of workers to self-organization, collective
bargaining, security of tenure, and <span style="">just
</span>and humane conditions of work."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
At this stage of the litigation, however, in the absence of factual
determination by the Ministry of Labor and the National Labor Relations
Commission, this Court is not in a position to rule on whether or not there is
an unconstitutional application.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There
was not even a categorical assertion to that effect by petitioner's counsel
which was indicative of the care in his choice of words.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He only assumed that the conferment of such
authority may run counter to the right of the workers to self-organization and
collective bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition then
cannot <span style="">prosper.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The facts alleged in the petition relevant for the purpose of
determining whether or not there is an undue delegation of legis­lative power
do not sustain the claim of petitioner union.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On September 14, 1981, there was a notice of strike with the Ministry of
Labor for unfair labor practices stating the following grounds: "1)
Unilateral and arbitrary implementation of a Code of Conduct, a copy of which
is attached, to the detriment of the interest of our members; 2) illegal
terminations and suspensions of our officers and members as a result of the
implementation of said Code of Conduct; and 3) <span class="SpellE">Unconfirmation</span>
(sic) of call sick leaves and its automatic treatment as Absence Without
Official Leave of Absence (AWOL) with corresponding suspensions, in violation
of our Collective Bargaining Agreement."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="GramE">After which came, on September 15, 1981, the notification to
the Ministry that there was compliance with the two-thirds strike vote and
other formal requirements of the law and Implementing Rules.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Several conciliation meetings called by the Ministry followed, with petitioner
manifesting its willingness <span style="">to </span>have
a revised Code of Conduct that would be fair to all concerned but with a plea
that in the meanwhile the Code of Conduct being imposed be suspended - a position
that failed to meet the approval of private respondent.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Subsequently, respondent, on<span style=""> </span>September
25, 1981, certified the labor dispute to the National Labor Relations
Commission for compulsory arbitration and enjoined any strike at the private
respondent's establishment.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
The labor dispute <span style="">was </span>set for
hearing by respondent National Labor Relations Commission on September 28,
1981.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
There was in the main an admission of the above relevant facts <span style="">by</span> public respondents.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent, following the lead of
petitioner labor union, explained its side on the controversy regarding the
Code of Conduct, the provisions of which as alleged in the petition were quite
harsh, resulting in what it deemed indefinite preventive suspension -
apparently the principal cause of the labor dispute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At this stage, as mentioned, it would be
premature to discuss the merits, or lack of it, of such claim, the matter being
properly for the Ministry of Labor to determine.</p>

<p class="BODY">The very <span style="">next </span>day
after the filing of the petition, to be exact on September 29, 1981, this Court
issued the following reso­lution:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Considering the allegations contained, the issues raised and the
arguments adduced in the petition for <i>certiorari</i> with prayer for a
restraining order, the Court Resolved to (a) require the respondents to file an
[answer]<span style="">, </span>not a motion to
dismiss, on or before Wednesday, October 7, 1981; and (b) [Set] this case for
hearing on Thursday, October 8, 1981 at 11:00 o'clock in the morning."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
After the parties were duly heard, Solicitor General <span class="SpellE">Estelito</span>
P. Mendoza<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
appearing for the public respondents, the case was consi­dered <span style="">ripe </span>for decision.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">To repeat, while the unconstitutionality of the amendatory act
has not been demonstrated, there is no ruling on the question of
unconstitutional application, especially so as to any alleged infringement in
the exercise of the power of compulsory arbitration of the specific modes
provided in the Constitution to assure compliance with the consti­tutional
mandate to "afford protection to labor" being at this stage
premature.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">1</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The allegation that there is undue delegation
of legislative powers cannot stand the test of scrutiny.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power which he would deny the Minister of
Labor by virtue of such principle is for petitioner labor <span class="GramE">union</span>
within the competence of the President, who in its opinion can best determine
national interests, but only when <span style="">a </span>strike
is in progress.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
Such admission is qualified by the assumption that the President "can make
law," an assertion which need not be passed upon in this petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What possesses significance for the purpose
of this litigation is that it is the President who "shall have control of
the ministries."<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It may happen, therefore, that a single person may occupy a dual position of
Minister and Assemblyman.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the extent,
however, that what is involved is the execution or enforcement of legislation,
the Minister is an official of the executive branch of the government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The adoption of certain aspects of a par­liamentary
system in the amended Constitution does not alter its essentially presidential
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article VII on the presidency
starts with this provision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"The
President shall be the head of state and chief executive of the Republic of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Its last <span style="">section is an even more
emphatic affirmation that it is a presidential system that obtains in our
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"All powers vested in the President of
the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style=""> under the 1935 Constitution and the laws of

member of </span>the <span style="">Cabinet or the

in the implementation of the policy of the government, the legislation duly
enacted in pursuance thereof, and the decrees and orders of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the Prime Minister can thus be delegated
the performance of the administrative functions of the President, who can then
devote more time and energy in the fulfillment of his exacting role as the
national leader.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> As the only one whose constituency is
national it is the President who,</span> by<span style=""> virtue of his election by the entire electorate, has an indisputable
claim to speak for the country as a whole.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, it is </span>he who <span style="">is
explicitly granted the greater power of control of such ministries.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He continues to be the Executive, the
amplitude and scope of the functions entrusted </span>to him in the formulation
of policy and its execution leading to the apt observation by <span class="SpellE">Laski</span> that there is not one aspect of which that does not
affect the lives of all.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Prime
Minister can be of valuable assistance indeed to the President in the discharge
of his awesome responsibility, but it is the latter who is vested with powers,
aptly characterized by Justice Laurel in <span class="SpellE">Planas</span> v. Gil,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
as "broad and extraordinary [being] expected to govern with a firm and
steady hand without vexation or embarrassing interference and much less
dictation from any source."<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
It may be said that Justice Laurel was referring to his powers under the 1935
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It suffices to refer anew
to the last section of the article of the present Consti­tution on the
presidency to the effect that all powers vested in the President of the
Philippines under the 1935 Constitution remain with him It cannot be emphasized
too strongly that under the 1935 Constitution "The Executive power shall
be vested in the President of the Philippines."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A later decision, <span class="SpellE">Villena</span> v. Secretary of Interior,<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
is of greater relevance to this case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The opinion of Justice Laurel, again the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span>,
made clear that under the presidential system, "all executive and
administrative organizations are adjuncts of the Executive Department, the
heads of the various executive departments are assistants and agents of the
Chief Executive, and, except in cases where the Chief Executive is required by
the Constitution or the law to act in person or the exigencies of the situation
demand that he act personally, the multifarious executive and administrative
functions of the Chief Executive are performed by and through the executive
depart­ments, and the acts of the secretaries of such departments, performed
and promulgated in the regular course of business, are, unless dis­approved or
reprobated by the Chief Executive, presumptively the acts of the Chief
Executive."<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
At the time of the adoption of the present Constitution on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>, this Court had cited with
approval the above ruling of <span class="SpellE">Villena</span> in twelve cases.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
It is particularly noteworthy that the first decision promulgated under the
present Constitution reiterating the above doctrine is Philippine American
Management Co. v. Philippine American Management Employees Association.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
For the question therein involved, as in this case, is the statutory grant of
authority to the then Secretary of Labor, now Minister of Labor, by the Minimum
Wage Law to refer to the then existing Court of Industrial Relations for
arbitration the dispute that led to <span style="">a </span>strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is indisputable, according to the opinion,
that in the very petition, the Secretary of Labor on <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1972</st1:date>, pursuant to the Minimum Wage Law,
"endorsed the controversy on the precise question of whether or not
petitioner Philippine American Management Company was complying with its
mandatory terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What was done by him,
as a department head, in the regular course of business and conformably to a
statutory provision is, according to settled jurisprudence that dates back to
an authoritative pronouncement by Justice Laurel in 1939 in <span class="SpellE">Villena</span>
v. Secretary of the Interior, presumptively the act of the President, who is
the only dignitary who could, paraphrasing the language of the decision,
disapprove or reprobate it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What other
response could be legitimately expected from respondent Court then?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could not just simply fold its hands and
refuse to pass on the dispute."<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a>
The <span class="SpellE">Villena</span> doctrine was stressed even more in
denying a motion for reconsideration by a more extensive citation from the <span class="SpellE"><u>ponencia</u></span> of Justice Laurel:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"Without minimizing the importance of
the heads of the various departments, their personality is in reality but the
projection of that of the President.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, and as forcibly characterized by Chief Justice Taft of
the Supreme Court of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
'each head of a department is, and must be, the President's <u>alter</u> <u>ego</u>
in the matters of that department where the President is required by law to
exercise authority.' * * * Secretaries of departments, of course, exercise
certain powers under the law but the <span style="">law
</span>cannot impair or in any way affect the constitutional power of control
and direction of the President.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a
matter of executive policy, they may be granted departmental autonomy as to
certain matters but this is by mere concession of the executive, in the absence
of valid legislation in the particular field.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If the President, then, is the authority in the Executive Department, he
assumes the corresponding responsibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The head of a department is a man of his confidence; he controls and
directs his acts; he appoints him and can remove him at pleasure; he is the
executive, not any of his secretaries.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is therefore logical that he, the President, should be answerable for
the acts of adminis­tration of the entire Executive Department before his own
conscience no less than before that undefined power of public opinion which, in
the language of Daniel Webster, is the last repository of popular
government."<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
So it should be in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even on the assumption,
indulged in solely because of the claim earnestly and vigorously pressed by
counsel for petitioner, that the authority conferred to the Minister of Labor
partakes of a legis­lative character, still no case of an unlawful delegation
of such power may be discerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is
the teaching from <span class="SpellE">Edu</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ericta</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"What cannot be delegated is
the authority under the Constitution to make laws and to alter and repeal them;
the test is the completeness of the statute in all its term and provisions when
it leaves the hands of the legislature.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To determine whether or not there is an undue delegation of legislative
power, the inquiry must be directed to the scope and definiteness of the
measure enacted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The legislature does
not abdicate its functions when it describes what job must be done, who is to
do it, and what <span class="GramE">is the scope of his authority</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a complex economy, that may indeed be the
only way in which the legislative process can go forward.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A distinction has rightfully been made
between delegation of power to make the laws which necessarily involves <span class="GramE">a dis­cretion</span> as to what it shall be, which constitutionally
may not be done, and delegation of authority or discretion as to its execution
to be exercised under and in pursuance of the law, to which no valid objection
can be made.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution is thus
not to be regarded as denying the legislature the necessary resources of
flexibility and practicability.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid
the taint of unlawful delegation, there must be a standard, which implies at
the very least that the legislature itself determines matters of principle and
lays down fundamental policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
the charge of complete abdication may be hard to repel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A standard thus defines legislative policy,
marks its limits, maps out its boundaries and specifies the public agency to
apply it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It indicates the circumstances
under which the legislative command is to be <span class="GramE">effected</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the criterion by which legislative
purpose may be carried out.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
the executive or administrative office designated may in pursuance of the above
guidelines promulgate supple­mental rules and regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The standard may be either express or
implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">If the
former, the non-delegation objection is easily met.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The standard though does not have to be
spelled out specifically.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be implied
from the policy and purpose of the act considered as a whole. * * * This is to
adhere to the recognition given expression by Justice Laurel in a decision [<span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation v. Public Service Commission]
announced not-too-long after the Constitution came into force and effect that
the principle of non-delegation 'has been made to adapt itself to the
complexities of modern governments, giving rise to the adoption, within certain
limits, of the principle of "subordinate legislation" not only in the
United States and England but in practically all modern governments.' He
continued:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'According­ly, with the
growing complexity of modern life, the multiplication of the subjects of
governmental regulation, and the increased difficulty of administering the
laws, there is a constantly growing tendency toward the delegation of greater
powers by the legislature and toward the approval of the practice by the
courts.' Consistency with the c<span style="">onceptual
approach requires the reminder that what is delegated is authority
non-legislative in character, the completeness of the statute when it leaves
the hands of Congress being assumed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Our
later decisions speak to the same effect.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus from Justice <span class="SpellE">J.B.L</span>. Reyes in People v. <span class="SpellE">Exconde</span>:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'It is well
established in this jurisdiction that, while the making of laws is a
non-delegable activity that corresponds exclusively to Congress, nevertheless
the latter may constitutionally delegate authority to promulgate rules and
regulations to implement a given legislation and effectuate its policies, for
the reason that the legis­lature often finds it impracticable (if not
impossible) to anticipate and provide for the multifarious and complex
situations that may be met in carrying the law into effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that is required is that the regulation
should be germane to the objects and purposes of the law; that the regulation
be not in contradiction with it; but conform to the standards that the law
prescribes.'

<p class="BODY">4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strict rule on

case, the institution of a new mode of treating offenders, it may pose
difficulty for social and economic legislation needed by the times.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even prior to the above-cited <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Transportation decision, Justice Laurel himself
in an earlier decision, People v. Rosenthal in 1939, promulgated less than two
years after Vera, pointed out that such doctrine of non-delegation "has
been made to adopt itself to the complexities of modern governments, giving
rise to the adoption, within certain limits, of the principle of 'subordinate
legislation' not only in the United States and England but in practically all
modern govern­ments.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difficulty lies
in the fixing of the limit and extent of the authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While courts have undertaken to lay down
general principles, the safest is to decide each case according to its peculiar
environment, having in mind the wholesome legislative purpose intended to be
achieved."<a style="" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="GramE">After which, in came the even more explicit formulation in <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span> Trans­portation appearing in the quoted excerpt
from <span class="SpellE">Edu</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Ericta</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no question therefore that there is
a marked drift in the direction of a more liberal approach.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is partly in recognition of the
ever-increasing needs for the type of legislation allowing rule-making in
accordance with standards, explicit or implicit, discernible from a perusal of
the entire enactment that in Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing
Adminis­tration v. Confederation of Unions in Government Corporations and
Offices<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
the then Justice, now the retired Chief Justice and presently Speaker, <span class="SpellE">Makalintal</span> had occasion to refer to "the growing
complexities of society" as well as "the increasing social challenges
of the times."<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a>
It would be self-defeating in the extreme if the legislation intended to cope
with the grave social and economic problems of the present and fore­seeable
future would founder on the rock of an unduly restrictive and decidedly
unrealistic meaning to be affixed to the doctrine of non-delegation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately with the retention in the amended
Constitution of some features of the 1973 Constitution as originally adopted leading
to an appreciable measure of concord and harmony between the policy-making
branches of the government, executive and legislative, the objection on the
grounds of non-delegation would be even less persuasive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is worth repeating that the Prime Minister,
while the choice of the Presi­dent, must have the approval of the majority of
all members of the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
<span class="GramE">At least a majority of the cabinet members, the Ministers
being appointed by the President, if heads of ministries, shall come from its
regional representatives.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
So, also, while the Prime Minister and the Cabinet are responsible to the <span class="SpellE">Batasang</span> <span class="SpellE">Pambansa</span> for the program
of government, it must be one "approved by the Presi­dent."<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
While conceptually, there still <span class="GramE">exists</span> a distinction
between the enactment of legislation and its execution, between form­ulation
and implementation, the fundamental principle of separation of powers of which
non-delegation is a logical corollary becomes even more flexible and
malleable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even in the case of the
United States, with its adherence to the <span class="SpellE">Madisonian</span>
concept of separation of powers, President Kennedy could state that its
Constitution did not make "the Presidency and Congress rivals for power but
partners for progress [with the two branches] being trustees for the people,
custodians of their heritage."<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
With the closer relationship provided for <span style="">by
</span>the amended Constitution in our case, there is likely to be even more
prompti­tude and dispatch in framing the policies and thereafter unity and
vigor in their execution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A rigid
application of the non-delegation doctrine, therefore, would be an obstacle to
national efforts at development and progress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There is accordingly more receptivity to laws leaving to administrative
and executive agencies the adoption of such means as may be necessary to
effectuate a valid legislative purpose.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is worth noting that a highly-respected legal scholar, Professor
Jaffe, as early as 1947, could speak of delegation as the "dynamo of
modern govern­ment."<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
He then went on to state that "the occasions for delegating <span style="">power to administrative offices [could be]
compassed by a single generalization."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"Power should be delegated where there is agreement that a task must
be performed and it cannot be effectively performed by the legislature without
the assistance of a delegate or without an expenditure of time so great as to
lead to the neglect of equally important business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Delegation is most commonly indicated where the
relations to be regulated are highly technical or where their regulation
requires a course of continuous decision."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> His perceptive study could rightfully
conclude that even in a strictly presidential system like that of the United
States, the doctrine of non-delegation reflects the American "political
philosophy that insofar as possible issues be settled [by legislative bodies],
an essentially restrictive approach" may ignore "deep currents of
social force."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> In plainer terms, and as applied to the Philippines

legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">spectre</span>

free from the taint of unconstitutionality, must be exercised in accordance
with the constitutional mandate of protection to labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The arbiter then is called upon to take due
