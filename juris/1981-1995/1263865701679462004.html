				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">This is a petition for
review on <i>certiorari</i> seeking to set aside the decision of the Workmen’s
Compensation Commission which affirmed the order of the Department of Labor
dismissing the claim of petitioner for compensation benefits under the
Workmen’s Compensation Act, as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioner is a public
school teacher assigned at <span class="SpellE">Kabankalan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Negros</span> Occidental since 1962.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On </span><st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="4"><span style="">April 14, 1971</span></st1:date><span style="">, she filed a claim for disability
compensation benefit with the Regional Office of the Department of Labor for
rheumatoid arthritis which was allegedly caused by prolonged standing and other
physical stress arising from classroom duties.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In an order dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="11"><span style="">November
 20, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, the
regional office of the Department of Labor dismissed petitioner’s claim on the
ground that “only those illness (sic) which affect the earning power of the
employee and deprive him of his livelihood are compensable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, as long as an employee is
able to continue working and receives his pay, he is not entitled to
compensation.” <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 8).</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner’s <span class="GramE">claim</span>
for reimbursement of medical expenses, being ancillary to the compensation
claim, was also dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1975</st1:date>,
petitioner filed <span style="">a </span>motion for
reconsideration of the aforementioned Order but the same was denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the case was elevated to the
respondent Commission for review.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1976</st1:date>,
respondent Commission rendered a decision dismissing petitioner’s claim for
lack of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Hence,
the present action.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="6" month="12">December 6, 1989</st1:date>,
the Court’s Second Division referred the instant case to this Division (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 65).</p>

<p class="BODY">The sole issue in the case at bar is whether petitioner’s ailment
is compensable under the Workmen’s Compensation Act, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">We rule in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rheumatoid arthritis is <span style="">an </span>occupational
disease of public school teachers normally associated with the nature and
character of their occupation (<span class="SpellE">Meñez</span> v. Employees’
Compensation Commission (97 SCRA 87 <span style="">[1980];
<span class="SpellE">Dimaano</span> v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission, 78 </span>SCRA
510 [1977]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, it is not
disputed that petitioner’s illness supervened <span style="">as </span>a result <span class="GramE">of,</span> and <span class="SpellE">aggaravated</span>
by, the nature of her employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the <span style="">legal presumption of compensability
arises (Sec. 44, Workmen’s Compensation Act, as amended) and the burden of
proof shifts to the employer to show otherwise (<span class="SpellE">Cayaba</span>
v. Workmen’s Compensation Commission, 102 SCRA 346 [1981]; <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
v. Republic, 77 SCRA 292 [1977]; <span class="SpellE">Buyco</span> v. Secretary </span>of
Labor, 145 SCRA 361 [1986] and cases cited).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the case at bar, respondent Commission offered no evidence to
controvert the illness of petitioner as shown by the <span style="">physician’s report (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 16) save its
bare pronouncement that rheumatoid arthritis is not compensable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, in view of the
factual finding of respondent Commission that in all of petitioner’s sick
leaves, petitioner was paid in full of all her salaries during the period of
her leave of absence, compensation benefits would be <span class="SpellE">unavaling</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is so because:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>“Workmen’s compensation refers to liability for compensation for
loss resulting from injury, disability or death of the workingman through
industrial accident or disease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
based on incapacity or disability for work, and hence on the loss or impairment
of the employee’s earning capacity in the employment at which he was engaged when
injured, the compensation payments being in lieu of wages or based on the loss
thereof and on the idea of providing means of subsistence to the employees
during the time when his earning capacity has been partially or entirely
destroyed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, as long as
the employee is able to work and receives his pay even if he is suffering from
illness, he is not entitled to compensation (Central <span class="SpellE">Azucarera</span>
Don Pedro v. de Leon, 101 Phil. 1141 [1959]); <span class="SpellE">Lombo</span>
v. Standard Cigarette Manufacturing Co., 58 SCRA 750 [1974]).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, inasmuch as Section 13 of Workmen’s Compensation
Act, as amended, requires the employer to defray the medical and hospital
expenses for ailments compensable under the law, petitioner <span style="">is </span>therefore entitled to reimbursement
of expenses incurred in curing his injury.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>PREMISES CONSIDERED</b>, the decision under review is hereby
SET ASIDE and respondent Commission (now Employees’ Compensation Commission) is
hereby ordered to reimburse petitioner of her medical and hospital expenses
duly supported by receipts submitted during the hearing, with legal interest
thereon from April 14, 1971 until full payment thereof.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
