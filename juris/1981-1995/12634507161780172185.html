judge in the light of the facts herein narrated.</p>

<p class="BODY">Fructuoso, Constancia, Delfin, Rufina, Ceferino, Cipriano, Lucia
and Filomena all surnamed Aguilar are the petitioners herein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are the legitimate children of Tomas
Aguilar now deceased.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parents of
Tomas were Miguel and Isidra Aguilar who owned Lot No. 2345 of the Tanjay
[Negros Oriental] Cadastre.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Miguel and
Isidra sold a portion of Lot No. 2345 to the Central Azucarera de Bais.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the spouses and the Central
claimed their respective portions in Cadastral Case No. 12, G.L.R.O. Cad. Rec.
No. 311 of Negros Oriental and on April 26, 1927, the cadastral court
adjudicated the lot, in accordance with a division made by the Bureau of Lands
as early as September 17, 1924, as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Lots 2345-A, 2345-C and 2345-D to the Aguilars and Lot 2345-B to the Central.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Later the division was amended with the
approval of the cadastral court on <st1:date year="1929" day="24" month="1">January
 24, 1929</st1:date>, so that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2345-A became <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
5281, <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2345-B became <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5282,
<st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 2345-C became <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5283, and <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
2345-D became <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5284.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the decision of the cadastral court, Lots 5281, 5283
and 5284 were registered on <st1:date year="1929" day="21" month="5">May 21,
 1929</st1:date>, in the name of the Aguilar spouses and Original Certificate
of Title No. 8922 was issued to them.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When the spouses died, Tomas Aguilar as the only <span class="GramE">heir,</span>
became the owner of the said lots and he was issued T.C.T. No. 968 which
cancelled O.C.T. No. 8922, on <st1:date year="1932" day="9" month="12">December
 9, 1932</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when Tomas died
on <st1:date year="1978" day="10" month="3">March 10, 1978</st1:date>, he was
succeeded by his children who are the petitioners herein.</p>

<p class="BODY">This petition concerns <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5284 only.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a ''Motion to Amend Technical Description
of Lot No. 5284" dated May 3, 1974, which Maria G. Gimony filed in
Cadastral Case No. 12, LRC Record No. 311, she prayed that, "The technical
description of Lot 5284 of Tanjay Cadastre, covered new by Transfer Certificate
of Title No. T-968, be cancelled and/or amended to technical description for
Lot No. 2345-D, <span class="GramE">which is the true technical description for </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">Lot</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"> No. 5284 of Tanjay
Cadastre.</span>" Gimony claims that "Lot No. 2345-D became Lot No.
5284 and in the technical description thereto, the area is ONE THOUSAND
FORTY-THREE (1,043) square meters, per amendment plan, Psd-1595-Amd., approved
by the Director of Lands on <st1:date year="1933" day="27" month="1">January
 27, 1933</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How­ever, in the
old and unamended technical description of said Lot No. 5284, the area of which
is ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED NINETY (1,190) square meters more or less.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there is a difference of 147 square
meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This 147 square meters forms
part of the property of herein private respondent, under Certificate of Title
No. T-15107 of Tanjay Cadastre, Negros Oriental, of which respondent had been
in possession since then up to the present."</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the uncontroverted allegations of the peti­tioners:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"x x x.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>The aforesaid motion [to amend technical
description of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5284] was filed on <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1974</st1:date>, and a notice thereof of
its scheduled hearing was set on <st1:date year="1974" day="8" month="5">May 8,
 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For reason of lack of
notice and failure of respondent Tomas Aguilar to receive a copy of said
motion, the latter likewise failed to be present during the hearing thereof,
and taking advantage of the absence of her adversary movant, private respondent
in this case, presented her evidence ex-parte.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nevertheless, in order not to be construed as having waived his right to
have a day in court, said respondent Tomas Aguilar filed a 'MANIFESTATION'
(ANNEX "H") dated May 9, 1974, asking the lower court a period of 10
days to file his opposition thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
lower court acting on said manifestation issued an ORDER (ANNEX "I")
dated May 9, 1974, granting the request of respondent Tomas Aguilar but the
evidence already presented by private respondent had not been set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In com­pliance with said ORDER respondent
Tomas Aguilar filed an 'OPPOSITION TO AMEND TECHNICAL DES­CRIPTION OF <st1:place>LOT</st1:place>
5284' (ANNEX "J") dated <st1:date year="1974" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the issues
were joined an ORDER (ANNEX "K") dated <st1:date year="1974" day="29" month="5">May 29, 1974</st1:date>, was issued resetting the hearing of pending
incidents to <st1:date year="1974" day="19" month="6">June 19, 1974</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There­after, a subsequent ORDER (ANNEX
"L") dated <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="7">July 10, 1974</st1:date>,
was issued fixing the hearing of said motion to <st1:date year="1974" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1974</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before the hearing of said motion (ANNEX "A")
private respondent filed a 'SUPPLEMENTAL MOTION' (ANNEX "M") dated <st1:date year="1974" day="20" month="8">August 20, 1974</st1:date>, and another 'MOTION'
(ANNEX "N") dated <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="3">March 4,
 1975</st1:date>, praying for an appointment of a Commissioner preferably a
Geodetic Engineer to conduct a relocation survey of Lot No. 5284.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the later motion the lower
court, inspite of lack of notice to Tomas Aguilar, issued an ORDER (ANNEX
"O") dated March 12, 1975, appointing Geodetic Engineer Bonifacio
Catarata as Commissioner who, incidentally, happened to have previous
contractual relations with private respondent involving the relocations of her
other parcels of land.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was the very
surveyor whom private respondent hired to locate the existence of the alleged
amended technical description (ANNEX "P") of Lot No. 5284 as shown on
the bottom thereof marked as ANNEX "P-1", which she later used as
evidence in her 'MOTION TO AMEND TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF LOT 5284'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is definitely established in Transfer Certificate of Title
No. 968 of Lot No. 5284 that its original cer­tificate of title was issued on
the 21st day of May, 1929.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other
hand the alleged amended technical des­cription (ANNEX "P") of said
lot indicates that the amendment survey of the same was approved on <st1:date year="1933" day="27" month="1">January 27, 1933</st1:date>, about 4 years after
from the is­suance of said Original Certificate of Title No. 8922 covering the
lot aforementioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The existence of
said circumstances established that ANNEX "P" was obtained from a
spurious source because it is highly irregular procedure for an amendment
survey to be approved after title to the land had long been issued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Dissatisfied of the aforesaid ORDER (ANNEX "O") for
denying him of his day in court, having re­ceived no notice of the hearing
thereof and a copy of said motion, said respondent Tomas Aguilar filed a
'MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION' (ANNEX "Q") dated April 14, 1975, and
the same was denied in the ORDER (ANNEX "R") dated April 23,
1975.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a <span style="">consequence of said denial, respondent Tomas Aguilar filed a 'SECOND
MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION' (ANNEX "S") dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="25" month="6"><span style="">June 25,
 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then on </span><st1:date year="1975" day="21" month="7"><span style="">July 21, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">, an ORDER (ANNEX "T") was issued
giving 15 days to private respondent to file her opposition thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said order was complied with by the latter
when she filed an 'OPPOSITION TO RESPONDENT'S SECOND MOTION FOR
RECONSIDERATION' (ANNEX "U") dated </span><st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="8"><span style="">August 2, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, an ORDER (ANNEX "V") dated </span><st1:date year="1976" day="22" month="1"><span style="">January
 22, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, was issued
denying respondent Tomas Aguilar's 'SECOND MO­TION FOR RECONSIDERATION'.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"In order to implement the ORDER (ANNEX "O")
appointing Geodetic Engineer Bonifacio Catarata as Commissioner, private
respondent filed a 'MOTION FOR EXECUTION' (ANNEX "W") dated <st1:date year="1976" day="26" month="5">May 26, 1976</st1:date>, and the same was
granted in pursuant to an ORDER (ANNEX "X") dated <st1:date year="1976" day="23" month="9">September 23, 1976</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In com­pliance with said order the above
named Commissioner conducted a relocation survey of Lot No. 5284 and after
completion of his relocation work he submitted a 'COMMISSIONER'S REPORT' (ANNEX
"Y") dated December 16, 1976, for approval.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="1">January 4, 1977</st1:date>,
private respondent filed a 'MOTION FOR EXECUTION OF THE COMMISSIONER'S REPORT'
(ANNEX "Z").</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering, in his opinion, that the 'COMMIS­SIONER'S
REPORT' appears to be inconsistent with the facts established in the records of
the aforesaid cadastral proceedings, as well as, the existing con­ditions
obtaining on the parcel in controversy, res­pondent Tomas Aguilar filed his
'OPPOSITION TO COMMISSIONER'S REPORT (ANNEX "A-1") dated February 28,
1977, and a 'SUPPLEMENT TO OP­POSITION TO COMMISSIONER'S REPORT (ANNEX
"B-1") dated April 26, 1977, both were denied in an ORDER (ANNEX
"C-1") dated May 25, 1977, and approving the 'COMMISSIONER'S
REPORT'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Tomas Aguilar, as
his only and last remedy available under the ordinary course of law, to pro­tect
and save his property from being adjudicated to private respondent without fair
trial, filed a 'MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION' (ANNEX "D-1") dated June
30, 1977, to the ORDER (ANNEX "C-1") approving the 'COMMISSIONER'S
REPORT'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"However, during the pendency of the proceedings in connection
with private respondent's 'MOTION TO AMEND TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION OF LOT 5284',
respondent Tomas Aguilar died on March 10, 1978, and by reason of his death his
counsel in order to give notice to the lower court of such fact, filed a
'MANIFESTATION' (ANNEX "E-1") dated October 18, 1978.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon receipt of a copy of said manifesta<span style="">tion, private respondent filed a
'COUNTER-MANIFEST­ATION AND OPPOSITION' (ANNEX "F-1") dated </span><st1:date year="1978" day="29" month="12"><span style="">De­cember
 29, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a rejoinder thereto counsel for respondent
Tomas Aguilar filed a 'REPLY TO MOVANT'S COUNTER-MANIFESTATION AND OPPOSITION'
(ANNEX "G-1") dated </span><st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="2"><span style="">February 12, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Before the resolution of said incidents an ORDER (ANNEX
"H-1") dated December 22, 1980, was issued granting a writ of
execution to the 'COMMISSIONER'S REPORT'.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Another ORDER (ANNEX "I-1") dated March 17, 1981, directing
the Register of Deeds of Negros Oriental, to cancel Original Certificate of
Title No. 8922 or Transfer Certificate of Title No. 968 and issue a new transfer
certificate of title to Lot No. 5284, was issued in pursuant to a 'MOTION'
(ANNEX "J-1") filed by private respondent dated March 11, 1981, which
the petitioners as successors-in-interest of the late Tomas Aguilar had not
been furnished a copy thereof."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The pivotal question in this case is whether or not the technical
description of a registered parcel of land can be amended so as to reduce its
area by a mere motion in the original cadastral pro­ceedings long after the
decree of registration had been entered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be noted that <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5284 was originally
registered as early as <st1:date year="1929" day="21" month="5">May 21, 1929</st1:date>,
whereas the motion to amend was filed on <st1:date year="1974" day="6" month="5">May
 6, 1974</st1:date>, after the lapse of 45 years on the basis of an amendment
survey said to have been approved on <st1:date year="1933" day="27" month="1">January
 27, 1933</st1:date>, or about four years after the issuance of the OCT.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is to be noted also that a Court of First
Instance acting as a land registration court has but limited jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent does not indicate the statutory basis to
support the procedure she has adopted namely:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>a motion in the original cadastral proceedings, for the purpose of
amending the technical description of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 5284.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, she has disclaimed the use of Sec.
112 of Act No. 496 which allows, upon court order, an erasure, alteration, or
amendment to be made on the registra­tion book after the entry of the
certificate of title and it is well she does for said section specifically
denies to the court of land registration "authority to open the original
decree of registration."</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent states "that the Court of First Instance
acting as a cadastral court may correct the technical description in the
Certificate of Title if the boundaries of the land can be determined.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Domingo vs. Santos, 55 Phil. 361, 373-374 -
cited in the Philippines Torrens System by Ponce, 1964 Ed., at p. 206)."
We have read both the case and the book and neither supports the statement
aforequoted more specifically that a Court of First Instance acting as a
cadastral court has the power attributed to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>Domingo</u> was an <u>ordinary civil action</u> to recover a piece of
land which had been registered under Act No. 496.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And this is what <st1:city><st1:place><u>Ponce</u></st1:place></st1:city>
says in his cited book:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"If the
boundaries of the land can be determined, the technical description in the
certificate of title may be corrected without cancelling the decree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To nullify and cancel final decrees by reason
of faulty technical description would lead to chaos (Domingo vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
55 Phil. 361, 373-4)." <span class="GramE">(</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Ponce</span></st1:place></st1:city><span class="GramE">, <u>op</u>.
<u>cit</u>.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The jurisprudence in point is Cuyugan, et al. vs. Sy Quia, 24
Phil. 567 [1913] where this Court speaking through Justice Moreland said:</p>

<blockquote>"Moreover, contests arising over the location of division
lines are actions <u>in</u> <u>personam</u> and must be tried in the ordinary
courts of law and not in the Court of Land Registration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are actions involving the title to real
estate, damages for illegal detention, for the cutting of timber, or the taking
of crops.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes they are for
ejectment and sometimes for trespass.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After the land has been registered the Court of Land Registration ceases
to have juris­diction over it for any purpose and it returns to the
jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of law of the <st1:place>Islands</st1:place>
for all subsequent purposes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The only
authority remaining in the Court of Land Registra­tion after its decree becomes
final is that given to it by section 112 of Act No. 496.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That section does not convey authority to
conduct a proceeding like the present or to take cognizance in any way of
disputes subsequently arising between adjoining owners and owners of the land
registered."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is granted and all proceedings in
the court <u><span style="">a</span></u> <u>quo</u>
in connection with the Motion to Amend Technical Description of Lot 5284 are
hereby annulled and set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Costs against the private respondent.</span></p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Maria G. Gimony
(Maria Aguilar) is the owner of Lot No. 2360-A located at Barrio Novallas,
Tanjay, Negros Occidental with an area of 14,054 square meters as shown in TCT
No. T-15107.</p>

<p class="BODY">Near that lot is Lot 5284 (formerly Lot 2345-D) with an area of <u>1,190</u>
square meters as shown in TCT No. T-968.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is registered in the names of Fructuoso, Constancia, Delfin Rufina,
Ceferino, Cipriano, Lucia and Filomena, all surnamed Aguilar (the children of
the late Tomas Aguilar), as shown in TCT No. 968.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lot 5284 used to have an area of <u>1,043 square meters</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when a portion of the creek (Sapang
Nagsala) separating it from Lot 2360-A dried up, the dried up portion with an
area of <u>147 square meters</u> was claimed by Tomas Aguilar and so the area
of Lot 5284 was increased to <u>1,190</u> square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">Maria G. Gimony in her ''motion" dated May 3, 1974 filed in
the cadastral proceeding for Lot No. 5284 prayed that the technical description
of Lot 5284 be corrected so as to reflect its original area of <u>1,043 square
meters</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claimed to be entitled
to the 147 square meters as part of her Lot 2360-A.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that she had been in possession
of that portion and that Tomas Aguilar occupied the same, thus encroaching on
her lot.</p>

<p class="BODY">Tomas Aguilar opposed that petition on the ground that the lower
court, as a land registration court, has no jurisdic­tion to determine the
ownership of that contested portion of 147 square meters.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court designated a geodetic engineer, Bonifacio
Catarata, as commissioner to conduct a relocation survey of Lot 5284 so as to
ascertain its exact area and boundaries.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the sketch plan prepared by Catarata, it appears that the 147
square-meter portion in question is a part of Lot 2360-A so that there is an <u>overlapping</u>
between that lot and Lot 5284.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners objected to the report of Catarata.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Francisco H. Ledesma approved it in his
order of May 25, 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Eleuterio
E. Chiu in his order of December 22, 1980 granted Gimony's motion for execution
of the commissioner's report.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Chiu in his order of March 17, 1981 directed the register
of deeds to cancel TCT No. 968 and issue a new title containing the corrected
technical description of Lot 5284 with an area of 1,043 square meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That order was assailed in the petition for <i>certiorari</i>
filed by the petitioners in this Court on May 11, 1981.</p>

<p class="BODY">I concur in the opinion that the lower court had no juris­diction
to entertain Gimony' s "motion" to correct the technical description
of Lot 5284.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, all the proceedings
in the lower court should be set aside.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Gimony's remedy is an ordinary action to settle the ownership of the
disputed 147 square-meter portion.</p>
