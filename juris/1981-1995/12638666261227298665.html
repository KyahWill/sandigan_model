allegedly recovered from </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">accused-appellant
is serviceable [TSN, January 20, 1988, p. 64.] <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">A careful analysis of the
postmortem report </span>will show that the gunshot wound sustained by the
deceased <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Dominador</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE">Manongdo</span> is indeed
</span>compatible <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with what could be
inflicted by a shotgun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, such a
finding assumes no significance in connection with a finding of the guilt of
accused-appellant unless the firing of the shotgun could </span>positively be
linked to him.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Neither is the ballistics
report any support to the conclusion that accused-appellant is guilty of the
commission of the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All that the
NBI ballistics report establishes is that the shotgun which was submitted to it
for examination is still serviceable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although this could have been done facilely by the crime laboratory,
there was no finding as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">whether or not the shotgun has just been
recently fired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore, instead of
bolstering the case for the prosecution, </span>it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">instead raises the doubt that the tested shotgun may not have been the
same shotgun which was used to shoot at and kill the deceased <span class="SpellE">Manongdo</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The only other evidence left with which to establish <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the guilt of accused-appellant is the positive
result obtained </span>from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
paraffin casts taken from his hands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
this was supported by other evidence before the Court, then the presence of
gunpowder nitrates on the hands of accused-appellant could have been a strong
indication that it was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">who fired the gun which killed the
deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this does not obtain
in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise of note is
the plausible reason <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> by the
accused-appellant that he tested positive for gunpowder burns because he took a
turn at firing at coconut fruits with an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> of
a military man who was </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">likewise </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a guest at a party given by his <span class="SpellE">kumpare</span> [TSN, April 6, 1988, p. 7.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>
