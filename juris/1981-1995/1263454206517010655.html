to the prosecution, between ten and eleven o'clock in the evening of April 27,
1972, while <span class="SpellE">Arnulfo</span> Benitez, 25, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagdanganan</span>, Jessie <span class="SpellE">Escaño</span>,
Roger Rosario and others were conversing in front of the <span class="SpellE">Virgen</span>
<span class="SpellE">Milagrosa</span> Hospital, <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span>
Street, San Carlos City, <span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span>, a red jeep
driven by Marvin <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>, 22, who was accompanied by
his brother <span class="SpellE">Justo</span> (Tito), 14, and by Feliciano <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> (Tony), 24, stopped near the group.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The three were members of the security squad
of City Mayor <span class="SpellE">Cayabyab</span>. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The headlights of the jeep were still on after
it had stopped.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Millora</span> brothers, grandnephews of
the city mayor (189 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>) and Tony alighted from the
jeep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marvin was armed with a .45
caliber pistol, Tito with an <span class="SpellE">armalite</span> and Tony with a
carbine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Benitez, an
engineering student, who had a misunderstanding with Marvin, sensed immediately
that the trio were going to liquidate him.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Impelled by the instinct of self-preservation, he ran and sought
refuge inside the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Tito and
Tony pursued him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marvin remained on the
street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The companions of Benitez
dispersed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Benitez did not stay long in the hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Feeling trapped inside the hospital and
having probably noted that Tito and Tony had followed him there, Benitez (whose
residence was on the other side of the street across the hospital), emerged
from his hiding place and returned to <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>, where Marvin,
as in an ambuscade, intercepted him by shooting him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Benitez fell, then stood up and walked towards the gate of <span class="SpellE">Pagdanganan's</span> residence a few meters away but Tony and
Tito, who were following him, shot him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He dropped to the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Tito
got the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">balisong</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> </span>knife of Tony and stabbed Benitez
(No. 18, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).</p>

<p class="BODY">The three assailants loaded Benitez in the jeep which proceeded
in the direction of <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The next day the corpse of Benitez was found
on a <span class="SpellE">ricefield</span> in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Duyong</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Calasiao</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pangasinan</span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span>
<span class="GramE">E to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">G and 1 and 2.)</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> The motive for the killing was revenge:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Benitez on a prior occasion had struck Marvin
on the head (Nos. 16 and 24, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The autopsy disclosed that Benitez had an entrance gunshot wound
on his left forehead and an exit gunshot wound on the right part of his
forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His brain was out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He had also an entrance gunshot wound near
the sternum (<span class="SpellE">parasternal</span> region) and an exit gunshot
wound in the thoracic region, a stab wound in the chest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">and multiple incised wounds on the cheek and neck (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
D).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Understandably, the city
police did not file any charge against the three malefactors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The case was investigated by the
Constabulary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>About four months after
the killing, Tony <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> was arrested.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He executed a confession (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
A) <span class="GramE">wherein</span> he implicated the <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>
brothers, the sons of lawyer Manuel B. <span class="SpellE">Millora</span> and <span class="SpellE">Encarnacion</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayabyab</span>, the city
mayor's niece (189 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The city fiscal in an information dated <st1:date year="1973" day="26" month="2">February 26, 1973</st1:date> charged <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
and the <span class="SpellE">Millora</span> brothers with murder aggravated by
treachery, abuse of superiority and evident premeditation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the trial, the <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>
brothers pleaded the alibi that they were in their residence at <st1:address><st1:street><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> Boulevard</st1:street>, <st1:city>San Carlos</st1:city></st1:address>
City at the time the shooting occurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That place is about one and a half kilometers from the scene of the
crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Marvin was allegedly playing
mahjong while Tito was collecting the tong and serving food to the players.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Tony <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
testified that at the time the killing was perpetrated he was in the residence
of his cousin, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Caloocan</span></span></st1:placename><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span><st1:placetype><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court rejected the alibis of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It convicted Marvin and Tony of murder
qualified by treachery and sentenced them to "life imprisonment" and
to pay <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> to the heirs of Benitez an
indemnity of twelve thousand pesos (Criminal Case No. 0180, Circuit Criminal
Court at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Tito <span class="SpellE">Millora</span> (born on <st1:date year="1958" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1958</st1:date>) was only fourteen
years, one month and twenty-nine days old when the crime was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court found that he acted with
discernment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It suspended his sentence
and ordered his commitment to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Vicente</st1:placename>

<p class="BODY">Tony <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> did not appeal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>
brothers appealed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their father, as
counsel, contends that the trial court erred in holding that his sons were
positively identified by prosecution eyewitnesses, <span class="SpellE">Isabelo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagdanganan</span>, Felipe <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>
and Manuel <span class="SpellE">Magali</span>, a councilor, notwithstanding their
contradictory testimonies, and in not acquitting the accused on the ground that
their guilt was not proven beyond reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">his brief meticulously </span>refuted the arguments
of the appellants <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">in </span>support of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">their contentions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants assail the credibility of the said prosecution
eyewitnesses because they did not report immediately to the authorities what
they allegedly knew about the killing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Canilang</span> and <span class="SpellE">Pagdanganan</span> executed
their affidavits on October 27 and <st1:date year="1972" day="13" month="12">December
 13, 1972</st1:date> before Constabulary Sergeants M. <span class="SpellE">Galsim</span>
and Romeo B. <span class="SpellE">Colet</span>, respectively (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
1 and 2).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They testified that their
statements were delayed because they were afraid of Marvin <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>
and his gang.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find that the delay was satisfactorily explained and that it
did not destroy the probative value of their testimonies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact is that the policemen did not bother
to make any thorough investigation of the case most pro­bably because they were
also afraid of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Constabulary officers stationed at <span class="SpellE">Lingayen</span> had to
undertake the investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' counsel mentions certain contradictions in <span class="SpellE">Canilang's</span> testimony and some discrepancies in the
testimony of <span class="SpellE">Pagdanganan</span> when correlated with the tes­timony
of the chief of police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although there
may be inconsistencies in the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Canilang</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Pag­danganan</span> on some details, it is,
nevertheless, undeniable that their testimonies consistently identify the
appellants and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> as the killers of Benitez.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is the main point <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and on that point their testimonies jibe and
are compa­tible and harmonious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their
affidavits are clear, convincing and credible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants impugn the testimony of Councilor <span class="SpellE">Magali</span>,
who had allegedly been convicted of <span class="SpellE">estafa</span> and who,
as a neighbor of Benitez, had taken an unusual interest in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magali</span> testified
that shortly before the killing he met the <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>
brothers and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span> at the police out­post about fifty
meters away from the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That testimony is not a prevarication.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' last contention is that their alibis generate
reasonable doubt as to their guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Considering that the two prosecution eyewitnesses indubitably identified
the <span class="SpellE">Millora</span> brothers and <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>
as the killers of Benitez, the unavoidable conclusion is that their alibis
appear to be brazen concoctions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court did not err in holding that the crime committed
is murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is qualified by abuse of
superiority and not by treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Abuse
of superior strength absorbs <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The use of a motor vehicle is not aggravating
in this case even if a jeep was used in con­cealing the victim's corpse.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The jeep was not used as a means for the
commission of the assassination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Evident
premeditation is not aggravating.</p>

<p class="BODY">The penalty imposable on Marvin <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>
is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, or the medium
period of the penalty for murder.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> As to
Tito <span class="SpellE">Millora</span>, inasmuch as he is now more than
twenty-four years old or no longer below sixteen years of age, he is not
entitled to a suspended sentence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Celes­para</span>,
82 Phil. 399; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Lingcuan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mauti</span>, 93 Phil. 9; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Doria</span>,
L-26188, Jan­uary 31, 1974, 55 SCRA 435).</p>

<p class="BODY">Tito is entitled to the privileged mitigating circumstance of
minority or to a two-degree reduction of the penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The maximum term of his penalty should be
taken from <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span>
maximum to <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <u>mayor</u> medium.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">WHEREFORE,</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the trial court's judgment is affirmed as to
Marvin <span class="SpellE">Millora</span> with the slight modification that
instead of "life imprisonment", the penalty imposed on him should be
designated as <u>reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That is </span>the penalty which carries with
it the corresponding accessory penalties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The commitment of Tito <span class="SpellE">Millora</span> to a
correctional institution is set aside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is sentenced to an indeter­minate penalty of six months of <span class="SpellE"><u>arresto</u></span> <u>mayor</u> as minimum to four years, two
months and one day of <span class="SpellE"><u>prision</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>correccional</u></span> as maximum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He is <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span>
