which respectively dismissed said case on the ground of pendency of another
action, Civil Case No. Q-10313, entitled Heroico M. Aguiluz, et al. vs. Lourdes
G. Suntay, and denied the motion for its reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are not disputed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants failed to pay the <s>P</s>40,000.00 on due date, 6
August 1966.  Plaintiff demanded payment
and threatened to foreclose the mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 August 1966, defendants filed a complaint against herein
plaintiff for specific performance with preliminary mandatory and prohibitory
injunction with the then Court of First Instance of Rizal, which was docketed
as Civil Case No. Q-10313.  They allege
therein that upon the execution of the contract, the parties agreed that herein
plaintiff would simultaneously deliver to the defendants the certificate of
title and the tax declaration of the lot, the latest realty tax receipt, lot
plan and vicinity map and building permit for the existing building; the
defendants repeatedly made it known to the plaintiff that in order to fully pay
the balance of the purchase price, the former needed to obtain a loan from the
Social Security System (SSS) or any other lending institution, thus
necessitating the transfer of the property in their names; for no justifiable
reason and despite repeated demands, plaintiff refused to turn over to them the
above documents, resulting in the delay in the filing of an application for a
housing loan with the SSS; even if the application had been processed, however,
the proceeds of the loan cannot be released until the certificate of title is
surrendered to them and a new certificate of title is issued to them; plaintiff
has threatened to foreclose the mortgage, immediately take possession of the
property as receiver and enforce the penalty clause of the contract, which
would cause them irreparable injury; if the foreclosure and/or receivership
proceedings are initiated by herein plaintiff, their loan application would be
disapproved by the SSS; and that it is essential that the court fix a
reasonable period, to commence on the date the certificate of title is
delivered to them within which they may comply with their obligation to pay the
unpaid balance of <s>P</s>40,000.00 of the purchase price.  They pray that:  (a) a writ of preliminary mandatory and prohibitory injunction be
issued ordering the plaintiff to surrender the certificate of title and
enjoining her or her representative from <i>inter alia,</i> proceeding with the
threatened foreclosure of the mortgage, respectively; and (b) after trial,
judgment be rendered making the injunction permanent, fixing a reasonable
period, from the date of delivery of the certificate of title, within which
they may comply with their above obligation and awarding to them attorney's
fees, exemplary damages and costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the day the above complaint was filed, the court<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
issued an Order setting the hearing for the application for injunction on 20
August 1966, and directing the parties to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in the
meantime.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 18 August 1966, before being served with summons, a copy of
the complaint in Civil Case No. Q-10313 and a copy of the above Order, herein
plaintiff filed with the same court a complaint for recovery of the unpaid
balance of the purchase price, the penalty provided for in the contract and
foreclosure of the mortgage.  The
complaint was docketed as Civil Case No. Q-10343 and was raffled to another
branch of the court.  In said complaint,
plaintiff prays for:  (a) judgment
ordering the defendants to pay her the amount of <s>P</s>50,000.00 (<s>P</s>40,000.00
representing the unpaid balance and <s>P</s>10,000.00 representing the
liquidated damages) with legal interest from the date of the filing of the complaint
until the same is fully paid and a sum equivalent to 25% thereof as attorney's
fees, plus certain sums as attorney's fees for the preparation of the document,
documentary stamps and registration fees, and decreeing the foreclosure of the
mortgage and sale of the property in a public auction; and (b) an Order
appointing her, during the pendency of the action, as receiver of the property.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff subsequently received the summons and a copy of the
complaint in Civil Case No. Q-10313 on 20 August 1966.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 2 September 1966, defendants filed a motion to dismiss
plaintiff's Civil Case No. Q-10343 on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  That there is another action pending between
the same parties for the same cause;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the complaint states no cause of action."<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The other action referred to is Civil Case No. Q-10313. </p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 September 1966, defendants filed a Supplemental Complaint.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 September 1966, plaintiff filed an Opposition to the motion
to dismiss<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
alleging therein that the two (2) complaints are not for the same cause of
action.  While Civil Case No. Q-10313
prays for:  (a) the issuance of a
mandatory and prohibitory injunction to compel her to deliver the certificate
of title and to prevent her from foreclosing the mortgage, and (b) the fixing of
a period within which herein defendants will pay the balance of the purchase
price of the property, Civil Case No. Q-10343 is an action for foreclosure of
mortgage.  She further alleges that her
complaint states a valid cause of action as defendants failed to pay the
balance of the purchase price on due date.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 7 January 1967, the trial court issued an Order dismissing
Civil Case No. Q-10343 on the ground of pendency of another action "between
the same parties for specific performance of the very contract subject of this
suit for foreclosure and it appearing that the issue raised in this present
action can well and should be litigated in the suit for specific
performance."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

plaintiff filed her notice of appeal on 21 October 1967,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>

filed a record on appeal which was approved on 12 March 1968.</p>

<p class="BODY">In her Brief, plaintiff makes the following assignment of errors:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">"I</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in holding that there is pending an action
between the same parties for specific performance of the very contract subject
of this suit for foreclosure, and it appearing further that the issues raised
in this present action can well and should be litigated in the suit for
specific performance.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>The lower court erred in dismissing the complaint."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Defendants did not file their Appellee's Brief despite three (3)
extensions of time granted by this Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, this Court considered this case submitted for decision without the
Appellee's Brief.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">As could be gathered from the body of the complaint, Civil Case
No. Q-10313 is an action for injunction filed in anticipation of the
foreclosure of the mortgage which plaintiff had threatened to pursue if
defendants failed to pay the unpaid balance of <s>P</s>40,000.00 on due
date.  The contract explicitly provides
that said balance shall be paid "on or before August 6, 1966 without need
of any demand." Defendants' self-serving characterization thereof as an
action for "specific performance" is calculated to obfuscate the
issues and mislead the trial court.  As
this Court sees it, defendants herein merely tried to beat the plaintiff to the
draw<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and pre-empt the latter's legal moves.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other causes of action in Civil Case No. Q-10313 are but mere
embellishments to give a semblance of viability to the alleged grievance of
herein defendants.  The contract fails
to indicate that (a) it was the intention of the parties to consider the
delivery of the certificate of title and the other documents mentioned therein
as a condition precedent before the balance of <s>P</s>40,000.00 would be paid
or (b) such delivery constitutes a suspensive condition the non-fulfillment of
which prevents the obligation of defendants to pay said balance from arising.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
On the contrary, as earlier alluded to defendants unqualifiedly bound
themselves to pay the balance on or before 6 August 1966 <u>without</u> <u>need</u>
<u>of any</u> <u>demand</u>.  Besides,
since under the contract the property was mortgaged to the plaintiff as
security for the payment of the unpaid balance of <s>P</s>40,000.00, plaintiff,
as mortgagee was entitled to possession of the certificate of title.  The filing then of Civil Case No. Q-10313
was a clever ruse to avoid compliance with defendants' obligation.  Even if it were not so, <i><u>lis</u></i> <i><u>pendens</u></i>
does not apply in this case.  The
requisites of <i><u style="">lis</u> <u style="">pendens</u></i> as a ground for dismissal of a complaint are:  (1) there must be the same parties or at
least such as to represent the same interest; (2) there must be the same rights
asserted and the same relief prayed for, which relief must be founded on the
same facts and the title or essential basis of the relief sought must be the same;
(3) the identity in these particulars should be such that if the pending case
had already been disposed of, it would be pleaded in bar as a former
adjudication of the same matter between the same parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While concededly, the first requisite obtains in this case, the
last two are conspicuously absent.  As
earlier discussed, Civil Case No. Q-10313, although cleverly denominated as one
for specific performance with mandatory and prohibitory injunction, is in
reality principally one for injunction to prevent the foreclosure of the
mortgage and to fix a new period to pay the remaining unpaid balance of <s>P</s>40,000.00
which was to be paid on or before 6 August 1966 without any need for a
demand.  Upon the other hand, Civil Case
No. Q-10343 is a suit for specific performance which asks for the payment of
the balance and the liquidated damages and foreclosure of the mortgage.  The causes of action and the reliefs sought
are entirely different.  A decision in
the first will not amount to <i>res judicata</i> against the second case for
whether or not defendants prevail in the former, petitioner's right to the
unpaid balance and the foreclosure of the mortgage would still be litigable.</p>

<p class="BODY">To the mind of this Court, if any case should be dismissed at
all, it should be Civil Case No. Q-10313.  That this case was filed ahead of the other is of no moment for as this
Court held in <i>Teodoro vs. Mirasol</i>:<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"It is to be noted that the Rules do not require as a ground
for dismissal of a complaint that there is a <u>prior</u> pending action.  They provide that there is a pending action
not a pending <u>prior</u> action.  The
fact that the unlawful detainer suit was of a later date is no bar to the
dismissal of the present action."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff then had all the right to file the motion to dismiss
Civil Case No. Q-10313.  Unfortunately,
however, while she actually filed such a motion, she failed to invoke <i>lis
pendens</i>; she merely raised:  (a)
unenforceability of the demands under the statute of frauds and (b) lack of
cause of action<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
as grounds for the motion.   Thus, the
same was denied by the trial court on 7 December 1966.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, committed an error in dismissing
Civil Case No. Q-10343.  What it should
have done was to order its consolidation, for joint hearing and trial, with
Civil Case No. Q-10313 pursuant to Section 1, Rule 31 of the Rules of
Court.  As ruled by this Court in <i>Ramos
vs. Ebarle</i>:<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
</p>

<blockquote>"x x x And, whatever difficulties or inconvenience may be
entailed if both causes of action are pursued on separate remedies, the proper
solution is not the dismissal order of the trial court.  The possible consolidation of said cases as
well as stipulations and appropriate modes of discovery, may well be considered
by the court below to subserve not only procedural expedience but more
important, the ends of justice."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, judgment is hereby rendered REVERSING and
SETTING ASIDE the challenged Orders of 7 January 1967 and 26 September 1967 in
Civil Case No. Q-10343; REINSTATING said case; and ORDERING that it be jointly heard
