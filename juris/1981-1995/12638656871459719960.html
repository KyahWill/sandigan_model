Metro Manila, finding the accused Rolando Garcia guilty of the crime of Rape
and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>Reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Perpetua</u></span>, to indemnify Cecilia Padua and her parents

<p class="BODY">Accused Rolando Garcia is charged by <span class="SpellE">Rossana</span>
Padua with having committed the crime of rape on her eight-month old daughter,
Cecilia Padua, on <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1984</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cecilia Padua was born on <st1:date year="1983" day="18" month="6">June 18, 1983</st1:date>, as evidenced by her

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution shows that at about 8:00 in the
morning of February 21, 1984, <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Padua
entrusted his 8-month old daughter, Cecilia, to the care of his grandmother, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span>, at 56 Rivera St.,
<span class="SpellE">Tanong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, because he
had to go to work at <span class="SpellE">Navotas</span> and his wife, <span class="SpellE">Rossana</span>, was busy washing clothes at their residence at <span class="SpellE">Disierto</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tanong</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The<span style=""> </span>companion of <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mangali</span> in the house at the time was the accused, who
was then jobless and living in the said house, together with his wife, Venus
Padua, a sister of <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Padua and a
granddaughter of <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span> took care of Cecilia Padua, but later in the day,
she left the child with the accused because she had to go to <span class="SpellE">Maysilo</span>, <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span>, with
instruction to the accused to bring the child home when <span style="">she </span>wakes up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The child
was then sleeping in a hammock on the ground floor.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Padua had
returned to the house of <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span>
at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the
afternoon to pick up his daughter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span> was not at
home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span>
Padua saw the accused sleeping outside his (accused) bedroom while his daughter
was crying inside said bedroom.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
noticed blood at the buttocks of his daughter, wiped it with a wet cloth, and
took the child home.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon seeing her
daughter, <span class="SpellE">Rossana</span> Padua noticed that there were burns
on the face and left leg of Cecilia and found blood on her rectum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Padua
surmised that Cecilia might have fallen from the cradle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, however, they noticed blood
flowing from the vagina of Cecilia.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
brought her to Dr. Albert Reyes, who advised them to bring the child to a
hospital.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They brought Cecilia to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Malabon</span></st1:placename> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Puericulture</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where she was examined by a nurse, who found bruises on the private <span style="">organ </span>of Cecilia, and advised them to
report the matter to the police.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After
reporting the matter to the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Station, <span class="SpellE">Rossana</span> Padua accompanied three policemen to the residence
of the accused and found the latter drinking with some companions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The policemen arrested the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cecilia Padua was brought by her parents to
the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> General</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place> for examination but the
hospital refused to issue a medical certificate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A letter-request, dated <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1984</st1:date>, was then prepared by P/Lt.
Dante M. Buenaventura of the <span class="SpellE">Malabon</span> Police Station,
addressed to the Commanding Officer of the PC Crime Laboratory at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Crame</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city> for the physical
examination of Cecilia Padua (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B").<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">After
securing the written consent of <span class="SpellE">Rossana</span> Padua for the
PC Crime Laboratory to conduct an examination on the person of Cecilia Padua (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.</span> "C"), said examination was conducted
by Major Dario L. <span class="SpellE">Gajardo</span>, medico?legal
examiner, who submitted a report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "A")
on his findings and conclusions, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>GENERAL</u> <u>AND</u> <u>EXTRAGENITAL</u>:</blockquote>

<blockquote>'Fairly developed, fairly nourished female subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Breast are</span>

days."</blockquote>

<blockquote>(pp. 45-46, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon the other hand, the version <span style="">of </span>the defense consists mainly of denials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rolando Garcia denies the crime imputed to
him (p. 7 <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, April 10, 1986) and denies having seen
the baby that whole day of <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February
 21, 1984</st1:date> (p. 9 <span class="SpellE"><span style="">tsn</span></span><span style="">, </span>April
10, 1986).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1987" day="16" month="11">November 16<span class="GramE">,1987</span></st1:date>, the trial court rendered a decision
convicting the accused appellant beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of
rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the said decision reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of the foregoing, the Court finds accused
Rolando Garcia y Nieves guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and
sentences him to suffer the penalty of <u><span style="">Reclusion</span></u><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, </span>to
indemnify Cecilia Padua and her parents in the sum of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
<span style="">as </span>moral damages and to pay the
costs.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED.</span> (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 38)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the aforesaid decision, the accused interposed
this appeal, and assigned the following errors, to wit:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">"I</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE COURT <u>A</u> <u><span style="">QUO</span></u><span style=""> </span>ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE DOES NOT

<blockquote>THE COURT <u><span style="">A</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">QUO</span></u><span style=""> </span>ERRED IN FINDING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE
DOUBT ON THE BASIS OF WEAK CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 38, Appellant's Brief)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant asserts that the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">quo</span></u> erred in not finding that the
physical evidence does not conclusively show that the baby was <span style="">a </span>victim of sexual assault.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He claims that the trial court relied solely
on the Medico Legal Report (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">"A")
in concluding that Cecilia Padua, an eight month old baby, was a rape victim.</span>
(p. 6, Appellant's Brief)</p>

<p class="BODY">The examining doctor testifying as an expert witness said that
the laceration of the hymen indicated in his report, could have possibly been
caused by sexual intercourse (90%) and finger-insertion (10%); that the said
laceration of the <span class="SpellE">fourchette</span>, which was almost up to
the anus, is very typical in sexual intercourse; and that it was possible that
the penis entered the vaginal canal because of the extent of the laceration of
the hymen (pp. 5-9, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., July 24, 1984).</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant would want it to appear that the findings as stated
in the medical examination report are defective factually and legally wanting
to sustain the theory that the child <span style="">was
</span>sexually abused (p. 7, Appellant's Brief).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such assertions of the appellant do not merit
a reversal of the judgment appealed from.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">The </span>jurisprudential rule
states that it is not even necessary that there should be a medical examination
of the victim in rape cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A medical
examination is not an indispensable requisite.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Carandang</span>, 52 SCRA
[1973]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact is that the subject (Cecilia Padua) is already in a
non-virgin state physically, as attested to by the examining doctor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The conclusion of a sexual assault
perpetrated upon her becomes very clear and outweighs greatly the presumption that
the loss of virginity may have been due to finger insertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>cannot
be disputed therefore that indeed rape was committed against the eight-month
old Cecilia Padua considering the medical finding that the <u><span style="">labia</span></u><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">majora</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>were reddish and edematous and that
the hymen was deeply lacerated.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the second assignment of error, appellant faults
the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>q</u></span><u><span style="">uo</span></u> for finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt on the
basis of weak circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant argues that the trial court had conceded that there <span style="">was </span>no direct evidence <span style="">pointing </span>to him as the malefactor and
yet it found him guilty based on circumstantial evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the very nature of the crimes against chastity, generally only
two <span style="">persons are </span>involved - the
victim and the offender.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seldom, if
ever, is there an eyewitness to the commission of the crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the instant case, the offended victim was
only eight months old when the heinous crime was committed, and obviously
cannot testify on the crime committed against her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court enumerated the series of circumstantial evidence,
to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"1. That <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span>
entrusted Cecilia Padua to the care of the appellant that fateful day of <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1984</st1:date>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>“2. That appellant was the only person with Cecilia Padua that
afternoon of <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1984</st1:date>;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">“3. </span>That appellant
had the smell of liquor;<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“4. That Cecilia <st1:city><st1:place>Padua</st1:place></st1:city>
who was sleeping in a hammock on the ground floor of the house when entrusted
to the care of the <span class="GramE">appellant,</span> was subsequently found
by her father inside the bedroom of the appellant at the second floor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(pp. 8-9, Appellant's
Brief).</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The first, third, and fourth circumstances were testified to by
the prosecution witnesses, and, appellant disputes only the second
circumstantial evidence, claiming that it was not supported by evidence and
consequently the same has no probative value (supra).</p>

<p class="BODY">The assertion made by the appellant with regard to the second
circumstantial evidence is obviously devoid of merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are circumstances which strongly
militate against appellant’s pretenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence on record is clear that at the time <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Padua came back that afternoon of February 21,
1984 to fetch his infant daughter, the only person he noticed inside his
grandmother's house was the appellant who at that time <span style="">was </span>outside his bedroom, sleeping, while his daughter Cecilia was
inside the bedroom of the appellant at the second floor (pp. 4, 5, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., January 30, 1986).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If it were true that appellant <span style="">was
</span>not alone and that there were other persons at that time, <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> naturally could have inquired from any of them
as to what probably caused the blood stains in the area of the buttocks of his
infant daughter.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant claims to have been sleeping the whole day of <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1984</st1:date> until <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three o'clock</st1:time> that afternoon and was totally
unaware of the presence of the baby in the household (pp. 7, 9, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1986</st1:date>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If that were true, it does not stand to
reason why appellant failed to contradict or rebut the first circumstantial
evidence to the effect that, <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span> had entrusted to him the baby that day of <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1984</st1:date> (p. 3, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>., September 27, 1985).<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Another point is that, if it were really true that there were
other persons in the household that afternoon, as claimed by the appellant, he
should have presented his wife, Venus Padua, to corroborate his testimony that
Cecilia Padua was not brought to their house that day.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It seems incredible that the wife of the
accused would not testify for her husband and defend him from a very serious
accusation if it were true that she was with him in their house on <st1:date year="1984" day="21" month="2">February 21, 1984</st1:date> and that Cecilia
Padua was not brought to their house that day.</p>

<p class="BODY">In addition, the accused himself admits that he knows of no
reason why <span class="SpellE">Josefa</span> <span class="SpellE">Mangali</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Deogracias</span> Padua would testify against him (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> <st1:date year="1986" day="10" month="4">April 10, 1986</st1:date>, p. 16).</p>

<p class="BODY">And lastly, and more importantly, Cecilia was found sleeping
inside the bedroom of the accused at the second floor contradicting his earlier
statement that he was totally unaware of the presence of the baby in the
household.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, did not commit a reversible error
when it rendered the judgment of conviction predicated on circumstantial
evidence against the accused.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> finding the <span class="SpellE">acused</span>
GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of RAPE, the decision appealed from
is hereby AFFIRMED with costs against the appellant.</p>
