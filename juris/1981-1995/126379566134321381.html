<p class="BODY"><span>In criminal Case No. 405 of the Court of First Instance of 
<span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Occidental (Branch III), Rogelio <span class="SpellE">Limosnero</span> was indicted for murder committed during the night 
of May 4, 1977 in <span class="SpellE">Liboron</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dolipos</span> Alto, <span class="SpellE">Oroquieta</span> City, it 
being claimed by the People that at that time and in that place, he fatally 
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Caga-anan</span> 
in the breast while the latter was asleep in his home, and defenseless, using an 
improvised spear made up of </span>a <span>kitchen knife mounted on a long piece 
of newly cut wood, and that the slaying was attended by the </span>qualifying 
cir<span>cumstance of treachery, and the aggravating circumstances of evident 
premeditation and obvious ungratefulness.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span>Limosnero</span></span><span> pleaded 
<em>guilty</em> to the charge when arraigned, "but denied that he committed the 
*** (crime) with evident premeditation and with obvious ungratefulness", 
whereupon "the Court entered a plea of <em>not guilty</em> for him."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>In substantiation of the indictment, seven (7) witnesses 
were presented by the Fiscal at the trial.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> The accused testified in his behalf, 
admitting the <span class="GramE">killing</span> in the manner described in the 
information and by the witnesses, but asserting that he had had no quarrel with 
the victim before the incident and had no grudge or ill-feeling against him, and 
that it was the victim's wife, with whom he was allegedly maintaining an illicit 
relationship, who had asked him to do the foul deed.<span>&nbsp; </span>His mother, 
Margarita <span class="SpellE">Limosnero</span>, also testified, declaring 
<em>inter alia</em> that the accused was born on September 17, 1958 and had 
lived with the victim, <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span>, to help in his farm, 
on the latter's explicit request.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Trial Court found that the evidence submitted before 
</span>it established <span class="SpellE">Limosnero's</span> guilt beyond 
reasonable doubt.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>It however declined to appreciate against 
him the aggravating circumstances of evident premeditation or obvious 
ungratefulness, there </span>being in its view no <span>adequate evidence to 
prove them.<span>&nbsp; </span>The Court also ruled that although <span class="SpellE">Limosnero</span> was a "youthful offender" in accordance with P.D. 
No. 603<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup> — since he was below 
twenty-one years of age at the time of the perpetration of the felony, being 
then only 18 years, 7 months and 17 days </span><span>old — he could not be 
accorded the benefit of a suspended sentence under said decree, for the reason 
that </span><span>P.D. </span><span>No. 1179 precludes the grant of that benefit 
to youthful offenders convicted of an offense punishable by death 
</span><span>or life </span><span>imprison­ment; at any rate, <span class="SpellE">Limosnero</span> had not applied for suspension of his 
sentence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It accordingly sentenced the accused "to 
<em>RECLUSION</em></span> <span style="font-style: italic;">PERPETUA</span><span>, with all the accessory 
penalties provided for by law, to indemnify the heirs of <span class="SpellE">Marcelino</span> <span class="SpellE">Caga-anan</span>, the amount of 
P12</span><span class="GramE"><span>,000.00</span></span><span>, and to pay the 
costs."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The Court also credited the 
</span><span>accused, as a detention prisoner, "with four-fifths (4/5) only of 
his pre­ventive imprisonment, it not appearing that he had agreed, in writing, 
to be governed by the same rules concerning convicted prisoners."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span>Limosnero</span></span><span> has 
appealed to this Court, and ascribes two errors to the Court <em>a quo</em>, to 
wit:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">1)<span>&nbsp; </span>"the Trial Court erred in <span>not crediting ** 
</span>(him) with the mitigating circumstance of his <span>plea of guilty"; 
and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY">2)<span>&nbsp; </span>"the Trial Court erred in <span>not holding that 
** </span>(he) is entitled to the benefit of a suspended sentence <span>as a 
</span>youthful offender, because the law applicable, as to <span>him, is 
</span>Presidential Decree No. 603, and not Presidential Decree <span>No. 
1179."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><span>Limosnero</span></span><span> does not 
impugn the low</span><span>e</span><span>r Court's conclusion as to his 
guilt.<span>&nbsp; </span>He seeks attenuation </span><span>of </span><span>the life 
</span><span>sentence </span><span>imposed by the trial Court by invoking the 
mitigating circumstance of voluntary plea of guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>The Solicitor General agrees that <span class="SpellE">Limosnero</span> should, in the light of the facts, have been 
credited with the mitigating circumstance of a voluntary plea of guilt.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This Court also agrees:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Although the confession was qualified and introduction of evidence 
became necessary, the qualification did not deny the defendant's guilt and, what 
is more, was subsequently fully justified.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was not the 
defendant's fault that aggravating circumstances were erroneously alleged in the 
in­formation and mitigating circumstance omitted <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If such qualification could deprive 
the accused of benefit of plea of guilty, then the prosecution could nullify 
this mitigating circumstance by counteracting it with unfounded allegations of 
aggravating circumstances."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> 
</blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>The second point raised by <span class="SpellE">Limosnero</span>, <em>i.e.</em> he is entitled to the benefit of a 
suspended sentence as a youthful offender in accordance with Presidential Decree 
603,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> has became moot and 
academic.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Limosnero</span> is now 27 years old, 
and the rule is that if an accused reaches the age of majority during appeal, he 
is no longer entitled to a suspended sentence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> </span></p>
<p class="BODY"><b><span>WHEREFORE, </span></b><span>the judgment of the trial 
court is affirmed, with the modification that the accused-appellant is sentenced 
to an indeterminate penalty of 10 years and 1 day of <span class="SpellE"><em>prision</em></span><em> mayor</em> as minimum to 17 years, 4 
months and 1 day of <em>reclusion </em></span><em>temporal </em>as maximum, and 
that the indemnity due from him the heirs of the deceased is increased to
