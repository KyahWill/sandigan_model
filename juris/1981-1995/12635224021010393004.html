Automatic review of the decision of the Court of First Instance of Davao
 in Criminal Cases Nos. 6683 and 6896, imposing the supreme penalty of 
death upon Realino Zea alias Boy, Severino Elegio and Ricardo Awitin for
 the crime of robbery with homicide. The decretal portion of the 
decision reads as follows:
  <blockquote>
    <p> "WHEREFORE, the court finds: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        (1)    That the guilt of the accused Gualberto Boleche alias 
Ambing and Gregorio AMADORE alias Gorio has not been proved beyond 
reasonable doubt and therefore acquits them, and
      </p>
      <p> (2)    That the accused Realino Zea alias Boy, Severino Elegio
 and Ricardo Awitin alias Cardo are guilty beyond reasonable doubt as 
principals of the crime of robbery with homicide, defined and penalized 
under article 294 of the Revised Penal Code, with the aggravating 
circumstances of (1) use of motor vehicle, (2) use of craft and (3) 
abuse of confidence with respect to Realino Zea and Severino Elegio and 
the aggravating circumstances of (1) use of motor vehicle and (2) use of
 craft as regards Ricardo Awitin, without any mitigating circumstance, 
and hereby sentences all of them to Death, with the accessories of the 
law, to indemnify jointly and severally the heirs of Tan Diong Ong alias
 Ho Sing Ong in the sum of Six Thousand Pesos (P6,000.00) and Go Su Lian
 in the amount of One Thousand Nine Hundred Fifty Pesos (P1,950.00) 
representing the amount robbed and to pay the costs proportionately."
          </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p>
Tan Diong Ong was the business associate and <em>jefe de viaje </em>of 
one Go Su Lian, a Chinese merchant engaged in buying and selling rice 
and corn in Davao City. As jefe de viaje, Tan Diong Ong made frequent 
trips to the outlying towns of Davao to buy grains. In these trips, he 
brought with him substantial amount of cash.
</p><p>
Among the employees of the Chinamen were Realino Zea, alias Boy, the 
driver of their Ford cargo truck; Severino Elegio, part-time driver of 
said truck; and Gualberto Boleche and Gregorio Amadore, both cargadores.
 At the time material to this case, Zea was residing in a house at T. 
Claudio St., Davao City, and staying with him in said house were his 
friends, Severino Elegio; the latter's half-brother, Edilberto 
Gutierrez; and Ricardo Awitin.
</p><p>
On August 15, 1960, Tan Diong Ong was scheduled to make a trip to 
Bansalan to buy corn. For this pur­pose, he was given by Go Su Lian the 
amount of P2,000.00. When Severino Elegio reported for work that 
morning, he informed his employers that the regular driver, Boy Zea, 
could not drive as he was suffering from severe stomach ache and that 
the latter had requested him to drive the truck that day.
</p><p>
At about 7:30 in the morning, the cargo truck left the compound of the 
Chinamen with Elegio at the wheel. Ong was seated beside him, while the 
cargadores, Boleche and Amadore, stayed at the cargo com­partment. 
However, instead of proceeding to their destination, Elegio drove to the
 house of Boy Zea. At said house, Ong asked Boy about his ailment and 
the latter replied that he was already well and fit to drive. Whereupon,
 Boy and his two companions, Edil­berto Gutierrez and Ricardo Awitin, 
boarded the truck. Boy took the driver's seat and the vehicle departed 
for Bansalan.
</p><p>
The truck made a brief stop at Cogon where Ong inquired from one Tan 
Seng, a Chinese merchant, if he had corn for sale; and after the latter 
told him that he had none, the trip was resumed.
</p><p>
At about 9:30 that morning, Jose Yanez, a cochero, was driving his 
tartanilla along the high­way, headed for the poblacion of Digos. Yanez 
testified that while passing sitio Tres de Mayo, he came upon a cargo 
truck parked about 15 meters away from the bridge. Its hood was opened 
and a man was looking into the engine. After his tartanilla had crossed 
the bridge, he heard a gunshot coming from where the truck was parked 
and this was followed by another shot. Shortly after, he saw five men 
running from the truck towards him. They boarded his tartanilla and 
instructed him to take them to Digos. On the way thereto, one of the 
passengers, whom he identified as Ricardo Awitin, removed the 
blood-stained shirt he was wearing<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  and threw it away. When they reached the road junction at Kiagot, two 
of his passengers, identified at the trial as Edilberto Gutierrez and 
Ricardo Awitin, jumped out of the tartanilla and ran to the woods. 
Elegio warned Boleche and Amadore not to tell anyone of the 
participation of Gutierrez and Awitin in the commission of the crime. 
Since that day, Gutierrez had succeeded in avoiding arrest, while Awitin
 was apprehended by the police in Balengwan, Misamis Oriental on January
 10, 1961.
</p><p>
Upon arrival of the tartanilla at Digos, Boy Zea reported to Pat. 
Jumao-as of the Digos Police that he and his companions were held-up at 
sitio Tres de Mayo by armed unidentified men and that their jefe de 
viaje, Mr. Ong, was shot by the robbers.
</p><p>
Forthwith, the policemen brought Boy Zea and his companions to the scene
 of the crime. On their way thereto, Corporal Cuevas picked up at the 
road­ side a white shirt splattered with blood.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  The shirt was identified at the trial as the same one worn by Awitin during the incident.
</p><p>
The police found Mr. Ong lying at the road­side, his head smeared with 
blood. Of the amount of P2,000.00 he had brought with him, only a P50.00
 bill was retrieved from his pocket. He was immediately taken to the 
Caños Hospital and later transferred to San Pedro Hospital in Davao City
 where he died at 12:45 pm that day, August 15, 1960. Dr. Alex 
Panunciaman, who examined the victim, described the latter's injuries as
 follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Two gunshot wounds on the head. Point of entry at the right 
infraorbital, and at the left temple. X-ray revealed two foreign bodies 
of metalic density, the size and shape of which approximates the 
description of a .38 Cal. Bullet, lodged deep within the substance of 
the brain. The patient died from intracerebral hemorrhage, massive, and 
laceration of the brain caused by the bullets. x x x ."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
At the scene of the crime, Boy Zea informed the police officers that the
 hood of the truck had been opened because the engine had faltered and 
that he and Elegio were fixing it when Mr. Ong was shot.
</p><p>
Tranquilino dela Cruz, municipal councilor and an experienced mechanic, 
later went to the scene of the incident. He checked the engine and 
tested the vehicle, and found the same to be in perfect running 
condition.
</p><p>
This information, coming as it did from an experienced mechanic, aroused
 the suspicion of the Digos police on the story foisted off by Boy Zea 
that the crime was perpetrated by unidentified robbers. The following 
day, August 16, 1960, Boy Zea, Elegio Boleche and Amadore were summoned 
to the police station, and in the ensuing investiga­tion of Elegio and 
Boy Zea, the police discovered that the crime was committed in pursuance
 of a sinister plot to rob and kill the Chinaman. The names of the 
conspirators, and the time and the place it was planned were revealed by
 Elegio in the extrajudicial statement he executed on August 16, 1960.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  Thus,
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q   Who planned to kill Mr. Ong? </p>
  <p>
    A    Realino Zea, alias Boy, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   How did you come to know of his plan to kill Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    He told me in their house, sir, as I am staying with him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Did Realino Zea, alias Boy tell you his reason for wanting to kill Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    He resented the employment of Mr. Ong as jefe de viaje, as 
previously he was the one being trusted with the money to buy corn. He 
was able to tell me that Mr. Ong was just a newcomer, as the latter was 
only employed as <em>jefe de viaje </em>about 2 weeks ago by Mr. Go. He 
also told me that it would be a nice idea to rob Mr. Ong of the cash 
being entrusted to him and he was trying to invite me to participate in 
his plan but I told him I was afraid.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   When did Realino Zea, alias Boy, tell you of this plan to kill Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    I cannot remember the date, but it was a few days after Mr. Ong had already started to work as <em>jefe de viaje </em>of Mr. Go.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Before you left for the house of Mr. Go from the house of 
Realino Zea alias Boy in Davao City, were you told of the plan that they
 will kill Mr. Ong on that day of August 15, 1960?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    No, sir. I did not know that their plan was to kill Mr. Ong 
that day, although last Sunday August 14, 1960, I was told again that 
they will kill Mr. Ong and I was even told by Realino Zea that the 
moment he stopped the truck he will tell me to open the hood and pretend
 to work on the defect of the engine of the truck.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   You mentioned the word 'they', who are the other persons aside from Realino Zea who planned to kill Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Ricardo (Awitin), and Edilberto Gutierrez, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Where did Realino Zea, Ricardo and Edilberto tell you of their intention to kill Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    In the house of Realino Zea at T. Claudio, Davao City.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Do you know where in Davao City Realino Zea, Edilberto Gutierrez live?
  </p>
  <p> A    They are living with Realino Zea, sir, in the house of the latter."
  </p>
  <p>
    This conspiracy was likewise admitted by Realino Zea in his sworn statement<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>  as follows:
  </p>
  <p> "Q   You mean to say that there was already a previous plan agreed among you about robbing Mr. Ong and killing him? </p>
  <p>
    A    Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Who conceived the plan to kill Mr. Ong and to rob him of his money?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Edilberto, sir, alias Eddie.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Who presented the idea of stopping the truck after crossing the 
bridge at Tres de Mayo, Digos, Davao where a check-up on an alleged 
engine trouble was to be made?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    I was the one, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   When was this idea presented by you to your companions and who 
were your companions in conceiving the plan to kill Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    It was only last Sunday night, August 14, 1960, when the plan 
was conceived by Edilberto as he said he needed money as he will get 
married in Cagayan in this month of August, 1960.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Where was this plan discussed among you and who were those present?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    In our house at Tomas Claudio, Davao City and those present 
were Edilberto Gutierrez alias Eddie, Ricardo alias Kardo, Severino 
Elegio and myself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   What did you tell your companions about the plan being discussed in your house in the night of August 14, 1960?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    I just agreed with their plan.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   At about what time did you discuss the plan to kill Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p> A    That was about 8:00 o'clock in the evening, sir."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The four conspirators found the opportune time to carry out their 
sinister plot on August 15, 1960 when Tan Diong Ong was scheduled to 
leave for Bansalan to buy corn.
</p><p>
As heretofore stated, the cargo truck left the Chinamen's house at about
 7:30 in the morning, with Tan Diong Ong, Boy Zea, Elegio, Boleche and 
Amadore on board. Zea, Gutierrez, and Awitin also boarded the truck from
 their house at T. Claudio St. They made their first stop at Cogon where
 Ong went to the house of Tan Seng to inquire if the latter had corn for
 sale.
</p><p>
At Astorga, Zea again brought the truck to a stop, on the pretense that 
he was going to urinate. Boy Zea, Elegio, Gutierrez and Awitin then got 
down and went behind the truck. There, in whispers, they laid out the 
final details for the execution of the crime. They agreed that, on the 
pretext that the truck had run into engine trouble, Boy Zea would bring 
the vehicle to a dead stop at an isolated place near the bridge in sitio
 Tres de Mayo; and that while Elegio and Zea went through the motions of
 fixing the engine, Edilberto Gutierrez would shoot down the Chinaman 
with his cal. 380 pistol and divest him of his money. They would then 
proceed to the police station at Digos and report that the slaying of 
Mr. Ong was an incident of an alleged hold-up perpetrated by armed 
unidentified men. Having set up their plan, they returned to the truck 
and continued on their way.
</p><p>
They finally reached sitio Tres de Mayo. As pre-arranged, Boy Zea 
brought the truck to a full stop. What transpired thereafter was 
narrated by Boy Zea as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q   You said that upon stopping near the bridge which you had 
crossed at Tres de Mayo, Digos, Davao, you called upon Severino (Elegio)
 to check up your dynamo, what did Severino do? </p>
  <p>
    A    He went down and raised up the hood and pretended to work on 
the dynamo while I stepped on the accelerator and stopped or switched 
off the engine and joined Severino near the machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   What happened after that?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Eddie (Edilberto Gutierrez) opened the door at the left (when 
facing the truck) and loaded his gun and I saw him shoot Mr. Ong. Eddie 
entered the truck before firing at Mr. Ong.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Who was the companion of Eddie in going inside the truck where he shot Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Cardo (Ricardo Awitin), sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   What did you do upon hearing the shot fired?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    I intended to run, but I met Cardo coming out from under the truck so that I returned back towards the engine.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Did you see what happened to Mr. Ong in your return to the engine?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    No, sir. What I noticed is that Eddie and Cardo were dragging Mr. Ong from the truck.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   But you said you saw Cardo coming out from under the truck when you intended to run, how can you explain this?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Cardo went back and entered the truck and helped Eddie in dragging Mr. Ong.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Where was Eddie when he fired at Mr. Ong with his Cal. 38 pistol?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Inside the truck, sir, at the left (when facing the truck) side where he entered with Cardo.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   When you said that Cardo entered the truck after meeting him 
coming out from under the truck to help Eddie in dragging Mr. Ong, what 
did they do with Mr. Ong?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    I no longer saw what they did to Mr. Ong because I ran away from the truck.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   How many shots were fired?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    I only heard two shots fired.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Where were you when the second shot was fired?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    I was already at the bridge which is about 15 meters away from the truck.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   Why did you run away from the scene?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    Because I want to avoid being hit as they may shoot me.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   When you ran away from the truck, where were your companions?
  </p>
  <p>
    A    They followed me.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In his affidavit,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup>  Elegio substantially confirmed the foregoing statements of Boy Zea.
</p><p>
There is no question that it was Edilberto Gutierrez who shot and killed
 the deceased Tan Diong Ong. All the accused, in their testimonies as 
well as in their sworn statements, are in unison that Gutierrez alone 
was the trigger man. This notwithstanding, the trial court held each and
 all the appellants guilty as principals on the basis of its findings of
 the existence of a conspiracy.
</p><p>
The records support the lower court's findings. With respect to Boy Zea 
and Elegio, the conclusion is easily reached that, as co-conspirators, 
they are equally guilty as the trigger man. As pointed out, said 
appellants executed their respective extrajudicial statements wherein 
they positively and directly acknowledged that in the night of August 
14, 1960, in the secrecy of their house at T. Claudio St., they agreed 
to kill and rob the victim. It is significant to note that no attempt 
whatever was made by said accused to dispute either the voluntary 
execution of their respective sworn statements or the truth of the 
incriminating facts recited therein. As this Court said in People vs. 
Garcia<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup>  "There is no 
evidence of a higher quality than a confession. It represents the 
outward manifestation of a man. Unless, there­fore, the confession is 
nullified by evidence of duress x x x, the same is admissible as an 
evidence of guilt of a high quality."
</p><p>
In US vs. Delos Santos,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup>  
the same principle was stated in this wise: "If a confession be true and
 voluntary, the deliberate act of the accused with a full comprehension 
of its significance, there is no impediment to its admission as evidence
 and it then becomes evidence of a high order, since it is supported by 
the presumption, a very strong one, that no person of normal mind will 
deliberately and knowingly confess himself to be the perpetrator of a 
crime, especially if it be a serious crime, unless prompted by truth and
 conscience."
</p><p>
It would not be amiss to state that said confessions, having been made 
before the effectivity of the 1973 Constitution, are admissible in 
evidence.
</p><p>
But quite apart from the confessions of said accused, there is adequate 
evidence adduced at the trial to support the lower court's finding of 
the existence of a conspiracy. In open court, Boy Zea and Elegio 
admitted having performed certain overt acts in the furtherance of their
 common design. They testified that when the truck reached sitio Tres de
 Mayo, Boy Zea brought the truck to a full stop and that on the false 
pretense that the engine had failed, Elegio opened the hood and 
pretended to fix the engine. As pre-arranged, the vehicle was parked at 
that isolated and uninhabited place to enable them to consummate the 
crime undetected and unseen by any other person.
</p><p>
They further declared that upon their arrival at Digos they gave to the 
police the report that they were held up by unidentified men. That such 
report was pure concoction was confirmed by Zea in his affidavit, as 
follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Q   Was it included in your plan that after accomplishing your 
intention to rob and kill Mr. Ong, you and your companions will run away
 and pretend that what transpired was a hold-up? </p>
  <p>
    A    It is with the plan, sir.
  </p>
  <p> Q   Was it also included in your plan that to make it appear more 
con­vincing, you will report to the police authorities that you were 
victims of a hold-up? </p>
  <p>
    A    Yes, sir.
  </p>
  <p>
    Q   In running away from the scene of the crime, where were you intending to proceed?
  </p>
  <p> A    Our purpose is to report to the police force about a prepared and fabricated report of a hold-up."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The false report given to the police was obviously a scheme intended to conceal the identity of the real malefactors.
</p><p>
By the same token, the testimonies of Boy Zea and Elegio as well as 
those of Boleche and Amadore established not only Awitin's participation
 in the planning of the crime in the night of August 14, 1960, but also 
his role in the actual perpetration in the cold-blooded murder of Mr. 
Ong. He placed himself beside the victim immediately before the victim 
was shot in order to prevent his escape; and after the shooting, he and 
Gutierrez pulled out the Chinaman from the truck, dragged him to the 
roadside where they left him in the bushes.
</p><p>
The concerted action and the unity of purpose displayed by the 
appellants clearly indicate the existence of a conspiracy. It has been 
laid down as a rule that when the defendants by their acts aimed at the 
same object, one performing one part and another performing another part
 so as to complete it, with a view to the attainment of the same object,
 and their acts, though apparently independent were in fact concerted 
and cooperative, indicating closeness of personal association, concerted
 action and concurrence of sentiments, the court will be justified in 
concluding that said defendants were engaged in conspiracy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup>  Accordingly, as co-conspirators, appellants are liable for the wrong­ful act and its consequences.
</p><p>
However, We set aside the holding of the trial court that the crime was 
aggravated by the circumstances of (1) use of motor vehicle (2) use of 
craft and (3) abuse of confidence.
</p><p>
The aggravating circumstance of use of motor vehicle is appreciated when
 it is shown that the vehicle was purposely sought to facilitate the 
com­mission of the offense or to insure its success or when it is 
manifested that without it the offense charged could not have been 
committed.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p>
In the case at bar, the use of the truck was not intentionally sought by
 appellants. The crime was committed in the course of their regular 
employment and activity. The use of the truck was not necessary to 
facilitate the perpetration of the heinous crime. In fact, they could 
have con­summated their nefarious design by simply waiting in ambush at 
some point along the route of the truck.
</p><p>
Nor was the commission of the crime attended by aggravating circumstance
 of use of craft. The lower court found as basis for this aggravating 
circumstance the fact that Zea pretended to be sick in order that Elegio
 could secure Mr. Go's permission to drive the truck, thereby enabling 
Zea, Awitin and Gutierrez to board the vehicle when it passed by Zea's 
house.
</p><p>
Craft is chicanery resorted to by the accused to aid in the execution of
 his criminal design. It is employed as a scheme in the execution of the
 crime. In the instant case, it cannot be said that Zea's excuse proved 
to be a significant aid in the execution of the conspiracy. One way or 
the other, the appellants' criminal design could have been carried out 
without Zea's having feigned illness on the day in question.
</p><p>
With respect to abuse of confidence, the same can be appreciated only if
 the following requisites are present: (a) the offended party had 
trusted the offender; (b) the offender abused such trust; and (c) such 
abuse facilitated the commission of the crime.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup>
  In the present case, the above requisites have not been fully met. 
Elegio and Zea came to know Tan Diong Ong only about two weeks before 
the incident.
</p><p>
The penalty for robbery with homicide is <em>reclusion perpetua </em>to death. In the absence of any aggravating circumstance, the appropriate penalty is <em>reclusion perpetua</em>.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the death penalty imposed by the trial court is hereby 
modified as follows: each of the accused-appellants is hereby sentenced 
to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify 
jointly and severally the heirs of Tan Diong Ong in the sum of Thirty 
Thousand (P30,000.00) Pesos and Go Su Lian in the amount of One Thousand
 Nine Hundred Fifty (P1,950.00) Pesos, representing the amount robbed, 
and to pay the costs proportionately.
