<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioner-spouses had
filed a complaint in the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City for annulment of
the deed of absolute sale covering a house and lot located in Don Antonio
Heights, University District, Payatas, Quezon City.  The lot was formerly covered by TCT No. 277097 in the name of the
petitioner Flordeliz L. Bellido.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The evidence adduced by
the parties is summarized by the Court of Appeals as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Briefly,
plaintiffs' evidence sought to prove that: being financially distressed in
October or November 1986, plaintiffs offered to defendants the subject property
valued at P900,000.00 as collateral for a loan of P300,000.00; an advance of
P85,284.39 (in PNB Check No. 131229) was given by defendant husband to
plaintiffs who used said amount to pay the balance of their loan with the
Central Bank Provident Fund Office; before the balance of the loan was given to
plaintiffs, defendants demanded the execution of a deed of absolute sale and the
surrender of the title to the land, and assured plaintiffs that the deed of
sale and title would be merely collateral to the loan; plaintiffs executed the
deed of absolute sale on March 5, 1987 but they received only a total of
P240,000.00 including the advance of P85,284.39; of the loan of P300,000.00,
P60,000.00 was immediately deduct­ed by defendants as interest for one year;
and, sometime in April - May, 1987, defendants tried to evict Joel de Leon,
plaintiffs’ caretaker from the disputed house and lot.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Defendants'
evidence, on the other hand, tended to establish that: thru an aunt of
defendants, plaintiffs secured from the latter a loan in the amount of
P85,284.39, the exact amount needed to redeem plaintiffs' property from the
Central Bank; defendant husband granted said loan on plaintiffs' promise that
they would pay the loan within three (3) months, otherwise, if plain­tiffs
would fail to settle within said period, plaintiffs would sell the subject
property to defendants for P300,000.00 including the amount of P85,284.39;
plaintiffs failed to pay within the stipulated three (3) month grace period and
even after another one (1) month extension granted by defendants; plaintiffs
then voluntarily appeared in the office of defendants' counsel to execute the
assailed deed of absolute sale; defendants had the disputed property titled
under their names after paying all the back taxes thereon since 1982; and,
defendants informed the caretaker of plaintiffs that they are now the owners of
the subject property and after the latter moved out of the premises, defendants
occupied the same up to the present."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 90, Quezon City

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">*</span></span></a> dated 15 March 1991 dismissing
herein petitioner-spouses' complaint and upholding the deed of absolute sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court decision
deleting however the awards of moral damages and attorney's fees in favor of
the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner-spouses raise the following issues to this Court:</p>

<p class="BODY">Article 1604 of the Civil Code makes the aforementioned Article
1602 applicable to a contract purporting to be an absolute sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">After carefully going over the records of this case, we are
convinced that the agreement between the petitioner-spouses and the private
respondents is an equitable mortgage.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that the Deed of Absolute Sale executed by the
petitioner-spouses is dated 5 March 1987 but the Court finds it hard to believe
that the private respondents had earlier loaned a little over Eighty-Five
Thousand Pesos (P85,000.00) to herein petitioners without getting any type of
security for the loan, not even a promissory note.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the version of the petitioners is much more
consistent with the presumption that a person takes ordinary care of his
concerns.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the petitioners, private respondents required them
to surrender their transfer certificate of title over the lot and further
required that they execute a Deed of Absolute Sale over the said lot before
they could obtain the balance of the Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00)
less the advance of P85,284.39 which was used to pay the petitioners' loan with
the Central Bank Provident Fund to release the mortgage over the lot, and less
the pre-deducted amount of P60,000.00 representing advance interest on the
loan.  The transfer certificate of title
and the unnotarized Deed of Absolute Sale thus served as the security for the
loan extended to the petitioner-spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The Court had previously
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That a transaction was really one of loan with security, and
therefore <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">a </span>mortgage, may be
shown by the aid of surrounding circumstances, and parol evidence is competent
in that respect.  This rule has been
accepted for many generations.  The
difficulty lies in its application, for many factors are to be considered, none
of them conclu­sive in itself, but each to be considered in its company."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In the case at bench,
several factors are present which support the existence of an equitable
mortgage, namely:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

and unsupported, this report stating that the total market value of the
property subject of this case was about One Million Four Hundred Twenty One
Thousand Pesos (P1,421.000.00) as of 29 January 1987 and the testimony of
petitioner Villamor Bellido that the value of the property in 1986 was about
Nine Hundred Fifty Thousand Pesos (P950,000.00)<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
cannot be completely ignored by this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In <u>Vallangca v. Court
of Appeals</u></span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">, this Court took judicial notice of the fact
that real estate usually commands a market value much higher than its assessed
value.  In the case before us, while the
alleged purchase price of </span>Three Hundred Thousand Pesos (P300,000.00) may
be a bit more than the market value reflected in the owner's copy of the
Declaration of Real Property<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
totalling about Two Hundred Eighty Six Thousand Pesos (P286,000.00) only, the
presence of other circumstances hereinabove discussed give rise to a conclusion
that the stated purchase price (P300,000.00) was intentionally fixed to
carefully or skillfully prevent the application of Articles 1602 and 1604 of
the Civil Code.</p>
