<p class="BODY">The facts of this case as found by both the trial court and the
appellate court on the basis of the evidence show the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">At about a little past midnight of March 22, 1972, while the
victim Manuel Esteban, Jr. and his companions Jaime <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>,
Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span>, Jesus <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
and Charles Go were having a drinking spree at the mezzanine floor of the Sands
Kitchenette, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> Avenue, Manila, a napkin container
was <span style="">thrown to their table coming from a
group of three </span>or <span style="">four persons,
which included the petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
victim approached the group of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Jr. after which a heated argument ensued.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Bautista pushed the </span>left shoulder of the victim
causing the latter to spin at which time, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Jr. fired his gun with his left hand (his right hand is atrophied), hitting the
victim, who was then in a stooping position, at the back.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Having been shot, the victim drew his gun and
fired indiscriminately hitting Manuel de Guzman, a companion of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. on his left thigh.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet which wounded De Guzman hit the
wall and ricocheted, hitting one of the accused Eden Ng along his umbilical
cord.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner Bautista then held the
victim who was bent forward, <span style="">on </span>his
right wrist and poked a gun at him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At
this point, petitioner Bautista suddenly fired his gun hitting the chest of the
victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span> together with a bouncer from a nearby Soda
Fountain brought the victim to the <st1:place><st1:placename>Jose</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Reyes</st1:placename> <st1:placename>Memorial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
where he was pronounced dead on arrival.</p>

<p class="BODY">We will first dispose of the second issue raised by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. that he should be acquitted on the ground of
self-defense and/or defense of strangers. </p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is well-settled<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
an indispensable requirement of self-defense and defense of strangers under <span style="">paragraphs </span>1 and <span style="">3, </span><span style="">respectively, </span><span style="">of Article <span class="GramE">11,</span>
Revised Penal Code </span>is unlawful <span style="">aggression </span>on the part of the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
This element is not present in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span> would have <span class="GramE">Us</span> believe that the unlawful aggression emanated from the
victim alleging that the latter was under heavy influence of liquor at the time
of the incident, that it was he who suddenly accosted their group because of
the napkin container thrown at his table and that he was the first to fire the
shot.</p>

<p class="BODY">For unlawful aggression to be present in self-<span class="GramE">defense,</span>
there must be an assault or at least a threatened assault of an immediate and
imminent kind on the person defending himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, there was no actual physical assault on petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. or any member of his group.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither was it shown that the victim
exhibited an intimidating attitude that is offensive and positively strong,
showing the wrongful intent to cause an injury.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
When the victim approached the group of <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr.,
presumably to confront them <span style="">as </span>to
the napkin container thrown at their table, he was not yet brandishing his gun
as testified to by the prosecution witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A mere threatening attitude on the part of the victim will not
constitute unlawful aggression.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
If there was any unlawful aggression, it came from the group of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. when Bautista pushed the victim's shoulder
after which petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. fired the first
shot hitting the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only at
this time when the victim drew his gun and fired indiscriminately.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These facts have been duly established by the
evidence for the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, as the accused,
must establish self-defense by clear and convincing evidence.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
He must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of
that of the prosecution, for even if it were weak, it could not be disbelieved
after he himself admitted shooting the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There being no unlawful aggression on the part of the victim,
petitioner cannot claim the justifying circumstance of self-defense to absolve
him from criminal liability for inflicting injury upon the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But for what crime should he be held liable -
homicide or slight physical injuries?</p>

<p class="BODY">Per the post-mortem findings report prepared by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Abelardo</span> B. Lucero, Medico Legal Examiner, Manila
Metropolitan Police, the victim died of "shock and hemorrhage due to
multiple (2) gunshot wounds in the anterior and posterior chest lacerating the
diaphragm, <span style="">liver, stomach and
spleen."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Dr. Lucero testified that wound no. 1
located at the anterior right chest is a contact wound because the muzzle of
the gun touched the skin of the body of the victim which is a fatal wound,
while wound No. 2 found at the back of the victim is a slight wound making it
possible for the victim to fire a gun even after sustaining such wound.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Per opinion of Dr. Lucero, wound Nos. 1 and 2
have been caused by bullets of different caliber, or at </span>least by
different firearms, with wound No. 2 inflicted ahead of wound No. 1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court then ruled that wound No. 2
was caused by the gun of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. who
was established to have fired first and that wound No. 1 was inflicted by
petitioner Bautista.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, relying on this
finding of the trial court, now argues that wound No. 2 not being a fatal wound
but only a slight wound would not make him criminally liable for the death of
the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He points out that had not
petitioner Bautista subsequently shot the victim during the scuffle for the gun
of the latter, the victim would not have died.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He asserts that since there was no conspiracy established, the liability
of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. should only be for the
crime of slight physical injuries.</p>

<p class="BODY">The State through the Solicitor General in opposing the theory of
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. argues that the denomination
of wound No. 2 as "slight" merely refers to the gunshot wound of
entry and that the medical findings show that the victim died due to shock and
hemorrhage caused by two gunshot wounds - wound No. 1 and wound No. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Solicitor General further contends that
since none of the wounds is "thru and thru" and therefore one <span style="">cannot </span>be the wound of entry while the
other the wound of exit, the conclusion becomes ineluctable that the two
gunshot wounds, one in front and one at the back caused the shock, hemorrhage
and the laceration of the internal organs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. retorts by
saying that the two (2) gunshot wounds are "thru and thru" thus
resulting in four wounds, two of entry and two of exit; thus, the "two (2)
gunshot wounds" which caused the shock and hemorrhage resulting in the
death of the victim refer to the wounds caused by gunshot No. 1 fired by
petitioner Bautista.</p>

<p class="BODY">We agree with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr.</p>

<p class="BODY">The postmortem findings report details the wounds <span style="">sustained by the victim -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We can clearly see that there were four gunshot wounds.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The gunshot fired by <span style="">p</span>etitioner Bautista, produced gunshot wound of entry I located at
the anterior right chest with the bullet coming out thru gunshot wound of exit
I-A in the left lateral chest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
second gunshot fired by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr.
caused gunshot wound of entry II located in the left posterior <span class="SpellE">midlateral</span> chest with the bullet coming out thru gunshot
wound of exit II-A at the lateral posterior left shoulder.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The bullet fired from the gun of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. only lacerated the skin and subcutaneous
tissues, thus, its classification by Dr. Lucero as a slight injury.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The bullet fired from the gun of
petitioner Bautista lacerated the diaphragm, liver,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
stomach and spleen proving to be fatal to the victim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There can be no other conclusion except that
the "two gunshot wounds" indicated under the cause of death refer to
the gunshot wounds of entry and exit located at the anterior right chest and
the left lateral chest, respectively, produced by the gunshot fired by petitioner
Bautista which lacerated the diaphragm, liver, stomach and spleen.</p>

<p class="BODY">The nature of the wound inflicted by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr. having been settled as a slight injury, <span style="">should he be held </span>responsible
for the death of the victim?</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no pretension that there was any conspiracy between the
petitioners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no concerted
action pursuant to a common criminal design between the petitioners.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In the absence of conspiracy, each of the accused, herein petitioners, is
responsible only for the consequences of his own acts.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in a case where one accused inflicted the mortal wound by
stabbing the victim with a knife while the other two assailants merely hit the
victim with a bamboo on the left arm and the head, the former was held <span style="">guilty </span>of murder while the latter was
held liable only for <span class="SpellE"><u>lesiones</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>leves</u></span> or slight physical injuries.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">In still </span>another case where two
persons attacked <span style="">a single </span>victim,
one inflicting a fatal wound hacking the victim with a bolo almost amputating
the left arm completely, while the other also using a bolo struck the victim
just below the armpit causing a wound that would heal in ten (10) days, the one
who inflicted the mortal wound was convicted of murder while the other only of
less serious physical injuries.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The gunshot wound inflicted by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>,
Jr. was a slight wound which did not cause the death of the victim nor
materially contributed to it in order that he may be held liable for homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
His liability should therefore be limited to the slight injury he caused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">However,
</span>the fact that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Araneta</span>, Jr.
inflicted a gunshot wound on the victim shows the intent to kill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use of a gun fired at another certainly
leads to no other conclusion <span style="">than </span>that
there is intent to kill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He is therefore
liable for the crime of attempted homicide and not merely for slight physical
injury.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the issues raised <span style="">by
</span><span style="">petitioner </span>Bautista, We
note that they involve questions of fact, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>whether or not he shot the victim and whether
or not he was present at the inception of the shooting incident -- which this
Court <span style="">will </span>not ordinarily
review.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except in criminal cases in
which the penalty imposed is <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>
or higher, appeals to the Supreme Court are not <span style="">a </span>matter of right but of sound judicial discretion, allowed only

<p class="BODY">Petitioner invokes the exceptions that the findings of respondent
court is grounded on speculations, surmises or conjectures,<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>

and that there was grave abuse of discretion<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
to justify a review of the findings of facts of respondent court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bautista primarily decries the fact that the
respondent court as well as the trial court did not give weight to the negative
results of the paraffin test to which he was subjected to nine (9) hours after
the shooting and instead indulged in speculations, surmises and conjectures
when they concluded that "many things had happened between the shooting
and the time Bautista was subjected to paraffin test"<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
He contends that the supposition of the respondent court that the petitioner
being a policeman must be aware that gunpowder can be easily removed by washing
the hands with vinegar, or even with soap and water and knowing such must have
done so, was totally unfounded and unsupported by evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, an examination of the records reveals that there are
other circumstances upon which the respondent court based its conclusion that
petitioner Bautista fired his gun, thus -</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="GramE">a</span>)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ballistics
results show that the gun of appellant Bautista was newly oiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Specifically the finding was that it has
“traces of thick oil." Appellant Bautista failed to refute the prosecution
evidence that his gun at the time of his examination in the morning of <st1:date year="1972" day="23" month="3">March 23, 1972</st1:date>, was newly oiled.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither did he explain the presence of thick
oil in his gun.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His obvious purpose of
oiling his gun is to remove traces of gun powder.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ballistics test itself shows that one
chamber in the gun of Bautista was found to have smoke rings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Smoke rings, according to
the testimony of the ballistics expert, appears</span> in the chamber of a
revolver whose bullet was fired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only
one chamber had smoke rings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
five chambers do not have any.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
shows that appellant Bautista fired only one shot which is in accordance with
the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lame explanation of Bautista that the
said smoke ring is attributable to the fact that in the month of February he
participated in quelling student demonstra­tions, fails to explain why, despite
the fact that his gun is newly oiled, said smoke ring was still present at that
time The obvious conclusion is that because he was racing against time,
Bautista forgot, in his desire to exculpate himself, to clean the inner chamber
of his service revolver."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These circumstances are nevertheless of no moment because of the
positive identification of petitioner Bautista as the person who shot the
victim by the prosecution witness Eduardo <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner, however, discounts the testimony
of <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span> for the reason that <span style="">he </span>gave two (2) conflicting statements
- one before the Manila Metropolitan Police (MMP) given on March 23, 1972
wherein he failed to identify the person who fired the fatal shot and the other
before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on March 24, 1972 wherein he
identified petitioner as the assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">This apparent inconsistency in the statements of <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span> was satisfactorily explained at the trial during his
direct and cross examinations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
testified that he had no choice but to sign the sworn statements given before
the MMP because he was intimidated by the investigating officers who did not want
him to implicate petitioner Bautista as the person who shot the victim since
petitioner was their comrade.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
when he insisted that it was Bautista who shot the victim, the investigating
officer Rolando <span class="SpellE">Atanacio</span> stopped the taking down of
the statement and instead indicated therein that <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span>
refused to continue with the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
for this reason that <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span> together with another
prosecution witness Jaime <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> decided to proceed to
the NBI to give another sworn statement this time disclosing the whole truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bautista deplores the fact that the respondent court
chose to give full credence to the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
placing the former at the scene of the incident prior to the actual shooting
and disregarded his version that he merely responded to the crime scene as
police officer after he heard the shots coming from the Sands Kitchenette.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Roque</span> affirmatively identified
petitioner Bautista as the person who, during the confrontation pushed the
victim on the shoulder making him spin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioner Bautista on the other hand, alleged that he was in the
vicinity of the crime scene that <span class="GramE">night</span> of <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1972</st1:date> because he conveyed
his <span class="SpellE">compadre</span> <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span>
Sanchez whom he accidentally met to take a ride for La Loma.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, Sanchez was never presented as a
witness to corroborate this claim of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court properly observed that the
non-presentation of Sanchez is <span class="GramE">an evidence</span> <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> suppressed which if presented will be adverse to
Bautista.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Bautista <span style="">also </span>capitalizes
on the failure of <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> to identify him and his
co-accused in his sworn statement given before the NBI on <st1:date year="1972" day="24" month="3">March 24, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This failure is explained by the fact that at the start he did not know
their names, but merely recognized their faces.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It was only when the pictures of the accused were shown that he came to
know of their names.</p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the trial court's conclusion on the credibility of the
prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span> and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
as it is in a better <span style="">position </span>to
decide the question, having seen and heard the witnesses themselves and
observed their behavior and manner of testifying.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>

The trial court noted that "no evil or bad motive was shown to have
existed before the incident which would prompt <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Saguil</span> to testify in the manner they did if such
were not the <span style="">fact."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> The absence of evidence as to an improper

prosecution witnesses that he was at the crime scene at the inception of the
incident and pointing to him as the person who confronted and last shot the
