				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> of the
decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. CV No. 06649 dated <st1:date year="1987" day="30" month="6">June 30, 1987</st1:date> affirming the decision
of the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> in SP Proc. No.
8492 dated <st1:date year="1983" day="29" month="12">December 29, 1983</st1:date>;
and its resolution dated <st1:date year="1987" day="24" month="11">November 24,
 1987</st1:date> denying the motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1969" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1969</st1:date>,
private respondent Jose Vicente De Leon and petitioner Sylvia <span class="SpellE">Lichauco</span> De Leon were united in wedlock before the
Municipal Mayor of <span class="SpellE">Binangonan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="28" month="8">August
 28, 1971</st1:date>, a child named Susana L. De <st1:country-region><st1:place>Leon</st1:place></st1:country-region>
was <span class="GramE">born</span> from this union. </p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime in October, 1972, a <u>de</u> <u>facto</u> separation
between the spouses occurred due to irreconcilable marital differences, with
Sylvia leaving the conjugal home.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in March, 1973, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">Sylvia </span>went
to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
where she obtained American citizenship.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1973" day="23" month="11">November 23, 1973</st1:date>,
Sylvia filed with the Superior Court of California, <st1:place><st1:placetype>County</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename>San Francisco</st1:placename></st1:place>, <span class="GramE">a</span> petition for dissolution of marriage against Jose
Vicente.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the said divorce
proceedings, Sylvia also filed claims for support and distribution of
properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It appears, however, that
since Jose Vicente was then a Philippine resident and did not have any assets
in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
Sylvia chose to hold in abeyance the divorce proceedings, and in the meantime,
concentrated her efforts to obtain some sort of property settlements with Jose
Vicente in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on <st1:date year="1977" day="16" month="3">March 16, 1977</st1:date>,
Sylvia succeeded in entering into a Letter-Agreement with her mother-in-law,

of the divorce lawyer of petitioner Sylvia (Mr. <span class="SpellE">Penrod</span>)
in support of the fact that <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> was mistaken
in having signed Exhibits ‘E’ to ‘E-2’ because when she signed said Exhibits
she believed that fact that petitioner <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">Sylvia
</span>would eliminate her inheritance rights and there is no showing that said
<span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> was properly advised by any American
lawyer on the fact whether petitioner Sylvia, being an American citizen, could
rightfully do the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Transcending,
however, the issue of whether there was mistake of fact on the part of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> or not, this Court could not see a valid cause
or consideration in favor of <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> De Leon having signed Exhibits ‘E’ to ‘E-2.’ For
even if petitioner Sylvia had confirmed Mr. <span class="SpellE">Penrod’s</span>
statement during the divorce proceedings in the United States that she would
undertake to eliminate her hereditary rights in the event of the property
settlement, under Philippine laws, such contract would likewise be <span class="SpellE">voidable</span>, for under Art. <span class="GramE">1347 of the New
Civil Code ‘no contract may be entered into upon future inheritance.’”</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not subscribe to the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
view of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Article 1335 of
the Civil Code provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“There is intimidation when one of the contracting parties is
compelled by a <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">reasonable and
well-grounded fear of an imminent and grave evil upon his person or property,
or upon the person or property of </span>his spouse, descendants or ascendants,
to give his consent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“To determine the degree of the intimidation, the age, sex and
condition of the person shall be borne in mind.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“A threat to enforce one’s claim through competent authority, <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">if the claim is just or legal, does not
vitiate consent.”<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">In
order that intimidation may vitiate consent and render the contract invalid,
the following requisites must concur:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>(1)
that the intimidation must <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">be the
determining </span>cause of the contract, or must have caused <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the consent to be given; (2) that the
threatened act be unjust or unlawful; </span>(3) that <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">the threat be real and serious, there being </span>an evident
disproportion between the evil and the resistance which all men can offer,
leading to the choice of the contract as the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">lesser evil; and (4) that it produces a reasonable and well-</span>grounded
fear from the fact that the person from whom it comes has the necessary means
or ability to inflict the threatened injury.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Applying the foregoing to the present case, the claim of <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> that Sylvia threatened her to bring Jose Vicente to
court for support, to scandalize their family by baseless suits and that Sylvia
would pardon Jose Vicente for possible crimes of adultery and/or <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span> subject <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">to
</span>the transfer of certain properties to her, is obviously not the
intimidation referred to by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With
respect to mistake as a vice of consent, neither is <span class="SpellE">Macaria’s</span>
alleged mistake in having signed the Letter-Agreement because of her belief
that Sylvia will thereby eliminate inheritance rights from her and Jose
Vicente, the mistake referred to in Article 1331 of the Civil Code, <u>supra</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not appear that the condition that
Sylvia “will eliminate her inheritance rights” principally moved <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span> to enter into the contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Rather, such condition was but an incident of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the consideration </span>thereof which,
as discussed earlier, is the termination of marital relations.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the ultimate analysis, therefore, both parties acted in
violation of the laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> rule,
expressed in the maxims “Ex <span class="SpellE">dolo</span> <span class="SpellE">malo</span>
non <span class="SpellE">oritur</span> <span class="SpellE">actio</span>” and “In <span class="SpellE">pari</span> <span class="SpellE">delicto</span> <span class="SpellE">potior</span>
<span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">conditio</span> <span class="SpellE">defendentis</span>,” which refuses remedy to either party to an
illegal agreement and leaves them where they are, does not apply in this
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Contrary to the ruling of the
respondent Court that (pp. 47-48, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>):<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[C]<span class="SpellE">onsequently</span>, <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> <span class="SpellE">appellees</span>’ obligation under the said agreement having been
annulled, the contracting parties shall restore to each other that things which
have been subject matter of the contract, their fruits and the price or its
interest, except as provided by law (Art. 1398, Civil Code).”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span class="GramE">Article 1414 of the
Civil Code, which is an exception to the <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> rule, is the proper law to be applied.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It provides:</p>

<blockquote>“When money is paid or property delivered for an illegal purpose,
the contract may be repudiated by one of the parties before the purpose has
been accomplished, or before any damage has been caused to a third person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In such case, the courts may, if the public
interest will thus be <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>, allow the party
repudiating the contract to recover the money or property.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Since the Letter-Agreement was repudiated before the purpose has
been accomplished and to adhere to the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pari</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> </span>rule in this case is
to put a premium to the circumvention of the laws, positive relief should be
granted to <span class="SpellE">Macaria</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Justice would be served by allowing her to be placed in the position in
which she was before the transaction was entered into.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the conclusions thus reached, <span class="GramE">We</span>
find it unnecessary to discuss the other issues raised.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>,<b> </b>the petition is hereby DENIED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The decision of the respondent Court of
