				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">It was the absence of any definite ruling at the time this
petition was filed on the question of whether or not a pending certification
election proceeding may be dismissed or held in abeyance, there being such a
motion on the part of the employer Juan S. Barrera, doing business under the
firm and trade name of Machinery and Steel Products Engineering (MASPE),
alleging an unfair labor practice against one of the contending parties,
private respondent MASPE Workers Union, the other being private respondent
Philippine Associated Workers Union, that led this Court to give it due course.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The unfair labor practice imputed to such
labor union consisted of failure to bargain collectively, aggravated by an
illegal strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court of
Industrial Relations denied such a motion to dismiss, stating that the grounds
therein alleged "appear not to be indubitable." A motion for
reconsideration having proved futile, this petition was filed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subsequently, to be precise, in 1973, in the
case of B. F. Goodrich Philippines, Inc. v. Goodrich (<span class="SpellE">Marikina</span>
Factory) Confidential and Salaried Employees Union-NATU,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
such a question was given an answer by this Court, one adverse to the claim of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This petition, therefore,
must be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case for petitioner was put most vigorously in the exhaustive
and scholarly brief of its counsel, Manuel M. <span class="SpellE">Crudo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To quote from its pertinent portion:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"On <st1:date year="1970" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1970</st1:date> the petitioner Barrera filed a motion
to dismiss or hold case in abeyance, in CIR Case No. 2759-MC.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said motion, we called attention to <span style="">the </span>admission of <span class="SpellE">Maspe</span>
Workers Union as <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We stated that the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>
union, its officers and members had committed various acts of <u><span style="">unfair labor practice</span></u><span style=""> </span>and were on <u><span style="">illegal strike</span></u><span style=""> </span>punctuated by <u>force</u>, <u><span style="">violence</span></u><span style=""> </span>and <u><span style="">intimidation</span></u><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>We
called attention to our<u> </u><u><span style="">formal
charge of unfair labor practice</span></u><span style="">
</span>against the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> union.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We called attention to the fact that in the
charge of unfair labor practice among the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
prayed for were to <u><span style="">declare
respondents therein collectively and individually guilty</span></u><span style=""> </span>of unfair labor practice; to declare
the strike, and other concerted actions resorted to in pursuance of said unfair
labor practice <u><span style="">illegal</span></u><span style="">; </span>to declare the <span class="SpellE">Maspe</span>
Workers Union as <u><span style="">consequently having
lost all rights and privileges accorded by law to a <span class="SpellE">legimate</span>
labor union</span></u><span style="">; </span>and to
declare all individual respondents therein and others as <u><span style="">having lost their employment status<span style="">&nbsp; </span>by virtue</span></u><span style=""> </span>of the illegality of the strike staged by them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We then pointed out that unless the case for
unfair labor practice against <span class="SpellE">Maspe</span> Workers Union,
its officers and members is decided the status of that union and its members
who are respondents would be <u><span style="">uncertain</span></u><span style=""> (i.e., </span>in relation to the requested
certification election and the outcome thereof). * * * Unfortunately, the
respondent Honorable Court of Industrial Relations denied our motion to dismiss
or hold case in abeyance. * * *."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
It remains only to be added that subsequently the Court of Industrial Relations
<u>en</u> <u><span style="">banc</span></u><span style=""> </span>denied a motion for reconsideration,
failing "to find sufficient justification to alter or to modify the
aforesaid Order."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">As set forth in the B. F. Goodrich
Philippines, Inc. decision:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"There
is novelty in the specific question raised, as to whether or not a
certification election may be stayed at the instance of the employer, pending
the determination of an unfair labor practice case filed by it against certain
employees affiliated with respondent-unions.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>That is a matter of which this Court has not had an opportunity to speak
on previously.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is settled law, dating
from the case of Standard Cigarette Workers' Union v. Court of Industrial Rela­tions,
decided in 1957, is that if it were a labor organization objecting to the
participation in a certification election of a company-dominated union, as a
result of which a complaint for an unfair labor practice case against the
employer was filed, the status of the latter union must be first cleared in
such a proceeding before such voting could take place."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

</span>"The unique situation before us, however, is exactly the
reverse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is management that would
have an unfair labor practice case filed by it for illegal strike engaged in by
some of its employees concluded, before it would agree to the holding of a
certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the
stand of petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It does not carry
conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason that justifies
the postponement of a certification election pending an inquiry, as to the </span><u><span style="">bona</span></u><span style=""> <u>fides</u> </span>of a labor union, precisely calls for a different
conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If under the circumstances
disclosed, management is allowed to have its way, the result might be to dilute
or fritter away the strength of an organization bent on a more zealous defense
of labor's prerogatives.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The difficul­ties
and obstacles that must be then hurdled would not be lost on the rest of the
personnel, who had not as yet made up their minds one way or the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say that management is to be
precluded from filing an unfair labor practice case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is merely to <span style="">stress </span>that such a suit should not be allowed to lend itself as a
means, whether intended or not, to prevent a truly free expression of the will
of the labor group <span style="">as to </span>the
organization that will represent it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is not only the loss of time involved, in itself not likely to enhance the
prospect of respondent-unions, but also <span style="">the
</span>fear engendered in the mind of an ordinary employee <span style="">that </span>management has many weapons in its
arsenal to bring <span style="">the </span>full force
of its undeniable power against those of its employees dissatisfied with things
as they are. <span style="">&nbsp;</span><span style="">There is no valid reason then for the postponement sought.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is one instance that calls for the
application of the maxim, <span class="SpellE"><u>lex</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>dilationes</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>semper</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>exhorret</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, is there not in the posture taken by petitioner a
contravention of what is expressly set forth in the Industrial Peace Act, which
speaks of the labor organizations 'designated </span>or <span style="">selected for the purpose of collective bargaining </span>by the <span style="">majority of the employees in an appropriate
collective bargaining unit [be the exclusive] representative of all the
employees in such unit for the purpose of collective bargaining.' The law
clearly contemplates all the employees, not only some of them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As much as possible then, there is to be no
unwarranted reduction in the number of those taking part in a certification
election, even under the guise that in the meanwhile, which may take some time,
some of those who are employees could possibly lose such status, by virtue of a
pending unfair labor practice case."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 0.55in; text-indent: -0.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">3.<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR">Even on the assumption that the
vigorous condemnation of the strike and the picketing were attended by
violence, it does not automatically follow that thereby the strikers in
question are no longer entitled to participate in the certification election
for having automatically lost their jobs.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>So it was made clear in another B.F. Goodrich decision:</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
"What was set forth in the facts as found by respondent Judge Salvador
would indicate that it was during the picketing, certainly not peaceful, that
the imputed acts of violence did occur. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>It cannot be ignored, however, that there <span style="">were </span>injuries on both sides because
management did not, understandably, play a passive role confronted as it was
with the unruly disruptive tactics of labor.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This is not, by any means, to condone activities of such character,
irrespective of the parties responsible.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is merely to explain what cannot be justified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, did the acts in question call
for an automatic finding of illegality?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Again, the order issued on <st1:date year="1972" day="4" month="2">February
 4, 1972</st1:date> appeared to be oblivious of a 1971 decision of this Court,
Shell Oil Workers' <st1:place>Union</st1:place> v. Shell Company of the
Philippines, Ltd.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There it was clearly
held:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'A strike otherwise valid, if
violent in character, may be placed beyond the pale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Care is to be taken, however, especially
where an unfair labor practice is involved, to avoid stamping it with
illegality just because it is tainted by such acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To avoid rendering illusory the recognition
of the right to strike, responsibility in such a case should be individual and
not collective.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A different conclusion
would be called for, of course, if the existence of force while the strike
lasts is pervasive and widespread, consistently and deliberately resorted to as
a matter of policy.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could be
reasonably concluded then that even if justified as to ends, it becomes illegal
because of the means employed.' It must be pointed out likewise that the facts
as there found would seem to indicate a greater degree of violence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'<st1:street><st1:address>Respondent Court</st1:address></st1:street>
must have been unduly impressed by the evidence submitted by the Shell Company
to the effect that the strike was marred by acts of force, intimidation and
violence on the evening of June 14 and twice in the mornings of June 15 and 16,
1967 in <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Attention was likewise called to the fact
that even on the following day, with police officials stationed at the
strike-bound area, <span class="SpellE">molotov</span> bombs did explode and the
streets were obstructed with wooden planks containing protruding nails.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, in the branches of the Shell
Company in <st1:place><st1:placename>Iloilo</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
as well as in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
on dates unspecified, physical injuries appeared to have been inflicted on
management personnel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Court
in the appealed decision did penalize with loss of employment the ten
individuals responsible for such acts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Nor is it to be lost sight of that before the certification on June 27,
1967, one month had elapsed during which the Union was on strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Except on those few days specified then, the
Shell Company could not allege that the strike w<span style="">as </span>conducted in a manner other than peaceful.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, it would be going
too far to consider that it thereby became illegal.' Then, mention was made of
a decision 'in Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Employees' Association v. Insular Life Assurance Co., Ltd. [where] there
is the recognition by this Court, speaking through Justice Castro, of picketing
as such being "inherently explosive." It is thus clear that not every
form of violence suffices to affix the seal of illegality on a strike or to
cause the loss of employment by the guilty party.' "<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>
