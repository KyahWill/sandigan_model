of the judgment of the Court of Appeals promulgated on </span><st1:date year="1967" day="2" month="12"><span style="">December
 2, 1967</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Before the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court of First Instance, in Civil Case No. 3198-M (<span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Case), which was an action between members of the
same family for partition of war damage payments received from the United
States Government, judgment by default was rendered on September 9, 1966 in
favor of petitioners herein, </span><span style="">as
the </span>plaintiffs in the said case, and against private respondent <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and his
father-in-law, <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>,
jointly and severally, as defendants therein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Judgment having become final, the corresponding Writ of Execution was
issued and the properties <span style="">of private
respondent were levied upon and scheduled for sale at public auction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent resorted to an action for annulment of
judgment and of Writ of Execution before the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> in Civil Case No. 275
(Annulment Suit) against petitioners and the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> Provincial Sheriff, as defendants, upon the main
contention that judgment in the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Case was
procured by means of extrinsic fraud committed by petitioner Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> against private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Essentially, the extrinsic fraud allegedly
consisted in assurances made by Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> to
private respondent during a confrontation between them that it was never the
intention of petitioners to involve private respondent in the suit and that he
would be excluded <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Convinced, private respondent was lured into
inaction only to discover later that judgment was rendered against him and
execution against his properties ordered.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Private respondent also prayed for a Writ of Preliminary Injunction to
restrain the enforcement of the judgment and of the Writ of Exe足cution pending
the determination of the Annulment Suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners moved to dismiss the Annulment Suit and opposed the
Injunction on the principal ground that the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>
had no jurisdiction to interfere by Injunction and to nullify a final judg足ment
of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>,
which is a Tribunal of concurrent and coordinate jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In deferring determination of said Motion,
respondent Judge ruled <span style="">that the matters
alleged in the Complaint are reflective of extrinsic fraud "which, if
true, would evince the nullity of the Decision under litigation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are "too evidentiary which could be
resolved by the Court after having allowed both parties to adduce their
respective evidence pertinent to this contentious issue." Respondent Judge
granted the Injunction prayed for upon the filing of a bond of P1,000.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In petitioners' Motion for the reconsideration of the aforesaid Order,
they averred that "there is no necessity of reception of evidence to prove
the allegations of the complaint in order to resolve the defendants' motion to
dismiss because the ground of the said motion to dismiss which is lack of
jurisdiction assumes <span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> the truth of the said
allegations; and under said assumption, it is the defendant's stand that the
Court has no jurisdiction <span style="">to </span>review,
much less set aside, the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
decision"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Reconsideration<span style=""> </span><span style="">was </span>denied by respondent trial Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The Court of Appeals, in <i>Certiorari</i>
and Prohibition proceedings thereafter filed before it by petitioners, upheld
the jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
Court, stating:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ultimate facts which, if substantiated, could probably constitute extrinsic
fraud (<i>Vide</i>: II Moran, Comments on the Rules of Court, 1963 ed., p. 230,
and cases cited).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It follows that the
propriety of the action for annulment aforesaid and the competence of the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> court to take
cognizance thereof must be conceded. x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners assail the
foregoing conclusion and contend:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">I<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The respondent Court of Appeals erred in disposing of case CA-G.R.
No. 39715-R and dismissing the petitioners' petition on the basis of a legal
point which was not in issue before it because the legal proposi足tion that a
court of first instance may set aside the judgment of another court of first
instance on the ground of extrinsic fraud in the procurement of the said
judgment is admitted all along by the petitioners.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">II</p>

<blockquote>The respondent Court of Appeals erred in not holding that the
allegations of the complaint in Civil Case No. 275, having been hypothetically
admitted in the motion to dismiss, a hearing on the merits in order to prove
the said allegations is not necessary for the purpose of resolving the said
motion to dismiss.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">III</p>

stated in another way, do not state a cause of action as to justify the

annul the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judg足ment of the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> in Civil </span>Case No.
3198-M.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the foregoing
bereft of merit.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In regards to the first
assignment of error, although petitioners now admit that if, indeed, there was
extrinsic fraud, the judgment of the <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court
can be set aside by the <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
Court, the record shows that before the Appellate Court they had argued
"that the respondent Judge has no jurisdiction to interfere with, much
less annul, the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> decision of x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> because they have co-equal and concurrent
jurisdiction".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To prevent further
discussion on that point, we wish to state that the authority of a Court of
First Instance to take cognizance of a suit to annul a final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> Decision rendered by another Court of First
Instance is beyond doubt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was the
doctrine enunciated in <span class="SpellE">Dulap</span> et al. vs. Court of
Appeals, et al.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> wherein it was held that since the cause of
action in an annulment suit is entirely different from the action which gave
rise to the judgment sought to be annulled, a direct attack against it being
the main object of such proceeding, there is no plausible reason, why the venue
of the action to annul the judgment should necessarily </span>follow the venue
of the previous action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This ruling was
reiterated in the subsequent cases of <span class="SpellE">Gianan</span> vs.
Imperial, et al.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>

The con足clusion follows that, as admitted even by the petitioners, the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street>
has the power to annul the judgment of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street> if, as alleged,
extrinsic fraud attended the procurement of the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">We will now discuss the third error assigned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The issue raised is whether the allegations
in the Complaint filed before the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
  <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> Court</st1:address></st1:street> constitute <span style="">extrinsic fraud as to justify said Court in

</span><st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE"><span style="">Bulacan</span></span><span style=""> Court</span></st1:address></st1:street><span style=""> and to enjoin the exe足cution thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

No. 3198-M, accompanied by a motion to admit the same, bearing the date of
September 1, 1965; and in said amended complaint, the defendants as plaintiffs
therein included the plaintiff herein, Dr. <span class="SpellE">Donato</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>, as a co-defendant; and the defendants herein
alleged in their amended complaint that <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> is the father-in-law of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>,
which is true; and that they were living together in the same house in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sto</span>. <span class="SpellE">Cristo</span>, San Antonio, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>, which is not true,
because Dr. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> lived and is still living in his
own house in Barrio San <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>, San Isidro, <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>; defendants also
alleged in their amended complaint <span style="">that
plaintiff Dr. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> conspired with his
father-in-law <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
to defraud the defendants by having the war damage check indorsed to him and
then depositing it in his own savings account with the Philippine National Bank
on October 13, 1964, which is not true, because said check was not indorsed to
the plaintiff herein and plaintiff had not deposited it in his own savings
account, as in fact he had not and has not opened any savings account with the
Philippine National Bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants
prayed in their amended complaint that plaintiff Dr. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
be held <span class="SpellE">solidarily</span> liable with <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span>
<span class="SpellE">Magno</span> for the claims stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A true copy of said amended complaint,

plaintiff Dr. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span> and his wife, who is a carnal
niece of defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, learned of his
inclusion as co-defendant in the amended complaint <span style="">in Civil Case No. 3198-M, plaintiff and his wife sought defendant
Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> and remonstrated with him, asking him
why plaintiff should be involved in said case when he had nothing to do with it
except to identify his father-in-law before Mr. <span class="SpellE">Corrado</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sevilla</span> who in turn identified him with the
Philippine National Bank for the purpose of collecting the war damage check;
and on that occasion defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>
assured the plaintiff and more especially Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Vergara</span>
who is Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno's</span> carnal niece that it was
never his intention to involve the plaintiff in the case or to require him to
pay any amount claimed therein; and that plaintiff's inclusion as co-defendant
of his father-in-law must have been the thought of defendants' lawyers, because
the plaintiff had signed on the check in question; and on that occasion
defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> <span class="SpellE">unequivocably</span>
told plaintiff and his wife not to worry or be bothered with his inclusion in
the case, and not to mind it, and assured them that he would take care that plaintiff
was taken out of the case and was not prejudiced.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>(8)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With said assurances
of defendant Francisco <span class="SpellE">Magno</span>, which plaintiff and his
wife believed in good faith, they paid no more attention to the case, nor
followed its developments, nor paid any attorney's fee to the lawyer defending <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> to defend herein
plaintiff in said case."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Additionally, private

<blockquote>"(12)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although the
records of Civil Case No. 3198-M show that Atty. Pablo received notice of the
pre-trial, plaintiff was never informed of the same; and because of plaintiff's
absence during the taking of defendants' evidence, the Court was misled into
holding in its decision that <span class="SpellE">Meliton</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> indorsed the war damage check to <span style="">the plaintiff and that the plaintiff then
deposited the check in his account with the Philippine National Bank, which is
not true, as has already been stated.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court was also misled to make the finding that plaintiff acted with
gross bad faith in depositing the war damage money in his account with the
Philippine National Bank, which as has already been stated is not true."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We </span><span style="">agree with the Court of Appeals that the

Craddock and <span class="SpellE">Stotts</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He had a right to assume from his version of their conversation that the
case would not be taken up without notifying him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It appears that he thought that the court had
no jurisdiction because an attempt was made to foreclose in the same action a
mortgage on real estate which was situated in another district in the same
county.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He says it was understood that
he should be notified when the case was to be taken up, and did not appear at
the adjourned term because no depositions had been taken by either party, and
he relied upon his understanding that the case would not be taken up without
notice to him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He stated that Craddock
was only present during a part of the conversation that he had with Judge
Walker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Walker was not a witness
in the case, and there is nothing to contradict the testimony of Baker.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is true Craddock contradicted his
testimony in regard to some other matters which occurred during the
conversation, but we do not think there is any contradiction of Baker's
testimony with regard to the postponement of the trial.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no negligence on his part in
placing reliance upon the statements made to him, and, while we do not think
that any fraud was intended to be practiced upon Montague, <i>the result was
that Montague was deprived of his right to appear and defend the action and
