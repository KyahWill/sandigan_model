another <span style="">certificate </span><span style="">of </span>candidacy wherein he <span style="">indicated </span>that he was nominated by the

a letter withdrawing his certificate of candidacy under the banner of the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> said that his first certificate of candidacy was a
mistake since he was actually running as a KBL candidate (p. 44, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="8" month="1">January 8, 1980</st1:date>,
Ernesto T. <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> wrote a letter informing the
provincial election registrar at <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laoag</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place> that Rodolfo C. <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> headed the KBL ticket for the elective positions in
<st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laoag</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
(p 43, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Rollo</span></span><span style="">).<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>On
<st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1980</st1:date>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Laoag</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
was declared a free zone as far as the KBL was concerned.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of those two certificates of candidacy of <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>, Antonio F. <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, the
other KBL candidate for mayor, filed with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
on <st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1980</st1:date> a
petition to disqualify <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A copy of the petition was served upon <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He answered
it on <st1:date year="1980" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1980</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His answer was not verified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was heard the next day, Saturday, at
<st1:time minute="0" hour="16">four o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No oral evidence was received.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties submitted as exhibits the annexes
to their pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in its brief Resolution No.
8547 in PDC No. 158 dated January 28, 1980 (two days before the election and
the very day when <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> submitted his verified
answer to replace the unverified answer which he had previously filed) held
that <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>' candidacy should not be given due
course because of <span class="SpellE">turncoatism</span> and "for engaging
in partisan political activities before the campaign period" (See <span style="">Presidential Decrees </span>Nos. 1296 and
1661).</p>

<p class="BODY">The next day, January 29, <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> filed
in this Court a petition for <i>certiorari</i> wherein he assailed that <span style="">resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="">A
restraining order was immediately issued to stop its enforcement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>
remained as a KBL candidate.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In spite of the disqualification resolution, which was made known
to the voters, <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> won the election by a margin
of 6,419 votes over <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> was
proclaimed on February 6 as the duly elected mayor after the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> had lifted its order suspending the proclamation
(p. 69, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">Theorizing that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in allowing
his <span class="GramE">proclamation,</span> had tacitly acknowledged that he was
qualified for the position of mayor, <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> on <st1:date year="1980" day="13" month="2">February 13, 1980</st1:date> filed a motion to
withdraw his instant petition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He said
that it had become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, through the Solicitor
General, manifested that this case was not rendered moot by the proclamation of
<span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> (p. 178, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> was
also of the same opinion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> called the Court's attention to the fact that <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span> in his petition of <st1:date year="1980" day="5" month="2">February 5, 1980</st1:date> to stop the pro­clamation of <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span> alleged that this case would be rendered moot by
that proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold that this case should be returned to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> with the directive that, in the light of
supervening events, it should hold another hearing on <span class="SpellE">Lazo's</span>
petition to disqualify <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The previous hearing
before lawyer <span class="SpellE">Horacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Apostol</span>
</span>of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> was summary in character and
was not adequate to cover the factual issues involved in the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The parties had no chance to file
memoranda.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Due to the numerous pending
disqualification cases and the nearness of the election, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did not have ample time and opportunity to receive
evidence in this case and to deliberate thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its abbreviated resolution is an indication
that the case had not been thoroughly threshed out.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is some basis for <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>'
observation that the said resolution was a "<st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>
disqualification resolution" and that he was denied due process (See <span class="SpellE">Potencion</span> vs. Commission on Elections, G. R. No. 52527,
September 4, 1980 and cases cited therein.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
resolution of <st1:date year="1980" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1980</st1:date>,
disqualifying <span class="SpellE">Fariñas</span>, is set aside.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> is
directed to set anew for hearing the disqualification petition of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lazo</span>, to receive the evidence of the parties and to render
another decision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No costs.</p>
