				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Private respondents Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Recio</span> filed a
complaint dated October 31, 1973 in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> against petitioners <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, Elizabeth <span class="SpellE">Maclean</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Zenaida</span> <span class="SpellE">Maclean</span>,
represented by their mother, <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, Josefina de Guzman (assisted by her husband
Rafael de Guzman) and Johnny Lara on two principal causes of action, the first,
for the annulment of a deed of sale of a parcel of land and the improvements
thereon located in <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>;
and the second, to annul two deeds of sale of certificates of stocks, or for
the recovery of the value thereof. They further prayed for the recovery of
moral and exemplary damages, attorney's fees and costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">The herein petitioners filed their answer to the said complaint
traversing the material allegations thereof and interposing a counterclaim. Subsequently,
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
filed a supplemental counterclaim against private respondents, and a
third-party complaint against the Security Bank and Trust Company praying that
she and her brother, Antonio de Guzman, be declared joint owners of 2/3 of the
proceeds <span class="GramE">of</span> Banker's Acceptance Certificate No. 3355
and the interest thereon, which is in the possession and custody of the
third-party defendant bank. Both the supplemental counterclaim and third-party
complaint were admitted by the respondent trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the filing of the aforementioned pleadings, private
respondent Cristina C. Recto, on <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="5">May
 16, 1975</st1:date>, filed a motion for par­tial summary judgment on the first
and second causes of action alleged in the complaint. Attached to the said
motion are affidavits of both private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1975</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Recios</span> filed another motion to order the Security
Bank and Trust Company to pay the aforementioned Banker's Acceptance
Certificate No. 3355 to private respondent Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span>.
The said motion was granted by the respondent trial court then presided by
Judge <span class="SpellE">Nicanor</span> S. <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> (now
deceased) in an order dated June 3, 1975, which directed the Security Bank and
Trust Company to pay the full amount of the said certificate to private
respondent Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span> upon the filing of a
bond in the amount of P170<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="30" month="5">May 30, 1975</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed a motion for the inhibition of Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
on the ground that he was supposed to reach the compulsory retirement age of 70
years on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1975</st1:date>. <span class="GramE">(Original Record, Vol. II, p. 419.)</span> The record does not show
any resolution of said motion for inhibition. It appears, however, that even
after the said motion for inhibition was filed, Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
continued to act on the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1975</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed their opposition to the motion for partial summary
judgment. On <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="6">June 4, 1975</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> resolved the said motion by rendering a
"Judgment", the dispositive portion of which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Under</span> the first
cause of action, annulling the deed of sale Annex 'A' as well as Transfer

C. <span class="SpellE">Recio's</span> name;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the second cause of action, annulling

the corresponding corporation to cancel the stock certificates in the aforesaid
de­fendants' names and issue new ones in lieu thereof to plaintiff Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio's</span> name and to deliver to, and/or transfer to the name
of, plaintiffs all of their fruits, be they stock or cash dividends;</blockquote>

fair market value of the properties sold or disposed of at the time of such
sale or disposition, which in any case should not be lower than P350,000.00 for
the house and lot, and P1,000,000.00 for the shares of stock, together with the
reimbursement of the value of the fruits thereof, be they stock or cash
dividends;</blockquote>

plaintiffs jointly and severally attorney's fees in the amount of P25<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> issued two other orders in
the case dated June 4 and 5, 1975. <span class="GramE">(Original Record, Vol. II,
pp. 436, 468, 469.)</span> He subsequently resolved on <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1975</st1:date> a motion to raffle the case to
another branch of the court filed by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Roque</span>
<span class="SpellE">Recio</span> on <st1:date year="1975" day="4" month="6">June
 4, 1975</st1:date>, on the ground that Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span>
"will soon retire." <span class="GramE">(<u>Ibid</u>., p. 442.)</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A copy of the partial summary judgment was served on the
petitioners on <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 7, 1975 (the last day of the period of appeal, July 6,
1975 being a Sunday), petitioners filed an omnibus motion for a reconsideration
of the summary judgment, the order of June 3, 1975 and two orders both dated
June 5, 1975. An opposition to the said omnibus motion was filed by the private
respondents on <st1:date year="1975" day="2" month="9">September 2, 1975</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The omnibus motion for reconsideration was denied by the trial
court in an order dated <st1:date year="1975" day="29" month="12">December 29,
 1975</st1:date> issued by the then Judge (later Justice) <span class="SpellE">Onofre</span>
<span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span>. The petitioners received a copy of the
order of denial on <st1:date year="1976" day="5" month="1">January 5, 1976</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, or on January 6, 1976, the petitioners filed
their notice of appeal, a cash appeal bond, and a motion for extension of time
to file the record on appeal for a period of not less than thirty days from
said date. Private respondents filed their opposition to the said motion for
extension of time to file record on appeal on the ground that the petitioners'
omnibus motion for reconsideration was filed after <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1975</st1:date>. They countered with their own motion for the
execution of the summary judgment rendered by the trial court. Judge <span class="SpellE">Villaluz</span> set the motion for extension of time to file the
record on appeal for hearing on January 13 and 16, 1976, at which hearing the
parties adduced both oral and documentary evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 24, 1976, the trial court, then presided by Judge Nelly L.
Romero <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span>, issued an order denying the motion
of petitioners for extension of time to file record on appeal, and granting the
motion of private respondents for the execution of the summary judgment for the
reason that the said omnibus motion for reconsideration was not filed on July
7, 1975. On <st1:date year="1976" day="31" month="5">May 31, 1976</st1:date>,
on motion of the private respondents, Judge <span class="SpellE">Valdellon</span>
appointed respondent Sheriff Rene Salvador and respon­dent Bailiff <span class="SpellE">Eustaquio</span> <span class="SpellE">Parada</span> as Special
Sheriffs to enforce the writ of execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1976" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1976</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed two separate petitions in the former Court of Appeals for
<i>mandamus</i>, <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition with preliminary injunction,
docketed in said Court as CA-G.R. Nos. <span class="GramE">SP-05555 and SP-05618.</span>
In a decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1977" day="20" month="9">September
 20, 1977</st1:date>, the former 8th Division of the Court of <span class="GramE">Appeals,</span> dismissed both petitions.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Acting on a motion for reconsideration filed by the petitioners on <st1:date year="1977" day="27" month="9">Septem­ber 27, 1977</st1:date>, a division of
five denied the motion for reconsideration in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1978</st1:date>.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The instant petition was filed in the Supreme Court to review the
aforementioned decision of the Court of Appeals and the resolu­tion denying a
reconsideration of the same. The petition was given due course after the
respondents filed their comment to the same. The parties were required to
submit <span class="GramE">simultaneous memoranda which was</span> duly complied
with.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners have raised the following issues:</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent courts committed a grave abuse of discretion (1)
in holding that the omnibus motion for reconsideration was not filed on July 7,
1975; (2) in ruling that a motion for reconsideration is essential before a
petition for <i>certiorari</i> could be instituted; (3) in issuing the order of
June 3, 1975 ordering the Security Bank and Trust Company to pay the full
amount of P250,000.00 under Security Bank and Trust Company Banker's Acceptance
Certificate No. 3355 to pri­vate respondent Cristina C. Recto on a mere motion
and without any hearing; and (4) in rendering a summary judgment despite the
fact that controversial issues of facts are raised and disputed by the par­ties
in their respective pleadings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The questioned decision of the respondent Court of Appeals
resolved the petitions filed in said court only on what it called the two vital
issues of the case, namely: (a) Whether or not the omnibus motion for
reconsideration was filed on July 7, 1975; and (b) Whether the petitioners'
failure to file a motion for reconsideration of the ques­tioned orders of the
trial court was fatal. There was no discussion at all on the question of
whether or not the partial summary judgment was validly rendered, <span class="GramE">nor</span> on the validity of the questioned order of <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1975</st1:date> regarding the payment of
the proceeds of the Banker's Acceptance Certificate. The concentration of the
dissertation made by the trial court, the Court of Appeals and in the several
motions and memoranda of the private respondents was on the alleged lateness of
the filing of the omnibus motion for reconsideration which caused the summary
judgment to have become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is conceded that if the omnibus motion for reconsideration
was, indeed, filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1975</st1:date>
as averred by the petitioners, it was filed on time, and it would then be
improper for the trial court to rule that the said summary judgment had already
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>. As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>,
the trial court required the presentation of evidence on this question and, on
the basis of the evidence <span class="GramE">adduced,</span> it ruled that the
omnibus motion for reconsideration was not filed on <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1975</st1:date>. The Court of Appeals merely
confirmed the said findings by adopting the same <span class="SpellE"><u>ipsisimis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>verbis</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">After a careful examination of the record.</span>
We are frankly amazed at how the lower courts have arrived at said conclusion. In
attempting to show that the omnibus motion for reconsideration was not filed on
July 7, 1975, private respondents relied almost exclusively on the testimony of
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Recio</span>
who declared that no motion for reconsideration was filed up to the close of
office hours on July 7, 1975, as attested to by a certification issued by
Marcelo Buenaventura, Special Deputy Clerk of Court, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"'TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:</blockquote>

<blockquote>This is to certify that according to the entry book of this Office,
no motion for reconsideration of the decision or notice of appeal has been filed

<p class="BODY">The above testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE">Varinuevo</span>, Maria Antonio and Marcelo Buenaventura all
tended to show that the certification issued by Buenaventura to the effect that
no motion for reconsideration was filed as of July 7, 1975 were merely to
attest to the fact that no such motion was listed in the Entry Book of the
Office of the Clerk of Court on said date. The actual filing of the motion
before the close of office hours on July 7, 1975 had been categorically
testified to by <span class="SpellE">Amparo</span> <span class="SpellE">Varinuevo</span>
and Maria Antonio. They further explained the reason why, des­pite such filing,
no entry of the same was made in the Entry Book until the following day. Buenaventura
himself made it clear in his testimony that his certification was based alone
from what appeared in the Entry Book. The failure to enter the motion in
whatever book the same is to be registered does not necessarily mean that the
motion was not filed at all. What the rule requires is the filing of the motion
within the proper time; not the actual entry thereof which is merely a matter
of practice and a pure physical act on the part of the employee charged with
such duty. There is no rule requiring entry of such motion, much less to enter
the same on the same date it was filed.</p>

<p class="BODY">We are accordingly of the view that the lower courts committed
palpable error in arriving at the conclusion that the petitioners failed to
file their omnibus motion for reconsideration on July 7, 1975. In the face of
the overwhelming evidence presented by the petitioners to sustain such fact,
the lower courts preferred to believe the testimony of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Roque</span> <span class="SpellE">Recio</span> whose bias is
undeniable, being a party-in-interest, and who could only declare negatively
that the omnibus motion was not filed until up to the close of office hours on <st1:date year="1975" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1975</st1:date>. The lower courts
discredited the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Varinuevo</span> and Antonio,
as well as of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Galapon</span>, for alleged
inconsistencies as to the exact time of the filing of the omnibus motion and as
to whether the same was inserted in the Entry Book or in the Rush Book being
kept by Antonio. Capital was made of the circumstance that the hour of filing
was not indicated in the rubber stamp showing the date of filing, as required
by Section 1, Rule 13 of the Rules of Court, as if such circumstance would
negate the fact of filing. This glaring <span class="SpellE">misappreciation</span>
of the evidence may not be justified on the stereotype excuse that findings of
the lower courts may not be disturbed on appeal, as if such a doctrine is
absolute and inviolable to the extent of being a shield against the search of
truth and a weapon for the perpetration of injustice.</p>

<p class="BODY">Another intriguing aspect of this case is the total disregard by
the lower courts of the issue regarding the propriety of the summary judgment
rendered by the trial court. This issue was raised by the petitioners in their
omnibus motion for reconsideration (Original Record, Vol. II, pp. 477, 481), as
well as in the opposition of the private respondents to the same. <span class="GramE">(<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 514, 521.)</span> It was likewise raised in the
respondent Court of Appeals, as well as in the instant petition. Strangely, the
Court of Appeals passed on said issue <u>sub</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>silencio</u></span>,
and limited its discussion to the question of whether or not the omnibus motion
for reconsideration was filed on July 7, 1975. The private respondents now
contend that the validity of the summary judgment may no longer be touched upon
in the instant proceedings, inasmuch as said judgment had already become final
and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and may now be considered as "the
law of the case." <span class="GramE">(Memo­randum of respondents, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 90-93.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 34 of the Rules of Court authorizes the rendition of a
summary judgment when, on motion of the plaintiff after the answer to the
complaint had been filed, it would appear, during the hearing of the motion for
such a judgment, from the pleadings, depositions and admissions on file,
together with the affidavits that, except as to the amount of damages,
"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the winning
party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law." (Section 3, Rule 34,
Rules of Court.) Conversely, the rendition of summary judgment is not justified
when the defending party tenders vital issues which call for the presentation
of evidence. (<u>Villanueva vs. National Marketing Corporation</u>, 28 SCRA
729.) As was observed in the <span class="SpellE"><u>Viajar</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Estenzo</span>,</u> 89 SCRA 684:</p>

<blockquote>"Relief by summary judgment is intended to expedite or
promptly dispose of cases where the facts appear undisputed and certain from
the pleadings, depositions, admissions and affidavits. But if there be a doubt
as to such facts and there be an issue or issues of fact joined by the parties,
neither one of them can pray for a summary judgment. Where the facts pleaded by
the parties are disputed or contested, proceedings for a summary judgment
cannot take the place of a trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>An examination of the Rules will readily show that a summary
judgment is by no means a hasty one. It assumes a scrutiny of facts in a
summary hearing after the filing of a motion for summary judgment by one party
supported by affidavits, depositions, admissions, or other documents, with
notice upon the adverse party who may file an opposition to the motion
supported also by affidavits, depositions, or other documents (Section 3, Rule
34). In spite of its expediting character, relief by summary judgment can only
be allowed after compliance with the minimum requirement of vigilance by the
court in a summary hearing considering that this re­medy is in derogation of a
party's right to a plenary trial of his case. At any rate, a party who moves
for summary judgment has the burden of demonstrating clearly the absence of any
genuine issue of fact, or that the issue posed in the complaint is so patently
unsubstantial as not to <span class="SpellE">consitute</span> a genuine issue for
trial, and any doubt as to the existence of such an issue is resolved against the
<span class="SpellE">movant</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar may not, even by the most liberal or strained
interpretation, be considered as one not involving genuine issues which need
the presentation of evidence to determine which of two conflicting assertions
of fact is correct. A cursory examination of the pleadings will show that the
private respondents' causes of action are to annul documents of sale which were
allegedly executed by private respondent Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span>
on the ground of fraud, deceit, misrepresentation and due influence and
intimidation. These allegations were all denied in the answer filed by the
petitioners. <span class="GramE">The issue thus raised may not be categorized as
not genuine so as to dispense with a formal trial and to authorize the
rendition of summary judgment.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">The invalidity of the summary judgment rendered by the trial
court stems not only from the circumstance that such a kind of judgment is not
proper under the state of the pleadings filed in the case, but also from the
failure to comply with the procedural guidelines for the rendition of such a
judgment. The motion does not contain a notice of hearing. After the private
respondents filed a motion to set the private respondents' supplemental
counterclaim for hearing on <st1:date year="1975" day="22" month="5">May 22,
 1975</st1:date>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> scheduled the said motion
for hearing on <st1:date year="1975" day="28" month="5">May 28, 1975</st1:date>
"to coincide with the hearing of the motion for partial summary judgment
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1975</st1:date> filed by
the plaintiffs set for hearing on the same date." Attys. Ferry and <span class="SpellE">Galapon</span>, counsels for the herein petitioners, were served
with the said order of Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> on May 25, 1975
and May 24, 1975, respectively, or only four and five days, respectively,
before the date of the hearing. This is contrary to the requirement under
Section 3 of Rule 34 that a motion for summary judgment "shall be served
at least ten days before the time specified for the hearing." The minutes
of the hearing held on May 28, 1975 show that the counsel for the herein
petitioners prayed that they be given up to June 3, 1975 within which to file
appropriate pleadings, after which the motion for summary judgment shall be
deemed submitted for resolution. <span class="GramE">(Original Record, Vol. II,
p. 412.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1975</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed their opposition to the motion for partial summary
judgment contending principally that such a kind of judgment may not be
rendered in the case inasmuch as their answer tenders genuine issues which need
a trial on the merits. <span class="GramE">(<u>Ibid</u>., pp. 438-441.)</span> No
counter-affidavits were filed by the petitioners but in their aforementioned
opposition, they argued why a summary judgment is not proper in the case. On
June 4, 1975, the day following the filing of the opposition to the motion for
summary judgment, the court rendered its summary judgment in the case, which
granted not only the relief prayed for in the private respondents' first and
second causes of action but also an award of damages which is not even prayed
for in any of the said causes of action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">As earlier observed, the burden of the
discussion in this case centered on the timeliness of the filing of the omnibus
motion for reconsideration of the said summary judgment.</span> Viewing this
issue from another angle, it may rightly be said that such elaborate and
elongated argumentation on this question is hardly material to resolve the
issue at bar. Both parties appear to have assumed the correctness of the pro­position
that the summary judgment in question was <span class="SpellE">appealable</span>;
hence, their dispute as to whether or not the period of appeal had lapsed or
not by the time the motion for the reconsideration of the decision was filed. We
consider this assumption to be erroneous.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be noted that the judgment in question is a "<u>partial</u>
summary judgment." It was rendered only with respect to the private respondents'
first and second causes of action alleged in their complaint. It was not
intended to cover the other prayers in the said complaint, nor the
supplementary counterclaim filed by the petitioners against the private
respondents, nor the third-party complaint filed by the petitioners against the
Security Bank and Trust Company. A partial summary judgment "is not a
final or <span class="SpellE">appealable</span> judgment." <span class="GramE">(Moran, Vol. 2, 1970 Edition, p. 189, citing several cases.)</span>
"It is merely a pre-trial adjudication that said issues in the case shall
be deemed established for the trial of the case." <span class="GramE">(Francisco,
Rules of Court, Vol. II, p. 429.)</span> The nature of a partial summary
judgment is expressly provided for in Section 4 of Rule 34 of the Rules of
Court, which reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 4.</span> <u>Cases not fully
adjudicated on motion</u>. - If on motion under this rule, judgment is not
rendered upon the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial is
necessary, the court at the hearing of the motion, by examining the pleadings
and the evidence before it and by interrogating counsel shall ascertain what
material facts exist without substantial controversy and what material facts
are actually and in good faith <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>. It shall
thereupon make an order specifying the facts that appear without substantial
controversy, including the extent to which the amount of damages or other
relief is not in controversy, and directing such further proceedings in the
action as are just. Upon the trial of the action the facts so specified shall
be deemed established, and the trial shall be conducted accordingly.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The partial summary judgment rendered by the trial court being
merely interlocutory and not a final judgment, it is puerile to dis­cuss
whether the same became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> due to
the alleged failure to appeal said judgment within the supposed period of <span class="SpellE">of</span> appeal. What the rules contemplate is that the appeal
from the partial summary judgment shall be taken together with the judgment
that may be rendered in the entire case after a trial is conducted on the
material facts on which a substantial controversy exists. This is on the
assumption that the partial summary judgment was validly rendered which, as
shown above, is not true in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above discussion renders it unnecessary to resolve the issue
of whether the two separate petitions for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition and <i>mandamus</i>
filed by the petitioners in the former Court of Appeals should have been
dismissed for the reason that the petitioners did not file a motion for the
reconsideration of the judgment and orders therein sought to be annulled. Moreover,
the circumstances obtaining in this case, particularly the fact that the trial
court had already ordered the execution of the partial summary judgment and the
questioned orders of the trial court, necessitated the recourse to the urgent
remedy pursued by the petitioners. The situation easily falls under one of the
recognized exceptions to the rule that a motion for reconsideration should
first be availed of before filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition
and <i>mandamus</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We also deem it unnecessary to discuss, in this instance, the
validity of the questioned order of June 3, 1975 which ordered the Security
Bank and Trust Company to pay the full amount of P250,000.00 of Banker's
Acceptance Certificate No. 3355 to private respondent Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span> upon the filing of a bond in the amount of
P170,000.00. It appears that the motion of private respondent Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span> praying for such relief was duly served on
petitioners five days before the date was set for hearing, in which the
petitioners' appeared but failed to file any opposition. In any event, it
further appears that the giving of the proceeds of the said Banker's Acceptance
Certificate No. 3355 was not an adjudication of the ownership thereof in favor
of private respondent Cristina C. <span class="SpellE">Recio</span>. Her
ownership of the said sum was provisional and conditioned upon the filing of a
bond in the amount of P170<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> which is more than
the value of the 2/3 share of the said Banker's Acceptance Certificate No. 3355
claimed by petitioners <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>
and her brother, Antonio de Guzman. The bond expressly stipulates that it is
conditioned to answer for whatever damages that the Security Bank and Trust
Company or any of the petitioners may suffer "in the event that said
Cristina <span class="SpellE">Recio</span> is declared not entitled to the said
amount in the instant case or any other case."</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be said, therefore, that the questioned order of <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1975</st1:date> was <span class="GramE">an
adjudication</span> of the supplemental counterclaim filed by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span>, nor of the
third-party complaint filed by her against the Security Bank and Trust Company.
As already mentioned above, the partial summary judgment rendered by the trial
court did not include such claims which still remain pending and unresolved. Petitioner
<span class="SpellE">Rizalina</span> <span class="SpellE">Guevarra</span> may
properly seek to set aside or modify the said order of <st1:date year="1975" day="3" month="6">June 3, 1975</st1:date> in the trial court taking cognizance
of Civil Case No. 18522.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> judgment is hereby rendered reversing and
setting aside the decision of the former Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. Nos.
SP-05555 and SP-05618; and annulling the summary judgment rendered by the trial

There is nothing clear in the record as to the exact date when Judge <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> reached the compulsory retirement age. In petitioners'

<span class="GramE">(<i><u>Ibid</u></i>., p. 419.)</span> In their omnibus motion

was retiring on "June 5 or 7, 1975." <span class="GramE">(<i><u>Ibid</u></i>.,
