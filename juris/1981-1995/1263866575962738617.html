				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><i style=""><span style="">The </span>employment of many of its workers </i><i style=""><span style="">is </span>usually only a minor
statistic with management, to be given commensurate attention along with such
other </i><i style=""><span style="">business items </span><span style="">as inventories, </span></i><i style=""><span style="">credit lines,
receivables, taxes, interests, and depreciation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The worker himself gives it more
importance, it being the source of his livelihood </i><i style=""><span style="">and </span>that of </i><i style=""><span style="">his </span>family,
</i><i style=""><span style="">his
</span>assurance of present security if not well-being, and even his hope for a
better future.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><i style="">Leonito</i></span><i style=""> T. <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span>,
herein private respondent, had been employed as a driver with petitioner <span class="SpellE">Dagupan</span> Bus Co., Inc. since 1981 when in September 1986 he
had to stop working because the bus assigned to him was being </i><i style=""><span style="">repaired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When he reported back two days later, he was
told the repairs had not yet been completed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span></span>Not </i><i style=""><span style="">yet worried, he returned the following day,
only to be informed that his bus was being used by the <span class="SpellE">Saulog</span>
Transit </span></i><i style=""><span style="">in </span></i><i style=""><span style="">connection with a strike in
that company.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was advised to come
back after the strike.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The strike ended
in late September, but when he returned for work the following month, he was told
to come back after a week.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now
apprehensive, he approached the general manager of the petitioner company who
referred him to another officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was
instructed to go on vacation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Grown more
anxious, he reported back a number of times thereafter but was put off with
inconclusive answers that finally made him realize he had actually been
dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was then he decided, after
more than a year, to file his complaint for illegal dismissal, payment of
salary differentials, 13th month, </span>sick leave </i><i style=""><span style="">and other benefits against the
petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">The defense of the
petitioner was that <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> had not been illegally
dismissed but had actually abandoned his position for fourteen months from
September 1986 until he demanded his job back.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Its notices advising him to report for work having been ignored, he was
dropped from the </i><i style=""><span style="">company roll of employees for unauthorized
absences.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was duly informed of the
termination of his services for his refusal to return as directed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner stressed that even before his
abandonment, <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> had been habitually absent and
had been called down several times for these shortcomings.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">After considering the
evidence of the parties, Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Saludares</span> held in favor of the complainant but awarded him
separation pay instead of ordering his reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason was the strained </i><i style=""><span style="">relations
between the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other claims
were disallowed except for the attorney's fees.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On appeal, the decision was affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>
by the respondent NLRC, which is now faulted by the petitioner for grave abuse
of discretion.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">The petition has no merit.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">The issues raised are
mainly factual.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is no showing that
the findings thereon are tainted will arbitrariness or lacking in basis to
justify their reversal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This Court is
not a <span class="SpellE">trier</span> of facts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We defer to the superior opportunity of the lower courts or
administrative bodies to test the credibility of the</i><i style=""><span style=""> witnesses and examine the
authenticity of the documentary evidence directly before them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their conclusions on these matters area
binding on us in the absence of any of the established exceptions calling for
our review.</span></i><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><i style=""><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></i></span></a><i style=""><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">We are satisfied, as the
public respondent has found, that <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> had not
abandoned his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i><i style=""><span style="">He </span>had
sought to return after completion of the repairs on the bus assigned to him but
without success.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His attempts were
warded off with temporizing and vague promises.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In the idiom of the day, he was "given the run-around."<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">His proven requests to
resume work are inconsistent with his alleged abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not even his occasional absences, assuming
they had really been incurred, would constitute abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has not been shown that he was </i><i style=""><span style="">giving
up his employment for good, with the intention of</span></i><i style=""><span style=""> </span></i><i style=""><span style="">not
returning.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Labor Arbiter
correctly observed:<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<blockquote><i style=""><span style="">x </span><span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
Moreover, even granting without admitting that complainant made absences, the
same are insufficient to constitute abandonment, because abandonment of work
cannot just be shown by mere absence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
requires a deliberate refusal to resume employment or a clear showing in terms
of specific circumstances that the worker does not intend to report for
work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, even prolonged
absence does not necessarily mean abandonment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>For abandonment to arise, there must be a concurrence of the intention
to abandon and some overt act from which it may be inferred that the employee
has no more interest to work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one
could not possibly abandon his work and shortly thereafter, vigorously pursue
his complaint for unjust dismissal with prayer for reinstatement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Policarpio</span> v.
Vicente <span class="SpellE">Dysun</span>, Jr., NLRC Case No. R04-903074, </i><st1:date year="1976" day="12" month="7"><i style=""><span style="">July </span>12, 1976</i></st1:date><i style="">; Mario Franco, et al. v. E &amp; M Security
Agency, NLRC Case No. 1036, 2nd Div., </i><st1:date year="1978" day="27" month="12"><i style="">December 27, 1978</i></st1:date><i style="">.)<o:p></o:p></i></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">The petitioner claims it
had required <span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> to report back for work and ultimately,
upon his refusal, informed him of his separation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The evidence shows, however, that the notices
were sent to his old address although he had given the company his new address.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also argued that it would not have
taken him more than one year to file his complaint if it was true that he had
not really abandoned his employment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reason for that delay </i><i style=""><span style="">is obvious.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> was repeatedly reporting back for
work during that period in the hope, eventually turned </span>forlorn, that he
could still return.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">The suggestion is made that
<span class="SpellE">Marasigan</span> had left his employment with the petitioner
to work in </i><st1:country-region><st1:place><i style="">Saudi Arabia</i></st1:place></st1:country-region><i style="">, but there is nothing in the record to prove this assertion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is added that he is still working there
now, but that does not prove he was not illegally dismissed by the petitioner
in 1986.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">As we see it, the
petitioner was, at the very least, lacking in candor toward the private
respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever its reasons for
dismissing him, it should have informed him as soon as possible that </i><i style=""><span style="">his
ser</span>vices had been terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></i><i style=""><span style="">It
should not have left him dangling, so to speak, expecting </span><span style="">he </span></i><i style=""><span style="">could still resume the work
that in fact had already been denied him.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Frankness, if not fairness, would have enabled the private respondent to
act more decisively </span>on the action of the petitioner.<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><i style="">The constitutional mandate
for the protection of labor is as explicit as it is demanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose is to place the workingman on an
equal plane with management - with all its power and influence - in negotiating
for the </i><i style=""><span style="">advancement of his interests and the defense of his rights.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ordinary laborer usually speaks through
his union and so speaks with the force and assertiveness of its
membership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case at bar, the
workingman speaks alone to plead a lonely cause. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>Nevertheless, he speaks with strength, for the
Constitution is behind him.<o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY"><b><i style="">WHEREFORE</i></b><i style="">, <span style="">the
petition is DISMISSED, </span></i><i style=""><span style="">with </span>costs against the
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is so ordered.</i></p>
