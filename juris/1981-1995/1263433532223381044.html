(knows) Pat. Velasquez because he was his contemporary and they used to go in
the (sic) school in the University of Pangasinan; that on March 25, 1990, at

guilty as charged rationalizing, as follows (pp. 13-14, <u><span style="">Rollo</span></u><span style="">):</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"From the evidence, the Court finds that the accused Alex
Querrer was arrested in a buy bust operation conducted by the Narcotics Section
of the Dagupan City Police Station on March 25, 1990 at Fernandez Street, Dagupan
City; that when Patrolman Ireneo Velasquez who pretend(ed) to be a buyer
together with an asset/informer approached the accused, the latter ordered Boy
to get the stuff (Marijuana leaves); that Boy delivered to the asset the
marijuana leaves in a matchbox (Exhibit 'E') and received the <s>P</s>20.00
marked money from the asset which Boy gave to the accused; that at this
juncture, the policemen led by Cpl. Federico Mina, Jr. arrested the accused and
recovered from him the <s>P</s>20.00 bill marked money (Exhibit 'H') and the
asset handed the matchbox of marijuana leaves; that also recovered from the
accused (were) two (2) other (matchboxes) of marijuana leaves; that specimen of
the marijuana flowering tops and leaves stuffed in a matchbox recovered from
the accused was tested by the National Bureau of Investigation Forensic Chemist
and gave a  positive result for
marijuana (Exhibit 'F'); that colored pictures (Exhibit 'G') were taken of the
accused Alex Querrer (exhibit ‘G-1’) holding a partly open(ed) (matchbox) with
‘guitar’ marking showing a discern(i)ble small brownish mutilated object() in
his right hand (Exhibit 'G-2') and two (2) other partly opened (matchboxes)
showing similar substance (Exhibit 'G-3’) and picture of one (1) partly
open(ed) (matchbox) and a <s>P</s>20.00 bill (Exhibit 'D'); that an inventory
receipt (Exhibit 'G-4') dated March 26, 1990 was signed by Sgt. Orlando Garcia
(Exhibit 'D-1') and Cpl. Federico Mina, Jr., (Exhibit 'D-2'); and that pursuant
to law a letter dated March 26, 1990 (Exhibit 'C') signed by Patrolman Gaspar
Dacpano, the investigator was sent to the Executive Director, Dangerous Drugs
Board, Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is undisputed that the findings that the marijuana subject
of this case is one of the prohibited drug<span style="">s</span>
under Republic Act. No. 6425, as amended; that the accused Alex Querrer was
arrested in connection with the buy-bust operation conducted by the Dagupan
City Police authorities on March 25, 1990, at 4:30 p.m. at Fernandez Street,
Dagupan City; that Cpl. Federico Mina, Jr., Sgt. Orlando Garcia and Patrolman
Ireneo Velasquez actually participated in the said operation; and that the
marijuana subject of this case wa<span style="">s </span>confiscated
from the accused during the buy-bust operations.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"While it is true that the marijuana leaves were seized and
confiscated by the arresting officers without <span style="">a </span>search warrant, the seizure was made contemporaneously with the
arrest of the accused and at the place where the arrest was effected.  The accused was lawfully arrested and search
was made incident to the arrest.  (Agnelio
vs. U.S., 269 U.S. 30).  Officers may
search premises of an accused even without a warrant if made contemporaneous
with the arrest and at the place where the arrest occurs.  (U.S. vs. Coffman, 50 Supp. 823, July 6,
1953).</blockquote>

<blockquote>''As the taking of the dried marijuana leaves, was made
contemporaneous with the arrest, the seizure of said dried marijuana leaves
does not constitute illegally seized evidence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In the case at bar, the arrest of the accused could fall under the
pertinent exception provided under Rule 113, Sec. 5, (a). Par. (a) addresses a
situation where a crime is committed in the presence of the officer.  It could be said that the accused was
committing a crime when he ordered Boy to get the stuff (marijuana leaves) and
to deliver the same to the asset of the policemen and received from Boy the <s>P</s>20.00
bill marked money as payment thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The bare denial of the accused can not prevail over the
positive testimony of the arresting officers.  No evidence has been adduced by the defense to prove that the
prosecution witnesses (had) ill motive to testify against the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Court finds the degree of proof which after
investigations of the whole record produces moral certainty in an unprejudiced
mind of accused's culpability.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"The presumption of innocence of the accused has been
successfully overwhelmed by evidence beyond reasonable doubt to establish guilt
(.)”<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, the accused-appellant assigns a single error
committed by the trial court (p. 22, <u>Rollo</u>):</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;">"I</p>

<blockquote>"THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN NOT
ACQUITTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT FOR INSUFFICIENCY OF EVIDENCE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">He maintains that it was not him who sold
and delivered the marijuana leaves to the asset of the police.  As testified to by Cpl. Federico Mina, Jr.,
he (accused-<span style="">appellant) never got hold of
the marijuana leaves, neither the money (tsn, Nov. 5, 1990, pp. 7, 9).  The testimony of Pat. Irineo Velasquez
cannot be believed.  It is almost
impossible that he sold the marijuana leaves and received the money in the
presence of the police whom he knows and who knows him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We sustain the conviction of the accused-appellant by the trial
court.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The contentions of the Office of the Solicitor General in its
impressive brief has rendered unconvincing all the arguments of the
accused-appellant.  We, therefore, adopt
it as Our own (pp. 49-53, <u>Rollo</u>):</p>

<blockquote>"Appellant contends that his guilt has not been proven beyond
reasonable doubt.  In support thereof,
he (capitalizes on) the testimony of prosecution witness, (Cpl.) Mina, that it
was the boy, and not appellant, who handed the marijuana to the civilian
informer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention is puerile.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"True it is that as testified by (Cpl.) Mina, it was the boy
who handed the marijuana to the civilian informer.  However, (Cpl.) Mina further testified that precisely the boy handed
the marijuana to the civilian informer upon the order of appellant.  Thus:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Moreover, (Cpl.) Pfc. Mina further testified that after the
boy received the marked money as payment for the marijuana, the boy handed the
marked money to appellant.  All these
thus indicate too vividly appellant's participation in the sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"</span>Appellant,
however,<span style=""> </span>contends as incredible his having
sold marijuana in the presence of policemen who he well knew and recognized,
more particularly (Cpl.) Mina and Sgt. Garcia who used to visit him at his
place and with (sic) whom he used to run errands for, and Pat. Velasquez who
used to be his classmate at the University of Pangasinan (tsn., December 17,
1990, pp. 3?4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The contention is futile.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">The fact that
appellant and the policemen were close acquaintances does not render it
incredible for appellant to have sold old marijuana in their presence.  Precisely, it is because of friendship that
appellant entertained the wrong notion that the policemen, would not arrest him
despite his nefarious activity of selling marijuana.  Besides, it only renders all the more credible that indeed
appellant when arrested was committing a crime because otherwise, the policemen
who are his friends would not have implicated him with so serious an offense as
drug pushing which is punishable by life imprisonment.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="">In any event, the
issue boils down to (the) question on the (sic) credibility of witnesses.  The trial court gave credence to the
testimonies of (Cpl.) Mina and Pat. Velasquez.  Surely, this finding of the trial court should be sustained, consistent
with the principle of long use that on matters of credibility, the finding of
the trial court must be given the highest degree of respect (People v. Tintore,
111 SCRA 714; People vs. Bautista, 92 SCRA 465, 472).  Besides, being police officers, (Cpl.) Mina and Pat. Velasquez
enjoy in their favor the presumption of regularity in the performance of their
duties (Rule 131, Section (5)(m), Revised Rules of Court)."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">An additional observation weakens further the allegation of the
accused-appellant that inasmuch <span style="">as it </span>was
not him who sold and delivered the marijuana leaves to the asset of the police,
he should not be held liable for violation of Section 4, Republic Act No. 6425,
as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 2 of said law defines the term "sell" as the
act of giving a dangerous drug, whether for money or any other material
consideration; and the term "deliver" as a person's act of <u>knowingly</u>
passing a dangerous drug to another personally <u>or</u> <u>otherwise,</u> <u>and</u>
<u>by</u> <u>any</u> <u>means</u>, with or without consideration.  It is thus impertinent that it was another
person who gave the marijuana leaves to the asset of the police.  What is material is that the giving of the
marijuana leaves was pursuant to the instruction of the accused-appellant, as
Cpl. Mina, Jr. testified to categorically.</p>

<p class="BODY">We, therefore, find that the guilt of the accused?appellant
for violation of Section 4, Republic Act No. 6425, <span style="">as </span>amended, has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.  However, the imposition by the trial court
of subsidiary imprisonment in case of his failure to pay the fine, is
erroneous.  Article 39(3) of the Revised
Penal Code is explicit that when the principal penalty imposed <span style="">is </span>higher than <u>prision</u> <u>correccional</u>,
no subsidiary imprisonment shall be imposed upon the culprit (People v. Andiza,
G.R. No. 71986-87, August 19, 1988, 164 SCRA 642; People v. Bati, G.R. No.
87429, August 27, 1990, 189 SCRA 97; People v. Domingo, et al., G.R. No. 82375,
April 18, 1990, 184 SCRA 409).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the decision appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED
subject to the modification that the imposition by the trial court of
subsidiary imprisonment is deleted.</p>
