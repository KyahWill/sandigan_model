				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition seeks the review of the decision dated November 6,
1985 of the Intermediate Appellate Court (now Court of Appeals)<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
in AC-G.R. No. SP-05928, Teodoro G. Hernaez, et al. vs. Hon. Regina G. Ordoñez
Benitez, <i>et. al</i>., which held as void the decision of the Regional Trial
Court of Manila, Branch XLVII, in Civil Case No. E-02786 declaring petitioner Teodoro
Palmes Hernaez, Jr. as the recognized natural child of private respondent
Teodoro G. Hernaez and entitled to a P400.00 monthly support.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the records that on September 2, 1980, petitioner
represented by his mother and natural guardian, Evelyn Palmes, filed a
complaint with the then Juvenile and Domestic Court (now Regional Trial Court)
against Teodoro Hernaez for acknowledgment and support with support <i>pendente
lite.  </i>A decision dated March 23,
1984 was rendered by said court the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"WHEREFOR</span>E,
judgment is hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.<span style="" times="" new="" roman="" ;="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

installments, the first, one (1) month after this Decision shall have become

be paid within the first five (5) days of July, 1984<i>.  </i>Thereafter, the monthly support shall be
paid within the first five (5) days of the succeeding months, which shall be
deposited with the Cashier of the Regional Trial Courts of Manila at City Hall,
Manila, from whom plaintiff's mother or her duly authorized representative may
withdraw the same; and</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On June 29, 1984, Teodoro Hernaez filed a notice of appeal of
said decision which he received on May 31, 1984.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the appeal was filed beyond the reglementary period of 15 days
as mandated by Section 39 of Batas Pambansa 129, petitioner moved to dismiss
the appeal as the decision of the trial court has become final and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Realizing the defect in his notice of appeal, Teodoro Hernaez
filed a Motion to Give Due Course to Appeal or Petition for Relief on August 8,
1984 which was denied in the Order of September 12, 1984 on the ground that the
motion was filed out of time and the petition did not comply with Section 3 of
Rule 38 of the Revised Rules of Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On September 19, 1984, Teodoro Hernaez thru his new counsel,
filed another Petition for Relief from Judgment alleging that he was not aware
of the decision of the lower court.  On
the same date, private respondent's wife, Estrella Hernaez, together with their
six children likewise filed a Petition for Relief from Judgment with Motion to
Intervene because they were not included as parties in the instant case, which
petitions and motion were denied in the order of December 21, 1984<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
for lack of merit and on the ground that the decision had already become final
and executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">From said order, private respondents appealed, which was granted
in an order dated January 25, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, on the other hand, filed a motion for reconsideration
of the order of January 25, 1985 which was also granted by the trial court on
February 20, 1985.</p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents then filed a motion for clarification
inquiring as to whether their appeal which was granted on January 25, 1986 was
subsequently denied because of the order of February 20, 1985.  The trial court issued an order declaring
that there is no need for a clarification.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 20, 1985, petitioner filed a motion to require private
respondent Teodoro Hernaez to deposit support in arrears or to be cited for
contempt.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearing of the motion for contempt, private
respondents' counsel, requested for 10 days within which to comply with the
questioned decision.  However, on April
10, 1986, private respondents, instead of complying with said decision, filed a
petition for <i>certiorari</i>, prohibition or <i>mandamus</i> or alternatively,
an action for the annulment of judgment with preliminary injunction with the
Intermediate Appellate Court,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
which declared the decision of the trial court null and void for lack of
summons by publication being an action <i>in rem</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Their motion for reconsideration having been denied on February
21, 1986, petitioner instituted this Petition for Review.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is petitioner's contention that the requirement of publication
is not necessary in an action for compulsory acknowledgment and support of an
illegitimate child since said action is not one of the instances enumerated in
Section 1 of Rule 72 of the Revised Rules of Court requiring publication of the
petition before jurisdiction can be acquired by the Court.  Under the "<i>expressio unius est
exclussio alterius</i>" principle on statutory construction, this action
should be considered a proceeding <i>in</i> <i>personam</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">We find merit in the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">An action for compulsory recognition of minor natural children is
not among cases of special proceedings mentioned in Section 1, Rule 72 of the
Rules of Court.  Consequently, such an
action should be governed by the rules on ordinary civil actions.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar does not fall under Rule 105 of the Rules of
Court since the same applies only to cases falling under Article 281 of the
Civil Code where there has been a voluntary recognition of the minor natural
child, <i>i.e.</i>, prior recognition of the minor natural child in a document
other than a record of birth or a will, which is absent in the instant case.<i><o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Private respondents' claim that notice of an action for
compulsory recognition should also be given to the wife and legitimate children
of the putative parent, Teodoro Hernaez, Sr., is unmeritorious.  First of all, in a case for compulsory
recognition, the party in the best position to oppose the same is the putative
parent himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, implicit in both Articles 283<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
and 285<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Civil Code is the general rule that an action for compulsory recognition
should be brought against the putative father,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
the exceptions being the instances when either the putative parent died during
the minority of the child, or when after the death of the parent a document
should appear of which nothing had been heard and in which either or both of
the parents recognize the child, in which cases the action is brought against
the putative parent's heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, an action for compulsory recognition is an ordinary
civil action.  Thus, service of summons
on the putative parent shall be as provided for under Rule 14.  Said action shall be brought against the
putative parent only; his heirs may be made party defendants only under the
circumstances mentioned in Article 285.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby
REVERSED and SET ASIDE, and the decision dated March 23,1984 of the Regional
Trial Court of Manila, Branch XLVII in Civil Case No. E-02786 is hereby
REINSTATED and AFFIRMED.  Costs against
private respondents.</p>

Art 283<i>.  </i>In any of the following
