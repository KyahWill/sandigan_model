				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">If in a labor case, an employee is absolved of an offense that
led to her dismissal and is ordered reinstated, will her subsequent conviction
in a criminal prosecution for the same offense affect the administrative
decision?</p>

<p class="BODY">The offense subject of the two cases is theft, claimed to have
been committed by private respondent Emilia B. Santos, an employee of
petitioner Sampaguita Garments Corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was alleged in both cases that on April 14, 1987, Santos
attempted to bring out of the company premises, without authorization or
permission, a piece of cloth belonging to the petitioner.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Sampaguita dismissed her on this ground.  She filed a complaint for illegal dismissal
but the labor arbiter sustained the company.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
However, his decision was reversed by the NLRC, which ordered her reinstatement
with back wages from the time of her illegal suspension until her actual
reinstatement.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Meantime, the petitioner had also filed a criminal action against
Santos for the same offense in the Municipal Trial Court of Caloocan City.  After trial, she was found guilty and
sentenced to an indeterminate penalty of 1 month and 1 day of <i><span style="">arresto mayor</span></i><span style=""> </span>as minimum to 4 months of <i><span style="">arresto mayor</span></i><span style=""> </span>as maximum.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a> This
decision was affirmed by the Regional Trial Court of Caloocan City.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 89323, this Court dismissed the petition for <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>against the decision of the NLRC for lack of a showing that it
was tainted with grave abuse of discretion.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 100929, this Court saw no reversible error in the
decision of the Court of Appeals sustaining the petitioner's conviction by the
Municipal Trial Court as affirmed by the Regional Trial Court.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The decisions in both cases became final and executory and the
corresponding entries of judgment were eventually made.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, Santos moved for the execution of the NLRC
decision.  The petitioner opposed,
invoking her conviction in the criminal case.  However, the NLRC sustained her on the ground that its decision had been
affirmed by this Court and had long become final and executory.  Sampaguita then came to this Court for
relief.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is asserted by the petitioner that, in view of the private
respondent's conviction, the decision of the NLRC calling for her reinstatement
and the payment to her of P63,908.00 in back wages should not now be
enforced.  Otherwise, she would in
effect be undeservedly rewarded when she should instead be punished for her
offense.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the private respondent argues that the
decision of the NLRC is independent of the criminal case and in any event can
no longer be modified or reversed after having become final and executory on
August 7, 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">We hold for the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that once a judgment has become final and executory,
it can no longer be disturbed except only for the correction of clerical errors
or where supervening events render its execution impossible or unjust.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In the latter event, the interested party may ask the court to modify the
judgment to harmonize it with justice and the facts.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There is no dispute in the case at bar that the decision of the
respondent NLRC ordering the private respondent's reinstatement with back wages
had indeed become final and executory.  Even so, we find, in light of the subsequent developments, that the NLRC
was not correct in sustaining the implementation of that decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Heirs of Francisco Guballa, Sr. vs. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court held that "the power of the NLRC to issue a writ of execution
carries with it the right to look into the correctness of the execution of the
decision and <i>to consider supervening events that may affect such execution</i>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The affirmance by the Regional Trial Court and the Court of
Appeals of the private respondent's conviction for theft is justification
enough for the NLRC to exercise this authority and suspend the execution of its
decision.  Such conviction, which was
also upheld by this Court in G.R. No. 100929, is a supervening cause that
rendered unjust and inequitable the decision mandating the private respondent's
reinstatement, and with back wages to boot.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General agrees that reinstatement is no longer
feasible in view of the subsequent conviction of the private respondent and the
already strained relationship between her and the petitioner.  He suggests instead the grant of separation
pay to the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">We disagree.  Even this
award is not justifiable because Santos was found guilty of a crime involving
moral turpitude and so is disqualified from this benefit under the ruling in
PLDT v. NLRC.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
That case laid down the rule as follows:</p>

<blockquote>We hold that henceforth separation pay shall be allowed as a
measure of social justice only in those instances where the employee is validly
dismissed for causes other than serious misconduct or those reflecting on his
moral character.  Where the reason for
the valid dismissal is, for example, habitual intoxication or an offense
involving moral turpitude, like theft or illicit sexual relations with a fellow
worker, the employer may not be required to give the dismissed employee
separation pay, or financial assistance, or whatever other name it is called,
on the ground of social justice.</blockquote>

<blockquote>A contrary rule would, as the petitioner correctly argues, have the
effect of rewarding rather than punishing the erring employee for his
offense.  And we do not agree that the
punishment is his dismissal only and that the separation pay has nothing to do
with the wrong he has committed.  Of
course it has.  Indeed, if the employee
who steals from the company is granted separation pay even as he is validly
dismissed, it is not unlikely that he will commit a similar offense in his next
employment because he thinks he can expect a like leniency if he is again found
out.  This kind of misplaced compassion
is not going to do labor in general any good as it will encourage the
infiltration of its ranks by those who do not deserve the protection and
concern of the Constitution.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The same rationale exists for not enforcing the respondent
Commission's award of back wages in favor of the private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conformably to Wenphil Corporation v. NLRC<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
and subsequent cases,<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> the
only award to which the private respondent may be entitled is for the amount of
P1,000.00, to be paid to her by the petitioner as a penalty for effecting her
dismissal without complying with the procedural requirements laid down in
Sections 2 and 5 of Rule XIV, Book V, of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the
Labor Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention that the petition should be dismissed for lack of
the certification on forum-shopping required under Circular No. 28-91 is not
well taken.  The petition was filed on
December 5, 1991, before the circular took effect on January 1, 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent's conviction of the crime of theft of
property belonging to the petitioner has affirmed the existence of a valid
ground for her dismissal and thus removed the justification for the
administrative decision ordering her reinstatement with back wages.  Nevertheless, the petitioner is still
subject to sanction for its failure to accord the private respondent the right
to an administrative investigation in conformity with the procedural
requirements of due process.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is GRANTED and the order of execution
dated April 1, 1991, is SET ASIDE.  The
petitioner is instead required to pay the private respondent an indemnity of
P1,000.00 for its arbitrariness in effecting her dismissal.</p>
