				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i> which seeks to
reverse and set aside the decision of the Court of Appeals affirming that of
the then Court of First Instance of Masbate granting the application for
judicial confirmation of incomplete or imperfect title on a tract of public
land in Barrio Calpi, San Pascual (now Claveria), Masbate, with an area of
598.4894 hectares.</p>

<p class="BODY">Two hundred fifty-six (256) hectares of the land are within
Timberland Block A, Masbate L.C. Project No. 7, and certified by the Bureau of
Forestry on March 11, 1930 as forest land.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
The first known possessor of the entire tract of land was allegedly Estanislao
Patricio who used it as a pasture land as early as 1914.  It was sold to Vicente Montenegro in 1928
together with 100 heads of cattle and their offsprings, as well as the corrals
and wire enclosures.  Montenegro
continued the possession of Patricio and devoted the land to the same
purpose.  In 1938, he sold the same to
Maria Calanog with the cattle remaining on the ranch.  Calanog intensified her efforts in the rearing of livestock such
that by 1941, there were about 500 heads of animals grazing on the land.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 20, 1956, in the Court of First Instance of Masbate,
Calanog filed an application for the registration of title over the land.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forthwith, the Director of Lands filed an opposition to the
application alleging that neither applicant Calanog nor her
predecessors-in-interest possessed sufficient title to the land which they had
acquired either by composition title from the Spanish Government or by
possessory information title under the Royal Decree of February 13, 1894; that
the applicant and her predecessors-in-interest had not openly and adversely
possessed the land under claim of ownership since July 26, 1894; and that the
land involved is part of the public domain belonging to the Republic of the
Philippines.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On December 17, 1956, the Director of Forestry likewise filed an
opposition to the aforesaid application, alleging that a sizeable portion of
the subject land falls within the timber block.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
There being no other oppositors to the application with the exception of the
Director of Lands and the Director of Forestry, the court issued on the same
day an order of general default against the whole world.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Maria Calanog died on October 30, 1958.  One of her children, Trinidad S. Armedilla, filed a motion
alleging that at the extrajudicial partition of her mother's estate, her
co-heirs agreed to cede, convey and transfer to her ownership over the land
herein involved and praying that she be substituted party-applicant in the
proceedings.  The Court accordingly
granted the motion.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On June 26, 1962, thirty-seven (37) private individuals filed an
urgent petition to lift the order of general default alleging that they learned
of said order only the day before or on June 25, 1962; that their failure to
file opposition was due to mistake, accident and excusable negligence as they
had always been under the impression that their former counsel had filed an
opposition to the application; that they had a valid, legal and just title to
their claim to 2/3 of the land sought to be registered, as in fact two of them
had already been issued certificates of title while some of them had
applications for homestead which had been approved or were pending approval; <span style="">and </span>that they were filing an
opposition in the interest of justice and to avoid multiplicity of suits.  Attached to the petition was their
opposition to the application for registration of title.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The said petition was granted by the Court and the order of
general default was lifted with respect to the thirty-seven (37) private
oppositors.  Thereafter, Trinidad S.
Armedilla, as substitute applicant, filed an amended application for
registration of title with the additional prayer that should the provisions of
the Land Registration Act be inapplicable, she prays that the benefits of
Chapter VII of Commonwealth Act No. 141, otherwise known as the Public Land
Act, as amended by Republic Act No. 1942, be made applicable.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On October 7, 1964, the court dismissed the case for failure of
applicant to appear at the continuation of the hearing.  Upon the applicant's motion for
reconsideration, the court reconsidered the dismissal order and on February 17,
1970, the parties submitted an additional agreement of stipulation of
facts.  Worth noting are the parties’
statements therein that "the parcels of land respectively occupied by the
private oppositors and covered by their homestead applications are agricultural
lands;" that the applicant (then Maria Calanog) had filed in February 1956
a protest against the homestead application of Remigio Veñiga and a motion for
the cancellation of the applications for homestead and/or free patent of <span style="">private oppositors or to hold said
applications in abeyance until the instant registration proceedings are
terminated; that no homestead or free patents had been issued to the private
oppositors except Eriberto Bojos; that private oppositors took possession of
their respective lots only after their entry permits had been issued by the
Bureau of Lands, and that private oppositors had introduced improvements on
their respective portions.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 11pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On August 14, 1970, the trial court rendered its decision, the
dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, judgment <span style="">is
</span>hereby rendered:</blockquote>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Confirming and ordering the registration of
the title over the property described in Plan Psu 149401 (Exh. ‘D’) and its

Nazario Armedilla, and residing at  Donsol, Sorsogon, and excluding therefrom the areas covered by Original
Certificate of Title Nos. P-1601 and P-2358 in the name of  Eriberto Bojos, which are identified as

Subdivision;</blockquote>

confirmation be issued in favor of the applicant.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED."<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the said decision, the public oppositors
elevated the case to the Court of Appeals for review but on March 9, 1979, the
Court of Appeals affirmed the lower court's decision.  Hence, the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals erred in ruling
that 256 hectares of the land for which private respondent had applied for
registration are agricultural in nature because they are within the timberland
area designated as Block A, Masbate L.C., Project No. 7 of the Bureau of
Forestry.  They also assail as erroneous
the respondent court's decision that Trinidad S. Armedilla and her
predecessors-in-interest had, for thirty years, openly and continuously
possessed the land involved because:  (a) 256 hectares of the same land fall within the timberland area and
therefore, possession thereof, however long, cannot ripen <span style="">into private </span>ownership, and (b) the
remaining 342 hectares are public land occupied by at least 37 private
oppositors to the application for registration of title who took possession
thereof by virtue of entry permits, approved homestead applications, and a free
patent grant issued by the Bureau of Lands in 1954, 1955 and 1956.  Moreover, petitioners assert that the
appellate court erred in finding that when the Government surveyed and
subdivided the San Pascual public land from September 7, 1953 to May 29, 1954,
Trinidad S. Armedilla, through her predecessors-in-interest, had acquired a
registerable title notwithstanding that the application is founded on
continuous and adverse possession of public land and that prior to 1954, the
law then required possession since July 26, 1894 whereas applicant's possession
commenced only in 1914.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">A careful scrutiny of the records of this case reveals a glaring
disparity between the area of the land described <span style="">in </span>the 1928 deed of sale between Patricio and Montenegro and the
area of the land applied for by private respondent.  The deed of sale mentions only <u>200</u> hectares<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a> but
private respondent, through her mother, applied for registration of a tract of
land containing <u>598</u> hectares.  While Maria Calanog alleged in her application that the area she wanted
to register in her name is the same as the subject of the 1928 sale which, in
turn, was sold to her in 1938, there is no showing as to how the area increased
in size to almost triple that of the land originally owned and sold by
Patricio.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in the absence of convincing evidence on the matter, the
lower court could only surmise that, since fencing the vast area entailed huge
expense, it could be done only as the need arose to accommodate the increasing
number of cattle raised.  Hence, it was
"difficult if not impossible to determine with accuracy the entire
area." The same court concluded that the object of the sale between
Montenegro and Maria Calanog "should not be pegged to what was stated in
the document but should also include all that is found within the boundaries of
the land."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
It should be remembered, however, that in cases where there is <span style="">a<i> </i></span>great difference between the
area of the land sought to be registered and that which appears on the deed of
sale on which the registration is based, the same should be properly explained and
the identity of the property should be proven in a satisfactory manner.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Unfortunately, the private respondent failed to satisfactorily explain the
disparity in area.  Surmises and
conjectures have no room in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioners’ claim that 256 hectares of the
land involved are timberland is buttressed by satisfactory documentary
evidence.  Thus, Exhibit 1 of the report
of Senior Ranger Escaler of the Bureau of Forestry dated February 10, 1957
categorically states that said area is "a part of Timberland, Block A,
Masbate L.C., Project No. 7." This evidence is supported by Exhibit 2, the
sketch plan; Exh. 4, also the sketch plan of the public land subdivision of San
Pascual, Masbate under Pls-32, Parcel 1 (PHILCUSA-FOA) which includes Exhibit
4-A showing the demarcation and classification of the 256 hectares as within
the forest zone, and Exhibit 5, the survey plan of the land applied for as
prepared by a private surveyor hired by Maria Calanog and which shows the
subdivided public land of San Pascual as Exhibit 5-A and the subject 256
hectares as timberland within Block A, Project 7 of the government survey as
Exhibit 5-B.  It is interesting to note
that even private respondent had adopted Exhibit 1 as her own Exhibit M.  Hence, it is grave abuse of discretion on
the part of the trial court to ignore such material evidence which establishes
the fact that 256 hectares of the area being registered by private respondent
form part of a timberland.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There being sufficient proof as to the classification of the 256
hectares as timberland, there is no need for a judicial determination that
indeed the area is forest land.  Classification of public lands is an exclusive prerogative of the
Executive Department through the Office of the President, and not of the
courts.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Similarly, the administration and disposition of lands of the public domain in
the manner authorized by law is outside the powers of the courts, for they
belong to the Executive officials.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Not only does the Public Land Act (Com. Act No. 141)<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
mandate it but the courts accord great respect to the opinion of the technical
experts who speak with authority on forest matters.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Corollarily, an applicant for registration of a parcel of land
bears the burden of overcoming the presumption that the land sought to be
registered forms part of the public domain.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
Private respondent, therefore, incorrectly argued that she did not have the
"initial obligation" to show that the property involved is
agricultural.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Evidently, her premise that there was insufficient proof of the classification
of the land as mineral or timber was <span style="">inaccurate.  </span>Being the interested party, it was
incumbent upon her to prove that the land being registered is indeed alienable
or disposable.  She cannot rely on the
mere presumption that it was agricultural and, therefore, an alienable part of
the public domain.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this regard, it should be emphasized that under Sec. 6 of the
Public Land Act, the term "timberland" is called "forests"
in the Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that the 256 hectares in question are, according to Exhibit 1,
"practically covered with cogon and small patches of forest"
"with minor <span style="">species </span>such as
taluto, kulatingan and alim" does not detract from their classification as
timberland or forest land.  Neither does
the fact that the area involved may have been devoted to cattle- raising or
that it has <span style="">long </span>been used as a
pastureland, change its classification to anything other than timberland.  Worth quoting is the following portion of
the decision in <u>Amunategui</u> <u><span style="">v</span></u><span style="">. </span><u>Director</u> <u>of</u> <u>Forestry</u>:<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a><u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"A forested area classified as forest land of the public
domain does not lose such classification simply because loggers or settlers may
have stripped it of its forest cover.  Parcels
of land classified as forest land may actually be covered with grass or planted
to crops by kaingin cultivators or other farmers.  ‘Forest lands’ do not have to be on mountains or in out of the
way places.  Swampy areas covered by
mangrove trees, nipa palms, and other trees growing brackish or sea water may
also be classified as forest land.  <u>The</u>
<u>classification</u> <u>is</u> <u>descriptive</u> <u>of</u> <u>its</u> <u>legal</u>
<u>nature</u> <u>or</u> <u>status</u> <u>and</u> <u>does</u> <u><span style="">not</span></u><span style=""> <u>have</u> </span><u>to</u> <u>be</u> <u>descriptive</u> <u>of</u> <u>what</u>

<p class="BODY">The doctrine that has evolved on this matter through case law<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> is
that forest lands or forest reserves are not capable of private appropriation,
and possession thereof, however long, cannot convert them into private
property.  Clearly, then, private respondent
cannot claim a registerable title over 256 hectares of the total area sought to
be registered in the absence of proof that they had been classified as part of
the disposable agricultural lands of the public domain.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither <span style="">may </span>private
respondent claim <span style="">open, </span>continuous
and uninterrupted possession for thirty years immediately preceding the filing
of the application for registration on November 20, 1962 with respect to the
remaining 342 hectares of land.  As
earlier mentioned, this bigger portion of the land had been occupied and
possessed by the thirty-seven private oppositors to the application as early as
1954, 1955 and 1956.  As private
respondent herself admitted in the agreed additional stipulation <span style="">of </span>facts, said oppositors even showed
that they have duly approved homestead applications, free patents and two of
them even possess <span style="">transfer certificates
of title.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It was also erroneous for the Court of Appeals to categorically
rule that the continuous, exclusive and notorious possession and occupation for
thirty years cannot be required of the applicant in view of the fact that such
possession was interrupted by force majeure or by the war years.  While the applicant is at liberty to invoke
said interruption in her possession, it must be clearly established that when
the war ended, the applicant resumed possession of the land.  In this case, however, the applicant could
not have resumed her alleged pre-war possession inasmuch as other
occupants-cultivators had settled on the land.  Her claim that she had installed an overseer in the property when she
returned in 1945<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
rings hollow in light of the undisputed evidence presented by the 37
oppositors.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, when the government surveyed the area in 1953-1954,
private respondent had no registerable title considering the law then
applicable.  Before its amendment, Sec.
48 of the Public Land Act required adverse possession from July 26, 1894 before
a title to a piece of land could be registered.  What is on record, however, is that private respondent's predecessors-in-interest
commenced possession only in 1914.  Furthermore, even if private respondent be considered as in possession
of the land from that time on, as stated above, after its interruption by the
war, private respondent was no longer in open and notorious possession of the
land.  A sizeable portion had been taken
over by persons, who, sensing perhaps that private respondent was no more than
an absentee claimant, took the necessary legal steps to claim for their own the
lands in their respective possession.</p>
