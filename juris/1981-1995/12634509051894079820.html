to compel public respondents to conduct a certification election among the rank
and file employees of the respondent employer in Case No. LRD-M-8-360-79 or in the
alternative, to require the respondent Minister of Labor or his Deputy to act
on private respondent's "Appeal" and on petitioner's "Motion to
Dismiss with Motion to Execute."</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="8">August
 17, 1979</st1:date>, peti­tioner <st1:place>Union</st1:place> filed a petition
to be directly certified as collective bargaining agent of the rank and file
employees of private <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> (Annex
"A"; p. 26, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1979</st1:date>,
the date of the hearing, private respondent was required to submit on <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1979</st1:date> a payroll of
employees as of <st1:date year="1979" day="31" month="7">July 31, 1979</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the same date, in a handwritten
manifestation, respondent employer through counsel, agreed that as soon as the
registration certificate of the local union was issued by the Ministry of Labor
and that it was shown that the local union represents the majority of the rank
and file, the Bank would recognize the said union and would nego­tiate
accordingly (Annex "B"; p. 27, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1979</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">abovesaid</span> registration certificate of the local
union /Certificate No. 9352-LC, issued by the Ministry of Labor/ was
secured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On October 15, 1979, petitioner
filed a Manifestation and Urgent Motion to Decide and submitted a copy of the
Registration Certificate of the local union and union membership application of
183 members out of more or less 259 rank and file employees of employer Bank,
authorizing the National Union of Bank Employees (NUBE) /herein petitioner/ to
represent them "as their sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent in
all matters relating to salary rates, hours of work and other terms and
conditions of employment in the Pro­ducers Bank of the Philippines" (p.
38, rec.).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, <span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> failed to submit the required payroll
and the list of rank and file workers based on said payroll.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1979</st1:date>,
Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Plagata</span>
issued an order directing the holding of a certification election, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, premises considered, a certification election is
hereby ordered held, conducted, and super­vised by representation officers of
this office within 20 days from receipt hereof.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The same representation officers shall conduct pre-election conferences
in order to thresh out the mechanics and other minor details of this election
including the inclusion and exclusion proceedings to determine the qualified
electors in this election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The choice
shall be either YES, for Petitioner, or NO, for NO UNION DESIRED.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SO ORDERED" (Annex "C", pp.
28-29, rec.).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="10">October 19, 1979</st1:date>,
<span class="GramE">respondent corporation</span> filed a motion to suspend
further proceedings in view of an allegedly prejudicial issue consisting of a
pending proceeding for cancellation of the registration of petitioning union
for allegedly engaging in prohibited and unlawful activities in violation of
the laws (Annex "D"; pp. 30-32, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On October 23, 1979, by agreement of the parties, respondent then
Deputy Minister of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>,
acting for the Minister of Labor, assumed jurisdiction over the certification
elec­tion case and the application for clearance to terminate the services of
thirteen (13) union offi­cers by private respondent corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, an order was issued on the same date
which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"On October 23, 1979 the parties entered into an agreement
that the Office of the Ministry of Labor shall assume jurisdiction over the
following disputes under P.D. No. 823 in the interest of speedy labor justice
and indus­trial peace:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q" style="">"1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">certification</span> elec­tion case; and</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-top: 1pt; text-indent: 42.5pt;"><span class="GramE">(Agreement,
October 23, 1979).</span></p>

<blockquote>"Accordingly, the Deputy Minister deputized Atty. Luna C. <span class="SpellE">Piezas</span>, Chief of the Med­-Arbiter Section, National Capital
Region, to conduct summary investigations for the purpose of determining the definition
of the appro­priate bargaining unit sought to be represented by the peti­tioning
union as well as com­pliance with the 30% mandatory written consent in support
of the petition under the bargain­ing unit as shall have been defined.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the application for clearance to terminate with pre­ventive
suspension, this Office deems it necessary, for the mutual protection of each
party's interest and to assure continuance of the exercise of their respective
rights within legal limits, to lift the imposition of preventive suspension on
the subject employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lifting of
the preventive suspension shall include Messrs. Castro and <span class="SpellE">Sumibcay</span>,
who are presently on leave of absence with pay in pursuance of the agreement
reached at the level of the Regional Direc­tor, Further, should the two (2)
employees' leave credits be ex­hausted, they are to go on leave without pay,
but this shall not be construed as done in pursuance of the preventive
suspension.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, the lifting of the preventive suspension shall be without
prejudice to the conti­nuance of the hearing on the application for clearance
in­volving the thirteen (13) em­ployees the determination of the merits of
which shall be dis­posed of at the Regional level" (Annex "E",
pp. 33-34, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, Med-Arbiter Luna <span class="SpellE">Piezas</span>
conducted hearings but withdrew, in view of the alleged utter disrespect for
authority, gross bad faith, malicious refusal to appreciate effective, prompt
and honest service and resorting in malicious and deliberate lying in dealing
with Ministry of Labor officials by a certain Mr. Jun <span class="SpellE">Umali</span>,
spokesman of the Producers Bank Employees Association.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was then transferred to Med-Arbiter
Alberto <span class="SpellE">Abis</span> on <st1:date year="1979" day="7" month="11">November 7, 1979</st1:date> (Annex "F", p. 35, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">During the hearing on <st1:date year="1979" day="9" month="11">November
 9, 1979</st1:date>, respond­ent Bank failed to submit a list of rank and file

verbal manifestation pressed for the exclusion of the following personnel from
the bargaining unit:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1979" day="19" month="11">November 19, 1979</st1:date>,
Med-Arbiter Alberto <span class="SpellE">Abis</span> Jr. ordered the holding of
certification election among the rank and file employees but sustained the
stand of re­spondent company as to the exclusion of certain employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the pertinent portion of said order
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful perusal of the records, evaluation of the
evidence on hand and consideration of the positions taken by the parties, we
find and so hold that Petitioner-Union has substantially complied with the mandatory
and jurisdictional requirement of 30% subscription of all the employees in the
bargaining unit as prescribed by Section 2, Rule 5, Book V of the Rules and
Regulations Implementing the Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Submission by the Petitioner during the hearing of copies of the
application and membership forms of its members wherein they have duly
authorized Petitioner 'as their sole and exclusive collective bargaining agent'
constitutes substantial compliance of the mandatory and jurisdictional 30%
subscription requirement, it appearing from the records that out of the 264
total rank and file employees, 188 are union members who have so authorized
Petitioner to represent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"With respect to respondent bank's motion to suspend the
proceedings in the instant case pending resolution of the can­cellation
proceedings now pend­ing in the Bureau of Labor Rela­tions, we find that the
same is not tenable in the absence of a restraining order.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In consideration of the agreement of the parties, it is
hereby ordered that the scope or coverage of the appropriate bargaining unit
should include the Head Office of the Producers Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and all its branch offices and shall comprise of all the regular rank and file
employees of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Excluded are all
managerial and supervisory employees, proba­tionary, contractual and casual
employees and security guards.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>It is further ordered that by virtue
and in consonance with industry practice as revealed by the <span class="SpellE">CBAs</span>
of 18 banks submitted by Petitioner-Union, the follow­ing positions should
likewise be excluded from the bargaining unit; Secretaries of bank officials;
employees of the Personnel Depart­ment, EXCEPT Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sumibcay</span>,

to vote, but the votes should be segregated as challenged.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>In case a doubt arises as to whether or
not the position held by an employee is confidential in nature, the employee
should be allowed to vote, but his vote should be seg­regated as challenged</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, it
is hereby ordered that a certifi­cation election be conducted among the regular
rank and file employees of the Producers Bank of the Philip­pines (the
appropriate bargaining unit of which is defined above) after the usual
pre-election con­ference called to formulate the list of qualified voters and
dis­cuss the mechanics of the election.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is further ordered that the election in the bank's
branches outside the Metro Manila area be conducted by the appropriate Regional
Offices of the Ministry of Labor having jurisdiction over them.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"SO ORDERED (pp. 5-7, Annex "G"; pp. 41-43, rec.;
underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On November 29, 1979, petitioner filed a partial appeal to the
Director of Bureau of Labor Relations questioning the exclusions made by
Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Abis</span> of those employees who are not among
those expressly enumerated under the law to be excluded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It vigorously urged the inclusion of the rest
of the employees which is allegedly the usual practice in the banking
industry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It likewise urged the holding
of a certification elec­tion allowing all those excluded by Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Abis</span> to vote but segregating their votes as challenged in
the meantime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, it averred:</p>

<blockquote>"It is in the position of the petitioner that notwithstanding
the statements above that the petition for certification should be held
immediately by allowing all those not excluded from Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Abis</span>'
order to vote without prejudice to a final decision on the matters subject of
these appeal/.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Which we also submit that
in order to expedite the pro­ceedings these exclusions should also be allowed
to vote even pending resolution of the appeal but segre­gating them for further
considera­tion" (pp. 3-4, Annex "H"; pp. 46-47, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 4, 1979, respondent bank likewise appealed from the
aforesaid November 19, 1979 order of Med-Arbiter Alberto <span class="SpellE">Abis</span>,
Jr. to the Minister of Labor on the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that the act of Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Abis</span> in issuing the <span class="SpellE">abovesaid</span>
Order is <u>ultra <span class="SpellE">vires</span></u>, full and complete
jurisdiction over the questioned petition being vested in the office of the
Minister of Labor and hence the only adjudicative body empowered to resolve the
petition;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> the fact that
petitioner's Union registration was subject of cancellation proceedings with
the Bureau of Labor Relations rendered the issuance of the <span class="SpellE">abovequestioned</span>
Order direct­ing the holding of a certification, election premature; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">that</span> the bargaining
unit was not appropriately defined [Annex "I"; pp. 49-57, rec.].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On December 7, 1979, the entire <span class="GramE">records of the
case were allegedly elevated as an appealed case by Regional Director Francisco
L. <span class="SpellE">Estrella</span> to the Director of the Bureau of Labor
Relations and was</span> docketed there­at as appealed case No. <span class="GramE">A-1599-79.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 21, 1980, the Union of Producers Bank Employees
Chapter-NATU filed a motion to intervene in the said petition for certification
election alleging among other things that it has also some signed up members in
the respondent Bank and consequently has an interest in the petition for
certification election filed by petitioner as it will directly affect their
rights as to who will represent the employees in the collective bargaining
negotiations (Annex "P"; pp. 100­-101, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 24, 1980, the Bureau of Labor Relations Director <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span> C. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span> rendered a
decision affirming the Med-Arbiter's order with certain modifications, the
pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Preliminarily, the issue of jurisdiction is being raised by
respondent bank but we need not be drawn into nor tarry in this issue but
instead proceed to con­sider the merits of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Suffice it rather to say that the appealed
order was signed by the med-arbiter <u>a</u> <u>quo </u>and the records of the
case were elevated on appeal to this Bureau by the Regional Director of the
National Capital Region.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Besides respond­ent should not unduly press the jurisdictional
issue.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such ques­tion does not
lead nor contribute to the resolution of the real pressing issue -- the
certification election issue.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is at
stake here is the right of the employees to organize and be represented for
collective bargaining purposes by a union at the respondent bank where none
existed up to the present time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this
consideration alone, respondent's vigorous objection alleging want of
jurisdiction cracks from tangency of the issue.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The matter of defining the bar­gaining unit, that is to say
the appropriateness thereof, usually presents for determination three
questions, to wit, the general type of the bargaining unit or whether it should
be an industrial unit embracing all the employees in a broad class or a craft
unit that is confined to a small specialized group within a broad class, the
scope of the bargaining unit or whether it would embrace all employees in a
given class at only one plant or at several plants of an employer, and the
specific composition of the bargaining unit, that is, whether or not the unit
should include employees of different occupational groups, like clerks,
inspectors, technical employees, etc..<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On these questions, we are not with­out legal guidelines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law and the Rules are clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petition for certification election,
whether filed by a legitimate labor organi­zation or by an employer in appro­priate
case, shall contain, <u>inter <span class="SpellE">alia</span></u>, the
description of the bar­gaining unit which shall be the employer unit unless
circumstances otherwise require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the policy under the Labor Code on the matter of fixing the bargaining unit is
to favor larger units and this is sought to be implemented on a two-tiered
basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the lower tier, the law
mandates the employer unit as the normal unit of organization at the company
level, thus discourag­ing if not stopping fragmentation into small craft or
occupational units as what prevailed prior to the Labor Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the Code en­visions further consolidation
into larger bargaining units.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, on
the higher tier, the law mandates the eventual restructuring of the labor
movement along the 'one union, one industry' basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There should therefore be no doubt as to the
law and policy on the fixing of the appropriate bargaining unit which is
generally the employer unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Applying
this rule to the instant case, the appropriate bargaining unit should embrace
all the regular rank and file employees at the head as well as branch offices
of re­spondent bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of course, the
exception to this employer unit rule is when circumstances otherwise
require.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But such is not at issue here,
respondent not having adduced circumstances that would justify a contrary
composition of the bargaining unit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent however insists on the definition of the
appropriate bargaining unit upon the question of whether or not to exclude ad­mittedly
regular rank and file employees which it considers con­fidential, managerial
and technical.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This question, it should
be pointed out, does not enter the matter of defining the bargaining unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The definition of the appropriate unit refers
to the grouping or more pre­cisely, the legal collectivity of eligible
employees for purposes of collective bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pre­sumption is that these employees are
entitled to the rights to self-organization and collective bargain­ing,
otherwise they would not be, in the first place be considered at all in the
determination of the appropriate bargaining unit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The <span class="GramE">question therefore of excluding certain
rank and file employees for being allegedly confidential, managerial or tech­nical
does not simply involve</span> a definition of the bargaining unit but rather
raises the fundamental issue of coverage under or eligi­bility for the exercise
of the workers' rights to self-organiza­tion and collective bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On this score, the law on cover­age and
exclusion on the matter should by now be very clear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 244 of the Labor Code states that all
persons employed in commercial, industrial and agricultural enterprises, includ­ing
religious, charitable, medical or educational institutions operat­ing for
profit shall have the right to self-organization and to form, join, or assist
labor organizations for purposes of collective bargain­ing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Articles 245 and 246 (ibid) provide that
security guards and managerial employees are not eli­gible to form, assist or
join any labor organization.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As defined
by the Code, a managerial employee is one who is vested with powers or
prerogatives to <span class="GramE">lay</span> down and exe­cute management
policies and/or to hire, transfer, suspend, lay-off, recall, discharge, assign
or dis­cipline employees, or to effectively recommend such managerial
actions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All employees not falling
within this definition are considered rank and file employees for purposes of
self-organization and collective bargaining.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is in the light of the fore­going provisions of law that
the challenged order, in so far as it excludes all managerial and supervisory
employees, secretaries of bank officials, credit investi­gators, telephone
operators, loan security custodians, employees in the accounting, auditing,
legal, trust and personal departments respectively, should be modified for being
either superfluous, dis­criminatory or simply contrary to law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The express exclusion of managerial employees
in the Order is superfluous for the same is already provided for by law and is
presumed when the bargaining unit was defined as comprising all the regular
rank and file employees of the bank.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is also anomalous and discriminatory when it excluded employees of the
personnel depart­ment but included specific individ­uals like Manuel <span class="SpellE">Sumibcay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Primi</span> Zamora and
Carmelita <span class="SpellE">Sy</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Exclusion as managerial employee is not based on the personality of the
occupant but rather on the nature and function of the position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The exclusion of the other positions is
likewise con­trary to law, there being no clear showing that they are
managerial, employees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The mere fact of
being a supervisor or a confidential employee does not exclude him from
coverage.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He must strictly come within
the category of a managerial employee as defined by the Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution assures to all workers such
rights to self-organi­zation and collective bargaining.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exclusions, being the exception and being in
derogation of such constitutional mandate, should be construed in <span class="SpellE"><u>strictissimi</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>juris</u></span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Furthermore, to uphold the order of exclusion would be to
allow the emasculation of the workers' right to self-organization and to
collective bargaining; statutory rights which have received constitutional
recognition when they were enshrined in the 1973 Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the further rulings that 'other non-confiden­tial
employees included in the bank's list of proposed exclusion be allowed to vote
but the votes should be segregated as challenged' and 'that in case of doubt as
to whether or not the position held by an employee is confidential in nature,
the employee should be allowed to vote but his vote should be seg­regated as
challenged' both complete the said order's self-nullifying effects.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the most and indeed as a policy, exclusion of confidential
employees from the bargaining unit is a matter for negotiation and agreement of
the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the parties may agree
in the CBA, to exclude certain highly confi­dential positions from the bargain­ing
unit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Absent such agreement, coverage
must be observed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any event, any
negotiation and agree­ment can come after the represen­tation issue is resolved
and this is just the situation in the in­stant case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In fine, the appropriate bar­gaining unit shall include all
the regular rank and file employees of the respondent including the positions
excluded in the challenged order dated 19 November 1979, with the exception of
the secretaries to the Bank President, Executive Vice-President, Senior Vice
President and other Vice Presidents as agreed upon by the parties during the
hearings.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent vehemently inter­poses also the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of can­cellation proceedings against peti­tioner
as a prejudicial issue which should suspend the petition for certification
election.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>We cannot fully concur with this contention.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Unless there is an order of
cancellation which is final, the union's certificate of registration remains
and its legal personality intact.</span></u><span style="">&nbsp;
</span><u>It is entitled to the rights and privi­leges accorded by law,
including the right to represent its members and employees in a bargaining unit
for collective bargaining purposes including participation in a repre­sentation
proceeding.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>This is especially
true where the grounds for the cancellation of its union certificate do not
appear indubit­able</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<u>The <span class="GramE">rights of workers to
self-organization finds</span> general and specific constitutional guarantees.</u>
<u>Section 7, Article IV of the Philippine Constitution pro­vides that the
right to form associations or societies for purposes not contrary to law shall
not be abridged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right is more
pronounced in the case of labor.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Section
9, Article II (ibid) specifically declares that the State shall assure the
rights of workers to self-organization, collective bargaining, security of
tenure and just and humane conditions of work.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Such constitutional guarantees should not be lightly taken much less
easily nullified.</u><span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>A healthy
respect for the freedom of associa­tion demands that acts imputable to officers
or members be not easily visited with capital punish­ments against the
association itself</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the 30% consent requirement, respondent contends that the
bargain­ing unit is not appropriately defined hence, the med-arbiter's finding
that there was compliance with the 30% 'jurisdictional require­ment is patently
erroneous.' To this we must disagree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As
earlier stated, the definition of the appropriate bargaining unit does not call
for an actual head count or identification of the parti­cular employees
belonging thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is done in the
pre-election conference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is
sufficient that the bargaining unit is defined such that the employees who are
part thereof may be readily ascer­tained for purposes of exclusions and
inclusions during the pre-­election conference when the <span class="GramE">list
of eligible voters are</span> determined.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In this regard, respondent does not really seriously question
the 264 total <span class="GramE">number</span> of employees except for the
alleged exclusion which should reduce the number thus allegedly affecting the
sufficiency of the supporting signatures sub­mitted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already ruled against the exclusions
as <span class="SpellE">violative</span> of the constitutional guarantee of
workers' right to self-organization.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, since 188 of the 264 employees subscribed to the peti­tion,
which constitutes 70% of the total employees in bargaining unit, the 30%
consent requirement has been more than sufficiently com­plied with.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In any case, even if we grant the alleged
exclusions <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> about 45, the same will not give
any refuge to respondent's position.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For
assuming momentarily that the exclusions are valid, the same will not fatally
affect the 30% consent compliance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Finally, lest it be so easily forgotten, a certification
election is but an administration device for determining the true choice of the
employees in the appropriate bargaining unit as to their bargain­ing
representative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unnecessary obstacles
should not therefore be thrown on its way.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Rather, the parties should take their case, if they have, directly to
the real and ultimate arbiter on the matter, the employees sought to be repre­sented
in the bargaining unit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in the light of the foregoing considerations, the
Order dated 19 November 1979 call­ing for a certification election is hereby
affirmed with the modi­fication that the same shall be conducted among all the
regular rank and file employees of the re­spondent bank at its head and branch
offices, including those excluded in said Order, except only the positions of
secretary to the Bank President, Executive Vice-President and other
Vice-Presidents which agreed to be excluded from the bargaining unit by the

General filed with the Supreme Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
April 11, 1980 date must have been based on a draft order which was

however, that the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion as quoted in
the Manifestation is exactly the same as that in the Order eventually signed
and released by the Labor Minister on October 23, 1980" (p. 220, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Public respondents further averred that "(I)n any event,
whether the order is dated April 11, 1980 or October 23, 1980 will not matter
since both 'orders' dismissed the appeal of the respondent Bank, upon which
dismissal the Manifestation in Lieu of Memorandum dated September 30, 1980, of
public respondents, was based." Public respondents thus reiterated their
prayer that the instant peti­tion be dismissed for being allegedly moot and
academic (pp. 219-222, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">On December 5, 1980, petitioner filed a comment to
manifestation/motion of counsel for private re­spondent alleging <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> should the Honorable Court be minded to resolve the issue
raised in the Manifestation/Motion of private re­spondent - i.e. - whether the
alleged strike ban violation is a bar to a certification election, it will be
noted that the matter of whether there has been a 'violation' of the strike ban
or not is still to be heard by the Regional Director through Labor Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Crescencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Trajano</span> after this
Honorable Court dismissed G.R. No. L-52026 on the matter of jurisdictional
competence of the Regional Director to hear the question raised therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the present, although, the Regional
Director has commenced to act on the case, there is <u>no decision on whether
the strike ban has been violated</u> by the petitioner union." Petitioner
union vigorously asserted that while private respondent Bank has a pending
petition for cancellation of the registration certificate of herein petitioner
union, it is still premature for private respondent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Bank to claim that the petitioner union has
violated the strike ban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner then
alleged that "(T)here is also <u>no proof </u>or <u>decision</u> that acts
indulged in by the petitioner and its members <u>amounted to a strike</u> and
even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that such act (which
was the holding of a meeting for 30 minutes before office time in the morning)
constitutes a 'strike' and further that such act violates the strike ban.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It has been held through Honorable Justice
Antonio P. <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in <span class="SpellE">Petro­phil</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Malayang</span> <span class="SpellE">Manggawa</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> ESSO (75 SCRA 73) that only the leaders and members who
participated in the illegal activity are held responsible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>If this were so, then the rest of the
members who are innocent are still entitled to the benefits of collective bar­gaining</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is thus no need to delay the holding of
a certification election on the <u>alleged ground</u> that there is a pending
action of the respondent company against the petitioner union for 'violation of
the strike ban'" (pp. 226-227, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is likewise pointed out by petitioner union that even if it
would be ultimately confirmed that indeed petitioner union has violated the
strike ban, cancellation f the registration certificate of petitioner union is
not the only disciplinary action or sanction provided for under the law but
other penalties may be imposed and not necessarily can­cellation f its
registration certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 12, 1981, pursuant to the resolution of this Court
dated December 4, 1980, petitioner union filed its rejoinder which reiterated
the stand of the Solicitor General that the present case has become moot and
academic by virtue of the decision of the Minister of Labor affirming the
decision of the BLR Director which ordered a certification election (p. 230,
rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite obvious from the facts set forth above that the
question of jurisdiction vigorously asserted by herein private respondent Bank
has become moot and academic.</p>

<p class="BODY">What therefore remains for this Court to resolve is the issue as
to whether or not a certification election should be held under the
circumstances obtain­ing in the present case.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Is it proper to order a cer­tification election despite the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the petition to cancel herein petitioner
union's certificate of regis­tration?</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court rules in the affirmative.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the
petition for cancellation of the registration certificate of herein petitioner
union is not a bar to the holding of a certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">pen­dency</span> of
the petition for cancellation of the registration certificate of petitioner
union founded on the alleged illegal strikes staged by the leaders and members
of the <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span> union and petitioner union should
not suspend the holding of a certification election, because there is no order
directing such cancellation (cf. Dairy Queen Products Company of the
Philippines, Inc. vs. Court of Industrial Relations, et al., No. L-35009, Aug.
31, 1977).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said Dairy Queen case, one
of the issues raised was whether the lower court erred and concomitantly
committed grave abuse of discretion in disregarding the fact that therein <u>respondent
union's permit and license have been cancelled by the then Department of Labor
and therefore could not be certified as the sole and exclusive bargain­ing
representative of the rank and file employees of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>therein petitioner company</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the rationale of the decision was prin­cipally rested on
the subsequent rescission of the decision ordering the cancellation of the
registration certificate of the respondent union, thereby restoring its legal
personality and all the rights and privileges accorded by law to a legitimate
organization, this Court likewise declared: "<u>There is no showing,
however, that when the respondent court issued the order dated Decem­ber 8,
1971, certifying the Dairy Queen Employees Asso­ciation-CCLU as the sole and
exclusive bargaining representative of all regular rank and file employees of
the Dairy Queen Products Company of the Philippines</u>, Inc., for purposes of
collective bargaining with respect to wages, rates of pay, hours of work and
other terms and conditions for appointment, <u>the order of cancella­tion of
the registration certificate of the Dairy Queen Employees Association-CCLU had
become final</u>" (78 SCRA 444-445, supra, underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be worthy to note also that the petition for cancellation
of petitioner union's registration certificate based on the alleged illegal
strikes staged on <u>October 12, 1979</u> and later November 5-7, 1979 was
evidently intended to delay the early disposition of the case for certification
election considering that the same was apparently filed only after the <u>October
18, 1979 Order</u> of Med-Arbiter <span class="SpellE">Plagata</span> which
directed the holding of a certification election.</p>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the fact that the petition for cancel­lation of the
registration certificate of petitioner union has not yet been finally resolved,
there is another fact that militates against the stand of private respondent
Bank, the liberal approach observed by this Court as to matters of
certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In a recent
case, Atlas Free Workers Union (AFWU)-PSSLU Local vs. Hon. <span class="SpellE">Carmelo</span>
C. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>, et al.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(No. 51005, May 26, 1981), "/T/he Court resolves to grant the peti­tion
(for <i>mandamus</i>) in line with the liberal approach consistently adhered to
by this Court in matters of certification election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The whole democratic process is geared
towards the determination f representation, not only in government but in other
sectors as well, by election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
Court has declared its commit­ment to the view that a certification election is
crucial to the institution of collective bargaining, for it gives substance to
the principle of majority rule as one of the basic concepts of a democratic
policy" (National Mines and Allied Workers Union vs. Luna, 83 SCRA 610).</p>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, Scout Ramon V. <span class="SpellE">Albano</span>
Memorial College vs. <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>, et al. (L-48347, Oct. 3,
1978, 85 SCRA 494, 497, 498), this Court citing a long catena of cases ruled:</p>

<blockquote>"xx x 'The institution of collective bargaining is, to recall
Cox, a prime manifestation of industrial democracy at work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The two parties to the relation­ship, labor
and management, make their own rules by coming to terms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is to govern them­selves in matters that
really count.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As labor, however, is
composed of a number of individ­uals, it is indispensable that they be
represented by a labor organization of their choice.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This may be discerned how crucial is a certification
election.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So our decisions from the
earliest case of PLDT Employees Union v. PLDT Co, Free Telephone Workers Union
to the latest, Philippine Communications, Electronics &amp; Electricity
Workers' Federation (PCWF) v. Court of Industrial Relations, had made clear.'
The same principle was again given expression in language equally emphatic in
the subsequent case of Philippine Association of Free Labor Unions v. Bureau of
Labor Relations: 'Petitioner thus appears to be woefully lack­ing in awareness of
the signifi­cance of a certification election for the collective bargaining
process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the fairest and most
effective way of determining which labor organization can truly represent the
working force.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a fundamental
postulate that the will of the majority, if given expression in an honest
election with freedom on the part of the voters to make their choice, is
controlling.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No better device can assure
the institution of industrial democracy with the two parties to a business
enter­prise, management and labor, establishing a regime of self-rule.'<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>That is to accord respect to the policy of
the Labor Code, indis­putably partial to the holding of a certification
election so as to arrive in a manner defini­tive and certain concerning the
choice of the labor organization to represent the workers in a collective
bargaining unit</u>" (underlining supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is true that under Section 8, Rule II, Book V of the Labor
Code, cancellation of regis­tration certificate <u>may</u> <u>be</u> imposed on
the follow­ing instances:</p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Violation
of Articles 234, 238, 239 and 240 of the Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Failure
to comply with Article 237 of the Code;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Violation
of any of the provisions of Article 242 of the Code; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Any
violation of the pro­visions of this Book</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The aforementioned provisions should be read in relation to
Article 273, Chapter IV, Title VIII which explicitly provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 273.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Penalties.
--­(a) Violation of any provision of this Title shall be punished by a fine of
One Thousand Pesos /P1,000.00/ to Ten Thousand Pesos /P10,000.00/ and/or
imprisonment of one (1) year to five (5) years.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any person violat­ing any provision of this
Title shall be dealt with in accordance with General Order No. 2-A and General
Order No. 49.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><u>Violation
of this Title by any legitimate labor organization shall be grounds for
disciplinary action includ­ing, but not limited to, the cancellation of its
registration permit</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">From the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> provisions, We are
like­wise convinced that as it can be gleaned from said provisions,
cancellation of the registration certificate is not the only resultant penalty
in case of any viola­tion of the Labor Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Certainly, the penalty imposable should be commen­surate to the
nature or gravity of the illegal activities conducted and to the number of
members and leaders of the union staging the illegal strike.</p>

<p class="BODY">As aptly ruled by respondent Bureau of Labor Relations Director <span class="SpellE">Noriel</span>: "The rights of workers to self-organization
finds general and specific con­stitutional guarantees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 7, Article IV of the Philippine
Constitution provides that the right to form associations or societies for
purposes not con­trary to law shall not be abridged.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This right is more pronounced in the case of labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 9, Article II (ibid) specifically
declares that the State shall assure the rights of workers to
self-organization, collective bargaining, security of tenure and just and
humane conditions of work.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
constitutional guarantees should not be lightly taken much less easily
nullified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A healthy respect for the
freedom of association demands that acts imputable to officers or members be
not easily visited with capital punishments against the association
itself" (p. 8, Annex "J"; p. 66, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, THE WRIT OF <i>MANDAMUS</i> PRAYED FOR IS
GRANTED AND RESPONDENT BLR DIRECTOR NORIEL HEREBY ORDERED TO CALL AND DIRECT
THE IMMEDIATE HOLDING OF A CERTIFICATION ELECTION.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>NO COSTS.</p>
