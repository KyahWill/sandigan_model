Thereafter, trial on the merits ensued.</p>

<p class="BODY">To establish its case, the prosecution presented Lloyd Mahinay
and Ramon Pangilinan whose testimonies disclosed the following facts:</p>

<p class="BODY">At 10:00 o'clock in the evening of 14 November 1989 while Lloyd
Mahinay, a resident of Parola Beach, Barangay Bagong Silang, Puerto Princesa
City, was on his way home, he met a group of five persons.  One of them poked a gun at him and asked him
his name while the other four surrounded him.  He did not know the name of the gunwielder but he could see his face and
estimate his height as the place was "not so dark because there was also
moonlight." Then another person arrived and when he was about five meters
away from Lloyd, three members of the group met this other person.  Two of these three men held the newcomer
while the third poked a gun at him.  He
tried to struggle and one of the five persons shouted "<i>Paputukan mo</i>."
Another person from the group raised his hand and struck the man and the latter
fell to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the ground.  The man was then shot.  At this juncture, Lloyd tried to wrestle
with the person who was pointing a gun at him but the gun fired towards the
ground and the five panicked and ran away.  Lloyd also panicked and ran towards the water and then to the place
where his </span>companions <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">were.  He told them that he was waylaid by a group
of five men.  He and his companions then
returned to the place where he was waylaid to find out what happened to the
other person.  When Lloyd and his
companions reached that place, they found the other person lying on the
ground.  He turned out to be his
co-worker, Decoroso Cajes, whose voice</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Lloyd earlier
recognized when Decoroso was held by the two men and he purportedly asked those
who escorted him, </span>"<i>Ano ba ito, wala naman akong kasalanan sa
inyo</i>?" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">They then brought
Decoroso to the hospital and laid him down on a bed, but the doctor who
examined him told them that he was already dead.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Per the Post-Mortem Findings<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> of
Dr. Manuel R. Bilog, Assistant Head Health Officer of the City of Puerto
Princesa, Decoroso Cajes sustained the following injuries:</p>

<blockquote>"=  Abrasion with peripheral hematoma, upper lid
(left) about 1" long, penetrated the whole thickness of the muscular
tissues</blockquote>

<blockquote>=  Gun Shot wound -- mid occiput, with powder
burns, circular, with penetration to the Cranium (skull) producing worn-out
brain tissues.  Bullet slug lodged &amp;
recovered about 2" below the wound of entrance underneath the skin."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The cause of death was "shock; hemorrhage,
massive, intra and extra-cerebral; gunshot wound."</p>

<p class="BODY">Lloyd did not know the names of the five persons until 9 October
1990 when he testified; but since he stated that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">h</span>e can recognize their faces, he was asked to identify them in
court.  So, he went down from the
witness box and approached and tapped the shoulder of a person in the courtroom
who gave his name as Leopoldo Balangue.  Lloyd identified Balangue as the person who poked a gun at him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
He also pointed to four other persons in the courtroom as the companions of
Balangue.  They gave their names as Rene
Reyes, Rodelio Vidal, Alfredo Hangad and Allan Alulod.  When told to point to the person who
allegedly shot Decoroso Cajes, Lloyd touched the shoulder of Rodelio Vidal.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Ramon Pangilinan, a security guard, testified that at about 10:00
o'clock in the evening of 14 November 1989, while he was at his store near the
Parola Beach, he heard "some voices in the cottage at the beach." At
10:30 o'clock, he saw a group of about four persons going out of the Parola
Beach toward the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">poblacion</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Not so long thereafter, the group of Decoroso
Cajes followed the first group.  Then he
heard "a burst of a firearm," but he did not mind it.  Later, a commotion occurred and he learned
that Decoroso had been shot.  That same
evening he was interrogated by the police regarding the incident and he told
the police that he "saw them (the first group) going out the parola
beach"</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> but he could not identify </span>any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of them.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:

13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The defense presented a totally different account of what
occurred on the night of the incident.  The trial court summarized the version of the defense as culled from its
witnesses as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x the accused who are all students of PNAC-RIFT denied
the accusation against them and maintained that at the time of the incident in
question, they were all sleeping at the cottage of a certain Mrs. Abian whose
son Eugene was their classmate at PNAC-RIFT, Puerto Princesa City.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, at around three o'clock in the afternoon on November 14,
1989, Rene Reyes and some of his classmates, including all the accused, went to
the house of Eugene Abian at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the Parola
Beach to help the latter and his mother in cooking since it was the birthday of
Eugene.  Two hours later, some more
guests arrived and the birthday party started.  After partaking of the food, the guests were served beer and the
drinking spree started at around 7:00 p.m.  Beer flowed that night up to about 9:00 p.m. when Rene and his
classmates decided to rest already as they were very tired.  Upon the suggestion of Mrs. Abian, they all
slept and spent the night at the latter's cottage at the Parola Beach.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>At around 12:00 midnight, Rene was awakened by one of his
classmates so that they could bring Eugene to the hospital as the latter's
mouth was frothing.  Together with Allan
Ramos, Ramon Aballa and the driver of the tricycle, Rene brought Eugene to the
hospital.  On their way to the hospital
from the Parola Beach, they noticed a person sprawled on the ground along the
road.  But since they were in a hurry to
bring Eugene to the hospital, they just evaded the said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">person.  After having Eugene
treated at the hospital, Rene and company proceeded home.  (Testimony of Rene Reyes, Tsn: pp. 3-8, Oct.
22, 1990).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Lito Montero, a neighbor of Eugene Abian was the one who drove the
tricycle that brought the latter to the hospital.  He said they indeed noticed the person sprawled on the ground in
the middle of the road about 90 to 100 meters away from the Parola Beach, but
they just evaded him.  (Testimony of
Rene Reyes, Tsn: pp. 2-7, Oct. 23, 1990).  He added that he did not hear any sound of a gunfire on the night of
November 14, 1989 as he was then sleeping and was only awakened in order to
drive the tricycle.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused Rodelio Vidal, Allan Alulod and Leopoldo Balangue likewise
testified in Court and corroborated substantially the testimony of accused Rene
Reyes.  (Testimony of Rodelio Vidal,
Allan Alulod and Leopoldo Balangue, Tsn: pp. 4-23, October 26, 1990) Accused
Alfredo Hangad likewise corroborated substantially the testimonies of all his
co?accused in the instant case.  He further testified that during the said party, he and his companions
exploded firecrackers.  Moreover, in the
afternoon of November 14, 1989 before going to Eugene's place at Parola Beach,
he and his classmates were made to scatter fertilizer in the fishpond by the
use <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of their hands.  (Testimony of Alfredo Hangad, Tsn: pp. 4-14,
November 7, 1990).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. Manuel Bilog who conducted the autopsy on the deceased Decoroso
Cajes, also testified on his autopsy report and as to the trajectory of the
bullet.  (Testimony of Dr. Manuel Bilog,
Tsn: pp. 26-28, Nov. 7, 1990).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The forensic chemist of the National Bureau of Investigation Aida
Viloria-Magsipoc was the one who conducted the paraffin examination on all the
accused and witness Lloyd Mahinay.  The
former presented in Court copies of her Chemistry Reports finding all the
accused and prosecution witness Lloyd Mahinay positive for gunpowder nitrates.  (Testimony of Aida Viloria-Magsipoc, Tsn:
pp. 2-21, Feb. 5, 1991)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court believed that the prosecution's lone eyewitness,
Lloyd Mahinay, had positively identified those who attacked him and assaulted
and killed Decoroso Cajes.  It also
found that the findings of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) not only
sufficiently corroborated Mahinay's identification of the accused, they also
"furnished concrete evidence that all the 5 accused were together at the
time the victim was shot and killed in the evening of November 14, 1989 at
Barangay Bagong Silang, Puerto Princesa City."<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
Treachery, the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">further
ruled, attended the killing because the victim was "unarmed" and was
"suddenly and unexpectedly attacked." In addition, it found that
conspiracy existed among the accused who "were animated by a joint purpose
or design, concerted act and community of interest," and at the same time
it noted that they "were boisterous and most likely under the influence of
liquor having come from a birthday party with 2 of them armed with handguns
[and] were disposed to commit trouble on that particular evening in
question.  x x x [T]hey accosted for no
apparent reason any person they first met on the way."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The generic aggravating circumstances of
abuse of superior strength and nighttime were considered against the accused
but they were credited with the alternative circumstance of intoxication which
was deemed not habitual.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the trial court rejected the accused's version
of the incident because having been positively identified, their defense of
alibi fails.  Moreover, they were unable
to give a plausible explanation for the presence of gunpowder nitrates on their
hands.  Considering the testimony of the
NBI chemist that nitrates from gunpowder are different from nitrates produced
by firecrackers and fertilizers,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
their claim that they handled fertilizers before the party and lighted
firecrackers in the evening of the incident cannot be given any weight.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In their Notice of Appeal<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> filed
on 3 September 1991, after their motion for reconsideration was denied by the
trial court in its Order of 30 August 1991,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> the
accused informed the court that they were appealing the decision to the Court
of Appeals.  The records of the case
were, however, forwarded to this Court in view of the penalty imposed.  We accepted the appeal in the Resolution of
3 February 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their Appellants' Brief filed on 20 November 1992, the accused
contend that the trial court erred in:  (a)
convicting them despite the failure of the prosecution to present the quantum
of evidence required by the Constitution to secure a conviction beyond
reasonable doubt; (b) interpreting the testimony of the NBI chemist regarding
the presence of nitrates as conclusive evidence; (c) giving credence to the
lone testimony of the single prosecution witness which was self-serving,
biased, and gutted by doubt-inducing inconsistencies; and (d) interpreting the
true but legally considered weak defense of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">alibi as an absolute principle -- even in the absence of sufficient
prosecution evidence.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The accused maintain that the evidence of the prosecution was not
sufficient to convict them.  To them,
the positive identification made by the prosecution's lone eyewitness is
questionable for it followed the "almost ritualistic procedure where the
prosecution witnesses are simply made to point out the accused on the basis of
a simple '<span style="color:windowtext">if </span>I see him I can identify him
declaration,' and which accused are required to sit on an area conspicuously
reserved for them where they can be easily tagged." They likened this
procedure to a mock police line-up.  Moreover, they characterize the testimony of Lloyd Mahinay as
self-serving and biased.  His error in
positively identifying in court the person who allegedly poked a gun at him and
his initial failure to recognize his co-worker, Decoroso Cajes, even while he
was able to identify the accused with certainty exemplify the doubt surrounding
Lloyd's ability to positively identify the real killer or killers.</p>

<p class="BODY">They further contend that "while the NBI chemist was
presented as an expert in her field of expertise, she is by no means an expert
of renown whose probity is beyond question." Her testimony concerning
specks and smudges of nitrates on their hands was ambiguous.  They argue that if Rodelio Vidal was indeed
the gunman who shot and killed Decoroso Cajes, he should have had more smudges
on his hands than Lloyd Mahinay, which was not the case.  The official reports themselves do not make
a categorical finding that the nitrates came from gunpowder but only state that
the subjects were positive of nitrates.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, they stress that the weakness of the defense of alibi
does not relieve the prosecution of its burden of proving their guilt beyond reasonable
doubt.  Where the prosecution's evidence
is weak, the alibi of the defendant assumes importance.</p>

<p class="BODY">The determination of the accused's guilt or innocence in this
case hinges on the credibility of the prosecution's lone eyewitness, Lloyd
Mahinay.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is a settled doctrine that when the issue of credibility of
witnesses is involved, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings
of the trial court, considering that the latter is in a better position to
decide the question since it had heard the witnesses and observed their
deportment and manner of testifying during trial, unless certain facts or
circumstances of weight have been overlooked, misunderstood or misapplied
which, if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">We have likewise consistently held that the testimony of a single
witness, when credible and trustworthy, is sufficient to convict.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Our painstaking examination of the records and evaluation of the
evidence leads us to no other conclusion than that the trial court overlooked
or failed to appreciate vital facts and circumstances which cast doubt on the
identification by Lloyd <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Mahinay of the
accused </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the murderers of Decoroso Cajes.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Firstly, Lloyd admitted that the place was not well-lit and that,
although there was light coming from the moon, he could not recognize his
co-worker, Decoroso Cajes, the victim, whom he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

identify his co-worker at a distance of five meters except through the latter's
voice, then indeed the place was poorly lit, in which case Lloyd could not
reasonably be expected to see a gun much smaller than Decoroso, being poked and
then fired at the latter.  Moreover,
considering that Lloyd himself was attacked and assaulted with one person
holding him and another poking a gun at him, his attention would be focused at
that time on his two attackers and on his own safety and survival.  What is more logical under the circumstances
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">is </span>that since, as he claimed, he
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">heard the sound of a gunshot and he was
aware that Decoroso died from a gunshot wound, he merely inferred that there
was a gun and that it was fired at Decoroso.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Secondly, if indeed Lloyd was able to recognize the faces of the
accused, it is highly unlikely that he would make a mistake in identifying the
person who purportedly pointed a gun at him and from whom he tried to wrestle
it.  Yet, we note that on direct
examination, he tapped the shoulder of the accused <u>Leopoldo</u> <u>Balangue</u>
to confirm to the court that Balangue was the person in question, but on
cross-examination, he pointed to accused Alfredo Hangad as the person who
pointed the gun at him.  Thus, on cross-examination:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>Who among the 5 accused you identified were the
ones who held you?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is the one who held me, at the other
side, (pointing to the person who gave his name as Allan Alulod) and this
person is the one who was<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>holding the
gun (witness pointing to the person who gave his name as Alfredo Hanged when
asked)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">No attempt was made by the prosecution to
reconcile Lloyd's conflicting testimony on this very vital point.  He did not say that he inadvertently tapped
Leopoldo Balangue on the shoulder during the direct examination or that he
erred in pointing at Vidal.  It was the
trial court which opined in its decision that Lloyd "later corrected
himself and pointed to Alfredo Hangad."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a> To
us, it is not a simple case of correction.  The tapping of Leopoldo Balangue expressed a thousand words of
certainty, bordering on infallibility, that no one else except Leopoldo poked a
gun at him.  If subsequently, Lloyd
knowingly changed his testimony without even giving the courtesy of an
explanation, his alleged positive identification of the person who poked the
gun at him is placed in serious doubt, nay, altogether discredited.  The inevitable conclusion is that he was in
fact unable to recognize the man either by face or by name and that his
dramatic courtroom identification was contrived.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thirdly, his testimony given in court on 9 October 1990 that he
did not know the names of the accused until that day <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We also </span>wish to
point out that in that same statement of Lloyd, the name <u>Alfredo</u> <u>Hangad</u>
is written in ball pen in bold letters over the typewritten name <u>Noel</u> <u>Hernandez</u>,
and the name <u>Rene</u> <u>Reyes</u> is written also in ball pen in bold
letters over the typewritten name <u>Renato</u> <u>Balangue</u>.  Since the sworn statement is supposed to be
that of Lloyd Mahinay, they should have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

superimpositions on those very substantive matters, </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">viz.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the assailants.  But both
superimpositions are not initialed by any person.  These unexplained superimpositions cast a heavy toll on the
truthfulness of Lloyd Mahinay's testimony.  They even strongly suggest that it was the investigator himself who

the possession of the gun pointed at him by one of the five persons who waylaid

<p class="BODY">That the evidence clearly indicate that the gun Lloyd grappled
for was fired is crucial to us in the further assessment of the reliability of
Lloyd's testimony.  He testified that it
was Rodelio Vidal who shot Decoroso Cajes and that two shots from two different
guns, one which was poked at him and the other poked at Decoroso, were actually
fired.  As earlier adverted to, however,
prosecution witness Ramon Pangilinan testified that two groups of persons
passed by near his store at Parola Beach going toward the <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">poblacion</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

only one burst of gunfire or one shot was fired from a gun.  If we are to give credence to the testimony
of Lloyd Mahinay, this shot could be the one fired from the </span>gun <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">poked at him when he allegedly grappled for
its possession.  And since we seriously
doubt that Lloyd actually </span>saw <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Vidal
fire the gun at Decoroso Cajes, the only scenario that opens itself to us or
which we could reasonably reconstruct is that Lloyd himself was with that group
that Ramon Pangilinan referred to </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

Decoroso's group and the other, unidentified group in this way</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">--
someone from the latter confronted Lloyd with a gun; a rumble ensued thereafter

from the other group and fell to the ground; and at that particular instance,
any of the protagonists for the possession of the firearm must have
accidentally pulled the trigger and off went one bullet which hit Decoroso; all
panicked and ran away.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">If there was murder in the hearts of any of the accused, assuming
that they did compose the other group, we find it hard to believe that Lloyd
was not shot at but was just asked for his name when he was the first one to be
waylaid, held by one and poked with a gun by another.  The trial court did surmise or speculate on why the killing of
Decoroso happened:</p>

<blockquote>"As the Court appreciates the evidence, the Court can only
surmised [sic] that the unfortunate incident happened by reason of youthful
exuberance.  The 5 accused mostly in
their late teens and another in his early twenties were students and definitely
do not belong to the bad elements in town.  Their attendance in the birthday celebration of their co-student where
food and drinks flowed freely and made some or all of them affected by
alcohol.  In their youthful zest for
thrill and excitement and uninhibited by alcohol, they set out to try and prove
their manly ego around as they were with 2 handguns."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Conviction, however, cannot lie on mere
surmises or speculation.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, the guilt of the accused has not been proven beyond
reasonable doubt.  Our minds cannot rest
easy upon a conviction of the accused on the basis of the doubtful testimony of
the lone eyewitness, Lloyd Mahinay.</p>
