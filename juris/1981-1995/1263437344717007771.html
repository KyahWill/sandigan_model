				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">SPOUSES ALBERTO and
ERLINDA CAUSAPIN filed with this Court a petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>
of the decision of the Court of Appeals</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> in CA-G.R. No. CV-27272 promulgated 30
September 1992 reversing the trial court and dismissing their complaint for
reconveyance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 December 1992, private respondents filed their
Manifestation and Comment alleging that the instant petition was already moot
and academic as the decision under review had already become final and
executory and an entry of judgment issued by the Division Clerk of Court of the
Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this resolution, this Court addresses only the question of
whether the entry of judgment and transmittal of records were tainted with
irregularity and whether the court employees responsible therefor should be
held administratively liable.  The
merits of the instant petition will be discussed in a separate decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that on 27 October 1992, petitioners seasonably
filed a motion for extension of time to file petition for review, of which
motion the Court of Appeals was duly served copy on the same day as evidenced
by a registry receipt.  We granted the
extension and gave petitioners up to 26 November 1992 to file the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion for extension notwithstanding, the Court of Appeals,
through Atty. Jose V. de Guzman, Jr., Division Clerk of Court, issued on 10
November 1992 an Entry of Judgment stating that the decision rendered in "<i>Erlinda
Causapin, et al. v. Sps. Dominador de Guzman, et al.</i>" in CA-G.R. No.
CV- 27272 had on 28 October 1992 already become final and executory.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Three (3) days later, or on 13 November 1992, Mr. Arsenio B.
Sipin, Chief of the Archives Section, Court of Appeals, transmitted the records
to the Regional Trial Court of Biñan, Laguna.  On motion of private respondents, the Biñan trial court issued an order
of execution and declared its judgment <i>functus officio</i>.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The extraordinary haste with which the entry of judgment and
transmittal of records were made was brought to the attention of the Clerk of
Court concerned.  Consequently, on 22
January 1993, the Court of Appeals directed the Clerk of Court of the Regional
Trial Court of Biñan, Laguna, "to forthwith send back the records of Civil
Case No. B-2466 which, on the mistaken belief that the decision thereon on
appeal by this Court dated 30 September 1992, had already become final and
executory, were returned to the court of origin."</p>

<p class="BODY">In a resolution dated 27 January 1993, this Court commended the
prompt action of the Court of Appeals in ordering the immediate retrieval of
the transmitted records but noted its failure to address the question of why
the records of the case had not been properly verified first before entry of
judgment was effected and the records sent back to the court of origin despite
notice of a pending motion for extension of time to file petition for review
before this Court.  Considering the
far-reaching and serious repercussions of the error, we directed Atty. Jose V.
de Guzman, Jr., and Mr. Arsenio B. Sipin of the Court of Appeals to explain
within five (5) days from receipt why the entry of judgment was made posthaste
in CA G.R. No. CV-27272 and the records transmitted to the court of origin
despite receipt of the aforesaid motion for extension of time.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 15 February 1993, Atty. Jose V. de Guzman, Jr., submitted his
letter-explanation.  He alleged that in
preparing the entry of judgment in CA-G.R. No. CV-27272, he strictly followed
the standard procedure of the court, particularly Rule 11 of the Revised
Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals on Entry of Judgment, and that copy of
the subject decision was sent by registered mail to counsel of the appellees,
Atty. Alfredo U. Malabaguio, and received by him on 12 October 1992.  According to Atty. de Guzman, counting
fifteen (15) days from 12 October 1992, petitioners had up to 27 October 1992
within which to file their petition for review.  A mailing allowance of ten (10) days from 27 October 1992 was
observed to give time after receipt of the decision for Atty. Malabaguio, who
is based in Quezon City, to file his petition by mail.  On 6 November 1992, upon expiration of the
ten-day mailing allowance, he issued the entry of judgment four <span style="">(4) </span>days later, or on 10 November
1992.  Then on 12 November 1992 or two
(2) days after entry of judgment was made, he verified with and obtained a
clearance from their Judicial Records Division which certified that no motion
for reconsideration or notice of appeal to this Court was received per docket
book regarding subject case.  He
maintains that the entry of judgment was not made posthaste but was prepared in
strict compliance with the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 16 February 1993, Mr. Arsenio B. Sipin submitted his
letter-explanation contending that on 12 November 1992, the Division Clerk of
Court transmitted the entry of judgment to their Archives Section which
prepared the Letter of Transmittal of Records the following day, 13 November
1992; that after four (4) working days, or on 17 November 1992, the letter of
transmittal was transferred to the Mailing Section for delivery.  Mr. Sipin claims that the function of the
Archives Section is purely ministerial; that one of his duties is to remand
cases that have become final and executory to the court of origin upon their
receipt from the Division Clerks of Court so as not to be held liable for unnecessary
delay.</p>

<p class="BODY">In our Resolution of 9 June 1993, we found unsatisfactory the
explanation profferred by Atty. de Guzman, Jr.  We noted therein that notwithstanding his contention that he relied on
the clearance from the Judicial Records Division of 12 November 1992, it
appears that the clearance was only secured two (2) days after the issuance of
entry of judgment; hence, it is absurd for him to insist that entry of judgment
was based on a clearance issued.  Also,
he failed to verify first from the records whether any appeal from the decision
had been taken, or a motion for reconsideration, a petition for review, or a
motion for extension of time to file petition for review had been filed, before
finally issuing the entry of judgment.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same resolution, we likewise found the letter-explanation
of Mr. Sipin unacceptable.  The
statement of Mr. Sipin in his Letter of Transmittal of 13 November 1992 that
the judgment on the Causapin case was entered on 28 October 1992 is erroneous
since the judgment became final on 28 October 1992 and was entered only on 10
November 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the deficient explanations of Atty. de Guzman, Jr.,
and Mr. Sipin, we found a <i>prima facie</i> showing of administrative
misconduct on their part.  Consequently,
we referred the case to the <i>ponente</i> <span style="">in </span>CA-G.R. No. CV-27272 through the Presiding Justice of the
Court of Appeals for the former to conduct an investigation into the
surrounding circumstances regarding the premature entry of judgment and
transmittal of the records, and to submit a Report and Recommendation thereon
within thirty (30) days from receipt of our resolution.</p>

<p class="BODY">After conducting an investigation, the <i><span style="">ponente</span></i><span style="">, </span>Associate
Justice Ricardo P. Galvez of the Court of Appeals, submitted his Report and
Recommendation dated 3 December 1992.  In his report, Justice Galvez found that Atty. de Guzman, Jr., made the
entry of judgment on 10 November 1992 without verifying first from the Judicial
Records Division whether the losing parties had filed any petition/motion with
the Supreme Court; that he made the verification only two (2) days after the
entry of judgment, or on 12 November 1992; that when asked why he did not
immediately make the verification, he was quite evasive in answering that even
if he made the verification before he made the entry of judgment on 10 November
1992, it would not have made any difference since the motion for extension of
time to come to this Court filed by petitioner-spouses was received by the
Court of Appeals only on 9 November 1992, was recorded in the Judicial Records
Division in the afternoon of 12 November 1992, and was transmitted to his
office only on 9 December 1992.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Galvez also noted that it has been the standard operating
procedure for other Division Clerks of Court of the Court of Appeals to refer
first the matter of making an entry of judgment to the <i>ponente</i> through
an <i><span style="">agendum</span></i><span style=""> </span>and it is only after the approval by
the members of the Division when the entry of judgment is actually made.  In the subject decision, the matter of entry
of judgment was not placed in the agenda for the consideration of the members
of the Twelfth Division to which the case belonged.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the investigation, Atty. de Guzman, Jr., admitted that,
usually, it takes him about a week to forward the records to the Archives Section
after he makes the entry of judgment, but in the subject decision, he
transmitted the records to the Archives Section two (2) days after the issuance
of the entry of judgment since, according to him, there were no other pending
matters to be released to the Archives Section and the clearance had already
been secured.</p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Galvez, while finding no strong evidence of grave
professional misconduct in the actuations of Atty. de Guzman, Jr., concluded
nevertheless that the latter had not exercised the necessary prudence and
caution in the performance of his duties.  Considering the hurried issuance of the entry of judgment and the
transmittal of records by Atty. de Guzman, Justice Galvez recommends that he be
found guilty of misconduct in office only and that a fine of P2,000.00 be
imposed upon him.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to Mr. Sipin, Justice Galvez found that
notwithstanding his long experience with the Court of Appeals, Mr. Sipin is not
aware of the distinction between the date when judgment becomes final and the
date when entry of judgment is made.  Mr. Sipin claimed that he was only following the practice of his
predecessors-in-office of placing the date of finality of judgment in the space
alloted for the date of entry of judgment, as shown by samples of letters of
transmittals made by the previous heads of the Archives Section.  Justice Galvez concluded that while the
inefficiency of Mr. Sipin should not be tolerated, it would be too drastic to
recommend the imposition upon him of a more severe penalty than censure with
warning that a repetition of the same mistake may bring about a more drastic
penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rule 11 of the Revised Internal Rules of the Court of Appeals
provides the guidelines to be observed by the Division Clerks of Court and the
Archives Section in entry of judgments and remand of the records.  Section 5 thereof provides that after
promulgation of the decision or final resolution, it shall be the duty of the
Division Clerks of Court to see to it that the entry of judgment is made in due
time without undue delay.  As to when
final judgments and resolutions should be entered, Sec. 1 provides the general
rule that <span style="">in </span>civil and criminal
cases, unless a motion for reconsideration is filed or an appeal is taken to
the Supreme Court, judgments and final resolutions of the Court of Appeals
shall be entered upon the expiration of fifteen (15) days after notice to the
parties.  A motion for extension of time
to file petition for review should be considered part of the appeal
process.  However, Sec. 6 requires that
in making entries of judgments, the Division Clerks of Court shall determine
the finality of the decision by making allowance for delay of the mails,
computed from the last day of the period of appeal from the decision or final
resolution, as follows:   forty-five
days, if the addressee is from Mindanao, including Palawan; thirty days, if the
addressee is from Luzon, except Metro Manila; and ten days if the addressee is
from Metro Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records also show that petitioner-spouses received on 12
October 1992 the decision of the Court of Appeals dated 30 September 1992.  Hence, the fifteen-day period to appeal to
the Supreme Court would expire on 27 October 1992.  Applying Sec. 6, Rule 11, of the Revised Internal Rules of the
Court of Appeals, the Division Clerk of Court should enter the judgment after
ten (10) more days from 27 October 1992 to give allowance for delay of the mail
to petitioner-spouses who might have filed their appeal on time.  This ten-day period would expire on 6
November 1992, after which, the Division Clerk of Court should enter the
judgment without undue delay if the same has in fact become final and
executory.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before making the entry of judgment on 10 November 1992, Atty. de
Guzman, Jr., should have first ascertained that no motion for reconsideration,
appeal, petition for review, or motion for extension of time to file said
petition had been filed.  In the case
before us, he made the verification only two (2) days after the judgment had
already been entered.  His contention
that his delay in making the verification would not make any difference because
there was nothing yet in the records of the Judicial Records Division to show
that the motion for extension of time to file petition for review was received
by the Court of Appeals, cannot be accepted as a defense.  The fact remains that it is his duty and
responsibility to ensure that before entering judgments and resolutions, the
same have <u style="">truly</u> become final <span style="">and executory.  </span>He should not have limited his verification to the records
because, as it turned out, petitioner-spouses' Verified Urgent Motion for
Extension of Time to File Appeal By <i>Certiorari</i> was received by the Court
of Appeals on 9 November 1992 except that, for unknown reasons, it was not
promptly entered in the docket book.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11, par. c(2), Rule 1, of the Revised Internal Rules of
the Court of Appeals provides that the Division Clerks of Court shall, among
other duties and responsibilities, direct and supervise the staff of the <span style="">Division; </span><u>maintain the records of
the Division in an orderly manner; keep watch over the status and progress of
cases assigned to the Division; follow up papers, pleadings, motions, etc.,
filed with the Receiving Section in connection with any pending case and update
the records of all cases</u>.  It is
also their duty to maintain the correctness of the records by making the proper
entries and corresponding certificates of final and executory judgments or
orders.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">By his own admission, Atty. de Guzman, Jr., immediately released
the entry of judgment to the Archives Section for remand of the records two (2)
days after its issuance, which is contrary to his usual practice of waiting for
a week after the entry of judgment before transmitting the same to the Archives
Section.  While the law has always
exhorted government employees, those in the Judiciary included, to perform
their assigned tasks without undue delay, it should be emphasized that it
should be done with prudence and caution to effectuate order in the
governmental machinery, and never to defeat the exercise of a legitimate right
as in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The failure of Atty. de Guzman, Jr., to exercise the necessary
diligence required of his duties is negligence on his part which warrants
disciplinary action.  Consequently, we
impose upon him a fine of <span style="">P2,000.00 for
his failure to discharge the serious responsibility which his position entails.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">As regards the
administrative liability of Mr. Sipin for his premature remand of the records
to the court of origin, we also fine him P500.00.  The fact that it has been the practice of his predecessors-in-­office
to put the date of finality of judgment in the blank space reserved for the
date of entry of judgment in the prescribed form, assuming it to be true,
cannot be a justification for his error.  He is bound to adhere only to what the law provides, i.e., the date of
entry of judgment is the date of actual recording of the judgment in the book
of entries of judgments.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Indeed, the conduct and behavior of every
one connected with an office charged with the dispensation of justice is
circumscribed with the heavy burden of responsibility.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, this Court finds Atty. Jose V. de Guzman, Jr.,
Division Clerk of Court, and Mr. Arsenio B. Sipin, Chief of the Archives
Section, both of the Court of Appeals, GUILTY of negligence in the performance

of P2,000.00 is imposed upon Atty. Jose V. de Guzman, Jr., and P500.00 upon Mr.
Arsenio B. Sipin, the amounts to be paid by them within fifteen (15) days from
