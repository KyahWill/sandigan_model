<p class="BODY">Said judgment of respondent court is based on the findings of
fact set out in its decision thus:</p>

<blockquote>“Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, being a subdivision
developer, owned <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 14, Block 1 of the San Pedro
Compound IV at <span class="SpellE">Tandang</span> <span class="SpellE">Sora</span>,
<st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City</st1:place></st1:city>,
under Transfer Certificate of Title No. 277209.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On November 7, 1981, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> agreed
to sell said parcel of land to defendants-appellants on a package deal together
with a residential house per House Plan Model B-203 to be constructed thereon
for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">sum </span>of P202,980.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘B’).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As
therein stipulated, the defendants-appellants were to pay P42<span class="GramE">,980.00</span>
as equity - P30,133.00 as down payment and the balance of P12,847.00 upon
completion and delivery of the property, the other P160,000.00 to have been
funded through a <span class="SpellE">Pag-Ibig</span> Fund loan to be applied for
by defendants-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Central to the
above was a stipulation that in the event the housing loan <span class="GramE">be</span>
insufficient to pay the full contract price owing, they shall pay the same in
cash on or before occupancy and acceptance of the housing unit (ref. <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. <span class="GramE">‘B’, <span class="SpellE">para</span>.</span>
[e])<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span>
agreement further provided -<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘(f).<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failure of the
Vendee to comply with any or all of the above stipulations shall ipso facto
cancel this contract to sell; and thereupon, this contract to sell or any other
contract executed in connection thereof, shall be of no further force and
effect; and the title to the property, if already <span class="SpellE">transfered</span>
in the name of the Vendee, shall automatically revert to the Vendor.’<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>The foregoing stipulation encompassed the
necessity of transferring title to the lot to defendants-appellants as an accommodation
to enable their application for a housing loan in their names.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Hence, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> executed a
deed of sale over the lot (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘C’) in favor of
defendants-appellants, without additional consideration beyond the P30<span class="GramE">,133.00</span> down payment adverted to, and the issuance to said
defendants?appellants of Transfer Certificate of Title No. 29435<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">*</span></span></a> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘D’).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thusly accommodated, defendants-appellants
applied for a P160<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> housing loan with the First
Summa Savings and Mortgage Bank as an accredited financing institution.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“After initial approval in the amount applied for, the <span class="SpellE">Pag-Ibig</span> housing loan was downgraded to P128<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> after reassessment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under date of <st1:date year="1982" day="18" month="12">December 18,
 1982</st1:date>, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> apprised
defendants-appellants of said development (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘F’)
enclosing the formal bank <st1:date year="1982" day="16" month="12">December
 16, 1982</st1:date> letter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘E’) requiring a
co-borrower related within the fourth degree of consanguinity should the
defendants-appellants desire approval of an increased loan amount.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Defendants-appellants appear to have disdained a reply to
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee’s</span> said letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, under date of <st1:date year="1982" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1982</st1:date>, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
again wrote a follow-up letter to defendants-appellants (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
<span class="GramE">‘G’) affording the latter time to decide on their options, on
pain of enforcement of the terms of the contract to sell.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Failing reaction from defendants-appellants thereto, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> resorted to enforcement of the contractual
stipulations under date of <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="3">March 1,
 1983</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘H’) and remitted an enclosed
check for P30<span class="GramE">,133.00</span> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
‘I’) representing the equity paid in by defendants-appellants.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter accepted said check and deposited
same into their account.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Instead of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of title to the
lot, defendants-appellants however sought time to buy the property; plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> agreed provided that payment be effected in
cash.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendants-appellants failed to
make such payment in cash, despite the lapse of a second 30-day period afforded
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> demanded anew
for <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> in a <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="7">July 27, 1984</st1:date> letter (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. ‘J’).<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that approval of a P160<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
housing loan had been assured upon completion of the house with proof of its

respondent court denied petitioners’ motion for reconsideration, hence this
present petition raising the following issues:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS">I</p>

<blockquote>“The ‘Contract to Sell’ dated November 7, 1981 creates a reciprocal
obligation between Labrador Development Corporation, as seller, and spouses
Eduardo and Ann Agustin, as buyer, of the questioned house and lot.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">II</p>

<blockquote>“The failure of Labrador Development Corporation (LADECO) to
complete construction of the housing unit pursuant to the ‘Contract to Sell’
constitutes a substantial and serious breach thereof as would bar LADECO from
executing the option of cancellation (rescission) of the ‘Contract to Sell’ under
Article 1191 of the Civil Code.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">III</p>

<blockquote>“The justifiable refusal of Spouses Agustin to sign the ‘House
Acceptance Form’ certifying that they accept the house as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">100% </span>complete constitutes merely a
slight or casual breach of the ‘C<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">ontract
</span>to Sell’ which does not warrant the unilateral cancellation (rescission)
of the contract under par. 4(f) thereof and Article 1191 of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Civil </span>Code.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">IV</p>

<blockquote>“The remedy of <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> of title of
the property in question cannot be availed of by LADECO as there was no valid,
binding and effective cancellation (rescission) of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">‘Contract </span>to Sell’.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS">V</p>

<blockquote>“Private respondent LADECO is not entitled to attorney’s fees of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> under the facts and circumstances of the case.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We agree with the Court of Appeals that <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
is proper in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Herein
petitioners are already barred from questioning the validity of the
cancellation of the contract to sell by their acquiescence thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their acceptance and encashment of the checks
representing the total amount paid by them to private respondent as equity,
coupled by their failure to object or file an action, despite due notice, to
question the validity of the extrajudicial cancellation of said contract and to
ask for specific performance for more than one year, clearly show that they
assented to the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, after receiving the check refunding their equity
payment incident to the <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> desired by
private respondents, petitioners, disregarding the original agreement of the
parties, offered to purchase anew the property in question to which private
respondent agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This <span class="SpellE">novatory</span> agreement, however, was not consummated as
petitioners again failed to raise and pay the purchase price despite two 30-day
extensions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They never at that juncture
questioned the propriety of the rescission and <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
desired by private respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Obviously, extrajudicial rescission produces legal effects where the
other party does not oppose it.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, even assuming that there was no implied assent to the
cancellation of the contract to sell, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span> is
still proper.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The non-fulfillment by
petitioners of their obligation to pay, which is a <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span>
condition to the obligation of private respondent to sell and deliver the house
and lot, rendered the contract to sell and the subsequent contract executed
pursuant thereto ineffective and without force and effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contract between petitioners and private respondent is not an
absolute <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">sale </span>but a conditional
sale or contract to sell, whereby ownership is retained by the vendor until
full payment of the purchase price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Without such full payment, there is no obligation to sell and
deliver.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent execution of the
deed of absolute sale and the transfer and registration of the title of the lot
in the name of petitioners <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">is </span>of no moment, considering that the same, by mutual agreement of
the parties, was made without consideration and solely for the purpose of
facilitating the approval and release of the PAG-IBIG loan and not for the
purpose of actually transferring ownership.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the contract to sell, the obligation of petitioners to
completely pay the purchase price is a condition precedent to the obligation of
private respondent to sell and deliver the house as provided in the contract to
sell, which specifically states:</p>

<blockquote>“5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon complete payment
of the VENDEE/S of the purchase price herein above stated, and faithful
compliance with all his obligations stipulated therein, the VENDOR, agrees to
execute a valid deed of sale in favor of the VENDEE/S and cause the issuance of
the Certificate of Title in the name of the latter, free from all liens <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">encumbrances except those provided for in the Land Registration Act and
other laws, Presidential Decrees, General Orders, Letters of Instruction,
Zoning Ordinances, and the attached Deed of Restrictions, which form part of
this Contract; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> “</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The repeated failure and refusal of petitioners, despite due
notice, to look for a co-borrower related to them within the fourth degree of
consanguinity as required by the bank in order to prevent the downgrading of
the loan, nor to communicate to private respondent the arrangement they
intended to make regarding the difference between the approved loan of P128<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and the unpaid amount of P160,000.00, clearly
indicate their intention not to perform their obligations under the
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This constituted not only a
substantial or serious breach, but prevented the happening of the condition
precedent which would give rise to the obligation of private respondent to sell
and transfer ownership of the house and lot to petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>“In contracts to sell, where ownership is retained by the seller
and is not to pass until the full payment of the price, such payment, as we
said is a positive <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span> condition, the failure
of which is a not a breach, casual or serious, but simply an event that
prevented the obligation of the vendor to convey title from acquiring binding
force, in accordance with Article 1117 of the Old Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To argue that there was only a casual breach
is to proceed from the assumption that the contract is one of absolute sale,
where non-payment is a <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span> condition, which is
not the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
appellant overlooks that its contract with <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Myers is not the ordinary sale envisaged by Article 1592, transferring
ownership simultaneously with the delivery of the real property sold, but one
in which the vendor retained ownership of the immovable object of the sale,
merely undertaking to convey it provided the buyer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">strictly complied with the terms of the contract (see paragraph [d],
ante, page 5).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In suing to recover
possession of the building from Maritime, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
Myers is not after the resolution or setting aside of the contract and the
restoration of the parties to the status quo ante, </span>as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">contemplated by Article 1592, but precisely
enforcing the provisions of the agreement that it is no longer obligated to
part with the ownership or possession of the property because Maritime failed
to comply with the specific condition precedent, which is to pay the
installment as they fell due.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“The distinction between contracts of sale and contracts to sell
with reserved title has been recognized by this Court in repeated decisions
upholding the power of <span class="SpellE">promissors</span> under contracts<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> to sell in case of failure of the other
party to complete payment, to <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>

<p class="BODY">We repeat<span class="GramE">,</span> the obligation of petitioners
to fully comply with their undertakings was necessarily determinative of the
obligation of private respondent to complete the construction of the
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where one of the parties to a contract
did not perform the undertaking which he was bound by the terms of the
agreement to perform, he is not entitled to insist upon the performance of the
other party.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

For failure of one party to assume and perform the obligation imposed on him,
the other party does not incur in delay.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Correspondingly, we reject the argument of petitioners that the
failure of private respondent to complete the construction of the house
constitutes a substantial breach as <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">would
bar</span> the latter from <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> the
contract.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, the facts of this
case persuade us to hold that petitioners were merely posturing when, after
being required to <span class="SpellE">reconvey</span> the premises, they came up
with belated complaints about the imperfections or incompleteness of the house
involved, in the same manner that they also pretended to be interested in
purchasing the property but failed to do so after importuning private
respondents to grant them extensions of time for that purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">With the foregoing circumstances, <span class="SpellE">reconveyance</span>
is proper and <span class="SpellE">exigible</span> pursuant to Paragraph 4(f) of
the contract to sell quoted in the decision of respondent court, <u>supra</u>,
and on the basic principle that when an obligation has been extinguished or
resolved, it is the duty of the court to require the parties to surrender
whatever they may have received from the other, and the parties must be
restored, as far as practicable, to their original situation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">The award to private respondent of attorney’s fees, however, must
be disallowed considering that the award of exemplary damages was eliminated by
respondent court and the text of the decision of the trial court, which was
