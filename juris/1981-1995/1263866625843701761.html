the decision of the Regional Trial Court of Manila, Branch XLVI, in Civil Case

<p class="BODY">The records show that private respondent entered into a contract
of lease with petitioner for a period of three (3) years, that is, from 1976 to
1979.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the stipulated term expired,
private respondent refused to vacate the <span class="GramE">premises,</span>

former in the City Court of Manila, docketed therein as Civil Case No. 051063<span style="">-CV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
case was terminated by a judicially approved compromise agreement of the
parties providing in part:</p>

<blockquote>"3. That the term of the lease shall be renewed every three
years retroacting from October 1979 to October 1982; after which the
above-named rental shall be raised automatically by 20% every three years for
as long as defendant needed the premises and can meet and pay the said increases,
the defendant to give notice of his intent to renew sixty (60) days before the
expiration of the term;"<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">By reason of said compromise agreement the lease continued from
1979 to 1982, then from 1982 to 1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On
<st1:date year="1985" day="17" month="4">April 17, 1985</st1:date>, petitioner

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1986</st1:date>,
because of private respondent's refusal to vacate the premises, petitioner

Metropolitan Trial Court of Manila in Civil Case No. 114659-CV.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its decision of September 24, 1987, said
court dismissed the complaint on the grounds that (1) the lease contract has
not expired, being a continuous one the period whereof depended upon the
lessee's need for the premises and his ability to pay the rents; and (2) the
compromise agreement entered into in the aforesaid Civil Case No. 051063-CV
constitutes <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>
to the case before it.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the Regional Trial Court of Manila which,
in its decision of <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="1">January 28, 1988</st1:date>
in Civil Case No. 87-42719, affirmed <span style="">the

<p class="BODY">As stated at the outset, respondent Court of Appeals affirmed in
full said decision of the Regional Trial Court and held that (1) the
stipulation <span style="">in </span>the compromise
agreement which, in its formulation, allows the lessee to stay on the premises
as long as he needs it and can pay rents is valid, being a <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span>
condition and, therefore, beyond the ambit of Article 1308 of the Civil Code;
and (2) that a compromise has the effect of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's motion for reconsideration having been denied by
respondent Court of Appeals, this present petition is now before us.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find the same to be meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Contrary to the ruling of respondent court, the disputed
stipulation "for as long as the defendant needed the premises and can meet
and pay said increases" is a purely <span class="SpellE">potestative</span>
condition because it leaves the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> and
enjoyment of leasehold rights to the sole and exclusive will of the
lessee.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is likewise a <span class="SpellE">suspensive</span> condition because the renewal of the lease,
which gives rise to a new lease, depends upon said condition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">It </span>should
be noted that a renewal constitutes a new contract of lease although with the
same terms and conditions as those in the expired lease.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It should also not be overlooked that said
condition is not <span class="SpellE">resolutory</span> in nature because it is
not a condition that terminates the lease contract.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The lease contract is for a definite period
of three (3) years upon the expiration of which the lease automatically
terminates.</p>

<p class="BODY">The invalidity of a condition in a lease contract similar to the
one at bar has been resolved in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Encarnacion</span></u></span><u><span style="">
vs. <span class="SpellE">Baldomar</span>, et al.</span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
where we ruled that in an action for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>, the
defense interposed by the lessees that the contract of lease authorized them to
continue occupying the premises as long as they paid the rents is untenable,
because it would leave to the lessees the sole power to determine whether the
lease should continue or not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated
therein, "(<span class="SpellE">i</span><span class="GramE">)f</span> this
defense were to be allowed, so long as defendants elected to continue the lease
by continuing the payment of the rentals, the owner would never be able to
discontinue it; conversely, although the owner should desire the lease to
continue, the lessees could effectively thwart his purpose if they should
prefer to terminate the contract by the simple expedient of stopping payment of
the rentals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This, of course, is
prohibited by the aforesaid article of the Civil Code:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(8 <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Manresa</span></st1:place></st1:city>,
3d ed., pp. 626, 627; <span class="SpellE">Cuyugan</span> vs. <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>,
34 Phil. 100.)"</p>

<p class="BODY">The continuance, <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> and
fulfillment of a contract of lease cannot be made to depend exclusively upon
the free and uncontrolled choice of the lessee between continuing the payment
of the rentals <span class="GramE">or</span> not, completely depriving the owner
of any say in the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Mutuality does
not obtain in such a contract of lease and no equality exists between the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> and the lessee since the life of the contract is
dictated solely by the lessee.</p>

<p class="BODY">The interpretation made by respondent court cannot, therefore, be
upheld.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 3 of the compromise
agreement, read and interpreted in its entirety, is actually to the effect that
the last portion thereof, which gives the private respondent sixty (60) days
before the expiration of the term the right to give notice of his intent to
renew, is subject to the first portion of said paragraph that "the term of
the lease shall be renewed every three (3) years," thereby requiring the
mutual agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The use
of the word "renew" and the designation of the period of three (3)
years clearly confirm that the contract of lease is limited to a specific
period and that it is not a continuing lease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The stipulation provides for a renewal of the lease every three (3)
years; there could not be a renewal if said lease did not expire, otherwise
there is nothing to renew.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Resultantly, the contract of lease should be and is hereby
construed as providing for a definite period of three (3) years and that the
automatic increase of the rentals by twenty percent (20%) will take effect only
if the parties decide to renew the lease.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>A contrary interpretation will result in a situation where the continuation
and <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the contract will depend only upon
the will of the lessee, <span style="">in </span>violation
of Article 1308 of the Civil Code and the aforesaid doctrine in <span class="SpellE"><u>Encarnacion</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The compromise agreement should be understood as bearing that import
which is most adequate to render it effectual.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
Where the instrument is susceptible of two interpretations, one which will make
it invalid and illegal and another which will make it valid and legal, <span class="GramE">the</span> latter interpretation should be adopted.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, perpetual leases are not favored in law, nor are <span class="SpellE">convenants</span> for continued renewals tending to create a
perpetuity, and the rule of construction is well settled that a covenant for
renewal or for an additional term should not be held to create a right to
repeated grants in perpetuity, unless by plain and unambiguous terms the
parties have expressed such intention.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
A lease will not be construed to create a right to perpetual renewals unless
the language employed indicates clearly and unambiguously that it was the
intention and purpose of the parties to do so.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
A portion in a lease giving the lessee and his assignee the right to perpetual
renewals is not favored by the <span class="GramE">courts,</span> and a lease
will be construed as not making such a provision unless it does so clearly.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">As we have further emphasized:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is also important to bear in mind that in a reciprocal
contract like a lease, the period of the lease must be deemed to have been
agreed upon for the benefit of <u>both parties</u>, absent language showing
that the term was deliberately set for the benefit of the lessee or <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are
not aware of any presumption in law that the term of <span style="">a </span>lease is designed for the benefit of the lessee alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><u>Koh</u></span> and <u>Cruz</u>
in effect rested upon such a presumption.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But that presumption cannot reasonably be indulged in casually in<span style=""> </span>an era of rapid economic change,
marked by, among other things, volatile costs of living and fluctuations in the
value of the domestic currency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
longer the period the more clearly unreasonable such a presumption would
be.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In an age like that we live in, very
specific language is necessary to show an intent to grant a unilateral faculty
to extend or renew a contract of lease to the lessee alone, or to the <span class="SpellE">lessor</span> alone for that matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We hold that the above-quoted rulings in <span class="SpellE"><u>Koh</u></span><u> v. <span class="SpellE">Ongsiaco</span></u> and
<u>Cruz v. Alberto</u> should be and are overruled."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In addition, even assuming that the clause "for as long as
the defendant needed the premises and can meet and pay said increases"
gives private respondent an option to renew the lease, the same will be
construed as providing for but one renewal or extension and, therefore, was
satisfied when the lease was renewed in 1982 for another three (3) years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A general covenant to renew is satisfied by
one renewal and will not be construed to confer the right to more than one
renewal unless provision is clearly and expressly made for further renewals.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
Leases which may have been intended to be renewable in perpetuity will
nevertheless be construed as importing but one renewal if there is any
uncertainty in that regard.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Buccat</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Dispo</span>, et al.</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
relied upon by respondent court, to support its holding that respondent lessee
can legally stay on the premises for as long as he needs it and can pay the
rents, is not in point.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said case,
the lease contract provides for an indefinite period since it merely stipulates
"(t<span class="GramE">)hat</span> the lease contract shall remain in full
force and effect as long <span style="">as </span>the
land will serve the purpose for which it is intended as a school site of the
National Business Institute, but the rentals now stipulated shall be subject to
review every after ten (10) years by mutual agreement of the parties."
This is in clear contrast to the case at bar wherein, to repeat, the lease is
fixed at a period of three (3) years although subject to renewal upon agreement
of the parties, and the clause "for as long as defendant needs the
premises and can meet and pay the rents" is not an independent stipulation
but is controlled by said fixed term and the option for renewal upon agreement
of both parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the second issue, we agree with petitioner that respondent
court erred in holding that the <span style="">action </span>for
<span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> is barred by <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>While it is true that a compromise agreement <span style="">has </span>the effect of <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span>, this doctrine does not apply in the
present case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is elementary that for
a judgment to be a bar to a subsequent case, (1) it must be a final judgment,
(2) the court which rendered it had jurisdiction over the subject matter and
the parties, (3) it must be a judgment on the merits, and (4) there must be
identity between the two cases as to parties, subject matter and cause of
action.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the fourth requisite is lacking.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although there is identity of parties, there
is no identity of subject matter and cause of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subject matter in the first <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case is the original lease contract while the
subject matter in the case at bar is the lease created under the terms provided
in the subsequent compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lease executed in 1978 is one thing; the lease constituted in 1982
by the compromise agreement is another.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There is also no identity in the causes of action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The test generally applied to determine the
identity of causes of action is to consider the identity of facts essential to
their maintenance, or whether the same evidence would sustain both causes of
action.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the <span class="SpellE">delict</span> or the wrong in the
first case is different from that in the second, and the evidence that will
support and establish the cause of action in the former will not suffice to
support and establish that in the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case, the cause
of action <span style="">was </span>private
respondent's refusal to comply with the lease contract which expired on <st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="12">December 31, 1978</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the present case, the cause of action is <span style="">a similar </span>refusal but with respect to
the lease which expired in October, 1985 under the compromise agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the compromise agreement may be <span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">judicata</span></u></span><span style=""> </span>as
far as the cause of action and issues in the first <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>
case is concerned, any cause of action that arises from the application or
violation of the compromise agreement cannot be said to have been settled in
said first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The compromise
agreement was meant to settle, as it did only settle, the first case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It did not, as it could not, cover any cause
of action that might arise thereafter, like the present case which was founded
on the expiration of the lease in 1985, which necessarily requires a different
set of evidence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the compromise
agreement was judicially approved does not foreclose any cause of action
arising from a violation of the terms thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the decision of respondent Court of Appeals is
REVERSED and SET ASIDE.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Private respondent
