<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Tito and Federico were arraigned on April
17, 1986.  They pleaded not guilty<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
and underwent trial.  Roberto Balanag,
on the other hand, has remained at large.  Before the prosecution could finish cross-examining Tito Balanag, he
absconded.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
He was thus tried <b><i><span style="">in absentia.<o:p></o:p></span></i></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The essential facts came mainly from the testimonies of
eyewitnesses Iluminada Lopez <span style="">and
Genoveva Lopez y Obra.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On November 24, 1985, at about 7:30 P.M., GUILLERMO LOPEZ, SR., a
dentist, was talking to his wife, ILUMINADA LOPEZ, in the living room of their
house, situated in Sitio Salapac, Aringay, La Union, while their daughter,
GENOVEVA LOPEZ y OBRA, was in the kitchen, brushing her teeth.  Suddenly, three (3) men barged into the
front door of Dr. Lopez' house.  Iluminada and Genoveva recognized two (2) of them as their neighbors
TITO BALANAG (a.k.a. Andres) and FEDERICO BALANAG (a.k.a. Pedring).  The third man, whom the Lopezes had seen for
the first time, was later identified as SERAFIN DACANAY, a <i><span style="">"compadre"</span></i><span style=""> </span>of Federico.</p>

<p class="BODY">Serafin immediately <span style="">announced
</span>a "hold-up." He poked a gun at the head of Iluminada, held her
arm and then led her towards Genoveva's room on the second floor of the
house.  Serafin demanded money and other
valuables from Iluminada.  She then
summoned Genoveva to give her the keys to the cabinet.  Her daughter followed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon seeing Genoveva upstairs, Serafin also poked the gun at her
head.  Genoveva thus obediently
proceeded towards the cabinet, near the door of her room, and she was about to
open the cabinet when her father, Dr. Lopez, rushed upstairs.  As Dr. Lopez was ascending the stairs,
Serafin yelled at him saying:  <span style="">"<b><i>Okinam nga lakay sica ti
ngangidarum quen Berto Balanag </i></b></span>(Vulva of your mother, you are
(sic) the one (who) filed a case against Berto Balanag."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
He shot Dr. Lopez who fell down the stairs which had no railings.  Downstairs, the victim was met by accused
Tito Balanag who stabbed him (the victim) with a dagger.  Serafin then went downstairs and, likewise,
stabbed the victim.  Seeing the helpless
condition of her father, Genoveva screamed.  She and her mother also rushed downstairs.  Iluminada thought of asking for help from their neighbors.  Thus, she ran past her husband and proceeded
outside their house thru the backdoor.  Genoveva, on the other hand, went to her father's aid as Serafin
continued assaulting her father.  During
the commotion, Tito and Federico fled, taking with them Genoveva's shoulder bag
containing a diamond ring and earrings worth three thousand pesos (P3,000.00);
fifty dollars (US $50.00) cash; two hundred pesos (P200.00) cash; and a
mini-stereo cassette, valued at P2,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Iluminada had barely stepped out of the house when she was
blocked by "Berto" (Roberto) Balanag, Tito's father, who aimed his
gun at her.  Iluminada quickly retreated
to the house and closed the backdoor.  She stood behind the door and locked it <span style="">as </span>Berto tried to force his way in.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, Genoveva and Serafin grappled for the <i><span style="">bolo </span></i>of the latter.  Irked, he lunged at her, but she bravely
parried the thrust with her arm.  Her
left forefinger was cut in the process.  Serafin also fired at her but missed.  By stroke of luck, Genoveva managed to get a <i><span style="">bolo</span></i><span style=""> </span>and
attacked Serafin in self defense.  Serafin died.  So did the wounded
Dr. Lopez.  Several neighbors of the
Lopezes who heard the commotion arrived at the scene.  One of them, a certain Jose Dulay, reported the incident to the
authorities.</p>

<p class="BODY">That evening, police authorities, namely:  Station Commander P/Sgt. Alejandro Basallo,
Pfc. Benjamin Rulloda, Pat. Simeon Madarang, and Pat. Wilson Argame inspected
the <i>locus criminis.</i>  They found
the bloodied bodies of Dr. Guillermo Lopez and Serafin Dacanay, sprawled on the
floor.  They also recovered the
following:  a Ruby Magnum, Cal. 22, with
serial no. 05522; two (2) bolos soiled with blood; a double bladed dagger; six
(6) empty shells; and one live ammunition found inside the gun's chamber.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Armando Avena, Medical Officer of the Rural Health Unit of
Doña Gregoria Memorial District Hospital in Aringay, La Union, conducted the
postmortem examination on the victim's body.  Based on his examination, Dr. Lopez sustained abrasion wound, two (2)
stab wounds, and multiple gunshot wounds (on the right breast upper outer
quadrant, right zygomatic area and right upper lip).<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> Dr.
Avena also treated Genoveva Lopez Obra who sustained lacerated wound on the 3rd
left forefinger.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">According to the widow, Iluminada, her dentist husband used to
earn P10,000.00 monthly.  At the time of
her husband's death, they had three (3) children in college.  She suffered mental anguish and could hardly
sleep or eat upon her husband's death.  During the two weeks wake for her deceased husband, she spent, more or
less, P25,000.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">Federico Balanag interposed the defense of alibi.  In the morning of November 24, 1985, he was
allegedly in a farm in Salapac, Aringay, La Union, together with his brother
Renato and mother-in-law, Florencia Hidalgo.  At about 5:00 P.M., after a day's work of threshing <i>palay</i>, they
proceeded towards Federico's house.  They
arrived home at 5:30 P.M., and dined together thirty minutes later.  Thereafter, Federico slept in the room with
his youngest son Ronald.  His <span style="">wife, </span>Teresita and the rest of the
family went to bed at 8:00 P.M.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to Teresita, her husband was sound asleep when she woke
up at around 11:00 P.M. to urinate.  She
then nursed her eight-month old baby and stayed awake until midnight.  At around 2:00 A.M. the following day, the
policemen came and took her husband with them.  She learned later that Dr. Lopez had been killed.  She and her daughter Gina visited Federico
in jail.  On their way to the municipal
building, they passed by the house of the victim.  There were several persons in the vicinity but she did not
inquire what happened.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the police station, Teresita noticed that her husband had
bruises.  He then told her he was
manhandled by Station Commander Alejandro Basallo.</p>

<p class="BODY">Gina Balanag corroborated the testimonies of her parents
pertaining to the whereabouts of her father, the accused-appellant.  She averred that on November 24, 1985, she
went to school at about 6:30 A.M.  She
returned home from school at 4:30 P.M.  She saw her father an hour later.  Her father slept at 7:30 P.M. after dinner.</p>

<p class="BODY">She claimed further that, at about 6:30 A.M., the morning
following the incident, she was on her way to school.  As she was nearing the house of Dr. Lopez, Genoveva and the
latter's sister who was then carrying a wooden stick ("<i>malo</i>"),
were waiting for her (Gina) and her companions ("<i>Agharang da amin</i>").  She decided to skip school.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Balanags described their dwelling as a one room house that it
would not be possible for them to leave without being seen <span style="">or </span>noticed by the other members of the
family.  Prior to the robbery and
killing, the Balanags <span style="">were </span>in
good terms with the Lopezes.  Federico
denied he was in the company of his cousin Tito Balanag and Serafin Dacanay
that fateful evening of November 24, 1985.  He admitted, however, that Serafin was the godfather of one of his
children.</p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <i>a quo </i>found Federico Balanag and
his co-accused Tito Balanag guilty of Robbery with Homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
They were meted the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i>.  The court <i>a quo</i> also ordered
accused-appellant and Tito Balanag, to indemnify, solidarily, the heirs of the
deceased Dr. Guillermo Lopez, the following amounts:</p>

<blockquote>a) P  50,000.00 -- for the death of Guillermo Lopez;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b) P  48,110.00 -- as actual damages;</blockquote>

<blockquote>c) P  20,000.00 -- as moral damages; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>d) P172,000.00 -- for loss of earning
capacity.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Both accused appealed.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a> However,
Tito Balanag, who has remained at large, did not file the required Appellant's
Brief.  His appeal was considered
abandoned for failure to prosecute his appeal and, more importantly, for his
refusal to submit himself to the jurisdiction of the authorities.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant Federico Balanag now contends:</p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN CONVICTING
THE ACCUSED, FEDERICO BALANAG, OF THE COMPLEX CRIME OF ROBBERY WITH HOMICIDE
AND/OR IN NOT EXONERATING HIM OF THE OFFENSE."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We affirm the judgment of conviction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prefatorily, the defense assails the validity of the Criminal
Complaint, dated November 27, 1985,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a> and
the amended Criminal Complaint, dated December 2, 1985,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
filed by investigating officer P/Sgt. Alejandro Basallo, on the ground that the
owner of the stolen items Genoveva Lopez y Obra, was not identified.  She was merely referred to as the
"offended party." Accused-appellant avers that a valid complaint for
robbery, must specify the owner of the stolen property, considering that the
phrase "personal property belonging to another," as an essential
element of the crime of robbery, should be clearly established.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
He claims, further that he could not be convicted of the crime of robbery with
homicide since the victim of the robbery, Genoveva Lopez y Obra, did not file
any complaint for robbery, and the person killed, Dr. Guillermo Lopez, was not
robbed of his personal belongings.  The
argument lacks merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">We need not delve lengthily on the cited defect in the Criminal
Complaint and Amended Criminal Complaint since the said error was corrected in
the Information, dated March 14, 1986.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a> Said
information alleged that the stolen items belong to Genoveva Lopez y Obra,
daughter of Dr. Guillermo Lopez.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have also ruled that in this kind of a complex crime, the victim
of the robbery need not necessarily be the victim of homicide.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, in <b><i>People vs. Disimban</i></b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a> we
affirmed the conviction of the accused for robbery with homicide although the
robbery victim was different from the homicide victim.  There is <i>robo </i><i><span style="">con homicido</span></i><span style=""> </span>even if the victim killed was an
innocent bystander.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> Or
that death supervened by mere accident, provided that the homicide was produced
by reason or on the occasion of robbery, inasmuch as it is only the result
obtained, without reference or distinction <span style="">as </span>to the circumstances, causes, modes or persons intervening in
the commission of the crime, that has to be taken into consideration.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
In the recent case of <b><i><span style="">People </span>vs.
Pamintuan</i></b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a> the
accused prisoners were held liable for robbery with homicide although the items
robbed, <i>i.e</i>., <span style="">five </span>(5)
shotguns and three (3) guns, Ruby Cal. 22, belong to the armory of the
Provincial Jail of San Fernando, Pampanga, and not the personal properties of
the homicide victims, the provincial jail guards.</p>

<p class="BODY">We now come to the more important issue of whether the guilt of
accused-appellant was established beyond reasonable doubt.  We rule in the affirmative.</p>

<p class="BODY">At least two credible witnesses, Iluminada and Genoveva,
positively identified accused-appellant Federico Balanag as among those who
barged into their house that tragic evening.  Genoveva even saw accused-appellant when he fled from the scene, taking
with him a mini-stereo cassette.  These
eyewitnesses could not have been mistaken as they knew Federico and Tito even
before the incident.  The records reveal
that the Lopezes and the Balanags were neighbors since birth.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It was also not improbable for the eyewitnesses to recognize the
faces of the culprits.  According to
Genoveva, the accused were not wearing masks, albeit Serafin was wearing a
hat.  At that time, too, the place of
incident was well lighted as 50 watts electric bulbs, installed along the
porch, in the living room and the kitchen, were on.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="BODY">The credibility of these eyewitnesses is further enhanced by the
fact that Iluminada and Genoveva had no ill feelings against Federico prior to
the incident.  Accused-appellant himself
confirmed this lack of ill motive.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, we see no reason to depart from the well established rule that when there
is no evidence to show that the prosecution witnesses were actuated by improper
motive, their identification of the accused should be given full faith and
credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Nonetheless, accused-appellant stresses that nobody testified on
his participation to the killing.  He
points out that, since there was no proof of conspiracy, he could not be held
responsible for the death of Dr. Lopez.  We hold otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">Conspiracy need not be proved by direct evidence of prior
agreement to commit the crime.  It could
be inferred from the conduct of the accused before, during or after the
commission of the crime, showing that the accused had acted in unison with each
other, evincing a common purpose or design.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> The
circumstances in field show the existence of conspiracy among accused-appellant
and his cohorts.  Federico, Serafin and
Tito simultaneously barged thru the front door of Dr. Lopez' residence.  To further secure the area, Roberto Balanag
stood on guard at the back portion of the house.  Serafin then led Iluminada upstairs, while Tito and Federico stayed
downstairs.  Their plan was almost
perfect and would have been successful if Dr. Lopez did not attempt to rescue
his wife and daughter from Serafin.  Dr.
Lopez' unexpected resistance, albeit futile in the hands of the armed robbers,
aborted the well-planned robbery.  Thus,
Tito and Federico hastily got Genoveva's shoulder bag and the mini-stereo
cassette.  They fled together, leaving
behind Serafin who was still grappling with Genoveva.  Without a doubt, accused-appellant acted in unison and cooperated
with his companions in committing the robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is settled that when homicide is committed as a consequence or
on the occasion of the robbery, all those who took part as principals in the
robbery will also be liable as principals of the special crime of robbery with
homicide, although they did not actually take part in the homicide.  The exception to the rule is when it is
clearly shown that they endeavored to prevent the unlawful killing.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, there is no evidence that accused-appellant tried to prevent the
killing of Dr. Lopez.  His claim of
innocence is belied by the fact that, after Dr. Lopez was shot and stabbed by
his cohorts, he carried away the mini-stereo cassette of the Lopezes.  Accused-appellant was, therefore, correctly
found guilty of the special complex crime of robbery with homicide.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accused-appellant's defense of alibi cannot succeed because of
circumstances pointing to its contrived nature and his positive identification
by the prosecution witnesses.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a> The
records show that accused-appellant's house was about 120 meters from the house
of the Dr. Lopez, thus, it was not physically impossible for him to be at the
scene of the crime and to commit the crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The testimonies given by accused-appellant's wife and daughter <i>vis-a-vis</i>
that of eyewitnesses Iluminada and Genoveva, do not inspire belief.  For one, Gina lied when she testified she
attended school on November 24, 1985.  When confronted that it was a Sunday, she got confused and said she went
to school on November 22, 1985 or January 22, 1985.  Gina also denied knowing Dr. Lopez, only to admit later that she
knew him as he was their neighbor.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> She
also claimed that Genoveva and her sister waited for them after the incident,
prompting her not to proceed to school.  On cross-examination, however, Gina admitted that she was not sure if
they were really waiting for them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of Teresita appears to be more consistent in
contrast to her daughter's story.  However, the trial court gave greater credence on the prosecution witnesses'
testimonies.  It is settled that when
the issue of credibility of witnesses is involved, appellate courts will
generally not disturb the findings of the trial court considering that the
latter is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the
witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying
during the trial, unless certain facts of value have been plainly overlooked
which if considered, might affect the result of the case.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Robbery with Homicide is punishable with <i>reclusion perpetua</i>,
notwithstanding the aggravating circumstances attending the commission of the
crime,<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
since at the time of the commission of the offense, Congress had yet to restore
the imposition of death penalty.</p>

<p class="BODY">In connection with the civil liability of accused-appellant, the
award of P48,110.00, for actual or compensatory damages, is not fully supported
by evidence.  The records show that the
total amount incurred for burial/funeral expenses was P19,482.00, not
P23,110.00.<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Anent Mrs. Lopez' additional claim of P25,000.00 for the expenses
incurred during the two weeks wake for the victim, we find the said claim
reasonable considering the social standing of the Lopezes in the
community.  The Lopezes are prominent in
their place, not to mention they belong to a big family, (Mr. and Mrs. Lopez
sired 13 children, most of whom are professionals and gainfully employed).  The total award for actual damages should
then be P44,482.00, and not P48,110.00.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the claim for <span style="">loss </span>of earning capacity of the victim, we note that the victim
was already 69 years old at the time he was killed on November 24, 1985.  His income <span style="">as </span>a dentist was P10,000.00 per month, or P120,000.00 per
annum.  After deducting therefrom the
necessary and incidental expenses which the victim would have incurred if he
were alive, the court <i><span style="">a quo,</span></i><span style=""> </span>declared that the victim's annual net
income would be P24,000.00.  The trial
court multiplied his net annual income by his life expectancy of seven (7)
years and two (2) months,<a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a> hence,
P172,000.00 was awarded for loss of the earning capacity of the victim.</p>

<p class="BODY">In computing the loss of the earning capacity of the victim,
several factors are considered besides the mathematical computation of annual
income times life expectancy.  Allowances are made for circumstances <span style="">which </span>could reduce the computed life expectancy of the victim, <i>e.g</i>.,
nature of work of the victim,<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a> his
lifestyle, age, and state of health prior to <span style="">his death.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>In addition, we have to consider the
rate of loss sustained by the heirs of the victim.<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
In this case, albeit there was no evidence on the state of health of the
victim, considering his advanced age, we find it reasonable and fair to assume
that he would not be able work and earn, as a dentist, until he reaches the
final moment of his life.<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, we reduce the award for loss of the earning capacity of the deceased to
P144,000.00, which is the approximate amount he would have earned until his
75th birthday.<a style="" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a></p>
