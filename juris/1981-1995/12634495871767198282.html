and the rest of the petitioners as the duly elected Mayor and Members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>, respectively.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1980" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1980</st1:date>,

Public. Roberto P. Laurel.</p>

<p class="BODY">Earlier, on February 2, 1980 or three (3) days, before
petitioners were proclaimed, respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>,
together with the candidates on his ticket for Vice Mayor and Members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span> of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, filed with
respondent Commission on Elections (COMELEC) a petition for suspension of
canvass and of proclamation of "winning candidates" for the elective
positions of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, which was docketed as
Pre-Proclamation Case No. 118, entitled "Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>,
et al. vs. The Municipal Board of Canvassers, et al." (pp. 23-30, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Invoking Section 2, paragraphs 1, 2 and 8, of Article XII (C) of
the Constitution and Section 175 of the 1978 Election Code as well as the
ruling of this Court in the case of <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span>, et al.
vs. COMELEC, et al.(G.R. Nos. 49705-09, February 8, 1979, 88 SCRA 251)
respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> and the members of his KBL ticket
vigorously pressed for the suspension of canvass and the proclamation of the
aforesaid "winning candidates" for the position of Mayor, Vice Mayor
and Members of the <span class="SpellE">Sangguniang</span> <span class="SpellE">Bayan</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">To justify their petition for the suspension of the canvass and
of proclamation, they alleged as grounds the following:</p>

<blockquote>1)
Disenfranchisement of voters who were not allowed to vote although their names
were in the official list of voters;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) Terrorism of
voters;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) Voters with fake
ID's who were not in the voters' list were allowed to vote without being
certified by the corresponding election committee; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>4) Flying voters.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, in said petition, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> alleged
that around 3,000 fake voters using forms allegedly misinterpreting paragraph 2
of Section 13 of Resolution No. 1410 of the COMELEC (General Instructions for
the Citizens Election Committee, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "B"
thereof) and allegedly mimeographed by the NP headquarters in <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, were able to cast their votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, respondent urged for the suspension of the canvass
of election returns prior to the identification and the segregation of the
alleged fake ballots from the genuine ballots.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> further alleged that the number
of voters affected by all the aforesaid irregularities is estimated to be not
less than 10,000 votes which therefore will materially affect the results of
the votes for the positions of Mayor, Vice Mayor and Councilors of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> prayed <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span> that an order be issued for the suspension of
the canvass of the votes and the proclamation of "winning candidates"
for the positions of Mayor, Vice Mayor and Councilors of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>; that respondent therein, particularly
private respondent <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>, et al., be required to
answer said petition and that after hearing, a new election be held for <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span> allowing particularly the electors who were
illegally disenfranchised, to vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 9, 1980, respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
filed with respondent Commission a supplementary petition which averred, among
others "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> that these election irregularities <u>involving fake
voters and massive disenfranchisement</u> (sufficient in number to affect the
results of the election, as in this case), are <u>proper grounds for a
pre-proclamation controversy</u> (although they may also be grounds for a
protest), because they affect the very integrity of the election return; in
other words, the election returns, insofar as these fake voters and
disenfranchised electors are concerned, do not speak the truth; to say the
least, they are <u>incomplete</u> expression of the people's will through the
ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We understand that this is the
first time that this question is being raised; and we hope that this Honorable
Commission will sustain our contention in order to prevent the 'grabbing' of
proclamation as in this case, and to make the sovereign will of the people
triumph" (pp. 5-6, Supplementary Petition, pp. 34-35, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">Noteworthy at this point is the allegation of <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
in said supplementary petition mentioned in a letter they had addressed to the
Minister of Justice, Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Puno</span>, dated February 8,
1980 (Annex "A", Supplementary Petition, p. 33, rec.), that the
aforesaid <u>fake voters have been quantified</u> to be 2,776 persons in 68 out
of the 102 voting centers of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the pertinent paragraph of their <span class="SpellE">letter'to</span> Minister <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> on the
matter reads:</p>

<blockquote>"We have identified a total of 2,776 persons who were thus
allowed to vote but whose names do not appear in the masters registration list
of voters, with the help of three lawyers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This number is only partial since it covers only 68 out of 102 voting
centers of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The lists of these persons are attached hereto with their respective
voting centers and marked as Annexes "D", "D-1" to
"D-67".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> prayed for the
annulment of the proclamation of herein petitioners and further prayed that the
matters raised in the petition for suspension of canvass and of proclamation
filed on February 2, 1980, reiterated in said supplementary petition be set for
hearing after respondents of said petition, Municipal Board of Canvassers and <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> have filed their
answers (Supplementary Petition, pp. 31-36, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY">In a related development, on the same date <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1980</st1:date>, J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>,
KBL gubernatorial candidate filed with respondent COMELEC a petition to suspend

grounds, namely:</p>

118, by revoking and setting aside Minute Resolution No. 9092.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It further maintained that the grounds relied

explicitly mentioned by <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 172, 173 and 174 of the

<p class="BODY">In said opposition, it was pointed out that P.P. Case No. 118 is
different from P.P. Case No. 360 (<span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> petition)
because in the former, the quanti­fication of the votes was complete and
sufficient to alter the results of the election while in the latter case the
quantification of the votes was incomplete; that the main basis of the petition
in P.P. Case No. 118 is the fact that fake voters with fake ID's and/or fake
identification slips were allowed to vote; that Sections 172, 173 and 174 of
the 1978 Election Code are not the only grounds for annulment and/or suspension
of proclamation (citing the cases of Diaz, Sr. vs. COMELEC, 42 SCRA 426; <span class="SpellE">Sinsuat</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Pendatun</span>, 36 SCRA

Commission, in a <u>telegram-notice</u> dated February 23, 1980, to respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> counsel, granted the prayer in the opposition to

<p class="BODY">Thus, upon the filing by the parties of their respective

<p class="BODY">Basically, the main objection of the petitioners is the alleged
want of jurisdiction of respondent Commission on Elections over P.P. Case No.
118, entitled "Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, et al. vs.
The Municipal Board of Canvassers, et al."</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners contend that while Pre-Proclamation Case No. 118, was
filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, et al. as a
pre-proclamation controversy, the grounds relied upon by <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
are not proper grounds in a pre-proclamation controversy but proper grounds in
an election protest.</p>

<p class="BODY">To reiterate, the petition of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>,
docketed as Pre-Proclamation Case No. 118, alleges the following grounds for
the suspension of petitioners' proclamation:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disenfranchisement of voters who were not
allowed to vote although their names were in the official list of voters;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Turncoatism</span> of
voters;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Voters with fake IDs who were not in the
voters' list were allowed to vote without being certified by the corresponding
election committee;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flying voters.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In paragraph 6 of the supplementary petition dated February 9,
1980 filed by respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, he averred, among
others, that:</p>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is respectfully submitted that these
irregularities <u>involving fake voters and massive disenfranchisement</u>
(sufficient in number to affect the results of the election, as in this case), <u>are
proper grounds for a pre-proclamation controversy</u> (<u>although they may
also be grounds for a protest</u>) because they affect the very integrity of
the election returns, insofar as these fake voters and disenfranchised electors
are concerned, do not speak the truth; to say the least, they are incomplete
expressions of people's will through the ballots.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We understand that this is the first time
that this question is being raised; x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (pp. 34-35, rec.,
broken underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, page 11 of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span>
memorandum states:</p>

<blockquote>"At the outset, we would wish to state that <u>the main basis
of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>' s petition and
Supplemental Petition in P.P. Case No. 118 for the annulment/suspension of the
proclamation of petitioners <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>, et al. is the
fact that fake voters with farce IDs and/ or with fake identification slips
were allowed to vote and their spurious votes were reflected in the election
returns, all authored by NP candidate <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>, his
leaders and henchmen</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other
grounds of massive disenfranchisement, substitute voters, flying voters and
terrorism of voters are only corollary maters (sic) and included therein only
for the purpose of showing the extensiveness of the fraud committed in the
Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>
in the January 30, 1980 elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Hence,
it is immaterial that the said other grounds are proper only for election
protest</u>" (broken underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Hence, from the foregoing averments of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, petitioners contend that the same amount to an
admission on <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> part that the grounds adduced by
him (<span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>) with the exception of fake voters with
false IDs and fake identification slips, as <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
claims, are all proper in an election protest and not in a pre-proclamation
controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners strongly assert that the grounds for a
pre-proclamation controversy under the present applicable laws are those
expressly enumerated in Section 175 of the 1978 Election Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, they say:</p>

<blockquote>"The crucial question now left to be resolved and upon which
the jurisdiction of respondent Commission hinges is whether the respondent
Commission has power and authority to inquire into the allegation of fake
voters, with fake IDs and fake identification slips in a pre-proclamation
controversy pursuant to its power vested by law under Section 175 of
Presidential Decree 1296 more popularly known as the 1978 Election Code.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is our contention that respondent Commission <u>has no
jurisdiction</u> to determine, in a pre-proclamation controversy, whether

(underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners further assert that "nowhere in the 1978
Election Code are other grounds, similar or analogous, enumerated or provided
for the suspension or annulment of the proclamation other than those in
Sections 172, 173 and 174."</p>

returned for a recount of the ballots or for any alteration of the number of
votes set forth therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That

not been violated, and also after satisfying itself that the integrity of the
ballots therein has been duly preserved, order the committee to count the votes
for the candidate affected, or his representative and thereafter complete the
returns."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 173 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 173.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
election returns appear to be tampered with or falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-If the election returns submitted to the
board of canvassers appear to be tampered with, altered or falsified <u>after

discrepancies in the other authentic copies of the election returns from a
voting center or discrepancies in the votes of any candidate in words and
figures in the same return and in either case, the difference affects the
results of the election, the Commission, upon motion of the board of canvassers
or any candidate affected and after due notice to all candidates concerned,
shall proceed summarily to determine whether the integrity of the ballot box
had been preserved and once satisfied thereof, shall order the opening of the
ballot box to recount the votes cast in the voting center solely for the
purpose of determining the true result of the count of votes of the candidates
concerned:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however, That if
upon the opening of the ballot box it should appear that there are evidences or
signs of replacement or tampering of the ballots, the Commission shall not
recount the ballots but shall forthwith seal the ballot box and order its
safekeeping."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is therefore clear from the above-quoted provisions that
Section 172 speaks of material defects in the election returns, Section 173
speaks of tampered, altered or falsified returns and Section 174 speaks of
discrepancies of election returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, petitioners further averred that "it is clear that <u>fake
voters, fake IDs and fake identification slips </u>are fraudulent election
practices which may not be entertained by the respondent Commission in a
pre-proclamation controversy" (p. 17, Petitioners' Memorandum,
underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in defending the alleged authenticity of the returns
argued that "even assuming <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that
voters with fake IDs and false identification slips, were able to vote in the
January 30, 1980 elections, the election returns prepared on the basis of the
ballots cast and counted cannot be classified as spurious or manufactured.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Had no elections taken place and yet, returns
were made and submitted by the election committee, no doubt these returns would
be spurious.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But where votes are cast,
counted and returns prepared, the latter cannot be considered as manufactured
or falsified."</p>

<p class="BODY">"The genuineness of the election returns is there­fore
unquestionable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>What may probably be
questioned are the ballots themselves and this cannot be done in a

Memorandum, underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, in vehemently
refuting the alleged want of jurisdiction of respondent Commission, on page 12
of his memorandum states:</p>

shall 'have exclusive charge of the enforcement and administration of all laws

'enforce and execute the decisions, directives, orders and instructions on any

<p class="BODY">The previous rule that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
cannot go beyond the election returns in canvassing the same (NP vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 85 Phil. 149, 157-158; <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span>
vs. Provincial Board, 52 Phil. 47, 57-59) had been eroded in subsequent cases
since 1966.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus in the 1966 case of <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> (L-25444, Jan. 31, 1966, 16 SCRA 175), this Court
empowered the Commission on Elections to nullify certain contested returns on
the ground of "statistical improbabilities", when WE sustained the
authority of the Commission to examine voting records, the number of ballots
and the number of votes reportedly cast and tallied for each and every
candidate, when the returns are obviously false or fabricated. In said case, WE
adopted "a practical approach to the Commission's mission to insure a free
and honest elections" by denying <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> recognition to
the election returns on the ground that they were manifestly manufactured or
falsified.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span> case, this Court
further-stated:</p>

<blockquote>"In Mitchell vs. Stevens <u>supra</u>, the returns showed a
noticeable excess of votes over the number of registered voters, and the court
rejected the returns as obviously 'manufactured'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Why?<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The excess could have been due to the fact that, disregarding all
pertinent data, the election officers wrote the number of votes their fancy
dictated; and so the return was literally a 'manufactured', 'fabricated'
return.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Or maybe because persons other
than voters, were permitted to take part and vote; or because registered voters
cast more than one ballot each, or because those in charge of the tally sheet
falsified their counts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, as the
Mitchell decision concluded, the returns were 'not true returns x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> but simply manufactured
evidences of an attempt to defeat the popular will.' All these possibilities
and/or probabilities were plain fraudulent practices, resulting in
misrepresentation of the election outcome. 'Manufactured' was the word used.
'Fabricated' or 'false' could as well have been employed."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Of course we agree that frauds in the holding of the election
should be handled - and finally settled - by the corresponding courts or
electoral tribunals.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That is the general
rule, where testimonial or documentary evidence, is necessary; but where the
fraud is so palpable from the return itself (<span class="SpellE"><u>res</u></span>

<blockquote>"At any rate, fraud or no fraud, the verdict in these fifty
precincts <u>may ultimately</u> be ascertained before the Senate Electoral
Tribunal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(This answers the erroneous
claim that our decision usurps functions of the Senate Electoral
Tribunal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All we hold now, is that the
returns show '<u>prima</u> <u>facie</u>' that they do not reflect true and
valid reports of regular voting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The con­trary
may be shown by candidate <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> -in the

<blockquote>"The well-known delay in the adjudication of election protests
often gave the successful contestant a mere pyrrhic victory, i.e., a
vindication, when the term of office is about to expire, or has expired.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And so the notion has spread among candidates
for public office that the 'important thing' is the proclamation; and to win
it, they or their partisans have tolerated or abetted the tampering or the
'manufacture' of election returns just to get the proclamation, and then let
the victimized candidate to file the protest, and spend his money to work for
an empty triumph.</blockquote>

as outlined in the <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span> Party vs. Commission

of the principle in the Mitchell decision, which is realistic and common <span class="SpellE">sensical</span> even as it strikes a blow at such pernicious

<p class="BODY">Likewise, in the 1971 case of Diaz, Sr. vs. Com­mission on
Elections (L-33378, Nov. 29, 1971, 42 SCRA 426, 435), WE reiterated the above
doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In said Diaz case, the
petitioner's petition for the amendment of all the election returns from the
municipality of <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span>, Mountain Province, in
connection with the 1970 elections for delegate of said Province to the
Constitutional Convention, and for the exclusion from the canvass of all the
returns aforesaid, for being spurious, fabricated and/or fictitious, was
dismissed by the respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner therein charged that many election
inspectors in <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> had been improperly appointed
(because they had been previously found by the House Electoral Tribunal to have
deliberately tolerated and abetted the commission of frauds in <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> in connection with the <u>1961</u> elections), and
that the elections for convention delegates (3) in said municipality <u>were
tainted with fraud and terrorism, and other irregularities</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It prompted the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to order the bringing to Manila of the precinct book of voters and CE form 39 for
all precincts of <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> and had the same examined by
the fingerprint and handwriting experts of the Commission and the NBI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
discovered the existence of fraudulent practices and commission of other
election irregularities such as illegal voting, nevertheless it sustained the
validity of the returns from <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span>, on the ground
that more than one-half of those who voted were the registered voters in said
precincts (underscoring supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court in overruling the Commission on Elections anchored its
conclusion on the reports of the finger­print experts on their examination of
the precinct books of voters and other voting records.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, this Court sanctioned the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> procedure, upon establishment of a strong <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> case, of causing the examination by fingerprint and handwriting
experts and analysis of the signatures and fingerprints of the precinct books
of voters and the CE 39's and voting records, in order to determine whether the
reported elections were a sham amounting to no election at all and accordingly
accord no <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value to the election returns and reject
them as manufactured or false returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this Court concluded that where all the evidence and
circumstances point to a systematic plan of allowing persons who were not
registered voters to cast their ballots in all the precincts of a certain
municipality and to count such spurious ballots and take them into account in
the returns, there is no alternative but to consider said returns as deliberately
prepared with a view to alter the true results of the voting, through either
malice or coercion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The returns thereby
become false or falsified.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Diaz vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> case, this
Supreme Tribunal, through Mr. Justice J. B. L. Reyes, stressed:</p>

<blockquote>"Thus the analysis of the returns for the six precincts
validated by the Commission leads to the same conclusion as that derived from a
consideration of all the returns from <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span>, to
wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that even if all the votes cast by
persons identified as registered voters were to be added to the votes cast by
persons who can not be definitely ascertained as registered or not, and
granting, <u>ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span>, that all of them
voted for respondent <span class="SpellE">Daoas</span>, still the resulting total
is much below the number of votes credited to the latter in the returns for <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plainly, the
said returns cannot be relied upon and should be regarded as fictitious or
manufactured and excluded from the canvass of the votes cast for the different
candidates in the district.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
conclusion becomes all the more imperative when account is taken of the
additional circumstances that (a) of the 2,188 ballots cast in <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> in the 1970 election for convention delegates,
nearly one-half (1,012) were cast by persons definitely identified as not
registered therein, and this number may even increase because some of the 399
thumbprints and/or signatures that could not be identified may have been cast
by non-registered persons; (b) that such wholesale illegal voting could not
have taken place without the connivance of the inspectors, either maliciously
or through intimidation, as found by COMELEC in its resolution and the true
results can not be ascertained; (c) that 16 of the inspectors and poll clerks
who acted as such in the 1970 elections in <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> had
been found by the House Electoral Tribunal to have 'deliberately tolerated and
abetted the commission of frauds' in the 1961 elections (H.E.T. Case No. 145);
(d) that <span class="SpellE">Sagada</span> has been notorious for massive and
large scale frauds in the past, as found by COMELEC itself; and (e) that the
resolution of the COMELEC in this case contradicts that which it adopted in
connection with the returns from <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span>, all of which were rejected and excluded from canvass
on account of similar anomalies (<span class="SpellE">Usam</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, C.R. No. L-33325), when justice and equity
imperatively demand that there should be no discrimi­nation in the application
of the rules by COMELEC.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"Russell vs. State (11 Kan. 236), the court said in part: 'Now

and proves that 127 of the names so recorded as the names of legal voters are
fictitious, and that 127 spurious ballots were cast into the ballot box.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, he proves absolutely that

mistake.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not possible that this
could have happened without the knowledge, consent, and connivance of both the
clerks, and some, at least, if not all, of the judges.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Surely, there was criminal culpability if not
actual, intentional wrongdoing on the part of all the officers of that election
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But, says the <span class="SpellE">contestee</span>,

Luis <span class="SpellE">Buendia</span> and <span class="SpellE">Bonifacio</span> <span class="SpellE">Legaspi</span> (hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
petitioners), candidates for delegate in the aforementioned district,
petitioned the Commission on Elections (hereinafter referred to as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>) for a declaration of nullity of the election returns
from all the precincts of seven municipalities and municipal districts – <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pantao-Ragat</span>, <span class="SpellE">Matungao</span> <span class="SpellE">Munai</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tangcal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Nunungan</span> and four barrios - <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span>,
Salvador, <span class="SpellE">Lala</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Kauswagan</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Lanao</span> del Norte.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> petitioners alleged as grounds
that in the said municipalities and barrios, no actual voting took place
because of 'terrorism and other machinations,' and that</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'fictitious election returns were prepared under duress, and the
influence of terrorism and/or bribery wherein, it was made to appear that
certain favored candidates obtained most, if not all the votes fictitiously
cast therein, while petitioners were made to appear as having obtained very
few, if no votes at all.'</p>

<blockquote>"The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> petitioners
particularly stressed that the canvassing of the fictitious votes and the
preparation of the election returns from the precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
were in violation of the procedure laid down in resolution 769 of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They prayed
for the holding of a special election in the municipalities and barrios
concerned and, <u>ad</u> <u>interim</u>, the suspension of the canvass as well
as the proclamation of the winning candidates until after hearing and decision
on the merits of the petition.</blockquote>

from precincts 16 and 24 of <span class="SpellE">Kapatagan</span> and precincts

<blockquote>and adding that the election returns from
the said precincts</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'.... were prepared prior to the elections, and/or had been

<blockquote>"Thus, <span class="SpellE">Usman</span>, on March 22, 1971,
filed the present petition for review, (1) challenging the jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in resolving the issue relating to the genuineness
and authenticity of the disputed election returns, and in inquiring into the
regularity or irregularity of the <span class="SpellE">thumbmarks</span> and

March 12, 1971 and the inclusion of the results from the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> in the canvass of the election returns and his
proclamation as the winning candidate; and (3) in case this Court sustains the
aforesaid <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution, the calling of a
special election in all the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
pursuant to section 17(e) of Republic Act 6132 (Section 17[e] states: 'Whenever

closing of the voting in any precinct or precincts because of <u>force</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>majeure</u></span>, violence or terrorism, and the votes not
cast therein are sufficient to affect the results of the election, the
Commission may call for the holding or continuation of the election in the
precinct or precincts concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Pending

in such proceedings --­summary in nature and character --­has jurisdiction only

board of canvassers, the completeness or incompleteness of a canvass, and the

conferred upon it by the Constitution, to enforce and administer 'all laws
relative to the conduct of elections' and to decide all administrative
questions affecting elections 'for the purpose of insuring free, orderly and
honest elections,' has been the key in the resolution of many pre-proclamation
controversies involving the integrity and authenticity of election
returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Invoking the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> power of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
we justified the action and upheld the authority of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>

vs. <span class="SpellE">Climaco</span> and <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 16

vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, 25 SCRA 391; Antonio, Jr. vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, et al., 32 SCRA 319), emphasizing the duty of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to see to the use and inclusion in the canvass of
only genuine elections.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Several circumstances, defying exact description and
dependent mainly on the factual milieu of the parti­cular controversy, have the
effect of destroying the integrity and authenticity of disputed election
returns and of avoiding their <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value and
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If satisfactorily proven,
although in a summary proceeding, such circumstances as alleged by the affected
or interested parties, stamp the election returns with the indelible mark of
falsity and irregularity, and, consequently, of unreliability, and justify
their exclusion from the canvass.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the performance of its duty to guard against the use and
inclusion of returns prepared under circumstances showing their falsity in the
canvass of election results, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should not
be hampered in the choice of effective means and methods to fully ascertain the
genuineness and regularity of disputed election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To establish the indubitable existence of any
of such circumstances -- necessarily not evident from an examination of the
election returns themselves -- demands recourse to proof independent of the
election returns or to evidence <span class="SpellE"><u>aliunde</u></span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At this juncture, we find it necessary to mention that the
results of the examination and analysis of the voters' fingerprints and
signatures indicating that many of the registered voters have been voted for by
persons not even registered in the 42 precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>,
constituted not the sole factor which prompted the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
to declare the 42 election returns as 'spurious and/or manufactured.' A
totality of circumstances -- not merely of persuasive but of compelling
character -- led the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to consider and conclude
that the aforesaid election returns are 'spurious and/or manufactured' and
therefore unworthy of inclusion in the canvass of the election results.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> heavily
relied on the following noteworthy circumstances:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The very high percentage of voting in the 42
precincts of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> -- with 100% voting in 7
precincts where the number of votes exceeded the number of registered voters --
in the whole town of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, there appeared an
excess of 138 votes over the number of registered voters;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The day before the elections, the members of
the boards of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span> were summoned
to the office of the mayor where they were 'asked' to 'cooperate' by making
some candidates win in their respective precincts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The members of the boards of inspectors of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, either out of fear due to terrorism or in
connivance with those responsible for the election anomalies, allowed voting by
persons other than those registered as voters in their respective precincts;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other irregularities -­among them,
multiple registration, blurred fingerprints making identifi­cation impossible,
and ID pictures attached to CE forms 1 showing the registered voters as minors
-- appearing in the precinct books of voters of <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>
making possible the per­petration of the election anomalies; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We fully agree with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
that the totality of all the foregoing circumstances, taken together with the
findings of the Fingerprint Identification Division of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
and of the Questioned Documents experts of the NBI, more than suffices to com­pletely
overcome the <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> value of the 42 election returns from <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>, strongly belying their integrity and
authenticity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These circumstances
definitely point, not merely to a few isolated instances of irregularities
affecting the integrity and authenticity of the election returns, but to an
organized, well-directed large-scale operation to make a mockery of the
elections in <span class="SpellE">Karomatan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find and so hold that the election returns
from the 42 precincts in question were prepared under circumstances
conclusively showing that they are false, and are so devoid of value as to be
completely unworthy of inclusion in the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have no alternative but to affirm the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> finding that they are spurious and manufactured.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx" (<u>supra</u>,
pp. 670-671, 672, 678, 683, 686, 687-689).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, it becomes clear from the above rulings that respondent
Commission on Elections has the power and authority to inquire into the
allegation of fake voters, with fake IDs and fake identification slips in a
pre-proclamation controversy in order to determine the authenticity or
integrity of the election returns or whether such election returns faithfully
record that only registered or genuine electors were allowed to vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">This ruling was further underscored in the case of <span class="SpellE">Abes</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> decided on
December 15, 1967 (21 SCRA 1252, 1255-1256), where this Court held: "...
Neither Constitution nor statute has granted <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
or the board of canvassers the power, in the canvass of election returns, to
look beyond the face thereof, once satisfied of their authenticity." Thus,
it is noted that before the canvass the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> must
first determine the genuineness and integrity of the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If on the face of the election returns the
authenticity, thereof is not patent, then the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
can go beyond the face thereof to satisfy itself of their authenticity or
integrity.</p>

<p class="BODY">While admittedly the Commission on Elections has no jurisdiction
over election contests involving municipal or municipal offices (Sec. 190, 1978
Election Code), WE must not lose sight of the fact that the instant suit
involved a pre-proclamation controversy filed by the private respondent before
the respondent Commission, Indeed, it is immaterial if some of the grounds
adduced by the private respondent (petitioner therein) are grounds for an
election contest rather than grounds for a pre-proclamation controversy.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 175 (first sentence) of the 1978 Election Code explicitly
provides that "the Commission shall be the sole judge of <u>all</u>
pre-proclamation controversies and any of its decisions, orders or rulings
shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>" (emphasis
supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">The law says "all", and therefore covers all
pre-proclamation controversies involving national, provincial, city and
municipal elective officials.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law
does not distinguish nor contain qualifications.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the second sentence of Section 175 of the 1978 Election
Code provides that suspension or annulment of a proclamation may be made if
based on the grounds mentioned in Sections 172, 173 and 174, WE are not
prepared to declare that the enumeration is exclusive.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enumeration made in Section 175 only
emphasizes the old rulings of this Court and statutory provisions on the matter
affirming the power of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to suspend or
annul a proclamation based on material defects in the election returns,
tampered, altered, falsified election returns or in case of discrepancies in
the election returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to state also that Sections 172, 173 and 174
of the 1978 Election Code are substantially a reproduction of Sections 204, 205
and 206 respectively of the 1971 Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 204 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 204.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Material
defects in the election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- If it
should clearly appear that some requisite in form or data had been omitted in
the election returns, the board shall return them by the most expeditious means,
to the corresponding boards of inspectors for correction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Said election returns, however, shall not be
returned for a recount of the ballots or for any alteration of the number of
votes set forth therein:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, That
in case of the omission in the election returns of the name of any candidate
and/or his corresponding votes, the board of canvassers shall require the board
of inspectors concerned to complete the necessary data in the election returns
and affix therein their initials:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, further, That if the votes omitted to be placed in the return
cannot be ascertained by other means except by recounting the ballots, the
Commission on Elections after satisfying itself that the identity and integrity
of the ballot box have not been violated, shall order the board of inspectors
to open the ballot box, and also after satisfying itself that the integrity of
the ballots therein has been duly pre­served, order the board to count the
votes for the candidate whose votes have been omitted in the presence of the
candidate affected, or his representative and thereafter complete the return.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Section 205 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 205.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
election returns appear to be tampered or falsified.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-If the copy of the election return submitted
to the board of canvassers appears to be tampered, altered or falsified after
it has left the hands of the board of inspectors, the board of canvassers shall
use the other authentic copies of said election return, except the copies
furnished the political parties, and, if necessary, the copy inside the ballot
box which upon previous authority given by the Commission may be retrieved in
accordance with Section one hundred ninety-seven hereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If all copies of said returns are equally
tampered, altered or falsified and cannot be used in the canvass, the board or
any candidate affected shall bring the matter to the attention of the
Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission shall then,
after giving notice to all can­didates concerned and after satisfying itself
that nothing in the ballot box indicates that its identity and integrity have
been violated, order the opening of the ballot box and likewise after
satisfying itself that the integrity of the ballots therein has been duly
preserved shall order the board of inspectors to recount the votes of the candidates
affected and prepare a new return which shall then be used by the board of
canvassers as basis of the canvass.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">And Section 206 provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 206.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recounting
of votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-In case it appears to the
board of canvassers that there exists discre­pancies in two or more authentic
copies of election returns, other than the copies furnished the political
parties from an election precinct or discrepancies in the votes of any
candidate in words and figures in the same return and in either case, the difference
affects the result of the election, the proper Court of First Instance, upon
motion of the board or of any candidate affected and after due notice to all
candidates concerned shall proceed summarily to determine whether the integrity
of the ballot box had been preserved and once satisfied thereof shall order the
opening of the ballot box to recount the votes cast in the precinct solely for
the purpose of determining the true result of the count of votes of the
candidates concerned:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, however,
That if upon the opening of the ballot box it should appear that there are
evidences or signs of replacement or tampering of the ballots, the Court shall
not recount the ballots but shall forthwith seal the ballot box and deliver the
same to the Commission on Elections for safekeeping."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To give a strict interpretation of Section 175 (second sentence)
of the 1978 Election Code would be to limit the grounds in pre-proclamation con­troversies
to matters purely affecting election returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>WE believe that to revert to the old doctrine prohibiting the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> from looking behind the election returns as to the
existence of election irregularities is not consistent with the very purpose of
the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, Sections 172, 173 and
174 only speak of irregularities committed in the preparation of <u>election
returns themselves</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>WE cannot see
any difference however if the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> be allowed to
suspend a canvass or suspend or annul a proclamation of a candidate-elect on
the ground that irregularities or mistakes in the preparation of the returns
such as tampering, altering, falsifying of returns, material defects or
discrepancies of election returns exist and deny said authority to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> if based on grounds not apparent on the face of the
election returns but indirectly affecting their integrity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, it would be ridiculous to deny the
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> the authority to suspend a canvass or suspend
or annul a proclamation if based on grounds of election irregularities
committed during the election which would necessarily also vitiate or affect
the integrity of the election returns such as fake voters whose votes cast and
included during the canvass would inevitably be reflected in the election
returns them­selves, although not apparent upon the face.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seemingly genuine returns based on fake votes
are equally spurious as tampered election returns.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To sustain the validity of election returns
despite a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> showing of the commission prior to the
voting of election irregulari­ties independent of the subsequent act of preparing
the election returns is to stamp our approval on making said election returns
as an impenetrable shield in the perpetration of election anomalies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, once there is a <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> showing of the
commission of other election irregularities which will ultimately be reflected
in the election returns, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> should in a
pre-proclamation controversy, with due observance of due process of course, be
also authorized to suspend canvass, suspend or annul a proclamation of a
candidate-elect, for it smacks of absurdity to proscribe the commission of one
kind of irregularity and yet countenance another kind of irregularity, when
both irregularities make a mockery of suffrage.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case of <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span> vs. Commission on
Elections (February 8, 1979, 88 SCRA 251), the issue as to the enlargement of
the powers of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has been foreclosed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"Correspondingly, the Election Code of 1978, which is the
first legislative construction of the pertinent constitutional provisions, makes
the Commission also the 'sole judge of all pre-proclamation controversies' and
further provides that 'any of its decisions, orders or rulings (in such
controversies) shall be final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>', just as
in election con­tests, 'the decision of the Commission shall be final, and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and <span class="SpellE">inappealable</span>'
(Section 193).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"It is at once evident from these constitutional and statutory
modifications <u>that there is a definite tendency to enhance and <span class="SpellE">envigorate</span> the role of the Commission on Elections as the
independent constitutional body charged with the safeguarding of free, peaceful

framers of the 1973 Constitution, said:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>

examination of the integrity of election returns, <u>or inquiring into any
relevant matter affecting the purity of the ballot</u> (88 SCRA 290, 291,
underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The Commission on Elections has been granted powers under the
Consti­tution which, under the old Constitution, belonged either to the
legislative body (Electoral Tribunals) or to the courts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is evident from the provision of the new
Constitution which reads:</blockquote>

Be the sole judge of all contents relating to the elections, returns, and quali­fication
of all Members of the National Assembly and elective provincial and city
officials' (Section 2, Article XII, Consti­tution).</p>

<blockquote>"The Commission is thus envisioned to exercise exclusive
powers on all electoral matters except the right to vote, such as the
enforcement and administration of laws relative to the conduct of elections
deciding adminis­trative questions affecting elections, except those involving
the right to vote, but also those that heretofore have been regarded, as matters
for strictly judicial inquiry, such as the hearing and disposition of election
contests, as is doubtlessly shown by the transfer thereto of the powers
previously conferred upon the Electoral Tribunal of Congress and the Courts

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid enlarged powers of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
under the 1973 Constitution become more apparent under Section 174 of the 1978
Election Code wherein the authority to recount the votes cast in a voting
center, formerly vested upon the Court of First Instance, is now exercised by
the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus
Section 163 of the Revised Election Code (R.A. No. 180, as amended by R.A. Nos.

all candidates affected (C.A. 357-158)" [underscoring supplied].</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Election Code of 1971 (R.A. No. 6388) also provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 206.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Recounting
of votes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>- In case it appears to the
board of canvassers that there exists discrep­ancies in two or more authentic
copies of election returns, other than the copies furnished the political
parties from an election precinct or discrep­ancies in the votes of any
candidate in words and figures in the same return and in either case, the
difference affects the result of the election, the <u>proper Court of First
Instance,</u> upon motion of the board or of any candidate affected and after
due notice to all candidates concerned shall proceed summarily to determine
whether the integrity of the ballot box had been preserved and once satisfied
thereof shall order the opening of the ballot box to recount the votes cast in
the precinct solely for the purpose of determining the true result of the count
of votes of the candidates con­cerned:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, however, That if upon the opening of the ballot box it should
appear that there are evidences or signs of replacement or tampering of the
ballots, the Court shall not recount the ballots but shall forthwith seal the

(underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Whereas, Section 174 of the 1978 Election Code provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 174.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">Petitioners in asserting the non-applicability of the <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span> case, <u>supra</u>, and the Diaz case, <u>supra</u>,
pointed out that in the above cases cited by private respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, "massive substitution of voters, failure of
actual' voting and almost 100% voters turn out in certain voting centers
impelled the Supreme Court to issue the guidelines for the canvass of
votes" (Petitioners' Memorandum, p. 18).</p>

<p class="BODY">Suffice it to reiterate that in the petition and supplementary
petition filed by respondents <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, et al., they
charged, among other things, that fake voters numbering about 2,776 persons in
68 voting centers out of the 102 voting centers of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>
(approximately 66%), allegedly with fake IDs and/or with fake identi­fication
slips, were allowed to vote in the January 30, 1980 elections, and that these
votes have been reflected in the returns.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As correctly advanced by respondent Commission, said election returns
would not reflect the true will of the electorate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And considering that the difference in the
number of votes garnered by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> over private respondent Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> is only about 1,579, the number of votes in the afore­said
questioned returns could materially affect the result of the elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the precariousness of the alleged
winning margin of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> over respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> can be gleaned from the totality of the votes
contested is therefore beyond doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">An examination of the official list of registered voters in the
remaining 34 voting centers may reveal additional fake voters allowed to vote,
to aggravate the election irregularity.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners also argued that private respondent cannot now raise
for the first time in a petition to annul proclamation the alleged spuriousness
or falsity of the election returns since no objection to the canvass of the
election returns had ever been made before the Municipal Board of Canvassers.</p>

<p class="BODY">Much reliance has been made by the petitioners on the ruling of
this Court declaring that "all questions regarding the returns should be
initially raised before the Board of Canvassers, subject to appeal from its
decision to the COMELEC" (<span class="SpellE">Anni</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Rasul</span>, No. L-34904, Aug. 30, 1972, 46 SCRA 758, 769; citing
Moore vs. COMELEC, 31 SCRA 60, 67 [1970]).</p>

<p class="BODY">But there was compliance with the aforesaid rule, when respondent
<span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> filed with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
on February 2, 1980, three days before the proclamation of petitioners on
February 5, 1980, the petition (P.P. No. 118) to suspend the canvass and
proclamation of petitioners, making the Municipal Board of Canvassers a
respondent, which was then notified of the challenge raised by respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">It may be appropriate to note here that said ruling applies to
cases where the irregularities of the election returns are patent upon their
faces, which makes it incumbent upon the aggrieved candidates to raise their
objection before the Board of Canvassers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rationale of the above doctrine has been aptly explained by this Court
through Justice <span class="SpellE">Conrado</span> Sanchez in the case of <span class="SpellE">Abrigo</span> vs. COMELEC (No. L-31374, Jan. 21, 1970, 31 SCRA 26,
35, 36.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
After the preparation of the election returns by the board of inspectors, the
next step outlined by the law is the canvass thereof by the canvassing
board.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>It is before this body that a
candidate must present any question regarding the election returns</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> <u>The law envisions that while the board is doing its
work in canvassing the election returns and tallying in the results, its
attention should be called to any question which could affect its work</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The board should be given an opportunity, as
Section 163 (now Section 174) plainly directs, to decide whether -- on the
existence or non-existence of discrepancy -- to defer the canvass or to
continue with it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After all, it is upon
this body that the duty to canvass is reposed.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This function, it would seem to us, complements its authority to canvass
only election returns which are in due form and <u>to exclude those which
are<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'obviously manufactured or palpably
irregular</u>" (underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is only then after the Board of Canvassers has passed upon the
objection when the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> will exercise its
appellate jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be observed further, that there is no plausible reason to
prohibit an aggrieved candidate from filing an objection regarding the election
returns directly before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> itself if the
election irregularities that vitiate the integrity of the election returns are
not apparent upon their faces.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is
therefore involved is the original jurisdiction of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
rather than its appellate jurisdiction for precisely the objection is filed not
before the Board of Canvassers because the irregularities are not apparent upon
the face of the election returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">The reason is obvious -- "the board of canvassers exists for
a specific function -- that is, to canvass the result of the election as shown
in the election returns and to proclaim the winning candidates.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Once this specific function had been
performed the existence of the board of canvassers is ended or terminated"
(<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> vs. COMELEC, L-28392, Jan. 29, 1968, cited in
<span class="SpellE">Pelayo</span>, Jr. vs. COMELEC, No. L-28869, June 29, 1968,
23 SCRA 1374, 1386).</p>

<p class="BODY">And it is more within the powers of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
being the "sole judge of all pre-proclamation contro­versies", to
determine the circumstances that stamp the election returns with the indelible
mark of falsity.</p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, as heretofore stated, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> filed his petition for suspension of canvass and of
proclamation against the Municipal Board of Canvassers of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>
and the petitioners on February 2, 1980 or three days before petitioners were
proclaimed and before the termination of the canvass.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same may therefore be considered as a
formal objection to the integrity of the election returns based on fake votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Not even the rule of "<span class="SpellE">expresio</span> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span>
<span class="SpellE">alterius</span>" will, carry the day for the
petitioners.</p>

<p class="BODY">"Where a statute appears on its face to limit the operation
of its provisions to particular persons or things by enumerating them, but no
reason exists why other persons or things not so enumerated should not have
been included, and manifest injustice will follow, by not so including them,
the maxim '<span class="SpellE">expresio</span> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span> <span class="SpellE">alterius</span>',
should not be invoked" (Blevins, vs. <span class="SpellE">Mullaly</span>,
135 p. 307, 22 Cal. App. 519, cited in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manantan</span>,
No. L-14129, July 31, 1962, 115 Phil. 657, 668-669).</p>

<blockquote>"The rule of '<span class="SpellE">expresio</span> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span>
<span class="SpellE">alterius</span>' shall be applied only as a means of
discovering the legislative intent which is not otherwise manifest and shall
never be permitted to defeat the plainly indicative purpose of the
legislature" (82 C.J.S. p. 668).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, "the cardinal rule of statutory construction
requires the court to give effect to the general legislative intent if that can
be discovered within the four corners of the Act.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the object intended to be accomplished
by the statute is once clearly ascertained general words may be restrained to
it and those of narrower import may be expanded to embrace it, to effectuate
the intent" (<span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span> vs. Mariano, 41 Phil. 322,
cited in Martin, G.R. Statutory Construction, Revised Ed., p. 46).</p>

<blockquote>"The Courts should give the statute a reasonable or liberal
construction which will best effect its purpose rather than one which will
defeat it (82 C.J.S., p. 593) even though such construction is not within 'the
strict literal interpretation of the statute (In re Marshall, 69 A. 2d, p. 619,
cited in Martin, G.R., Statutory Construction, Revised Ed., p. 67).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thus, cases will frequently be found enunciating the
principle that the intent of the legislature will govern (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">Corbet</span>, 215, U.S. 233).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is to be noted that a strict construction should not be permitted to
defeat the policy and purposes of the statute (Ash Sheep Co. vs. U.S. 252 U.S.
159).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The court may consider the spirit
and reason of a statute, as in this parti­cular instance, where a literal
meaning would defeat the clear purpose of the law makers (Crawford,
Interpretation of Laws, Sec. 78, p. 294, cited in People vs. <span class="SpellE">Manantan</span>, <u>supra</u>, p. 665).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, petitioners, in assailing the jurisdiction of respondent
<span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, argue that the electoral protest filed by
respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> before the Court of First Instance
of <span class="SpellE">batangas</span> deprived the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
of its juris­diction over P.P. Case No. 118.</p>

<p class="BODY">But the records amply show that private respondent's petition for
suspension of canvass and of proclamation was earlier filed on February 2,
1980, whereas the electoral protest was filed before the Court of First
Instance of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> on February 15, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently the electoral protest was filed by <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> to preserve his right in the event the prayers he
sought in P.P. Case No. 118 would not be granted as said electoral protest bore
the character of an <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>abundante</u></span> <u>ad</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>cautela</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus the footnote of said electoral protest reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Protestant has petition with the COMELEC for the annulment of
the proclama­tion of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because the COMELEC has only suspended the
effects of the proclamation, this protest is being filed <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>abundante</u></span><u> ad</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>cautela</u></span>"
(p. 106, rec.).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The second issue raised by petitioners is that <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> acted in excess of its jurisdiction and with grave
abuse of discretion in reinstating respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span>
petition for the annulment of petitioners' proclamation.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE cannot fault respondent Commission if in the course of its
search for the solutions to the problems posed by the numerous cases brought
before it, characterized by multifarious and oftentimes confusing charges and
counter-charges, it committed a mistake in its choice of solutions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission cannot be charged with
being guilty of an "omission to weigh pertinent considerations" nor
the blunder of rendering a "decision arrived at without rational
deliberation".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the
reinstatement of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> petition, affords
the parties full hearing on the issues raised by said petition to avoid any
injustice to either party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Certainly,
the error, if any, does not amount to grave abuse of discretion.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners likewise charged that respondent Commission is guilty
of discrimination in the application of its rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charge is anchored on the alleged
conflicting decisions made by respondent <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in
the <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> petition and the <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
petition, notwithstanding the alleged identity of circumstances in both cases.</p>

<p class="BODY">WE do not agree, for aside from the claim of private respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> that the fake voters involved in their (private
respondents') petition were quantified unlike the <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>
petition, it would be improper to presume irregularity in the performance of
official acts on the part of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be noted that not only did respondent
<span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> and his co-petitioners in P.P. Case No. 118
charge alleged election irregularities but also adduced evidence to prove the
existence of said election irregularities.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Hearing with due notice to the parties was conducted on March 1, 1980,
after which respondent Commission "after considering the comments of the
respondents, as well as the oral arguments of both parties at the hearing"
promulgated the questioned resolution (Resolution No. 9558, amending Resolution
No. 9306).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent Commission
therefore, had the occasion to exercise its discretion in both petitions and it
has not been shown that it committed such a capricious and whimsical exercise
of discretion amounting to lack of jurisdiction or to grave abuse of
discretion.</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>
[I]n the performance of its constitutional duty of insuring free, orderly and
honest elections the COMELEC possess wide latitude of discretion which, unless
shown to have been exercised in an arbitrary or improvident manner, will not be
interfered with by this Court" (<span class="SpellE">Ligot</span> vs.
COMELEC, No. L-31380, Jan. 21, 1970, 31 SCRA 45, 47).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">WE are more inclined to presume that respondent Commission, in
proceeding summarily with the <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> petition and
the <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> petition, acted regularly or
indiscriminately in the application of its rules.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the aforesaid Resolution No. 9558,
although silent as to what transpired during the hearing, it can be safely
presumed that with due observance of the basic rules of due process, respondent
Commission indeed heard the basic contentions of both sides, which includes
necessarily the contention of respondent <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> that
election irregularities affecting the authenticity and integrity of the
election returns were committed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
respondent Commission issued the questioned resolution with due consideration
on the matter, is a presumption that would be in accord with the basic rules on
presumption of regularity of official acts.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, as aptly stated by this Court through Justice Antonio <span class="SpellE">Barredo</span> in the above-cited case of <span class="SpellE">Aratuc</span>
vs. COMELEC, <u>supra:<o:p></o:p></u></p>

<blockquote>"Such, to Our mind, is the consti­tutional scheme relative to
the Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conceived
by the charter as the effective instrument to preserve the sanctity of popular
suffrage, endowed with independence and all the needed concomitant powers, <u>it
is but proper that the Court should accord the greatest measure of presumption
of regularity to its course of action and choice of means in performing its
duties, to the end that it may achieve its designed place in the democratic
fabric of our government</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Ideally,
its members should be free from all suspicions of partisan inclinations</u>, x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>" (underscoring
supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The last issue raised by petitioners during the hearing is that
respondent Commission on Elections in questioning the alleged fake voters with
fake IDs and/or fake identification slips violated the consti­tutional
provision prohibiting said Commission to decide questions involving the right
to vote.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that questions involving the right to vote is not
within the ambit of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as mandated by the
Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, paragraph 3, Section
2, Article XII(c) of the 1973 Constitution, specifically provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Commission
on Elections shall have the following powers and functions:</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(1) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> .</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(2) x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> .</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3) Decide,
<u>save those involving the right to vote</u>, administrative questions
affecting elections, including the determination of the number and location of
polling places, the appoint­ment of election officials and inspectors and the
registration of voters" (under­scoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Likewise, it was held in the case of <span class="SpellE">Nacionalista</span>
Party vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, <u>supra</u>, that "x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> the power to decide questions
involving the right to vote is provided in the Election Law, the enforcement
and administration of which is placed in the exclusive charge of the
Commission" (85 Phil. 149, 156).</p>

<p class="BODY">WE cannot agree with petitioners that respondent Commission has
trodden into the forbidden scope of questions involving the right to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be observed that preparation of
election forms or documents such as registration records and the issuance of
voters' IDs or identification slips are functions exercised by the Commission
on Elections in the enforce­ment and administration of election laws.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If unscrupulous individuals however, resorted
to election anomalies such as issuance of fake voter's IDs and/or fake
identification slips or resorted to misrepresentation before the election
registrar to subvert the will of the electorate, an inquiry conducted by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> as to the commission of such election anomalies
does not violate the above-said constitutional prohibition.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is well within the powers of the
Commission on Elections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If, however, in
the course of its inquiry conducted to determine the commission of election
anomalies regarding the preparation of false or fake election documents,
persons possessed with such spurious documents and who participated in the
voting are identified or their number determined, the Commission on Elections
does not thereby pass upon the right to vote of a duly registered and genuine
voter.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is significant to note that Resolution No. 9558 is not final
and definitive in character as it only considered the proclamation in favor of
petitioners as temporary in nature as it was made subject to the final outcome
of P.P. Case no. 118.</p>

<p class="BODY">The resultant delay that may be caused by the remand of this case
to the respondent Commission is eclipsed by its paramount purpose of
ascertaining the true will of the electorate in P.P. Case No. 118; so that one
of the contending parties may be duly proclaimed and thereafter assume office,
subject only to the outcome of the regular election protest that the losing
party may, after the proceedings before the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>,
pursue.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, THE PRESENT PETITION IS HEREBY DISMISSED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>RESPONDENT COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS IS HEREBY

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">AQUINO, <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">Sotero Olfato was proclaimed by the municipal board of canvassers
on February 5, 1980 as the elected mayor of Tanauan, Batangas.  He allegedly obtained 15,293 votes while his
opponent, Francisco E. Lirio, the candidate of the Kilusan ng Bagong Lipunan,
obtained 13, 714 votes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 9, 1980, Lirio filed with the Commission on Elections
a supplementary petition praying that Olfato's proclamation be annulled on the
grounds that fake voters took part in the elections on January 30, 1980 and
that there was massive disenfranchisement (Pre-Proclamation Case No. 118).</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 15, 1980, Lirio filed an election protest <u>ad</u> <u>cautelam</u>
against Olfato in the Court of First Instance of Batangas, citing as grounds
(1) fake voters, (2) fake voter's identification cards, (3) flying voters, (4)
substitute voters, (5) massive disenfranchisement, etc.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 3, 1980, Olfato assumed the office of mayor.  On March 12, 1980, the Comelec issued
Resolution No. 9558 in Case No. 118 declaring that Olfato's proclamation is tem­porary
in nature and is subject to the final outcome of the said case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 21, 1980, Olfato and his co-petitioners filed in this
Court an amended petition praying that Resolution No. 9558 be annulled and that
Case No. 118 be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether in a pre-proclamation con­troversy, like
Case No. 118, the Comelec can annul the proclamation on grounds other than
those indicated in sec­tion 175 of the 1978 Election Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 175 provides that the Comelec may annul the proclamation
on any of the grounds mentioned in sec­tions 172, 173 and 174 Of the Election
Code which refer to material defects in the election returns, tampering with or
falsification of the election returns and discrepancies in the election
returns.</p>

<p class="BODY">I agree with Justice Makasiar that considering the vast powers of
the Comelec under the Election Code and in the light of the rulings cited in
his opinion, it may deter­mine in a pre-proclamation controversy whether fake
voters with fake identification cards and slips took part in the elec­tions.  That inquiry may be made for the purpose of
deter­mining the integrity of the election returns or whether the votes
recorded therein were cast by authentic and qualified voters.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is in consonance with the Comelec's primordial task of
insuring free, orderly and honest elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, I concur in the dismissal of the amended petition and the
continuation of the proceedings in Case No. 118 of the Comelec.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING AND DISSENTING OPINION<span style="font-weight: normal;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">FERNANDO, <i>C.J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY">It would not be difficult to yield concurrence to the opinion of
the Court, both scholarly and compre­hensive, penned with such painstaking care
by Justice Makasiar, with its meticulous appraisal of previous decisions.  There is, however, an obstacle posed by the
doctrine, now accepted as our basic policy in resolving controversies arising
from the 1980 elections enunciated in a unanimous decision, Aguinaldo v.
Commission on Elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a> Thus:
"Since Venezuela v. Commission on Elections, this Court has invariably
adhered to the principle that after the holding of the January 30, 1980
election, and a proclamation thereafter made, a petition to disqualify a
candidate based on a change of political party affiliation within six months
immediately preceding or following an election, filed with this Court after
January 30, 1980, arising from a pre-proclamation contro­versy, should be
dismissed without prejudice to such ground being passed upon in a proper
election protest or quo warranto proceeding.  Where, however, such consti­tutional provision had been seasonably
invoked prior to that date with the Commission on Elections having acted on it
and the matter then elevated to this Court before such election, the issue thus
presented should be resolved."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> It is
true that this principle has been followed mostly in suits seeking
for-disqualification of a candidate who had changed his political party
affiliation within six months immediately preceding an election.  It was first announced in Venezuela v.
Commission on Elections.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> Then
came Potencion v. Commission on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Arcenas v. Commission on Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a> and <span style="">Singco v.

All of them involved such an issue.  In two proceedings however, Arcenas v.
Commission on Elections, already referred to, and thereafter Laguda v.
Commission on Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> the same principle was applied even if the
grievances alleged would ordinarily call for an election protest.  Except for Singco, I was the <u>ponente</u>
in all such cases.  Under the
circumstances, I am unable to join the majority of my brethren in the approach
followed, even with due recognition of the high persuasive quality of Justice
Makasiar's opinion.  None­theless,
conformity by the Commission on Elections to the doctrine in the cited cases
therein, namely, Lagumbay v. Commission on Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> Diaz, Sr. v.

abuse of </span>discretion on <span style="">the part
of respondent Commission, especially so as the assailed resolution was issued,
on March 12, 1980, four months before our decision in Venezuela.  Hence my concur­rence in the result.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">A word more on the
Aguinaldo principle.  No single
formulation, of course, can capture the essence of,much less inevitably call
for application in, each and every case, in view of the multiplicity of
situations that give rise to litigations in any branch of the law.  It is not surprising therefore that the
Aguinaldo ruling, sufficient­ly broad and flexible as it is, did not
necessarily call for automatic adherence.  A month after its promulgation, in the first decision handed down by
this Court </span><span style="">in </span><span style="">February, Omar v. Commission on Elections,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> there was, if not a retreat from, a
qualification, to </span>application.  The reliance <span style="">by the majority of
the Court was on a 1941 </span>landmark decision, Sumulong v. Commission on
Elections,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
with its recognition of the realities and complexities of the broad discretion
conferred on the Commission on Elections.  Thus the assailed resolution of the Commission on Elections was
sustained, as against the view that our holding in Aguinaldo should be
controlling.  I would view <span style="">our </span>decision as susceptible to an
interpretation of the need for critical and sustained analysis of the peculiar
facts and circumstances of each case:   The
Aguinaldo principle should not be turned into a dogma, but, with due respect, I
submit that it should not be stripped of its authoritative character.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is not much more to add, except to reaffirm that were it
not for the norm thus consistently followed, I would not have limited my
concurrence in the result.  I find
highly persuasive the view that Section 175 of the 1978 Election Code should be
given a broad interpretation.  To my
mind, the power of the Commission on Elections "to suspend a canvass or
suspend or annul a proclamation of a candidate-elect on the ground that
irregularities or mistakes in the preparation of the returns such as tamper­ing,
altering, falsifying of returns, material defects or discrepancies of election
returns exist [even] if based on grounds not apparent on the face of the
election returns but indirectly affecting their integrity."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
The Commission on Elections is a constitutional creation.  It is entrusted with functions so essential
to the democratic process.  The 1973
Constitution increased the scope of its authority.  It is now the sole arbiter of election contests involving
legislators as well as provincial and city officials.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
It would not be in consonance with the principle consistently adhered to by
this Court, where a constitutional agency is involved, one moreover expected to
live up to the ideal of independence, that the statutory competence conferred
on it be viewed restrictively.  A
niggardly construction lacks justification.  Since the leading case of Gomez v. Ventura,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
a 1930 decision, the maxim, <u>expressio</u> <u>unius</u> <u>est</u> <u>exclussio</u>
<u>alterius</u> has not been interpreted so narrowly, for it is, to quote from
its <u>ponente</u>, Justice Romualdez, "applied only as a means of
discovering legislative intent and should not be permitted to defeat the plain
indicated <span style="">purpose </span>of the
Legislature."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">One last point.  The
Constitution empowered the Commission <span style="">On
</span>Elections to decide all administrative questions except' the right to
vote.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
So it was under the 1935 Constitution.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> <span style="">All </span>that it signified then was that it
was not the Commission on Elections that can determine whether an individual
should be in­cluded in or excluded from the list of voters.  So it is now.  The right to vote in that sense had a literal connotation, an
elector going to the polling place and casting his vote because under the
Constitution and the Election Code he is entitled to do so:   It cannot be construed as a restriction on
the power of the Commission on Elections in any appropriate proceeding
thereafter to ascertain whether or not anomalies were committed and who were
responsible for the same.  Its power
under the present Constitution is broader.  It can decide all election contests.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> It
appears to me then that there is even less persuasiveness to the contention of
petitioner as to the scope of such limitation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As set forth at the outset, I concur in the result reached by the
Court, dissenting, however, from its failure to apply the Aguinaldo principle.</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">TEEHANKEE, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the last elections
held over a year ago on January 30, 1980 for the mayoralty of the town of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span>, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Sotero</span> <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>, oppositionist
candidate (NP), with his ticket defeated the KBL ticket led by then incumbent
mayor-respondent Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> </span>with a
margin of 1, 579-votes out of 29, 007 votes cast.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> with his
co-petitioners were proclaimed on February 5, 1980.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> filed on
February 2, 1980 and February 9, 1980 his original and "supple­mentary"
petitions with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> for suspension or
annulment of canvass and proclamation of the winners on the grounds of alleged
"terrorism and massive <span class="SpellE">disenfranchisement,"and</span>
use of "fake and flying voters." On February 9,1980, the defeated KBL
incumbent governor of the province, J. Antonio <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span>,
had filed a similar petition against the proclamation of the winner NP
candidate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Jose C. Laurel V for governor­ship
of the entire province of <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> on the same
grounds and prayed among others for a "joint hearing" of the two
petitions, <span class="SpellE">Leviste's</span> and <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
on February 13, 1980 suspended the effects of the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> and required him to answer <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span>
<span class="SpellE">supplemenlary</span> petition (which be it noted was filed
only <u>after</u> <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span> pro­</span>clamation on
February 5, 1980).<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
filed on February 15, 1980 <span style="">an election
protest <u>ex <span class="SpellE">cautela</span></u> against <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>
with the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> CFI, stating as grounds <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> the very same grounds alleged in his <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> petition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On February 16, 1980, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
denied <span class="SpellE">Leviste's</span> petition for suspension/annulment of
Laurel's proclamation, ruling that the questions raised were "matters
(which) <u>should have been raised be­fore the Provincial Board of Canvassers</u>"
but were <u>not</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>
invoked with <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> the same treatment of denial of <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> petition, since the grounds alleged in both
petitions were the very same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first,
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> refused prompting <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>
to file on February 26, 1980 his original petition in this case to stop further
proceedings on <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> pe­tition in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> but on the same date, February 26, 1980, it ruled <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> grounds for annulment of <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span>
proclamation "are <u>proper</u> <u>grounds</u> for an <u>election protest</u>"
and resolved "to <u>dismiss</u> <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> pe­tition
and to <u>reinstate the proclamation</u> made by the [municipal] board of

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I dissent from the
majority decision sustaining the questioned <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
resolution for the following principal reasons:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">1. Pursuant to the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> earlier
resolution of February 26, 1980 correctly ruling that <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span>
grounds in his petition "are proper grounds for an election protest"
and reinstating <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span> Feb­ruary 5, 1980
proclamation, <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> was proclaimed once again on
February 27, 1980 and duly assumed the office of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>
mayor to which he had been elected and has discharged the functions thereof
since March 3, 1980 to date.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His title
to the office thereby became an accomplished fact and there is no longer any <u>pre-proclamation</u>
case, the same having become moot.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> himself manifested that this
case "has be­come <u>moot and academic</u>" with <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span>
proclamation (<u>supra</u>, at page 2).</p>

<p class="NUM">2. Under Section 175 of the 1978 Election Code, the decisions,
orders or rulings of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> in pre-proclamation
controversies are <u>final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its February 26, 1980 resolution dismissing <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> petition and reinstating <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span>
proclamation was <u>executed</u> with <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span> oath
and assumption of office and <u>can no longer be undone</u> as a <u>fait
accompli</u> at this late stage more than one year after the elections.</p>

<p class="NUM">3. The majority decision at bar is thus in disharmony and conflict
with our latest decision in <span class="SpellE"><u>Laguda</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
issued just this month wherein the Chief Justice, speaking for a <u>unanimous</u>
Court, held that "the question at issue has become <u>moot and academic</u>
as ap­parently the <u>Mayor-elect</u> had <u>assumed his position</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>No useful purpose</u> would thereby be
served by granting the remedy sought to enjoin the canvassing in certain
precincts," particularly in the case at bar, wherein <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span>
prayer in his original petition with the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> was
that "a <u>new election</u> be held for <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span> <u>allowing</u>
particularly the electors who were illegally <u>disenfranchised</u> to <u>vote</u>"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
while he prayed in his supplementary petition of February 9, 1980 that
"after hearing and the <u>deductions </u>(sic) of votes of the fake voters
and <u>voting by the disenfranchised voters</u> and <u>inclusion</u> of their
votes which we allege will materially affect the results of the election in
favor of the herein <span class="SpellE">movant</span> Francisco E. <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, that the latter be the one declared Mayor-Elect of <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> in the
elections of last January 30, 1980."<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">4. There is no beast nor fowl as a "temporary
proclamation" as the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> would <u>belatedly</u>
term its February 26, 1980 proclama­tion of <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> in
its "flip-flopping" March 12, 1980 resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>One can search the codes and statute and
decree books in vain for any such crea­ture.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basic and cardinal rule of elections is that the canvass and
proclamation be terminated once commenced "<u>not later</u> than seven
o'clock in the evening of election day ...., [the board] shall meet <u>continuously</u>
from <u>day to day</u> until the canvass is completed (and) shall prepare a <u>certificate</u>
of <u>canvass</u> …. and on the basis thereof, shall <u>pro</u>­<u>claim</u> as
elected the candidates who obtained the highest number of votes cast.....
"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
since the outcome of the election is of the utmost public interest and should
be immediately announced.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM"><span style="">5. Thus, <u>pre-proclamation</u>
controversies are <u>summary</u> pro­</span>ceedings that are just as <u>summarily
resolved</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Here, the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> did so summarily resolve the same, dismissing <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> petition and correctly ruling that his grounds of
alleged terrorism and cheating were grounds proper for an election
protest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court's unanimous ruling
and rationale in the latest case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Laguda</u></span>, <u>supra</u>,
that "an inquiry on the grounds relied upon to enjoining the canvassing of
election returns would <u>necessarily entail</u> the presentation of <u>conflicting
testimony</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To pass on such a complex
matter in a <u>summary proceeding</u> would be to run the <u>risk</u> that the
decision arrived at would <u>not reflect</u> the <u>realities</u> of the
situation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It could even be <u>susceptible</u>
to the charge that <u>the whole truth did not come to light</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, an <u>election pro-test</u>
clearly is the <u>more appropriate remedy</u>,"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
is fully applicable and controlling here, <u>mutatis mutandis</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is quite obvious that what <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> wants, a "<u>new election</u>" or the <u>exclusion</u>
of votes of alleged fake or flying voters and <u>inclusion</u> of votes of his
alleged <u>disenfranchised</u> voters which require extensive full-dress
hearing and reception of evi­dence, testimonial and documentary, and expert
witnesses can be done, <u>not</u> in a pre-proclamation summary proceeding but
in an <u>election protest</u>, if at all.</p>

<p class="NUM">6. This is but to reaffirm the doctrine and ruling firmly adopt­ed
by the Court since the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Arcenas</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u> wherein the Chief Justice as <span class="SpellE"><u>ponente</u></span> for a unanimous Court held that "It is
now the prevail­ing doctrine that <u>after</u> an election duly held and a <u>proclamation</u>
there­after made, a <u>pre-proclamation</u> controversy should <u>no longer be
viable</u>" and "resort (must) be had to the remedy of an <u>election
protest</u> or a quo <span class="SpellE">warranto</span>, whichever is
proper."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">7. What <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> is seeking is to identify
the alleged fake votes, exclude them, and have a "<u>new election</u>"
to allow his allegedly "disen­franchised voters" to vote.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This can be done, if at all (at least the
exclusion of alleged fake votes), only in an election protest over which the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has <u>no jurisdiction</u> since Section 190 of the
1978 Election Code vests <u>exclusive</u> original jurisdiction over election
protests for <u>municipal offices</u> "with the proper Court of First
Instance" and requires their filing "within ten days after the
proclamation of the election."</p>

<p class="NUM">8. This is not a case of failure of elections whereby under
Section 7 of the 1978 Election Code or Section 5 of Batas <span class="SpellE">Blg</span>.
51 "when the election for a local office has failed to take place on the
date fixed by law, or is suspended, or such election results in a failure to
elect" because of "force <span class="SpellE">majeure</span>, violence,
terrorism or fraud" the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> may "after
due notice and hearing, call for the holding or continuation of the election as
soon as practicable,"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
as in the aborted election for <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> City mayor which
"continuation" has not been called by <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
notwithstanding our Resolution of <u>May 16, 1980</u> therein for the
continuation of the election therein by the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
upon 15 days notice on all candidates.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
No such claim has been made by <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The elections in <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>
were duly held and the results proclaimed with <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>
thereafter having been re-proclaimed as the duly elected mayor by force of <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> own February 26, 1980 resolution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>So how can <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
ask for a "new election"?<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">9. In fact and in law, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> did file
since <u>February 15, 1980</u> his election protest with the <span class="SpellE">Batangas</span> Court of First Instance within the mandatory
10-day period.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <u>"ex <span class="SpellE">cautela</span></u>" notice made by <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
in his said protest was in a mere footnote stating that "Protestant has a
Petition with the COMELEC for the annulment of the proclamation of the <span class="SpellE">protestee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Because
the COMELEC has only <u>suspended</u> the effects of the proclamation, this
protest is being filed <u>ex <span class="SpellE">abundante</span> ad <span class="SpellE">cautela</span></u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
It is at once obvious that the notice was a <u>limited</u> one - "because
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> has only suspended the effects of [<span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span>] proclamation" and that upon the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span> issuance of its February 26, 1980 resolution <u>dismissing</u>
<span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> petition for annulment and reinstating <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span> proclamation and the case at bar having become
moot as per <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> own manifestation, the "ex <span class="SpellE"><span style="">cautela</span></span><span style="">" </span>notice became <span class="SpellE"><u>functus</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">oficio</span></u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="NUM">10. <span class="SpellE">Prescinding</span> from the foregoing and
assuming that the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> could declare its own
February 26, 1980 proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> as a
"temporary proclamation" in its "flip-flopping" March 12,
1980 Resolution, still the said Resolution must be set aside since to allow
further proceedings in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> on <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> petition as a <u>pre-proclamation</u> case, when he
has already his <u>pending election protest</u> in the Court of First Instance,
would be an exercise in futility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Section 175 of the 1978 Election Code now explicitly specifies three
cases <u>exclu­sively</u>, under Sections 172, 173 and 174 thereof, namely, <u>only</u>
in cases of <u>incomplete returns</u>, <u>tampered or falsified returns</u> or <u>discrepant
re</u><u><span style="">turns</span></u><span style="">, when the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
may order the suspension or annulment of the proclamation of a candidate-elect.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">11. The present case wherein <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
claims alleged "terrorism and massive disenfranchisement" and use of
"fake and flying voters" is patently <u>not</u> a case of incomplete,
discrepant or tampered or falsified returns wherein the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
may annul the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span> which it itself
had ordered, after finding correctly that they were "<u>proper grounds for
an election protest</u>." More so is this when these grounds are <u>not</u>
backed by on-the-spot reports on election day itself considering the vast
resources at <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> disposal as the then incumbent
mayor-official candidate of the dominant KBL.</p>

<p class="NUM">12. While it may be, as stated by the majority decision, that
"the enumeration made in Section 175 only emphasizes the old rulings of
this Court and statutory provisions on the matter affirming the power of the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> to suspend or annul a proclamation based on
material defects in the election returns, tampered, altered, falsified election
returns or in case of discrepancies in the election returns" (with
Sections 172-174 of the present 1978 Code corresponding to Sections 204-206 of
the 1971 Code), there is this one big difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The 1971 Election Code contained <u>no</u> ex­clusive
enumeration of the specific cases in which the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>
could suspend or annul a proclamation, whereas now the 1978 Election Code
filled the <span style="">void </span>and <u>explicitly
specified</u>, and <u>limited</u> the <span class="SpellE">Comelec's</span>
broad-power as "the <u>sole judge</u> of all <u>pre-proclamation
controversies</u>" to the <u>three grounds</u> above mentioned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The enumerated grounds are what have by
usage, definition and doctrinal jurisprudence been considered appropriate for <u>pre-proclamation</u>
controversies based on what appears on the <u>face</u> of the returns
themselves (including obviously manufactured returns as in the <span class="SpellE">Lagumbay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Batanes</span> and notorious
Mindanao provinces).</p>

<p class="NUM">13. <span class="SpellE"><u>Inclusio</u></span><u> <span class="SpellE">unius</span> <span class="SpellE">est</span> <span class="SpellE">exclusio</span>
<span class="SpellE">alterius</span></u>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The Court is bound by the <u>exclusive enumeration</u> in Section 175 of
the Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court cannot legislate and
substitute, its judgment for that of the lawmaker and stretch the grounds,
wherein the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> may summarily suspend or annul
the proclamation <u>in pre-proclamation controversies</u>, as the majority
decision would, by <u>adding</u> <u>post</u>-proclamation complaints and proper
grounds for election pro?tests, thereby <u>obliterating</u> the
distinction between <u>summary</u> and <u>pre-proclamation</u> proceedings in
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> and full-dress hearings and reception of
complete testimonial and documentary evidence in the <u>post-proclamation
election protest</u> in the proper courts of first instance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Contrary then to the majority decision's
implication (at page 48) that the <u>exclusive enumeration</u> rule should not
apply because "no reason exists why other persons or things not so
enumerated should not have been included, and manifest injustice will follow,
by not so including them," the great distinction between <u>summary</u> <u>pre</u>-<u>proclamation</u>
controversies and <u>post</u>-proclamation full-dress election protests
furnishes the reason for the ex­clusive enumeration; and "no manifest
injustice" results <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, as <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> has his <u>pending election protest</u> filed <u>since
a year ago</u> on February 15, 1980 which is the proper remedy - as stressed by
the Chief Justice in <span class="SpellE"><u>Arcenas</u></span><u> vs. <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span></u>, <u>supra</u><a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>,
"for it would be <u>time-consuming</u> and in the end <u>self-defeating</u>
if at this stage the <u>pre-proclamation</u> con­troversy is <u>not laid to
rest</u>." A law t hat is clear needs no interpre­tation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Justice Moreland stressed long ago:
"if there were more application and less construction, there would be more
stability in the law, and more people would know what the law is."<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;">13-a</span></span></a></p>

<p class="NUM">14. The <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> can hardly escape the
charge of discrimina­tion and applying a double standard in the disposition of
the two identical petitions filed with it by the losers <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Leviste</span> against <span class="SpellE">Olfato</span>
and Jose C. Laurel V for annulment of their respective proclamations as the

raised before the canvassing board and therefore could no longer be questioned
in the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span>, it was <u>inexplicably</u>, with
grave abuse of discretion and with lack of jurisdiction, to issue its
"flip-flopping" Resolution of March 12, 1980 <u>reinstating</u> <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> dismissed petition for annulment of proclamation
notwithstanding that <span class="SpellE">Olfato's</span> proclamation as

returns and they may do so only when the returns are palpably irregular.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A conclusion that an election return is
obviously manufactured or <span class="SpellE">or</span> false and consequently should
be disregarded in the canvass must be approached with extreme cau­tion, and
only upon the most convincing proof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any
plausible explanation, one which is acceptable to a reasonable man <span style="">in </span>the light of experience and of the
probabilities of the situation, should suffice to <u>avoid </u><u><span style="">outright </span>nullification</u>, with the
resulting <u>disenfranchise­ment</u> of those who exercised their right of

</span>In the ab­sence of strong evidence establishing the spurious­ness of the
return, the basic rule of their being ac­corded <u>prima facie</u> status as <u>bona
fide</u> reports of the results of the count of the votes for canvassing and
proclamation purposes must be applied, <u>without</u> pre­judice to the

is that where it has been duly determined after investigation and examination
of the voting and registration records that actual voting and election by the
registered voters had taken place in the questioned voting centers, the
election returns cannot be disregarded and excluded with the resulting
disenfranchisement of the voters, but must be accorded <u>prima facie</u>

<p class="BODY">The Court expressly found that the citations of jurisprudence
"arose from similar situations in the very venues of the actual milieu of
the instant cases, and we are satisfied they do fit our chosen posture"
and held that "We find the afore-quoted doctrines compelling as they re­veal
through the clouds of existing jurisprudence the polestar by which the future
should be guided in delineating and circumscribing separate spheres of action
of the Commission as it functions in its equally important dual role just
indicated bearing as they do on the purity and sanc­tity of elections in this
country." Unfortunately, the polestar of <span class="SpellE"><u>Aratuc</u></span>
- that election protest is the proper remedy of <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
- has somehow not been followed in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">I vote accordingly to grant the amended petition and to set aside
the <span class="SpellE">Comelec</span> resolution of March 12, 1980.</p>
