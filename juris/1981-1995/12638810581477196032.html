<p class="BODY">The factual and procedural antecedents are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="17" month="2">17 February 1966</st1:date>,
an information for slander against accused Marcela N. Gonzales (hereinafter
referred to as the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>) was filed before the
City Court of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> by Assistant City Fiscal Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Celi</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
information reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about December 19, 1965, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this
Honorable Court, the above-mentioned accused with intent to cast dishonor,
discredit and contempt upon one <span style="">Filipinas
<span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span>, willfully, unlawfully and </span>feloniously
and in the heat of anger uttered publicly in the presence and within the
hearing of several persons the following <span style="">defamatory
words, to wit:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘MANG-AAGAW NG ASAWA NG
MAY ASAWA! TIBIHON! PUTANG INA MO! WALANG HIYA! PATAY GUTOM’, which when
translated to English runs (sic) as follows:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>‘Seducer of wives of other husbands or adulteress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consumptive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your mother is a prostitute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You </span>do
<span style="">not </span><span style="">have a sense of shame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>You
are a glutton,’ to the dishonor, discredit and contempt of said Filipinas <span class="SpellE">Ordoñez</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="5" month="8">5 August 1966</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> moved to quash the information asserting
that the City Court has no jurisdiction over the offense charged and that the
officer who filed the <span style="">information </span>had
no authority to do so.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She claims
therein that the alleged defamation imputes the crime of adultery and thus
cannot be prosecuted <i><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other remarks, however, do not charge a
crime.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The complaint must, therefore, be
brought at the instance of the offended party, which was not done in this
case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the fiscal did not have the
authority to file the information and the court did not acquire jurisdiction
over the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records do not show that the offended party filed a complaint
in the <span class="SpellE">fiscal's</span> office and that the Information was
signed by her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The motion to quash was denied by respondent Judge, prompting <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to move for its reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This second motion was likewise denied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
filed with the then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
a petition for <i>certiorari</i> and prohibition which was docketed as Special
Civil Case No. 5270.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Appellee</span> reiterated in her petition the
grounds in her motion to quash and elaborated on her arguments in support
thereto.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, respondents
maintained that the slanderous words alleged in the "information contain
imputations not only to <span style="">(sic) </span>one
crime but to (sic) other offenses like vice, defect and condition which are
distinct from and independent of each other; one, admitted to be of adultery
and others are public crimes which can be prosecuted <i><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span></i>."</p>

<p class="BODY">In deciding Civil Case No. 5270 against respondents, then Judge
Alfredo I. Gonzalez opined that "the entire context of the Information
should be read together as a whole and not to pick up (sic) particular words
and phrases and then detach or isolate them from the rest so as to give them
different meaning (sic) that is desired by the one who may use it for his own
convenience" and that “the entire defamation in question should be <span style="">given </span>an ordinary and peculiar
significance in order to render it effectual in the sense that is most likely
understood by the parties and which is in keeping with the purpose and intent
of the party <span style="">who </span>uttered <span style="">them.” </span>He then concluded and ruled
that:</p>

<blockquote>"The first part of the defamation complained of, quoted:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘<span class="SpellE">mang-aagaw</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">asawa</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
may <span class="SpellE">asawa</span>’ may literally mean:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'one who grabs another's husband,' thereby
imputing the commission of the crime of adultery wherein the accused maintained
an immoral or illicit relations (sic) with another man who is not her husband.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The prosecuting Fiscal has correctly construed in English the
significance of the first portion of the defamation in question by imputing the
commission of the crime of adultery, in which case, it becomes undisputed that
the offended party has the exclusive right to sign and file the complaint and
not <span style="">the Fiscal.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>However, the City Fiscal did not interpret the correct meaning of
the succeeding group of clauses quoted:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'<span class="SpellE">Putang</span> <span class="SpellE">ina</span> mo, <span class="SpellE">tibi-hon</span>, <span class="SpellE">walang</span> <span class="SpellE">hiya</span>, <span class="SpellE">patay</span> <span class="SpellE">gutom</span>'
for he just gave them a strict, literal construction which does not portray the
real intent of the accused and does not conform to the sense as it is
ordinarily understood by an average person.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Expressions of this kind and tenor are commonly used by many people according
to their custom specially those who are unschooled and coming from the lower
social strata.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are usually uttered
by the slip of the tongue and are intended to describe, intensify, explain or
emphasize the other parts of the utterances which accompany them or to which
they cling or are attached.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They may be
defamatory or not depending upon the tenor and import conveyed by the
accompanying statements.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the instant case, the above quoted combined utterances expressed
in the native dialect are mere accompanying and supporting phrases and terms
used to give more vivid color and importance to the first portion, depicting
the temper, emotion, demeanor and <span style="">the
hatred of the petitioner (accused in the lower Court) owing perhaps to a fit of
jealousy arising from her suspicion that the offended party is having immoral
relations </span>with her husband.</blockquote>

<blockquote>It become (sic) clear and logical then to conclude that the next
group of words mentioned in the preceding paragraph does not impute the
commission of any public offense that may be considered distinct and
independent from that conveyed in the first sentence, but they are simply
intended to give more spicy flavor to the main thought expressed in the whole
statements.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No other reasonable and
logical conclusion can be drawn from the premises except that the correct
imputation to the crime probably committed in this case is that of adultery or
a similar offense, private in nature and that there is but one, single and
indivisible crime that is described by the whole slanderous statements alleged
in the information.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In view of all the foregoing, the Court is convinced and is of the
opinion that only the crime of adultery or a kindred offense <span style="">is </span>imputed to the accused (petitioner
herein) for uttering the alleged defamation in question taken as a whole and no
imputation to (sic) any other public offense could be logically inferred from
the tenor and spirit conveyed therein."<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Respondents-appellants challenge the above decision in their four
(4) assigned errors, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"FIRST – The lower court erred in holding that the information
alleges only one defamatory remark imputing a private offense which cannot be
prosecuted <i><u>de</u> </i><span class="SpellE"><i><u><span style="">oficio</span></u></i></span><i><span style="">.</span></i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>SECOND – The lower court erred in holding that the other utterances
alleged in the information are not defamatory as to constitute the crime of
slander which can be prosecuted <i><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</i></blockquote>

<blockquote>THIRD – The lower court erred in holding that the fiscal lacks
authority to file the information and, therefore, the City Court fails (sic) to
acquire jurisdiction over the case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FOURTH – The lower court erred in permanently enjoining the
respondents from taking further cognizance of the <span style="">information.”</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">In support thereof, they contend that:</p>

<p class="NUM">a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the
information alleges "many remarks or utterances which are all
defamatory" and not just one as ruled by the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each may constitute a separate offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, since they were made on one
occasion, and the product of a single criminal intent, there is only one
offense of slander.</p>

<p class="NUM">b) One slanderous remark should not be given more emphasis than
the other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither should a single
remark be considered to suit the purpose of the accused.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rather, the rule is that all the slanderous statements
should be treated as one and taken as a single offense of slander.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">c) The one remark held by the court to be slanderous as it imputed
the crime of adultery is <span style="">"<span class="SpellE"><i>mang-aagaw</i></span><i> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">asawa</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> may </i></span><span class="SpellE"><i>asawa</i></span>.” <span style="">Standing
by itself, it does not, contrary to the court's ruling, impute the crime of
adultery.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most, it implies that the
one to whom </span>it is <span style="">addressed is a
flirt, a temptress, or one who indulges in enticing other husbands.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It imputes a vice, condition or act which
equally casts dishonor and contempt upon the person alluded to.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Flirtation is not adultery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the defamatory
statements alleged in the information likewise only impute a vice, defect, act
or condition not constituting a crime.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The fiscal, therefore, has the authority <span style="">t</span>o file the information and the City Court acquired jurisdiction
over the case.</p>

<p class="NUM">e)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming for the sake of
argument that the defamatory statements alleged in the information include one
imputing an offense which cannot be prosecuted <i><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span></i>,
still the case at bar is one which can be instituted upon the instance of the
fiscal on the ground that what then is involved is a compound or complex crime,
one of the components of which is a public crime, in which case it can be
prosecuted <i><u><span style="">de</span></u></i><i><span style=""> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span></span></i><span style=""> </span>under the theory that public interest
is paramount to private interest.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> while
said Article 364 penalizes any intrigue which has for its purpose to blemish
the honor or reputation of a person, the information avers facts which do not
merely constitute an incriminatory machination or a defamatory intrigue but go
as far as accusing a married woman <span style="">of </span>having
illicit relations with a man not her husband which in effect constitutes the
crime of adultery.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Considering that under Article 360, paragraph 4, of the Revised
Penal Code, no criminal action for defamation which consists in the imputation
of a crime which cannot be <span style="">prosecuted <i>de
</i></span><span class="SpellE"><i><span style="">oficio</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><span style="">can

jurisdiction upon the court of origin.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court was therefore correct in quashing the information."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="NUM">(b) <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Yu</u>, cited by appellants, is
not applicable in this case because it refers to a complex crime defined under
the Revised Penal Code which imposes only one (1) penalty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">Appellants
admit that in this case there </span>is <span style="">only
one offense, although it involves many slanderous remarks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Slander is oral defamation while libel is defamation <span style="">in </span>writing.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
In both, there is a public and malicious imputation of a crime, or of a vice or
defect, real or imaginary, or any act, omission, condition, status, or
circumstance tending to cause the dishonor, discredit, or contempt of a natural
or juridical person, <span style="">or </span>to
blacken the memory of one who is dead.<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In determining whether the offense has been committed, the
defamatory words are to be construed in their entirety, and should be taken in
their plain, natural and ordinary meaning as they would naturally be understood
by persons reading or hearing them, unless it appears that they were used and
understood in another sense.<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
In short, the language used must be understood "in its plain and popular
sense -- to read the sentences as would the man on the street."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The intent or purpose then of the speaker or writer is not relevant.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues in this case revolve on the correct appreciation of
the statements uttered by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and alleged in the
information to be slanderous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They read
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Mang-aagaw</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
<span class="SpellE">asawa</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> may <span class="SpellE">asawa</span>! <span class="SpellE">Tibihon</span>! <span class="SpellE">Putang</span> Ina Mo! <span class="SpellE">Walang</span> <span class="SpellE">Hiya</span>! <span class="SpellE">Patay</span> <span class="SpellE">Gutom</span>!"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The fiscal translated them as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Seducer of wives of other husbands or adulteress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consumptive.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Your mother is a prostitute.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You
do not have a sense of shame.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>You are a
glutton.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Judge Gonzalez, after
postulating the major premise that the entire defamation in question should be
given an ordinary and peculiar significance in order to render it effectual in
the sense most likely understood by the parties and which is</span> <span style="">in keeping with the purpose </span>and <span style="">intent of the party who uttered them, held
that the controlling slanderous utterance </span>is <span style="">the first part which literally means:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>"one who grabs another's husband," thereby "imputing the
commission of the crime of adultery," while the rest are mere
"accompanying and supporting phrases and terms used to </span>give <span style="">more vivid color </span>and <span style="">importance to the first portion."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In the light of the above
rule of determining whether the offense of oral defamation </span>or <span style="">libel has been committed, it is evident that
the last part of Judge Gonzalez' major premise focusing on the purpose and
intent of the speaker </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">erroneous.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Equally erroneous is his </span><u><span style="">literal</span></u><span style=""> </span><span style="">translation of the
first portion of the alleged defamatory utterance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with appellants that </span><i><span style="">"<span class="SpellE">mang-aagaw</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span> <span class="SpellE">asawa</span> may <span class="SpellE">asawa</span>,"</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">even
if translated as "one who grabs another's husband," does not
necessarily mean an adulteress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At most,
it may imply that the person to </span><span style="">whom
</span><span style="">it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">addressed is a "flirt, a temptress, or one who indulges in </span>enticing
<span style="">other husbands;" hence, it </span><span style="">is </span><span style="">more </span>of <span style="">an imputation of
a vice, condition or act not </span>constituting <span style="">a crime.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">If indeed it were the
intention of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to impute upon the offended
party the crime of adultery, then in the light of the charge that the remarks
were made "in the heat of anger" or that, as Judge Gonzalez described
it, they were uttered in a</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">manner "depicting the temper, emotion,
demeanor and the hatred of the petitioner (accused in the </span>lower <span style="">court) owing perhaps to a </span>fit of
jealousy arising from her suspicion that the offended party is having immoral
relations with her husband," <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> should
have used more direct, pointed and descriptive terms to convey the accusation
that the offended party is an adulteress.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Under such circumstances, she would not have the luxury of time to
choose less offensive or even harmless words to camouflage a clear intent to
defame the other and thus avoid criminal or civil liability for the
utterance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On its face, her statement <span style="">is </span>merely suggestive of a doubt as to
the kind of relationship the offended party would have with married men.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is thus an imputation of some kind of
moral depravity, immoral conduct or a vice, but certainly not of a crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither do We agree with Judge Gonzalez' conclusion that the
other portions of the alleged slanderous remarks "are mere accompanying
and supporting phrases and terms used to give more vivid color and importance
to the first portion." The other remarks are by themselves defamatory and
are not at all related to the first portion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They were uttered to impute a condition, defect, status or vice intended
to cause dishonor, discredit or contempt on the offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>"<span class="SpellE">Tibihon</span>"</i>
means a person suffering from tuberculosis, and not "consumptive" as
translated by the fiscal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>"<span class="SpellE">Putang</span> Ina Mo,"</i> although referring to a mother,
was meant to suggest that the offended party is not a legitimate daughter of
her mother.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>"<span class="SpellE">Walang-Hiya</span>,"</i>
which means "shameless," could relate to the offended party's being a
flirt, seducer, or a daughter of a prostitute.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><i>"<span class="SpellE">Patay-Gutom</span>"</i> is a derogatory
remark connoting abject poverty entirely unrelated to the first portion.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In short, the other imputations did not give
color and importance to the first portion; they were uttered merely to expose
all the possible vices, defects, real or imaginary, status, or condition of the
offended party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>None of these, however,
imputed any crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, the <span style="">last </span>paragraph
of Article 360 of the Revised Penal Code which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>"No criminal action for defamation which <span style="">consists </span>in the imputation of a crime
which cannot be prosecuted <i><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span></i>
shall be brought except at the instance of and upon complaint expressly filed
by the offended party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">which has specific reference to the
crimes against chastity,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
and the second paragraph of Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court which
provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The crimes of adultery and <span class="SpellE">concubinage</span>
shall not be prosecuted except upon a complaint filed by the offended
spouse.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">are not applicable <span style="">in </span>this case since, as above
discussed, the alleged slanderous utterances subject of the assailed
information do not impute any crime which cannot be prosecuted <i><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing considered, neither <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Yu</u>,
cited by the appellant, nor <u>People</u> <u><span style="">vs.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Padilla</u>,
cited by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, is applicable in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The first refers to a prosecution "for
rape with murder” (included in the generic term homicide) under Article 335 in
relation to Article 48 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A single act resulted in two (2) grave
felonies.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants admit that in the
instant case, the remarks were made in one occasion and that even granting for
the sake of argument that one portion imputes a crime which cannot be
prosecuted <i><u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span></i>, the <span style="">rest, however, can be, hence the
applicability of <u>People</u> </span><u>vs.</u> <u>Yu</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The
argument is flawed by the wrong assumption that Article 48 of the Revised Penal

ground that it </span>was <span style="">not initiated
by a complaint filed by the offended party pursuant to paragraph 4 of Article
360 of the Revised Penal Code, considering that it involves an imputation of a
crime which cannot be prosecuted </span><i><u>de</u> <u>officio</u></i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">This
Court sustained the dismissal for the reason that the import of the allegation
in </span>the information cannot be mistaken -- "[I]t charges <span class="SpellE">Fausta</span> Bravo with committing adultery pure and
simple." Contrary then to the pretension of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
only one (1) crime was imputed -- adultery.</p>
