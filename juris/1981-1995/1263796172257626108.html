<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Briefly, the facts are as
follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Respondent is a domestic
corporation engaged in the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical, medicated,
cosmetic and toilet products, among which are the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span>
Lemon Hand and Body Lotion, <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> Hand and Body
Lotion, <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> Lemon Moisturizer and <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> Lemon Cleansing Cream, hereinafter referred to as
"<span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> Products".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the sale of the aforesaid products for the period starting
from the 4th quarter of 1975 up to the 4th quarter of 1976, respondent
corporation made a total gross sales amounting to P1,975,979.00 with a net
sales of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P809,144.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On said net sales, respondent paid sales tax
in the sum of P566,471.00 at the rate of 70% under Section 184(b) of the Tax
Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On January 17, 1978, respondent corporation filed with petitioner
a written claim for refund or tax credit of P509,825.00 on the contention that
the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> Products are medicinal preparations
subject<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>only to the 7% sales tax under
Section 186 of the Tax Code and not the 70% sales tax under 184 (b).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said amount represents the overpaid sales
tax for the period starting the 3rd quarter of 1975 to the 4th quarter of 1976.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 20, 1978, before the expiration of the period of two
years for seeking recovery of tax erroneously paid, respondent corporation
filed with respondent court a petition for review praying that its "<span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> Products" be declared medicinal preparations
subject to 7% sales tax, and that herein petitioner be ordered to grant
respondent corporation's claim for tax credit or refund in the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of P509,825.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The alleged overpaid sales tax for the 3rd
quarter of 1975 was excluded from respondent corporation's claim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">In its decision dated May
30, 1983, the respondent court declared the "<span class="SpellE">Tussy</span>
Products" as "medicinal preparations subject to 7% sales tax
prescribed in Section 186 of the Tax Code, instead of the 70% sales tax paid by
private respondent under Section 184(b)" and therefore ordered herein
petitioner to grant a tax credit in favor of private respondent the amount of
P509,825.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Its motion for
reconsideration having been denied, herein petitioner filed the instant
petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner contends that
in the case of La <span class="SpellE">Tondena</span> Inc. vs. Collector of
Internal Revenue,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> the term "medicinal preparation"
has been defined as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"'Medicinal preparations' consists of two words, 'medicinal'
and 'prepa­rations'. 'Medicinal' means curative or alleviative, used for the
cure or alleviation of body disorders (Words and Phrases, Volume 26-A, p. 616).
'Prepa­rations' are those which are prepared or something equipped or
compounded for particular purposes (Words and Phrases, Volume 33, p. 380).
'Medicinal prepa­rations' are therefore descriptive of and refer to substances
used in medi­cine and prepared for the use of the apothecary or the physician
to be administered as a remedy for diseases (Law Dictionary <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">with </span><span class="SpellE">Pronounciation</span>,
<span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Ballantine</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, Phil. Ed.).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As used in the Tariff Act of March 3, 1983 (C. 121, </span>Schedule 2,
22 Stat. 494), these medi­cinal preparations mean such articles, as are of use
or believed by the <span class="SpellE">prescriber</span> or user fairly and
honestly to be of use, in curing or alleviating or palliating or preventing
some disease or affliction of the human body (Words and Phrases, Volume 26-A,
p. 617)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is argued that from
the said definition, it is clear that to be classified as medicinal
preparation, a product should have the following characteristics:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(a)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The product must have
been prepared, equipped or compounded for a particular purpose;</blockquote>

the human body.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Petitioner maintains that
from the labels and descriptions of the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span>
products, it is evident that they are not used or intended to be used to cure
any skin disorder or disease.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The labels
do not state that the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> products can be used in
curing, alleviating, palliating and preventing some disease or affliction of
the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">human </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">body.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>What they state is simply that the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span>

protecting the skin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The function <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> products is
simply to improve body appearance or enhance the health of the skin.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">On the other hand,
private respondent contends that the findings of fact by respondent court are
conclusive and no longer <span class="SpellE">reviewable</span> since they are
supported by substantial evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
respondent court relied principally on the certification of the Food and Drug
Administration to the effect that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">in
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">view of the medicinal components
present in the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> Products, "the preparations
are used in the treatment and prevention of skin problems and for medicated
skin cleansing and to <span class="SpellE">nutrify</span> the skin."
Respondent claims that petitioner's reliance on the labels of <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> products, rather than on their medicaments, functions
and therapeutic uses, is erroneous, giving more importance to form rather than
substance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stressing this line of
argument, the respondent Court of Tax Appeals stated in its decision"<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"In an effort to discredit the medicinal functions and
therapeutic uses of Petitioner's '<span class="SpellE">Tussy</span> products',
respondent would however find comfort in the labels of the products which
present and describe them as lotions, moisturizers and cleansing creams instead
of names and descriptions indicating their medicinal characte­ristics.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, to quote once more the
observations of Judge Alex Z. Reyes on this point in <span class="SpellE"><u>Oro</u></span><u>
Enterprises</u>:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The apparent quibble on the descriptive term, 'lotion' as creating
the impression and evoking the connotation that the preparation is cosmetic,
does not change the basic fact that the <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
products by nature, formulation and purpose, as found and certi­fied, is
medicinal. 'What's in a name? that which we call a rose, by any other name
would smell as sweet! We do not think the certification is a mere cosmetic
effort to disguise the true nature and character of the questioned
product.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We therefore feel compelled to
affirm its import and force lest it be suffered to petrify in futility.'</p>

<blockquote>At any rate, as explained by petitioner in his letter dated January
13, 1978 to respondent requesting a tax credit/refund of the amount involved in
this case, 'these names are marketing strategies designed to attract more the buying
public than if they are to be called by medical names.' (p.28, BIR
records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And a medicinal preparation
does not lose its character as such because it is sold over the counter to the
public generally, rather than to druggist, physician and medical institution to
be administered <span class="SpellE">hyperdermically</span> by physicians.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Vital Corp. vs. Knox Co., Crest. &amp; App.
143 F, 2d, 883, 888)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">We find merit in the

for the use of the apothecary or the physician to be administered as a remedy

curing or alleviating or palliating or preventing some disease or affliction of

the respondent court's decision.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">It is undisputed that the
respondent has been publicly representing the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span>
products as good for cleansing, moisturizing, lubricating or oiling the skin;
in other words, their function is principally to improve bodily appearance and
enhance the health of the skin, making it soft, smooth and fragrant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The preparations fall squarely under the
definition of "toilet preparation" which has been defined as
"any preparation which is intended to affect and conceivably improve the
bodily appearance, such as a lotion intended to contribute to the health and
appearance of the </span>skin."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The marketing presentation of the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span>

preparation, cannot be dismissed as a mere matter of form rather than <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">substance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span></span>For it is the perception of the public carefully and assiduously
built over the years that lends substance to the claim of the manufacturer that
its product is a toilet preparation good for beautifying or enhancing the
health of the skin.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It cannot be said
that the public "fairly and honestly" believe the <span class="SpellE">Tussy</span>
