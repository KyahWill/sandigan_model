Petitioner Police Commission seeks the setting aside of the decision of 
the defunct Court of First Instance (respondent court) of Rizal, Branch 
VI, which declared null and void its decision in Administrative Case No.
 48 dismissing private respondent Simplicio C. Ibea and instead ordered 
then Municipal Mayor Braulio Sto. Domingo of San Juan, Rizal to 
reinstate said respondent to his former position as policeman of the 
same municipality with back salaries from the date of his suspension up 
to the date of his actual reinstatement.  Upon the filing of the 
petition, the Court, at petitioner's instance, issued a writ of 
preliminary injunction restraining respondent court from executing the 
questioned decision.
<p>
Respondent Ibea had been dismissed from the police service by the then 
Mayor Braulio Sto. Domingo (later on substituted during the pendency of 
this case in the court below by incumbent Mayor Joseph Ejercito Estrada)
 pursuant to the decision of petitioner commission finding him guilty of
 serious irregularity in the performance of duty on complaint of Jose 
Lee, Jr.
</p><p>
Respondent thereafter filed his complaint with respondent court seeking 
his reinstatement.  He was sustained by respondent court which rendered 
its decision declaring the decision of the Police Commission as null and
 void and ordered the town mayor to "reinstate the plaintiff to his 
former position as patrolman in the Police Department of San Juan, Rizal
 with back salaries and remunerations pertaining to said position from 
the date of his suspension to the time of his reinstatement to the 
service." Respondent court ruled that the decision of petitioner 
commission was based on incomplete records as there was no transcript of
 the testimonies of witnesses or minutes of the proceedings before the 
Board of Investigators and that the commission's conclusion was without 
factual basis and was in violation of administrative due process.  
Respondent court also ruled that the question of the temporary status of
 the appointment of Ibea for lack of civil service eligibility (which 
was raised in the court below by the answer of Mayor Joseph Ejercito 
Estrada) had become moot and academic upon respondent Ibea's subsequent 
acquisition of a civil service eligibility.
</p><p>
Hence, this petition which this Court finds meritorious, as per the 
assignment of errors made by the Solicitor General on behalf of 
petitioner commission, as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "I.    The lower court erred in holding that respondent Simplicio 
C. Ibea was deprived of due process of law because the Police Commission
 decided Administrative Case No. 48 even without stenographic notes 
taken of the proceedings of the case. </p>
  <p> "II.   The lower court erred in disturbing the findings of facts 
of the Police Commission, an administrative agency duly vested by 
Republic Act No. 4864 with the power and authority to render decision in
 administrative cases against policemen and whose decision is final. </p>
  <p> "III.  The lower court erred in holding that the allegations on 
the temporary status of the appointment of respondent Simplicio C. Ibea 
for lack of civil service eligibility has been rendered moot and 
academic upon the latter's subsequent acquisition of a civil service 
eligibility."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Court finds the errors assigned to be well taken.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1.  Respondent court's ruling against petitioner's decision as 
falling short of the legal requirements of due process, because it 
decided the subject administrative case without stenographic notes 
(which were not taken by the Board of Investigators) of the proceedings 
of the case, was in error.  Rep. Act No. 4864 does not provide that the 
Board of Investigators shall be a "board of record," and as such it does
 not provide for office personnel such as clerks and stenographers who 
may be employed to take note of the proceedings of the board.  The 
proceeding provided for is merely administrative and summary in 
character, in line with the principle that "administrative rules of 
procedure should be construed liberally in order to promote their object
 and to assist the parties in obtaining just, speedy and inexpensive 
determination of their respective claims and defenses."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup>
  The formalities usually attendant in court hearings need not be 
present in an administrative investigation, provided that the parties 
are heard and given the opportunity to adduce their respective evidence.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The decision and resolution of petitioner commission amply show that 
both complainant and respondent were given the opportunity to be heard 
by the board and to adduce their respective evidence, which were duly 
considered and taken into account in its decision.  The absence of the 
transcript of stenographic notes (which were not taken by the board) in 
the records of the case submitted by the Board of Investigators of San 
Juan, Rizal in the administrative proceeding cannot be claimed to have 
deprived respondent of due process of law.  The report of investigation 
(which contained a summary report of what transpired during the hearing 
of the case), the affidavit-complaint, and respondent's answer thereto, 
as well as the memoranda of the parties were sufficient basis for the 
decision and resolution of the commission, and substantially and 
essentially constituted the "records of the investigation" required in 
Section 15 of Rep. Act No. 4864.
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    2. The record amply shows that petitioner's decision was supported 
by substantial evidence consisting of the affidavit-complaint (which was
 duly affirmed when complainant Jose Lee, Jr. appeared and testified 
before the board) and the documentary evidence duly marked by the board 
as exhibits for the complainant (and which were not questioned by 
respondent).  As uniformly held by the Court, it is sufficient that 
administrative findings of fact are supported by evidence on the record,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup>  or stated negatively, it is sufficient that findings of fact are not shown to be unsupported by evidence.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup>  As expounded by Justice Laurel in the leading case of <em>Ang Tibay vs. Court of Industrial Relations</em>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup>
 substantial evidence is all that is needed to support an administrative
 finding of fact, and substantial evidence is "such relevant evidence as
 a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion." 
The commission's reasons for having chosen to believe the complaint 
filed by Mr. Jose Lee, Jr. as against respondent's defense were 
extensively discussed in its decision (Annex "N") and reiterated in its 
resolution, thus: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> ''A close perusal of the record shows that said affidavit was 
presented by the complainant during the proceedings and its presentation
 was not objected to by the respondent-petitioner.  Hence, it became a 
part of the records and therefore must be considered in the deliberation
 of this case.  Moreover, there are documents presented and incorporated
 in the records of the case that are corroborative of the affidavit of 
the complainant.  Some of these documentary evidence are memorandum of 
the complainant, copy of the police blotter, letter of the complainant 
to Lt. Bautista, reply of the Clerk of Court to Jose Lee, Jr., a copy of
 the decision of Cesar Cruz, Acting Municipal Judge of San Juan, Rizal 
and the investigation report of Pat. Simplicio C. Ibea which was 
eventually submitted though late.  All these documents, one way or 
another, corroborate the affidavit of the complainant.  Hence, the 
allegation that the affidavit is uncorroborated does not hold water."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> 
      </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above-mentioned documentary evidence which convinced petitioner as 
to the veracity of the charges against respondent were certainly more 
than persuasive and substantial.
</p><p>
Respondent court therefore erred in choosing to believe the theory of 
the defense put up by respondent Ibea on the equally erroneous ground 
that there was no evidence to support the findings of the Police 
Commission.  In effect, respondent Court substituted its own judgment 
for that of the Police Commission which is final, contrary to the 
prevailing principle that "in reviewing administrative decisions, the 
reviewing court cannot reexamine the sufficiency of the evidence as if 
originally instituted therein, and receive additional evidence that was 
not submitted to the administrative agency concerned.  The findings of 
fact must be respected, so long as they are supported by substantial 
evidence, even if not overwhelming or preponderant."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> 
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    3.  Since the appointment of Simplicio C. Ibea to the police force 
was only temporary in nature for lack of civil service eligibility at 
the time, the same was duly terminated upon his dismissal pursuant to 
the commission's decision.  Respondent had no longer any legal right to 
be reinstated to the service where the mayor does not want him 
reinstated by extending him a new appointment as in the instant case.
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Respondent court erred in holding that the allegations on the temporary 
status of the appointment of private respondent Simplicio C. Ibea for 
lack of civil service eligibility had been rendered moot and academic 
upon the latter's subsequent acquisition of a civil ser­vice 
eligibility.  Under the civil service law then in force, the fact that 
private respondent subsequently became a civil service eligible did not <em>ipso facto</em>
 render permanent the nature of his temporary appointment as to make the
 question moot and academic.  In fact, under Section 24 (d) of Republic 
Act No. 2260 (Civil Service Act of 1959), the law in force at the time 
of Ibea's appointment, a temporary appointment could not exceed six 
months (now one year under R.A. 6040).  That he was allowed by the mayor
 to continue in the service even after the six-months period was merely 
an extension of grace.  Thus, as the Court held in similar cases:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Temporary appointments, under Section 682 of the Revised 
Administrative Code, are limited to three months.  Upon the expiration 
of that period, a temporary appointee could be removed at will.  Any 
continuance thereafter as a temporary employee was an extension of 
grace.  The fact that petitioner became a civil service eligible did not
 entitle him to a permanent appointment to the position.  The power to 
appoint is discretionary on the part of the appointing power.  
Petitioner's temporary appointment did not ripen, by virtue of his 
acquisition of eligibility into one of permanence."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p align="center">
-           -           -
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Since his appointment is temporary, it did not confer upon 
appellant a vested right to occupy in a permanent character the position
 to which he was appointed.  His civil service eligibility will avail 
him none."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In fine, since respondent Ibea was merely a temporary appointee, he was 
subject to removal at any time without the necessity of following the 
procedure set up by Republic Act No. 4864, for removal of police 
officers, and regardless of the complaint filed against him.  After his 
services were terminated by former Mayor Sto. Domingo, his reinstatement
 was no longer legally feasible in the face of incumbent Mayor Estrada's
 refusal to do so, considering that he held merely a temporary 
appointment.
</p><p>
For "well-settled in this jurisdiction is the principle that when an 
appointment is temporary, the same is terminable at the pleasure of the 
appointing power, and no cause is required to be shown for such 
termination."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> 
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, the questioned decision of respondent defunct Court of 
First Instance of Rizal, Branch VI, in Civil Case No. 12069 is hereby 
set aside and the preliminary injunction issued against its enforcement 
is hereby made permanent.  No costs.
