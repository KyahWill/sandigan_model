<p class="BODY">Hence, in view of the admissions of the respondent, exceptional
circumstances allow a deviation from the general rule regarding the surrender
of the bill of lading.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The rule cannot
always be absolute.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioner-carrier Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc<span class="GramE">.,</span> averred in its answer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">as </span>one of its special and affirmative defenses that respondent
CMI is the consignee of the shipment in question and offered in its formal
offer of evidence before the Trial Court the subject Bill of Lading as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">its </span>“Exhibit 1”.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(p. 146, Original Records)</p>

<p class="BODY">The Rules of Court provide that:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“Admissibility of evidence.</span> - Evidence is
admissible when it is relevant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>the
issue and is not excluded by these rules.” (Sec. 3, Rule 128, Rules of Court)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“Judicial admissions.</span> - Admissions made by
the parties in the pleadings, or in the course of the trial or other
proceedings do<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"> </span>not require proof
and cannot be contradicted unless previously shown to have been made through
palpable mistakes.” (Sec. 2, Rule 129, Rules of Court)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">But assuming that CMI may not be considered consignee, the
petitioner cannot be faulted for releasing the goods to CMI under the
circumstances, due to its lack of knowledge as to who was the real consignee in
view of <span class="SpellE">CMI’s</span> strong representations and letter of undertaking
wherein it stated that the bill of lading would be presented later.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is precisely the situation covered by
the last paragraph of Art. 353 of the Corporation Code to wit:</p>

<blockquote>“If in case of loss or for any other reason whatsoever, the
consignee cannot return upon receiving the merchandise the bill of lading
subscribed by the carrier, he shall give said carrier a receipt of the goods
delivered this receipt producing the same effects as the return of the bill of
lading.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In <u>State</u> <u>Bonding</u> <u>and</u> <u>Ins.</u> <u>Co.</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Inc.</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <u>v.</u> </span><u>Manila</u> <u>Port</u> <u>Service</u>, (11 SCRA
400 [1964]), it was held that the arrival of shipment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">is </span>deemed admitted by an allegation of delivery to the consignee.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the special circumstances of this case, equity favors the
petitioner which proved that it was in good faith while both respondents cannot
claim the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">While the goods in question were released on March 4, 1980 the
records show that HSBC received the original bill of lading, as per testimony
of its witness <span class="SpellE">Ederlina</span> <span class="SpellE">Crisostomo</span>
(TSN, p. 29, July 13, 1982), only on April 1980 or long after the goods had
been released.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This circumstance goes
against the claims of HSBC.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus HSBC in its original demand letter stated, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">“We a</span>re unable to locate the cargo and
it would appear that it has been released by you to Consolidated Mines, Inc.” <span class="GramE">(Annex B of Complaint, p<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">. </span>8,
Original Records).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This proves
that it had foreknowledge of the prior release to CMI.</p>

<p class="BODY">And to make things worse, HSBC, despite <span class="SpellE">CMI’s</span>
admission that it received the goods, sued only the petitioner-carrier while at
the same time claiming for the value of the goods in the involuntary insolvency
proceedings of CMI <u>which</u> <u>the</u> <u>Bank</u> <u>itself</u>, together
with others, initiated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only later
developments led to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding that respondent HSBC admits even in its
memorandum filed with the trial court that Consolidated Mines, Inc. is the
consignee (p. 168, Original Records), yet HSBC pinpoints liability to the
petitioner carrier by relying on the provisions of Article 1736 of the Civil
Code of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which provides that:</p>

<blockquote>“The extraordinary responsibility of the common carrier lasts from
the time the goods are unconditionally placed in the possession of, and
received by the carrier for transportation until the same are delivered,
actually or constructively, by the carrier to the consignee, or to the person
who has a right to receive them, without prejudice to the provisions of Article
1738.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Respondent HSBC wittingly or unwittingly
overlooked the fact that the same article uses the conjunction “or” in
reference to whom the goods may be delivered, that is, to the consignee, <u>or</u>
to the person who has a right to receive them.</p>

<p class="BODY">That respondent HSBC is the more negligent party as against the
petitioner-carrier becomes more evident when aside from having allowed
respondent Consolidated Mines, Inc. to be designed in the bills of lading
(Exhibits A, A-1 and A-2, pp. 65-67, Original Records), as the party to be
notified, it allowed the latter to be designated as the consignee in the
Consular Invoice (Exhibit A-6, p. 74, Original Records), the original of which
was directly furnished to respondent Consolidated Mines, Inc. by and as
certified to by the shipper <span class="SpellE">Nanyo</span> Corporation
(Exhibit A-5, p. 73, Original Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>With such vast powers, akin to an agent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">of </span>respondent HSBC, respondent Consolidated Mines, Inc. acted
within its authority, and even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">if </span>it
acted on its own; consequently, respondent HSBC may not hold the
petitioner-carrier liable because Art. 1883 the Civil Code provides that:</p>

<blockquote>“If an agent acts in his own name, the principal has no right <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">of </span>action against the persons with whom
the agent has contracted; neither have such persons against the principal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“In such case the agent is the one directly bound in favor of the
person with whom he has contracted, as if the transaction were his own, except
when the contract involves things belonging to the principal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“The provisions of this article shall be understood <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>be without prejudice to the actions
between the principal and agent.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For almost six months from the arrival of the goods HSBC did not
do anything to claim the cargo.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It could
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">not possibly <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">be left </span>around lying idle when on the face of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">the bill </span>of <span class="GramE">lading,</span>
there was a named owner to be notified.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">On the other hand, CMI
secured the release of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">goods
through misrepresentation before the petitioner</span>-carrier without settling
its account with HSBC and <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">thereafter
did not </span>bother to present evidence before the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">trial court, leaving </span>the petitioner holding an empty bag <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">as it were.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>These </span>circumstances also prove bad faith </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the part of CMI.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Under the exceptional
circumstances and applying especially strong considerations of equity, the
petitioner did not commit </span>any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">fault
sufficient to render it liable to HSBC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>On the contrary, it was HSBC and CMI who were obviously in bad faith in
dealing with the <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">petitioner-carrier. </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
