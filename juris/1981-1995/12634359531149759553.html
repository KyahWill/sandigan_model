dated May 30, 1989 (pp. 16-117, Rollo), finding her guilty of 22 counts of
Estafa Through Falsification of Public Documents and sentencing her to suffer
22 separate jail terms, ranging from 4 years, 2 months, and 1 day of prision
correccional in the minimum, to 10 years of prision mayor, maximum.</p>

<p class="BODY">Forty-six cases were filed by the then Tanodbayan charging
certain <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">officials </span>and employees
of the then Ministry of Public Highways of Region VII and of the Siquijor
Highway Engineering District (SHED) Office and certain private
contractors/suppliers, with having committed the prime of Estafa Through
Falsification of Public Documents.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Informations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">in </span>all
the cases are identically worded, except <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">as

<blockquote>That during the period from [period specified], or thereabout, in
the City of Cebu and in the Province of Siquijor (both in Region VII), Republic
of the Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the
above-named accused, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">with </span>deliberate
intent and with intent to defraud the Republic of the Philippines, conspiring
and confederating together with their co-accused [name], a contractor, and
mutually helping one another, and taking advantage of their public positions,
did, then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously commit the following
acts of falsification and/or fraudulent acts executed prior to or
simultaneously with the commission of the fraud, to wit:   (a) [names of Regional Highway Officials and
their respective positions], prepared, caused to be prepared, signed,  countersigned and released Letter of Advice
of Allotment (LAA), No. [xxx], dated [xxx] in the amount of  [xxx] of the District Engineer of Siquijor
Engineering District, allegedly for maintenance of National Roads and Bridges
when, as a matter of fact and as accused well knew, the same was not covered by
a Sub-Allotment Advice (SAA) from the Ministry of Public Highways, Manila, thus
making untruthful statements in the narration of facts; (b), accused [names of
some SHED officials and employees] in connivance with the above-named accused
[name of contractor/supplier], prepared and approved Requisition &amp; Issue
Voucher [date of voucher] for [quantity in cu. m.] Aggregate Base Course (Item
200) charged to said fake LAA; (c) above?names accused Trinidad T.
Manloloyo, Chairman, Aurelio M. de la Pe√±a, Herminio T. Buac, Zosimo S. Dinsay,

of said General Voucher No. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">[xxx]; </span>(i)
and finally [name of contractor/supplier] received and encashed the aforesaid
TCAA Check, thus, the above-names accused were able to appropriate, as they did
appropriate and convert to their own personal use and benefit, to the damage
and prejudice of the Government of the Philippines in the total amount of
(words and figures) Pesos.</blockquote>

<blockquote>ALL ACTS CONTRARY to Article 315, par. 2, in relation to Article
171 of the Revised Penal Code.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Duly arraigned under each of the different Informations, all of
the accused pleaded "Not Guilty".</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, by agreement of the parties, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">a </span>joint trial was held.  The Sandiganbayan, later rendered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a
</span>single decision for all the cases.  Herein petitioner Tan, then employed as District Accountant of SHED, was
found guilty as charged in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">22 </span>cases
(Criminal Case No. 2073-2095, except 2077).</p>

<p class="BODY">Initially, it may be a useful backgrounder if We examine the
procedure involved in the funding of different regions of the Ministry of
Public Highways and in the disbursement of said funds which petitioner
accurately synthesized thus:</p>

<blockquote>At the beginning of each quarter, the Ministry of the Budget issues
to the Ministry of Public Highways the advice of allotment (AA), which is the
authority to obligate, and the Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC) which is the
authority to disburse.  In turn, the
Ministry of Public Highways, issues sub-advices of allotments (SAA) to the
various regional offices, and the corresponding advices of cash disbursement
ceilings (ACDC).  The regional offices
then issue Letter of Advice of Allotment (LAA) to the various districts to
enable the district offices to incur obligations, and the corresponding
sub-advices of Cash Disbursement Ceilings (ACDC).  The LAAs are prepared in the Budget Section of the Accounting and
Finance Division of the Regional Office, forwarded to the Accounting Section
for obligation and certification of availability of funds by the Chief Accountant,
after which it is forwarded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">to </span>the
Finance Officer for signature and the Regional Director or his duly authorized
representative for counter-signature.  Thereafter, it is brought back to the Budget Section for proper release.</blockquote>

<blockquote>With the receipt of the LAAs and the CDCs, the district is now
equipped with authority to incur obligation and authority to disburse.  However, as a matter of procedure, a
Requisition for Supplies or Equipment (RSE) is prepared by the property
custodian wherein the district accountant certifies as to the availability of
funds.  The Project Engineer also
prepares a Request for Obligation of Allotment (ROA) which is likewise
certified by the District Accountant as to the availability of funds.  The RSE, together with the program of work,
is transmitted to the Regional Director for approval, after which it is
returned to the district.  Thereafter,
canvass bid forms are sent to the different contractors or suppliers for
quotation of prices for the materials or supplies called for in the approved
RSE.  After all bid forms are submitted,
they are opened on specified dates and the determination of the lowest bidder
is made.  This is indicated in the Abstract
of Sealed Quotations.  A Purchase Order
is then made in favor of the winning bidder or contractor.  Deliveries are made by the contractor and,
thereafter, a General Voucher, supported by delivery receipts and inspection
reports and other supporting documents, is processed for the payment of the
delivered materials or supplies.  Finally,
the corresponding check is prepared and released to the contractor, who
encashes the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the end of each month, the District Accountant of the various
engineering districts prepare several reports including the Report of
Obligations Incurred (ROI) and the Report of Checks Issued by Deputized
Disbursing Officers (RCIDDO) which are submitted to the region.  The reports form the basis for the
preparation of the monthly trial balance.  This trial balance is prepared in the Regional Office and submitted to
the Central Office of the Ministry of Public Highways on or before the 5th of
the succeeding month, for final consolidation by the Central Office in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">a </span>single trial balance for the entire
Ministry, which is then submitted to the Commission on Audit.  The ROIs which is then submitted by the
various districts to the regional office at the end of each month are
summarized and consolidated by the Chief Accountant of the Region in a Journal
Voucher, which is then approved by the Finance Officer <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">of </span>the region.  The
monthly trial balance is likewise prepared and signed by the Chief Accountant
of the region, recommended for approval by the Finance Officer thereof, and
finally approved by the Regional Director before it is submitted to the central
office.  (pp. 245-247, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of an extensive investigation undertaken by different
agencies of the government involving the alleged Central Visayas highway
anomalies which surfaced in mid 1978, an audit team was organized on June 21,
1978, by Sofronio Flores, Jr., Regional Director, COA, Region VII, with station
at Cebu City.  The team was to look into
the alleged issuance of fake Letters of Advice of Allotments (LAAs) to the different
highway engineering districts of the region.</p>

<p class="BODY">The team, composed of Victoria Tejada (sometimes referred to in
the record as Quejada) and Ruth Paredes, both Auditors IV of Region VII, made a
detailed study of the system and accounting procedures in the issuance of
Advices of Allotments.  They also
prepared a worksheet containing a summary of sub-advices of allotments (SAAs)
under Fund 101 in 1977 based on the records of the Regional Office.</p>

<p class="BODY">Region VII covers 15 highway engineering districts, one of which
is the Siquijor Highway Engineering District or SHED, headed by the District
Engineer.  The SHED <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">LAAs </span>were matched <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with </span>the SAAs (Exhs. D to D-1).  Some LAAs (Exhibits J, J-1 to J-37) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">were </span>found <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">to be regular inasmuch </span>as they <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">were recorded </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the
Regional Office's </span>Logbook (Exhibits H-20 to H-24) while other LAAs
(Exhibits K, K-1 to K-29) turned out to be fake or irregular since they were
(1) not covered by SAAs; (2) could not be found in the logbook; (3) do not
contain the accounting release stamp at the upper portion; (4) issued without
authority, and (5) contain prior years' obligation numbers.  Most of the regular LAAs were signed by
accused Angelina Esca√±o or Heracleo Faelnar.  (Regional Finance Officer and Asst. Regional Director, respectively)
while the fake LAAs were signed by Rolando Mangubat or Adventor Fernandez
(Regional Accountant and Regional Highway Engineer, respectively).  The Advices of Cash Disbursement Ceilings
(ACDCs) received by the Regional Office from 1975 to 1977 appear in a certification
(Exhibit L) wherein said ACDCs are listed (Exhibits M to M-1 and N to N-54),
aside from being also listed in the logbook (Exhibits H-25 to H-31).  They also prepared a list of the regular
Sub-advices of Cash Disbursement Ceilings (SACDCs) which could be traced to the
Cash Disbursement Ceiling (CDC) subsidiary ledger maintained by the Regional
Office (Exhibits O to O-18; P to P-17).  Aside from the latter, there were also SACDCs in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
28.0pt">the</span> possession of the SHED in the year 1977 which could not be
traced in the subsidiary ledgers of CDCs maintained by the Regional Office and
over which they also made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">a </span>listing
(Exhibits Q, Q-1 to Q-22).  The regular
SACDCs bear accounting department release stamps and were signed either by
Rolando Mangubat, Delia Preagido, or Angelina Esca√±o while the fake <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">SACDCs </span>were signed only by Mangubat
and did not bear any release stamps.</p>

<p class="BODY">After making the listings and compilations, and following
analysis of the same the auditors determined the disbursements that were made
out of the fake allotments by going over the general vouchers (GVs) of SHED for
the year 1977 (Exhibits R, R-1 to R-23) which were retrieved by the COA team on
October 2, 1978 which then prepared a working paper matching the vouchers
against the fake LAAs (Exhibits S, S-1 to S-3 and T).  The basis for matching the vouchers with the fake allotments are
the Reports of Checks Issued by Deputized Disbursing Officer (RCIDDO) of SHED
for 1977 (Exhibits U, U-1 to U-40).  The
total payments made from the 24 vouchers which are the fake allotments was P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">982,207.60.  The total amount of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the </span>regular
LAAs assigned for Siquijor for the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">year
</span>1977 was P1,647,890.23 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">while </span>the
fake LAAs amounted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to P1</span>,586,080.00.  The fake SACDCs amount to P2,147,533.73 and
the regular CDCs totalled <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">P</span>1,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">660,084</span>.53 (Exhibits O and Q).  The total disbursements made by SHED in 1977
amounted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>P2,560,332.99 based
on the RCIDDO.  (See pp. 35-38, Decision,
pp. 50-53, Rollo pp. 10-11 Petitioner's Memorandum, pp. 247-248, pp. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">instant </span>appeal,
petitioner claims <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">that </span>the
Sandiganbayan erred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">when </span>it
held:</p>

<blockquote>Accused <u>Tan's</u> liability arises from her certifications on
all the RSEs and GVs as to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">availability
</span>of funds therefor, knowing fully well as District Accountant that these
were illegally funded and were irregularly charged to "Fund 81-400", <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and </span>that the district's regular
maintenance needs were adequately funded by, and prosecuted under, such regular
allotments.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">She </span>also signed seven (7) Abstract of Bids.  (p. 83, Decision, p. 99, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We have given due course to the petition despite objections of
the Solicitor General that because the petition raises <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">only </span>factual issues, appeal by <i>certiorari </i>is
unavailing.  We believe petitioner's
case falls within the exceptions consistently upheld by Us in regard to
findings of fact of lower courts.  In
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">case </span>of <u>Macadangdang</u>  <u>vs.</u> <u>Sandiganbayan</u> (170 SCRA
308 [1989]), We stated that while the general  rule is that factual findings of the Sandiganbayan are conclusive, this
is, however, subject to established exceptions, among them :</p>

<blockquote>1)  The conclusion is a finding grounded
entirely on speculation, surmise and conjectures; 2) the inference made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is </span>manifestly mistaken; 3) there is
grave abuse of discretion; 4) the judgment is based on misapprehension of
facts; and the findings of fact of the Sandiganbayan are premised on the
absence of evidence and are contradicted by evidence on record.  (Cesar vs. Sandiganbayan, 134 SCRA 105, 121-122)
(at p. 325.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As uniformly alleged by the prosecution, the manner of operation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>the "conniving" accused,
was to falsify any <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of </span>the
following documents:</p>

2, </span>Petition, p. 8, Rollo; p. 15, Comment, p. 142, Rollo.)</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner denies any direct participation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>the execution of the foregoing
documents.  She claims that her
participation was limited to the certification, in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">her capacity </span>as District Accountant, on the availability of
funds, and her signature on seven Abstracts of Bids, in her capacity as member
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>Committee on Awards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan, however, included her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">in </span>the conspiracy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">allegedly
</span>because she issued the certification on the availability of funds,
"knowing fully well as District Accountant <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>c.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
district's regular maintenance needs were adequately funded by, and prosecuted
under, such regular allotments.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the charge that the RSEs and GVs were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">illegally </span>funded, the Sandiganbayan relied principally on the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"fake" or </span>irregular LAAs,
issued by the Regional Office (Region VII) of the Ministry of Public Highways.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the LAA, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or </span>Letter
of Advice of Allotment, which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">authority <u>to</u> <u>incur</u> <u>obligation</u>,
as well as the SACDC, or Sub-Advice of </span>Case Disbursement, which is the <u>authority</u>
<u>to</u> <u>pay</u> for the obligation incurred under the LAAs emanate from the
Regional Office.  All the LAAs, cited in
the information against petitioner were duly covered by SACDCs.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Was there anything on the face of LAAs that should have warned
petitioner of any possible irregularity?</p>

<p class="BODY">She insists that there are no specific guidelines on the features
of an LAA.  The District Office was, at
the time, guided only by the signature of the duly authorized official and the
corresponding obligation number.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, while LAAs are generally signed by Angelina Esca√±o,
Regional Finance Officer, petitioner found nothing irregular in LAAs bearing
the signature of her co-accused, Rolando Mangubat (Chief Accountant, Region
VII), because there were instances where LAAs issued by the Regional Office,
which were supposed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">to </span>be signed
by Esca√±o bore instead the signature of Mangubat.  She thus found no need for verifying Mangubat's authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an earlier case, <u>Esca√±o</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Sandiganbayan</u>  (160 SCRA 429 [1988]), which concerned the
same Angelina Esca√±o spoken of earlier and which involved the same or similar
transactions herein treated, this Court took judicial notice of Memorandum
Circular No. 111, issued by the Ministry of Public Highways which authorized
Mangubat "to act as the Finance Officer, for and in the absence of the
Finance Officer".  The authority
given to Mangubat was subsequently revoked on May 17, 1978.  The evidence of the prosecution in said case
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">shows </span>that 46 spurious LAAs bore
the date May 16, 1976, which means that the LAAs were antedated in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">order </span>to make it appear that Mangubat
signed them before his authority <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">was
revoked </span>(at p. 436).</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witness Victoria Tejada (or Quejada), one of the
auditors who investigated the mess, likewise testified on cross-examination in
COA Adm. Cases No. 81-513, 81-514, cited in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">the </span>COA decision dated December 27, 1983, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Prior to 21 July 1978, obligations for requisitions of fuel, oil,
supplies and materials chargeable  to
the maintenance fund were based on estimates only and usually the estimated
costs were more than the actual payments.  These excess obligations become savings and if payments were to be made
after the close of the fiscal year these excess obligations cannot be returned
to the projects because these amounts are already credited to account
81-400.  These savings are to be
utilized for other purpose provided that it be in connection with the same
project.  Account 81-400 can be debited
by payment of the obligations or by reversion to the Central Office.  It cannot be adjusted because the beginning

<p class="BODY">With respect to maintenance funds, petitioner states that these
are continuing appropriations, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">and </span>the
practice was to obligate the unexpended balances at the end of the year in the
books, even without specific creditors.  These balances <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">are </span>considered

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">P</span>etitioner further
explains:</p>

<blockquote>Only the district engineer and the maintenance engineer knew the
amount needed for the regular maintenance fund because it is the maintenance
engineer mho prepares the maintenance estimate for the whole year.  The district accountant (who happens to be
the petitioner) is not provided a copy of the maintenance estimate.  The district engineer and the maintenance
engineer determine the needs for regular maintenance.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Releases of quarterly allotments for regular maintenance funds
based on the maintenance estimates are not covered by Programs of Work.  Release of maintenance fund other than what
is contained in the maintenance estimate (quarterly allotments) were received
first by the district office after which programs of work were prepared.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The district accountant has nothing to do with the program of
work.  The accountant's signature on the
GVs is for the purpose of certifying to the availability of funds, and that the
GVs are properly approved, supported by documents appearing legal and proper
and with the appropriate account codes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>All the alleged fake LAAs received <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">by </span>SHED bore Regional Office Obligation Number.  They are not, therefore, to be included in
the Statement of Accounts Payable of SHED otherwise the total of the Statement
of Accounts Payable will exceed that of the total of the balances of each ROA -
obligations incurred of SHED.  Petitioner believes it to be erroneous to include amounts already
obligated by the Regional Office and obligate them again in the books of SHED.  It will constitute double obligation and
wrong accounting procedures.  (pp.
24-25, Petitioner's Memorandum; pp. 261-262, Rollo)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner's defense was capsulized by the Sandiganbayan in this
matter:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">. . .  </span>When she received the questioned
LAAs, she classified them as unliquidated obligations for the year 1976, and
since it bears the obligation numbers of the Regional Office, she did not
include them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">in </span>the unliquidated
obligations of the district.  The moment
they received the LAAs with their respective ROA obligation numbers, they spend
the amounts and later submit a report of checks issued.  Since these are excess obligations, they can
use them for other purposes and it is the District Engineer who will determine
for what project the obligation will be spent.  Despite the regular quarterly allotments released to SHED, she was not
surprised when they received another P1 million plus, and she presumed that was
an additional allotment for the district.  They did not consume the amount because there was an excess of
P512,000.00 (pp. 47-48, Decision; pp. 63-64, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the claim of totally absent or irregular bidding procedures,
petitioner points out:</p>

<blockquote>There are two committees in SHED - the Committees on Bidding, which
is responsible for the opening of bids and writing the quotations of bids on
the Abstract of Bids; and the Committee on Awards, of which the petitioner was
a member.  Petitioner is not a member of
the bidding committee.  The Committee on
Award recommends the award to the lowest bidder based on the quotations on the
abstract of bids submitted by the bidding committee.  The committee on award will not be in a position to know what
transpired in the proceedings of the committee on bidding.  Petitioner's signature on the Abstract of
Bids is merely incidental to her being member of the Committee on Award.  (p. 264, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the charge that the LAAs (issued by the Regional Office) were
not covered by Sub-Allotment Advices (SAA) from the Ministry of Public
Highways, which circumstance impliedly, rendered the LAAs spurious, petitioner
again points out that since, precisely, the SAAs emanate from the Ministry, the
district office is not in a position to know whether or not an LAA is covered
by an SSA.</p>

<p class="BODY">Auditor Ruth I. Paredes, the companion of Tejada, declared for
the prosecution that upon receipt by the Budget Officer of the Advice of
Allotment (AA) from the Ministry of Budget, she prepares 5 copies for each
regional office of the Ministry of Public Highways.  The district offices <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">are
not </span>furnished <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">copies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Auditor Paredes further testified
that not </span>all LAAs issued by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Regional
Office are </span>covered by SAAs.  The
only instance that the SSA number is indicated on the LAA is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">when </span>the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">released </span>funds come from savings on equipment rentals (TSN, p.
11, January 12, 1983; p. 25, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, it appears that
petitioner <u>merely</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">app</span>lied</u>
<u>and</u> <u>observed</u> <u>standard</u> <u>operating</u> <u>procedures</u>.  If there were deficiencies in these
procedures which could have facilitated irregularities <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">or </span>misappropriation of funds, We believe that these should have
been corrected at the Regional level where the anomally seems to have been
hatched.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner carefully pointed out that where LAAs indicate Fund
81-400, the district had no choice but to record them and allow the expenses because
the Regional Office had already obligated the funds in its books.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no direct evidence to show that petitioner connived and
schemed with the others.  Seemingly, and
only because the LAAs were spurious, the Sandiganbayan thereupon surmised that
the funds authorized therein were illegal.  Petitioner was convicted solely on the theory of conspiracy.  We have emphasized times without number that
conspiracy must be established by clear and convincing evidence (<u>Bayan</u> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>, 181 SCRA 844 [1990]).  The liability of a person depends on his
participation.  In the case at bar,
aside from petitioner's certification of the availability of funds as District
Accountant and her signature on RSEs and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">GVs
</span>(which duty <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>attached to
her position), there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">is </span>no
showing that she participated in transactions that would reveal a criminal
intent or scheme to defraud.</p>

<p class="BODY">We had occasion to observe in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Macadangdang</span></u> <u>vs.</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">Sandiganbayan</span></u> (170<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>SCRA
308 [1989])</p>

<blockquote>Simply because a person in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a
</span>chain of processing officers happens to sign or initial a voucher as it
is going the rounds, it does not necessarily follow that said person becomes
part of a conspiracy in an illegal scheme.  It is all <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">too </span>easy to be
swept into a long prison term simply because the guilt of some conspirators is

<p class="BODY">And of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">course, We </span>need

convict.  Rather, every circumstance
