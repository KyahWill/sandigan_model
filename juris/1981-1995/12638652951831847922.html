				<BR><STRONG>PARAS, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Roberto <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> y <span class="SpellE">Cabading</span>,
found guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 4, Article II of
Republic Act No. 6425 (Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972 as amended) by the Regional
Trial Court, First Judicial Region, Branch V, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City and sentenced to suffer the penalty of imprisonment for life, to pay a
fine of P20,000.00 and costs, now seeks a reversal of the said decision and
prays for his acquittal on the ground that the trial court erred in finding him
guilty for the following reasons -</p>

<blockquote>"1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE TRIAL COURT
CORRECTLY DISREÂ­GARDED THE INHERENTLY HEARSAY TESTIMONY OF THE TWO ARRESTING
OFFICERS, THE ALLEGED "BUYER" NOT HAVING BEEN PRESENTED AS A WITNESS.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE POLICE
OFFICERS, THROUGH THEIR INFORMER, INSTIGATED THE COMMISSION OF THE OFFENSE;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE FISCAL
CONDUCTED THE PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION AND FILED THE INFORMATION AGAINST THE
ACCUSED-APPELLANT ONLY IN VIOLATION OF RULE 110, SECTION 1, REVISED RULES OF
COURT WHICH REQUIRES THAT CRIMINAL ACTION BE COMMENCED AGAINST ALL PERSONS WHO
APPEAR TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OFFENSE CHARGED;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE TRIAL COURT
CONVICTED THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING THE INHERENT INCREDIBILITY OF
THE EVIDENCE FOR THE PROSECUTION AND THE MATERIAL CONTRADICTIONS IN THE
TESTIMONY OF THE TWO ARRESTING OFFICERS;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"5.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>THE TRIAL COURT
FAILED TO APPLY BOTH THE LAW AND APPLICABLE JURISPRUDENCE AND THEREBY CONVICTED
THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT NOTWITHSTANDING INDUBITABLE EVIDENCE THAT THE LATTER DID
NOT KNOW THAT THE PLASTIC BAG, TOPPED BY 'PECHAY' CONTAINED MARIJUANA FLOWERING
TOPS AT THE BOTTOM." (p. 102, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The information filed against the accused alleged:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">about </span>the
7th day of November, 1983, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">this </span>Honorable Court, the above-named accused, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully, and feloniously attempt to sell, deliver, give away to
another and distribute three (3) kilos of marijuana flowering tops, a
prohibited drug, well-knowing that the sale, delivery and distribution to
another of such drug is prohibited without authority of law to do so, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">in </span>violation of the aforesaid law.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"CONTRARY TO LAW."</span> (p. 4, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">That guilt was established beyond reasonable doubt was justified
by the trial court in its now assailed decision in this wise -</p>

<blockquote>"The prosecution has established an overwhelmingly convincing
case against <span class="SpellE">Libag</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, he could do nothing but admit having delivered the plastic bag
containing the marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His pretension
that he did not know the contraband contents of the bag as he was merely sent
on an errand to deliver <span class="GramE">it,</span> is incredulous, if not
preposterous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">simply </span>unbelievable that three complete
strangers would pick on him to do the errand considering its highly dangerous
nature and for him to oblige for the paltry sum of P2.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is more, it appears odd that he did not
even ask for the names of the three men who supposedly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">sent </span>him on the errand so he <span class="GramE">could give</span>
the corresponding information to the other end nor did he inquire from them to
whom in particular he was going to deliver the bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>All these would only suggest that his line of
defense is the product of desperation." (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution's evidence upon which the finding of guilt beyond
reasonable doubt was based was narrated by the trial court thus -</p>

<blockquote>"Cpl. Eduardo Garcia and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>, both of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">Vice </span>and Narcotics Division of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span>
City Police Station, testified that in the afternoon of November 7, 1983, at
about 1:00 o'clock, one of their informers reported that two male persons were
offering to sell him marijuana.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Forthwith, the late Lt. <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>,
then the Chief of the Division, prepared a buy-bust operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told the informer to contact the would-be
sellers and make an arrangement for the purchase of five kilos <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">of </span>the prohibited stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the company of Cpl. Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>, the informer proceeded to Elena's Lunch on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Abanao</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street> where the latter
made contact with the would-be sellers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After making the contact, the informer told Cpl. Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> that the deal would be carried out at the Leisure
Lodge on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street>
later in the afternoon because the would-be sellers would still fetch the stuff
from La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After preparing the entrapment or boodle money, Cpl. Garcia,
Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> and the informer proceeded to the
Leisure Lodge to wait for the would-be sellers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That was at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock</st1:time>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At about <st1:time minute="15" hour="16">4:15
 o'clock</st1:time>, two male persons arrived, one of whom was carrying a
multi-colored plastic bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The person
carrying the bag entered the Lodge while his companion stayed behind at the
driveway.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Once inside the Lodge, the person carrying the bag handed the
said bag to the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">informer </span>who was
<span class="SpellE">infront</span> of Room 104.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, the informer gave the pre-arranged signal that delivery had
been made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>,
who was at the lobby about 10 to 12 meters away, closed in and arrested the
person who turned out to be the herein accused Roberto <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Libag</span></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Libag's</span> companion was able to elude apprehension.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Still at the Lodge, the plastic bag (Exhibit 'E') delivered
by <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> to the informer was examined and was found
to contain three (3) separate bundles of suspected dried marijuana flowering
tops (Exhibit 'B', 'C' and 'D').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Together with the confiscated items, <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> was
brought to the police station where he was searched but only a lighter was
found in his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">person.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Both Cpl. Garcia and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>
did not see what the informer did with the entrapment money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to Cpl. Garcia, the informer was
about to pull out the money from his pocket when <span class="SpellE">Libag's</span>
arrest was effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The money was later
on returned to Lt. <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> as it belonged to him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The plastic bag and its contents were promptly referred to
the PC Crime Laboratory at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dangwa</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, for chemical analysis (Exhibit 'A').<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Forensic Chemist Carlos Figueroa performed
the examination and found out that the three bundles of dried flowering tops
contained in the bag were positive to the test for marijuana (Exhibit
âFâ).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The stuff had an aggregate weight
of 3.20 kilos, and Exhibit 'B' - 9.5 kilos; Exhibit âCâ - 1.10 kilos, and
Exhibit 'D' - 1.15 kilos)." (pp. 6-7, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">On </span>the other hand,
the accused narrated a different version of what transpired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also as stated by the trial court -</p>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Libag</span>, a native of <span class="SpellE">Kapangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, who was then
above 17 but below 18 years of age, having been born on December 1, 1965 (Exhibit
'1'), admitted that he delivered a plastic bag to a big house near the
Philippine Rabbit Terminal on <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Avenue, <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City, in the afternoon of November 7, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, he disclaimed ownership of the bag
and knowing its contents, except for the <span class="SpellE">pechay</span> on
top.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further asserted that he handed
the bag to a woman in the big house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Narrating how he came upon the bag, <span class="SpellE">Libag</span>
declared that he was then on <span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Avenue waiting
for a ride to La Trinidad when three (3) men, one of whom was holding a bag,
approached him and requested him to deliver the bag to a big house nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, he refused but upon being offered
P2.00 for the errand, he finally agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He took the bag to the big house and on seeing a woman <span class="GramE">there,</span> he told her that he was leaving the bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the woman asked him to bring the bag
to a room inside the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The woman
opened the door to the room and once <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> was
inside, she followed him and then locked the door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The woman threw a stone at another door and
two policemen appeared.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They inspected
the bag and found marijuana inside.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Despite his protestations that the bag did not belong to him, <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> was taken by the policemen to the police station
where he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">was </span>frisked but only a
lighter was found in his person.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Libag</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
3.0pt">also </span>tried to show that he was then in <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Baguio</span></st1:place></st1:city> only to buy bean seedlings
and that he had never been to Elena's Lunch.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span class="SpellE">Libag</span> was corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Alsado</span> A-at, a <span class="SpellE">townmate</span> in <span class="SpellE">Kapangan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>, who was then
allegedly also on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span>
  Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> at the time, waiting for a ride for La
Trinidad, and he thus over-heard the conversation between <span class="SpellE">Libag</span>
and the three men who requested <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> to deliver the
bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But A-at went <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">on </span>further to say that the bag <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt">is </span>prosecution's evidence marked
Exhibit âEâ with its <span class="SpellE">pechay</span> content visible at the
top." (pp. 7-8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court found that the evidence of the prosecution did
not sufficiently prove a case of illegal <u>sale</u> of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless it found that there was
consummated <u>delivery</u> of marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus,</p>

<blockquote>"Coming now to <span class="SpellE">Libag's</span> degree of
culpability, the prosecution evidence does not sufficiently show a case of
illegal sale of the prohibited stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is for the reason that the police informer who arranged the deal
was not presented as a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
testimonies of Cpl. Garcia and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> that a
sale was intended are hearsay and bereft of probative value since they have no
first-hand knowledge of the real transaction between the informer and <span class="SpellE">Libag</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Nonetheless, consummation of the delivery of the marijuana by
<span class="SpellE">Libag</span> to the informer has been proven within the
context of the term 'deliver' under the law which is defined as a âperson's act
of knowingly passing a dangerous drug to another personally or otherwise; and
by any means, with or without considerationâ (Article I, Section 2(f), R.A. No.
6425).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Although the indictment charges merely an attempt, while the
proof has established a consummated offense, the variance is of no moment for
under Article IV, Section 21(b) of the law violated, an attempted delivery of
dangerous drugs is punished by the same penalty as that prescribed for
consummated delivery.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>"The imposable penalty
is life imprisonment to death and a fine of P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>
to P30,000.00 (Article II, Section 4).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering that <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> was, at the
time of the commission of the offense, a minor above 17 but below 18 years of
age, the Court shall impose on him the minimum penalty although strictly
speaking his minority is not a mitigating circumstance since the violation is
against a special law and not against the Revised Penal Code." (pp. 8-9, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">once </span>said
in People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 50, 58 -</p>

<blockquote>"Judges trying narcotics cases are often placed in a
non-enviable predicament.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The threat
posed by drugs against human dignity and the integrity of society is malevolent
and incessant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Courts should not hamper,
in any way, the dedicated although sometimes puny efforts to stem the giant
menace.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Courts should not unwittingly
tie down the hands of narcotic agents whose work is already difficult and dangerous
enough without legal and procedural obstacles to successful prosecuÂ­tions.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At the same time, we cannot close our eyes to the many
reports of evidence being planted on unwary persons either for extorting money
or exacting personal vengeance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>By the
very nature of anti-narcotics operations, the need for entrapment procedures,
the use of shady characters as informants, the case with which sticks of
marijuana or grains of heroin can be planted in pockets or hands of
unsuspecting provincial licks, and the secrecy that inevitably shrouds all drug
deals, the possibility of abuse is great.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Courts must also be extra-vigilant in trying drug charges lest an
innocent person is made to suffer the unusually severe penalties for drug
offenses."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, <span class="GramE">We</span> find that the
evidence for the prosecution, upon which the trial court based its finding of
guilt beyond reasonable doubt, is not strong enough to convince a reasonable
mind to conclude that the herein accused-appellant <u>had knowledge</u> that
the bag he delivered contained marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Trial Court, in its decision, said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Cpl. Eduardo Garcia and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>, both of the
Vice and Narcotic Division of the <span class="SpellE">Baguio</span> City Police
Station, testified that in the afternoon of November 7, 1983, at about 1:00
o'clock, one of their informers reported that two male persons were offering to
sell him marijuana." (p. 1, Decision)</p>

<p class="BODY">"Forthwith, the late Lt. <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span>,
then the Chief of the Division, prepared a buy-bust operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told the informÂ­er to contact the would-be
sellers and make an arrangement for the purchase of five kilos of the
prohibited stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the company of Cpl.
Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>, the informer proceeded to
Elena's Lunch on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Banao</span> St.</st1:address></st1:street>
where the latter made contact with the would-be sellers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After making the contact, the informer told
Cpl. Garcia and <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> that the deal would be
carried out at the Leisure Lodge on <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Magsaysay</span> Avenue</st1:address></st1:street> later in the
afternoon because the would-be sellers would fetch the stuff from La Trinidad, <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>." (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>)</p>

<p class="BODY">It must be noted that the testimony of the police officers
summarized by the Trial Court, as quoted above, was based not on their personal
knowledge of what transpired between the informer and the "two male
persons" but on what their alleged would-be buyer narrated, and it is the <u>alleged
agreement to sell</u> forged between the "buyer" and the "two
male persons" that the Trial Court relied upon to conclude that the
accused-appellant <u>knew</u> he was carrying marijuana flowering tops in the
plastic bag, and that he carried them and <u>knowingly</u> delivered them to
the "buyer" pursuant to the alleged agreement to sell.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is for that reason that it becomes
necessary to present the alleged poseur-buyer as witness to testify on the said
agreement to sell.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the trial, Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>, one of
the arresting officers was asked on cross-examination this question:</p>

<blockquote>"Can you tell us the name of that informer
("buyer")?"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The fiscal promptly objected to the
question and the Trial Court sustained the objection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="2">February 1, 1984</st1:date>, p. 13)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, when the second arresting officer,
Cpl. Eduardo Garcia was being cross-examined, he was asked the question:</p>

<blockquote>"Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Are
you at liberty to inform us who your informer was?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'm
<span class="GramE">sorry,</span> we could not give you or tell you the identity
of my informer."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Before the prosecution concluded the presentation of testiÂ­monial
evidence, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> manifested in open court:</p>

<blockquote>"I was trying to convince my witnesses, the arresting
officers, to reveal the identity of their informer but they seem to be
reluctant, Your Honor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, may we
be given time to convince them, to convince these police officers?" <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., </span><st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 6, 1984</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, p. 9).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the next hearing, however, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span>
informed the Trial Court that "We are ready to close the evidence for the
Government Prosecution, Your Honor." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., </span><st1:date year="1984" day="26" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 26, 1984</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It may not be amiss to say that the prosecution willfully
suppressed evidence vital in the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Apparently, Fiscal <span class="SpellE">Carbonell</span> was aware of the
consequence of such action when he informed the Trial Court that he will try to
convince his witnesses to reveal the identity of the alleged
would-be-buyer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently too, the
police officers were unmoved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, not
only had the prosecution failed to present a material witness, but by refusing
to disclose the identity of their poseur-buyer, the accused-appellant was
deprived of the opportunity to require production of the said witness by
compulsory process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While it is true
that the non-revelation of the identity of an informer is a standard practice
in drug cases, such is inapplicable in the case at bar as the circumstances are
different.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The would-be buyer's
testimony was absolutely necessary because it could have helped the Trial Court
in determining whether or not the accused-appellant had <u>knowledge</u> that
the bag contained marijuana, such knowledge being an essential ingredient of
the offense for which he was convicted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the
poseur-buyer (not as an informer but as a "buyer") as to the alleged
agreement to sell therefore became indispensable to arrive at a just and proper
disposition of this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The presumption that the accused-appellant had knowledge that he
was delivering marijuana is a <span class="SpellE">rebuttable</span>
presumption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Against this presumption,
the accused has consistently denied such knowledge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The testimony of the would-be-buyer could
have confirmed the claim of the accused that he did not know that the bag he
delivered contained marijuana and thus should have resulted in his acquittal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent such evidence, <span class="GramE">We</span>
are constrained to reverse the Trial Court's <span style="color:windowtext">judgment</span>
of conviction for failure of the prosecution to sufficiently prove an essential
element of the offense charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">only </span><span class="GramE">basis
for the judgment of conviction were</span> the testimonies of the two police
officers, uncorroborated by any other evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Fundamental is the rule that the prosecution has the burden of proving
the guilt of the accused beyond reasonÂ­able doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not incumbent upon the accused to
disprove his guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Stated otherwise,
the prosecution must rely on the strength of its own evidence and not on the
weakness of the evidence for the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">(a) Cpl. Eduardo Garcia testified in a manner that conveyed the
idea that the "buyer" was a male.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, when asked the distance of the "buyer" from the accused
at the time of arrest, the witness replied:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"He is only facing the accused in front of the door of Room
104" (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., <st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="3">March 1, 1984</st1:date>, p. 8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>When asked whether the "buyer" was able to deliver the money
to the accused, the witness said that "he was not able to do so" (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When asked what the "buyer" was

from his pocket."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the Joint Affidavit of witnesses <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>
and Garcia, they declared that "they received reliable information from
one of our "buyers" that he was able to contact two (2) susÂ­pected
male pushers ... they advised him to order five kilos of marijuana leaves
â¦" (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 'G').</p>

<p class="BODY">These declarations leave no doubt that the unidentified
"buyer" referred to by the two police officers was a <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">male</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span>person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, the accused
in his <span class="SpellE">uncontradicted</span> testimony was that he left a

something like P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> of which P2,000.00 was in

<p class="BODY">In the course of his testimony, Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span>
declared that the "buyer" had P5,000.00 of which P2,000.00 was in
cash and the rest consisted of what he described was "boodle" money <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or </span>bond paper presumably cut to the

<p class="BODY">Cpl. Garcia, however declared that at the time Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> and he proceeded to Leisure Lodge, the
"buyer" received P3<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> of which
P1,000.00 was in cash and the rest <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>'model'

<st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1984</st1:date>, p. 6).</p>

<p class="BODY">(c) The trial court in its decisions said:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"Both Cpl. Garcia and Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> did not see what the "buyer" did with
the entrapment money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to Cpl.
Garcia, the "buyer" was about to pull out the money from his pocket
when <span class="SpellE">Libag's</span> arrest was effected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The money was later on returned to Lt. <span class="SpellE">Manansala</span> as it belonged to him." (p. 2, Decision)</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no doubt that upon his arrest, the accused was frisked
and the only object found on his body was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">a
</span>lighter - no money was found with him (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
<st1:date year="1984" day="6" month="3">March 6, 1984</st1:date>, p. 7).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The "buyer" was not able to deliver
the money to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Id.,
p. 8).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">No mention was made of any money which the "buyer" had
which the latter pulled out of his/her pocket to be handed over to the
accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most that Pfc. <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> was able to say was "I presume it was handed
to the pusher, sir." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>., </span><st1:date year="1984" day="1" month="2"><span class="GramE">Feb. 1, 1984</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, p. 12).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was only
10 to 20 meters away from the "buyer" and the accused (Id., p.
15).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the short distance,
he did not see the "buyer" hand the money to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state>).</p>

<p class="BODY">(d) During the trial, the police officers testified and confirmed
the presence of two suspects.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But the
accused was not investigated about his possible associated activiÂ­ties, the
source or sources of marijuana, the persons who sell them, where they are sold,
to whom they are sold and whether or not they belong to a criminal
syndicate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>conduct this investigation is most
unusual unless the policemen and later the investigating fiscal knew that the
accused was what he represented to be - an innocent by-stander - a person who
unknowingly participated in an unlawful act.</p>

<p class="BODY">Due to the above-stated contradictions and inaccuracies of the
evidence for the prosecution, the evidence for the defense merits careful
evaluation.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to appellant he was waiting for a ride at the
Philippine Rabbit Station when three (3) men one of whom was holding a bag,
approached him and requested him to deliver the bag to a big house nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, he refused but upon being offered
P2.00 for the errand, he finally agreed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He took the bag to the big house and on seeing a woman <span class="GramE">there,</span> he told her that he was leaving the bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the woman asked him to bring the bag
to a room inside the house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The woman
opened the door to the room and once <span class="SpellE">Libag</span> was
inside, she followed him and then locked the door.</p>

<p class="BODY">This testimony was not contradicted by the prosecution.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, the trial court found the evidence of guilt against
the accused "overwhelming".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>"His pretension that he did not know the contraband content of the
bag or he was merely sent on an errand to deliver <span class="GramE">it,</span>
is incredulous, if not preposterous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is simply unbelievable that three comÂ­plete strangers would pick on him to do
the errand considering its highly dangerous nature, and for him to oblige for
the paltry sum of P2.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is more,
it appears odd that he did not even ask for the names of the three men who
supposedly sent him on the errand so he <span class="GramE">could give</span> the
corresponding information to the others nor did he inquire from them to whom in
particular he was going to deliver the bag.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>All of these would only suggest that this line of defense is a product
of desperation." (p. 8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot in conscience agree with the opinion of the Trial
Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused-appellant was a
penniless youth who was offered the opportunity to earn P2.00 by carrying a
plastic bag believed by him to contain "<span class="SpellE">pechay</span>"
to a woman at a nearby building.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Leisure Lodge happened to be a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">motel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The accused apparently did not know
what sort of establishment it was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
him it was a "big house".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
door was opened to him by a woman.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
did not expect to be paid by the person who will receive the bag, hence, after
making the delivery he made a move to leave at once.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this was not proceeding according to the
plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The male "buyer" who was
not too far away neither had the opportunity to receive the plastic bag nor to
pull out his money, much less <span class="GramE">pretend</span> to comb his
hair.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The police had to move in to <span class="GramE">effect</span> the arrest.</p>

<p class="BODY">This could account for the inexplicable failure to present the
poseur buyer as a witness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His testimony
would confirm the statement of the accused that he had no knowledge that the
plastic bag contained marijuana flowering tops.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also, this could explain why the poseur buyer was not able to deliver
the marked money to the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bag
was delivered to the wrong person.</p>

<p class="BODY">The police officers talked of a "second-man" who was
allegedly the companion of the accused at the time the plastic bag was
delivered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But this
"second-man" was not arrested nor charged even as a John <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Doe </span>defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused was not even investigated about
the identity of this "second-man".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Could it be that there was no "second-man"?</p>

<p class="BODY">If the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts and
circumstances are capable of two or more explanations, one of which is
consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his
guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is
not sufficient to support a conviction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(People v. <span class="SpellE">Parayno</span>, 24 SCRA 3, People v.
Ale, supra).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">As stated in the case <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of
</span>People v. <span class="SpellE">Alcaraz</span>, (G.R. No. 66509, April 25,
1985):</p>

jurisprudence is built upon the concept that it is preferable for the guilty to
remain unpunished than for an innocent person to suffer a long prison term
unjustly."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the information accused Roberto <span class="SpellE">Libag</span>
of the "attempt to sell, deliver, give away to another and distribute
three (3) kilos of marijuana flowering tops, a prohibited drug <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">well-knowing that the sale, delivery and

<p class="BODY">It is basic that in a criminal case, the prosecution avers the
guilt of the accused <span class="GramE">who</span> is presumed to be innocent
until the contrary is proved.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
the prosecution must prove such guilt by establishing the existence of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">all </span>the elements of the crime
charged.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In so doing, the prosecution
must rely on the strength of its own evidence, not on the weakness of the
defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, one of the elements of
the offense is that the accused <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">knowingly</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>delivered a dangerous drug to
another.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution must prove knowÂ­ledge
