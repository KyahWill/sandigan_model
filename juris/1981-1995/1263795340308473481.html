plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span> vs. Southern Industrial Projects
Inc., <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> Shipping Company, S.A., <span class="SpellE">Gacet</span> Inc., <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping

affirming the decision of the trial court, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Wherefore, the appealed decision being in accordance with the
law and the evidence, the same is hereby affirmed, with proportionate cost
against appellant."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The facts of this case as found by the Court of Appeals are as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Southern Industrial Project, Inc. (SIP for short) is a
corporation the majority stockholder of which is the <span class="SpellE">Concon</span>
Family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bacong</span>
Shipping Company, S. A. (<span class="SpellE">Bacong</span>, for short) is a
Panamanian corporation organized to operate vessels purchased by SIP under
Panamanian Flag and its president is Gregorio A. <span class="SpellE">Concon</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SIP and/or <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> purchased the vessels
SS "Southern Comet," SS "Southern Express" and SS
"Southern Hope," thru financing furnished by defendant Peoples Bank
and Trust Company, now the Bank of the Philippine Islands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To secure the payment of whatever amounts
maybe disbursed for the aforesaid purpose, the said vessels were mortgaged to
Peoples Bank and Trust Company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the
operation of the said vessels, these were placed under the booking agency of <st1:place><st1:placename>defendant</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype><span class="SpellE">Interocean</span></st1:placetype></st1:place>
Shipping Corporation, with the undertaking that the freight revenues from their
charter and operation shall be deposited with the Trust Department of Peoples
Bank and Trust Company and that disbursements made <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
shall be covered by vouchers bearing the approval of SIP.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As Peoples Bank and Trust Company and SIP were not satisfied with
the amount of revenues being deposited with the said Bank, it being suggested
that diversions thereof were being made, Gregorio A. <span class="SpellE">Concon</span>
of SIP and/or <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> and Roman <span class="SpellE">Azanza</span>
of Peoples Bank and Trust Company, organized S. A. <span class="SpellE">Gacet</span>,
Inc. to manage and supervise the operation of the vessels with Ezekiel P. <span class="SpellE">Toeg</span> as the manager thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, on <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="8">August 15, 1966</st1:date>, a Management Contract (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A, <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 1-SIP and <span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 3-Peoples Bank) was entered into between SIP and GACET,
INC., placing the supervision and management of the aforementioned vessels in
the hands of GACET, Inc., which was to run for a period of six (6) months,
renewable at the will of the parties, without however, terminating the booking
agency of <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping Corporation.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The said Management Contract stipulates, among others, that -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">"The agent (GACET) may not borrow money for the husbanding of
vessels "without special authority" from the appellant bank (5 [f]);<b><o:p></o:p></b></p>

<p class="2Q">"All office records required as well as books of
accounts" shall "be available for inspection" by the appellant
bank and "may at any time temporarily take possession of such records and
books to make a complete audit" (5 [h]);</p>

<p class="2Q">"The appellant bank may - "obtain copies of documents
from any or all of <span class="SpellE">GACET's</span> booking agents pertaining
to transactions entered into by said booking agents" (5 h [l]);</p>

<p class="2Q">"The appellant bank has the right "(t)o inquire and
obtain information, by telephone, or otherwise such data as the name of the
shippers, nature of cargo, destination of cargo, freight rates, etc. " (5
h [2]); and,</p>

<p class="2Q">"The appellant bank has the right "(t)o check on
remittances made by shipper to the booking agent" etc. (5) [3]).'</p>

<blockquote>"Likewise, under the terms of said Management Contract, the
Peoples Bank and Trust Company was designated as depository of all revenues
coming from the operation of the subject vessels thereby enabling it to control
all expenses of GACET, Inc., since they will all be drawn against said deposit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"During the period comprising March 16, 1967 and August 25,
1967, GACET and <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> - in performing their
obligations under said Management Contract, contracted the services of herein
plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, Benjamin Pineda doing business
under the name and style 'Pioneer Iron Works,' to carry out repairs,
fabrication and installation of necessary parts in said vessels in order to
make them seaworthy and in good working operation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, repairs on the vessels were
made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Labor and materials supplied in
connection therewith, amounted to P84,522.70, P18,141.75 of which was advanced
by <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>, thereby leaving a balance of
P62,095.95.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For this balance, <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> issued three checks (Exhibit I); and the third
one for P17,377.57 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. J).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When these checks were however presented to
the <span class="SpellE">drawee</span>, Peoples Bank and Trust Company, they were
dishonored as defendant <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> stopped payment
thereon (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>. H-2, I-2 &amp; J-2).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Meanwhile and by reason of the inability of SIP and/or <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> to pay their mortgage indebtedness which was past
due since 1964, the mortgagee Peoples Bank and Trust Company threatened to
foreclose the mortgage on said vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In order to avoid the inconvenience and expense of imminent foreclosure
proceedings, SIP and/or <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> sold said vessels to
Peoples Bank by way of <span class="SpellE"><u>dacion</u></span> <u>en</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pago</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
sale is evidenced by three (3) deeds of sale all dated <st1:date year="1968" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1968</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.
C, D, &amp; E).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Immediately preceding
the execution of said deeds of sale, SIP, <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> and
Peoples Bank executed a 'Confirmation of Obligation' (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"B") whereby SIP and <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> (1)
acknowledged being indebted to defendant bank, the payment of which
indebtedness was secured by chattel mortgages on said vessels, (2) agreed to
sell and convey to defendant bank the aforementioned vessels by separate deed
of sale for the total purchase price of P3,038,000.00 to be applied as partial
payment on account of their mortgage indebtedness; and (3) expressly recognized
that after such application, a substantial balance will still remain unpaid and
owing by SIP and <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> which remaining balance they
have agreed to confirm and pay to the bank on demand with 12% interest per
annum.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, listed in the
'Confirmation of Obligation' were some of the accounts acknowledged and
confirmed by the parties to be outstanding at the time, in connection with the
subject vessels as follows -</blockquote>

the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> Shipping Corporation and

exceeded their authority.</p>

People's Bank, now Bank of P.I. being the purchaser of said vessels, is jointly
and severally liable for the outstanding balance of said repairs, admittedly a
lien on the properties in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Bank of P.I. seeks shelter in a deed of
"Confirmation of Obligation" entered into between buyer and seller
before the execution of a deed of sale between them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Buyer, Bank of P.I., maintains that it has
the option of whether or not to pay the obligations listed <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>,
one of which is the repairs undertaken by private respondent, as inferred from
the phrase that the owner of the vessels merely authorized petitioner bank to
pay certain expenses and charges in connection with said vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter stressed the fact that nowhere in
said deed was the bank placed under obligation to pay any of the listed
indebtedness of the owner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The cardinal rule in the interpretation of contracts is to the
effect that the intention of the contracting parties should always prevail
because their will has the force of law between them (<span class="SpellE">Kasilag</span>
vs. Rodriguez, et al., 69 Phil. 217 [1939]; Sec. 10, Rule 130 of the New Rules
of Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in order to judge the
intention of the contracting parties, regard must be had principally to their
acts both contemporaneous and subsequent to the contract (Atlantic Gulf Co. vs.
Insular Government, 10 Phil. 166 [1908]), "the circumstances under which
it was made, including the situation of the subject thereof and of the parties
to it, may be shown, so that the judge may be placed in the position of those
whose language he is to interpret." (Sec. 11, Rule 130 of the New Rules of
Court).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that once this
intention of the parties has been ascertained, it becomes an integral part of
the contract as though it has been originally expressed therein in unequivocal
terms (Nielson &amp; Co., Inc. vs. <span class="SpellE">Lepanto</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consolidated Mining Co., 18 SCRA 1040
[1966]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, well settled is the
fact that in construing a writing particularly a written agreement, the reason
behind the circumstances surrounding its execution are of paramount importance
to place the interpreter in the situation of the parties concerned at the time
the writing was executed (Vicente <span class="SpellE">Gotamco</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hermanos</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Shotwell</span>, 38 SCRA 107 [1971]).</p>

<p class="BODY">It is undisputed that S. A. <span class="SpellE">Gacet</span>,
Inc., the managing corporation, is only a creation of Gregorio A. <span class="SpellE">Concon</span> of Southern Industrial Projects, Inc. and of Roman <span class="SpellE">Azanza</span> of People's Bank and Trust Company obviously for the
protection of their respective interests on the properties in question, after
both expressed dissatisfaction with the amount of revenue being deposited with
the said bank which suggests that diversions thereof were being made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, although it was SIP and GACET which
entered into the Management Contract, it was expressly stipulated <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>, among others, that GACET may not borrow money
for the husbanding of vessels without special authority from the petitioner
bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition, all office records
were required to be subject to inspection and complete audit by the latter,
including all remittances made by the Shipper to the booking agent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, petitioner was already in
control of the vessels as early as <st1:date year="1966" day="15" month="8">August
 15, 1966</st1:date>, the date the Management Contract was signed (Decision,
CA-G.R. No. 66365-R); (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 28).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the contract itself for the repairs
of the vessels which is now the bone of contention, was entered into by GACET
and INTEROCEAN with private respondent Benjamin Pineda with the approval of
petitioner Bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This lends credence to
the claim of Pineda that he was led to believe that he will be paid the
corresponding amount for the repairs, as in fact he was paid with checks which
were later dishonored.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that SIP incurred debts by reason of these
vessels not only here in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
but also in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
notably ESSO Standard Eastern which attached said vessels in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As admitted by Gregorio A. <span class="SpellE">Concon</span>, fourteen banks were after the assets of the
corporation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under this distressed
financial condition and with People's Bank also threatening to foreclose the
mortgages on these vessels, SIP decided to sell the vessels to People's Bank
(Record on Appeal, pp. 55-56).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But a
deed of "Confirmation of Obligation" was first entered into between
SIP and/or <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span> Shipping and People's Bank,
confirming and acknowledging the obligations <span class="SpellE">oustanding</span>
at the time, among which is the obligation to private respondent in the amount
corresponding to the repairs in question.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner however insists on its theory based on a separate
interpretation of the deed of "Confirmation of Obligation" that on
the authority granted <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> by the seller (the
previous owner), responsibility to pay the listed obligations was not
compulsory or mandatory (Record on Appeal, pp. 59-60).</p>

<p class="BODY">Other fundamental rules in the interpretation of contracts no
less important than those already indicated are to the effect that where the
terms are doubtful, the various stipulations of a contract shall be interpreted
together, attributing to the doubtful ones that sense which may result from all
of them taken jointly (Art. 1374, Civil Code), and if some stipulation of any
contract should admit of several meanings, it shall be understood as having
that import which is most adequate to render it effectual (Art. 1373, Civil
Code) and the words which may have different significations shall be understood
in that which is most in keeping with the nature and object of the contract
(Art. 1375, Civil Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason for
these rules is that it must be presumed that the parties had intended an
effective act and not one that is impracticable or illusory ( <span class="SpellE">Caguioa</span>, Comments and Cases on Civil Law, p. 592, 1983
Ed.).</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be observed that the deed of "Confirmation of
Obligation" is but a part or a corollary to the deeds of sale of the three
vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, specific reference
thereto was made by said deeds of sale as to the settlement of obligations,
among which are the repairs in question.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Said provision in the deeds of sale reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Any amount or amounts that the Bank has voluntarily paid
and/or has been compelled to pay, or hereafter will voluntarily and/or will be
compelled to pay for any encumbrance, claim, lien or particular average in
order to save the vessel from any legal seizure or suits by third parties, and
for any repair, supplies, provisions, accrued salaries and allotment of crew,
cost of bailing out of the vessel, and any other expenses or accounts of the
said vessel, shall be for the account of Southern and/or <span class="SpellE">Bacong</span>
in accordance with their agreement preceding this conveyance executed on
January 19, 1968 x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It will be observed that the above stipulation interpreted
together with the deed of "Confirmation of Obligation" leaves no room
for doubt that while the bank may indeed pay certain obligations voluntarily or
by choice, there are those that the Bank will be compelled to pay to save the
vessel from any legal seizure or suits by third parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, the primary purpose of the
contracts is the protection of the vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Among them are liens on the same under which the obligation to private
respondent properly belongs.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, petitioner contends that assuming that such obligations
are liens on said vessels, they are deemed to have been waived and discharged
when respondent released and delivered said vessels to GACET and/or <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span> which ordered said repairs prior to their sale
and conveyance to petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 117).</p>

<p class="BODY">Such contention is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">It will be recalled that private respondent was paid the sum of
P18,141.75 and for the balance of P62,095.95 <span class="SpellE">Interocean</span>
issued three checks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the
circumstances, private respondent has no basis or necessity at that time to
exercise his right of retention under Art. 1731 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that later said checks were
dishonored, as correctly argued by private respondent, cannot give validity to
petitioner's argument that the former has waived or abandoned his liens on the
vessels.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To pursue such view would put a
premium on an act of deception which led private respondent to believe that he
will be fully paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, when
the checks were dishonored, it was impossible for private respondent to enforce
his lien because the vessels were already in <st1:country-region><st1:place>Japan</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Philippine courts (Brief for
Plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">Appellee</span>, p. 19; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 128).</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing facts, it was aptly stated by the trial
court and affirmed by the Court of Appeals that when the parties executed the
deed of "Confirmation of Obligation" they really intended to confirm
and acknowledge the existing obligations for the purpose of the buyer assuming
liability <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> and charging them to the seller
after proper accounting, verification and set offs have been made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, there is merit in the trial court's
view that if there was no intention on the part of People's Bank (now Bank of
P.I.) to assume responsibility for these obligations at the time of the sale of
the vessels, there is no sense in executing said Deed of Confirmation together
with the deeds of sale and the stipulations <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span>
would be pointless (Record on Appeal, pp. 61-62, Annex "C", <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 33).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it is indisputable that the repairs made on the vessels
ultimately redounded to the benefit of the new owner for without said repairs,
those vessels would not be seaworthy.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Under Art. 2142 of the Civil Code, such acts "give rise to the
juridical relation of quasi-contract to the end that no one shall be unjustly
enriched or benefited at the expense of another."</p>
