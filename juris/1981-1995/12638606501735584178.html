				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GUTIERREZ, JR., J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The petitioner, with himself as his own counsel, filed this
petition for review of the decision of the National Labor Relations Commission
(NLRC) which denied his claim for damages arising from an alleged illegal
dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In addition to the separation
pay already awarded to him, the petitioner asks for P9<span class="GramE">,995.00</span>
actual damages, P300,000.00 moral damages, P200,000.00 exemplary damages, and
attorney's fees to be determined by the Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 4, 1977, petitioner Leonardo D. <span class="SpellE">Suario</span>
filed a complaint for separation pay, damages and attorney's fees against the
Bank of the Philippine Islands, <span class="SpellE">Davao</span> Branch/ or the
Manager and Assistant Manager/Cashier alleging:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That complainant
has been a loyal employee of the respondent bank since March, 1969, first
assigned as a saving clerk, then rose to become the head of the loan section in
1976 with an official designation as Credit Investigator-Appraiser-Credit
Analyst;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That during the time of
the complainant's employment with the respondent bank, he pursued his studies
of law without criticism/or adverse comments from the respondent bank but
instead praises were showered and incentives and considerations were bestowed
in view of the complainant's determination for intellectual advancement;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That sometime in March,
1976, the complainant verbally requested the then Asst. Vice-President and
Branch Manager, Mr. Armando N. <span class="SpellE">Guilatco</span>, for a
6-month leave of absence without pay purposely to take the 1976 pre-bar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">review in Manila and that the said Mr. <span class="SpellE">Guilatco</span> informed the complainant that there would be no
problem as regards the requested leave of absence;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That sometime in May,
1976, the complainant received a verbal notice from the new Branch Manager, Mr.
Vicente Casino, that the respondent's Head Office approved only a 30-day leave
of absence without pay but that Mr. <span class="SpellE">Guilatco</span>, then
assigned in Head Office as Vice President, advised him (Casino) to inform the
complainant to just avail of the 30-day leave of absence first and then proceed
to Manila for the review since the request would be ultimately granted;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That complainant never
suspected that his application would be disapproved, much less any bad faith on
the part of the respondent bank to discriminate union member <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(sic), since it has been the policy of the
respondent bank to grant request of this nature as shown in the case of four
(4) former employees who were all granted leave of absence without pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Copies of the affidavits of Judge Juan <span class="SpellE">Montejo</span> and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Bienvenido</span> <span class="SpellE">Banez</span> and <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copies of the
payroll of Jose <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> and Antonio Tan are hereto
attached as ANNEXES ‘A’, 'B', 'C', and 'D' and made an integral part hereof;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That on May 10, 1976,
the complainant wrote a formal letter to the President of the respondent bank,
Mr. Alberto Villa <span class="SpellE">Abrille</span>, asking for a formal
reconsideration and caused the same to be received by Mr. Vicente Casino <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">but the latter advised instead the
complainant to address to him (Casino) a letter of mild tenor since any
reconsideration should be coursed through the proper channel; and that Mr.
Casino advised the complainant to just file his 30-day leave of absence without
pay as approved and then proceed to Manila since the request would ultimately
be granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A Xerox copy of the said
letter is hereto attached as ANNEX 'E' to be made an integral part hereof;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That acting on the said
advice of Vicente Casino, the complainant, with utmost good faith, wrote a
letter addressed to Mr. Casino and at the same time, filed a 30-day leave of
absence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Copies of the letter and
Application for Leave of Absence are hereto attached as ANNEXES 'F' and 'G' to
be made an integral part hereof;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That On May 17, 1976,
the complainant proceeded to Manila for the pre-bar review and even went to the
extent of going to the respondent's Head Office to seek an audience with the
Personnel Manager with an alternative <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">of
working with any of the Metro-Manila Branches of the respondent bank if and
when the request would not be granted and that the Personnel Manager promised
to take up the matter with Mr. Alberto Villa <span class="SpellE">Abrille</span>;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>10.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That during the first
week of August, 1976, the complainant received a letter from the Asst.
Manager/Cashier, Mr. Douglas E. Aurelio, ordering the complainant to report
back for work since the complainant's request was allegedly disapproved and
that failure to report back for work would be a conclusive proof that the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">complainant is no longer interested to
continue working and therefore considered resigned.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">xxxx</span></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>11.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That upon receipt of the
letter, complainant's review was unduly interrupted since sleepless nights were
spent in order to arrive at the proper decision and that the complainant has
decided not to report back because of the considerable expenses already
incurred in Manila after he has been led to believe that the request would
ultimately be granted;<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>12.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That during the last
week of August, 1976, the complainant received another letter from Douglas E.
Aurelio, attaching a <span class="SpellE">xerox</span> copy of the application
for a Clearance to terminate on the ground of resignation/ or abandonment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span>"<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>13.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the complainant
failed to file his opposition since as above averred to, he was already in
Manila taking up the review and was then very busy since the bar examination
was only two months shy;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>14.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That sometime during the
first week of December, 1976, the complainant went to the respondent bank but
was verbally informed that he was already dismissed;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>15.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That on December 13,
1976, the complainant formally wrote a letter to the respondent bank requesting
for a written and formal advise as to his real status and that on December 14,
1976, the respondent bank replied that the matter was still referred to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the Personnel Department at Head Office
leading again the complainant to believe that his case was not yet hopeless.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span>.</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>16.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That on December 21,
1976, the complainant wrote another letter pressing for a categorical answer
and on December 23, 1976, the lawyers of the respondent bank replied that as
far as the bank is concerned the services of the complainant was considered
terminated effective July 19, 1976 contrary to the respondent bank's
manifestation that his case was still pending before the Personnel
Department.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>17.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That the dismissal of
the complainant was clearly illegal and without just cause, being
discriminatory in character he being an active union member and in fact <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the Vice President of the ALU-BPI Chapter
until his dismissal in view of the uneven application of the respondent's
policy;</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The case was set for conciliation but since the parties could not
agree on any settlement, the case was certified to the Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the Executive Labor Arbiter

<p class="BODY">The main issue in this case is whether or not the NLRC committed
grave abuse of discretion in denying the petitioner's claim for actual, moral
and exemplary damages plus attorney's fees in addition to his separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of NLRC jurisdiction over claims for damages, it
clearly appears that the complaint was filed on <st1:date year="1977" day="4" month="8">August 4, 1977</st1:date> and decided by the Labor Arbiter on <st1:date year="1977" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1977</st1:date>; hence, the
applicable law is Article 217 of the Labor Code which took effect on <st1:date year="1974" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1974</st1:date>, and which provides:</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention of private respondent that the NLRC is not clothed
with authority to entertain claims for moral and other forms of damages is
based on PD 1367 which took effect on May 1, 1979 and which amended Article 217
by specifically providing that "Regional Directors shall not indorse and
Labor Arbiters shall not entertain claims for moral or other forms of
damages."</p>

<p class="BODY">This limitation on jurisdiction did not last long.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This Court in the case of <u>Ebon</u> <u>v.</u>
<u>De</u> <u>Guzman</u> (113 SCRA 52 [1982]) explained:</p>

<blockquote>"Evidently, the lawmaking authority had second thoughts about
depriving the Labor Arbiters and the NLRC of the jurisdiction to award damages
in labor cases because that set up would mean duplicity of suits, splitting the
cause of action and possible conflicting findings and conclusions by two
tribunals on one and the same claim.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"So, on May 1, 1980, Presidential Decree No. 1691 (which
substantially reenacted Article 217 in its original form) nullified Presidential
Decree No. 1367 and restored to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the
Labor Arbiters and the NLRC their jurisdiction to award all kinds of damages in
cases arising from employer-employee relations (Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of the Philippines v. Martinez, G.R.

<p class="BODY">It is now well settled that money claims of workers provided by
law over which the labor arbiter has original and exclusive jurisdiction are
comprehensive enough to include claims for moral damages of a dismissed
employee against his employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Vargas v. Akai Phil. Inc., 156 SCRA 531 [1987]).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue whether or not the petitioner is entitled to his

indeed terminate the employee's services <u>without</u> <u>just</u> <u>cause</u>

sufficient for redress under the Labor Code) that the employer fired his

<p class="BODY">The case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Primero</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>IAC</u>
states the distinction between the two seemingly disparate causes of action, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>"It is clear that the question of the legality of the act of
dismissal is intimately related to the issue of the legality of the manner by
which that act of dismissal was performed. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>But while the Labor Code treats of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">the nature of, and the remedy available as
regards the first - the employee's separation from employment - it does not at
all deal with the second - the manner of that separation - which is governed
exclusively by the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
addressing the first issue, the Labor Arbiter applies the Labor Code; in
addressing the second, the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And this appears to be the plain and patent intendment of the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For apart from the <span class="SpellE">reliefs</span>
expressly set out in the Labor Code flowing from illegal dismissal from
employment, no other damages may be awarded to an illegally dismissed employee

injuries such as mental anguish, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings and
social humiliation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is however not
enough that such injuries have arisen; it is essential that they have sprung
from a <u>wrongful</u> act or omission of the defendant which was the proximate
cause<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> thereof.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">`Moral damages include physical suffering, mental anguish, fright,
serious anxiety, besmirched reputation, wounded feelings, moral shock, social
humiliation, and similar injury.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Though
incapable of pecuniary computation, moral damages may be recovered if they are
the proximate result of the defendant's <u>wrongful</u> act or omission.'
(Civil <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Code, Article 2217).</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'In a long line of cases, we have consistently ruled that <u>in</u>
<u>the</u> `<u>absence</u> <u>of</u> <u>a</u> <u>wrongful</u> <u>act</u> <u>or</u>
<u>omission</u> <u>or</u> <u>of</u> <u>fraud</u> <u>or</u> <u>bad</u> <u>faith</u>,<u>
moral</u><i> </i><u>damages</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>awarded.</u>..' (R
&amp; B Surety and Insurance Co., Inc. v. IAC, 129 SCRA 736, 743.)” <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(p. 580)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">We do not find any bad faith or fraud on the part of the bank
officials who denied the petitioner's request for a six months’ leave of
absence without pay.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the petitioner
was made to believe that his request would be granted, we can not fault the
branch manager or his subsequent replacement for giving their assurances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were merely personal assurances which
could be reconsidered on the basis of later developments or upon consultation
with higher authorities and which are not binding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the bank officials who gave their
verbal assurances had only the petitioner's paramount welfare in their
minds.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no evidence to show that
they meant to deceive the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They themselves thought that such a request would be granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, company policy had to be
followed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the petitioner's
request for six months’ leave of absence was denied does not <u>ipso</u> <u>facto</u>
entitle him to damages.</p>

<p class="BODY">As held in the case of <u>Rubio</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Court</u> <u>of</u>
<u>Appeals</u> (141 SCRA 488 [1986]):</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In a long line of cases, we have consistently ruled that in
the absence of a wrongful act or omission or of fraud or bad faith, moral
damages cannot be awarded and that the adverse result of an action does not per
se make the action wrongful and subject the actor to have payment of damages,
for the law could not have meant to impose a penalty on the right to
litigate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">xxx</span>."
(p. 516)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is incumbent upon the petitioner to prove that there was
malice or bad faith on the part of the private respondents in terminating
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, the records of this
petition show that the private respondent acted in accordance with law before
effecting the dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The records
also show that there was a prior application with the Ministry of Labor to
terminate the petitioner's employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A
copy of said application was furnished to the petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, however, did not oppose such
application nor did he do anything to preserve his right.</p>

<p class="BODY">More pertinent is the fact that the petitioner knew as early as <st1:date year="1976" day="6" month="5">May 6, 1976</st1:date> that he was granted only a
one month study leave (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">rollo</span></span>,
p. 98).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He may have asked for <span class="GramE">a reconsideration</span> but notwithstanding its denial, the
petitioner proceeded with his review.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Whether or not his request for six months’ leave without pay would be
granted, the petitioner was set on continuing with his review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can we consider the private respondents' response to the
petitioner's query regarding his status as having given him false hopes.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The referral to the personnel department was
merely a part of the formal procedure undertaken by the bank.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such referral does not show that the bank
acted in a wanton or <span class="SpellE">wilful</span> manner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the light of the foregoing, we sustain the Labor Arbiter's
finding that the petitioner's claim for damages must be dismissed for lack of
sufficient basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition is hereby DISMISSED for lack of
merit.</p>
