				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Pepsi Cola Bottling Company of the Philippines
(hereinafter referred to as PEPSI) seeks the reversal of the decision of the
National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) in NLRC-RAB CASE No. 0474-84
entitled "Job <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> vs. Pepsi Cola Bottling
Co. of the Philippines, Inc." promulgated on August 12, 1987, wherein the
NLRC held that <span class="GramE">private</span> respondent Job <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> was illegally dismissed by petitioner and
accordingly, ordered the payment of his <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and
separation pay.</p>

<p class="BODY">As shown in the records, the facts are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1965" day="12" month="9">September 12, 1965</st1:date>
petitioner PEPSI hired private respondent Job <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
as a "route salesman".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sometime in June 1979 he was "grounded" or suspended for his
alleged violation of company rules and regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>During an administrative investigation
conducted by PEPSI, <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> was found guilty of
misappropriating money collected from customers and of falsifying invoices and
reports [Decision of Labor Arbiter, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
30.]<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1979" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1979</st1:date> private respondent was served by petitioner
with a letter informing him of the termination of his employment effective <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1979</st1:date> ["Annex A" to
the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 17.]</p>

<p class="BODY">A criminal complaint for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span> <span class="GramE">Through</span> Falsification of Commercial Documents was also filed
by PEPSI against <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> with the Office of the City
Fiscal of <span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, the case was dismissed on <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1984</st1:date> based on the finding
that a charge invoice is not a commercial document.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The investigating fiscal also found that the
financial liability of <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to </span>PEPSI was already paid by him
[Decision of Labor Arbiter, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">6; </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 31.]</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="11">November 14, 1984</st1:date>
private respondent filed with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the
office </span>of the Labor Arbiter in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Bacolod</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
a complaint for reinstatement and payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his complaint, private
respondent claimed that he was grounded <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as a </span>route salesman due to "fabricated
and malicious dishonesty charge by the local agents of petitioner"
[Paragraph 3, Complaint, p. 1; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 18.]</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter dismissed the complaint on the ground that the
claims of private respondent had prescribed pursuant to Article 292 (now
Article 291) of the Labor Code which provides for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>three-year prescriptive period for
all money claims arising from<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an
employer-employee relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision reads:</p>

<blockquote>WHEREFORE, premises considered, judgment is hereby rendered
DISMISSING all the claims of the complainant against respondent company <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">for </span>having been barred <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by </span>prescription.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>[NLRC Decision, p. 9; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 34.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, respondent NLRC reversed the decision of the Labor
Arbiter and held that Article 292 of the Labor Code is not applicable since <span class="SpellE">Guanzon's</span> complaint is not strictly one for recovery of
money claims but is principally an action for illegal dismissal and
reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The applicable law,
according to the NLRC, is Article 1146 of the Civil Code which provides for <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>four-year prescriptive period in
cases of violation of or injury to the rights of the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The NLRC considered May 25, 1984, the date of
the dismissal of the criminal case against private respondent, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the reckoning date for computing
the prescriptive period, and accordingly held that when <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>
filed the complaint for illegal dismissal on November 14, 1984 the four-year
prescriptive period has not lapsed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
NLRC also found that the dismissal of <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> was
without just cause and that the investigation <span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">conducted by PEPSI suffered from "patent
procedural infirmities," and therefore, <span class="SpellE">violative</span>
of the requirements of due process [Decision of NLRC, pp. 4-5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 39-40.] Considering that reinstatement was no
longer feasible or practical in view of the length of time that had elapsed
since private respondent's dismissal, the NLRC ordered petitioner to pay
private respondent three (3) years <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and
separation pay,<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>in lieu of </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reinstatement [Decision of NLRC, p. 6; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 41.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">Hence, the instant petition.</span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">The
main issue to be resolved in this petition is whether or not private
respondent's action for illegal dismissal with claims for reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> had prescribed.<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">The
Court sustains the petitioner's contention that private respondent's action for
illegal dismissal is </span></span>already barred by prescription.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">It
is undisputed in the instant case that private respondent's complaint for
illegal dismissal was filed only on November 14, 1984 or <u>more</u> <u>than</u>

date of the termination of his employment with petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The complaint was, therefore, filed beyond

the Civil Code </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">(Cf. </span></span><span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">Articles 290-</span></span>291,

<p class="BODY">In maintaining that private respondent's cause of action against
petitioner had not yet prescribed, respondent NLRC claims that private
respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was
</span>never terminated by petitioner but was only "grounded" or
preventively suspended until the final resolution of the criminal case against
him [Comment of NLRC, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 84.]</p>

<p class="BODY">This is untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>nothing in the termination letter which
implies that petitioner PEPSI was merely suspending respondent <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The intent
to terminate private respondent is evident in the tenor of the letter which
states that:</p>

<blockquote>In view of these series of flagrant violations of company rules and
regulations, we are, therefore, constrained <u>to</u> <u>terminate</u> <u>you</u>
<u>effective</u> <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="7"><u>July</u> <u>17</u>,
 <u>1979</u></st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Annex
"A" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 17.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, private respondent himself claimed that he was
"unlawfully dismissed" by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paragraph 6 of private respondent's complaint reads:</p>

<blockquote>*<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*<span style="mso-tab-count:
1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>*</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That from June 20,
1979 up to the present, he [respondent <span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span>] has
been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">grounded and <u>this</u> <u>fact</u>
<u>amounts</u> <u>to</u> <u>unlawful</u> <u>dismissal</u> because he has been
denied any </span>salary, allowances, 15 days sick leave with pay, 15 days
vacation leave with pay, Christmas bonus and his route allowances per month.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>[Complaint, p. 2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
p. 19; Underscoring supplied.]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Equally untenable is private respondent's claim that he never received
a notice of termination [Memorandum of Respondent p. 1<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">; </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 117.] The records clearly
show that private respondent received the termination letter on July 6, 1979 as
shown by his signature at the lower right hand portion thereof [Annex
"A" to the Petition; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 17.] Private
respondent never claimed that his signature was forged or made without his
authority.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He merely insists that he
never received a notice of termination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was error on the part of the NLRC to give weight to the unsupported
denial of private respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">in </span>the
light of the clear documentary evidence to the contrary.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of when private respondent's cause <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>action accrued, the Court does not
agree with the <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> position that "the date of
dismissal of the criminal case against private respondent on May 25, 1984 is
the reckoning date when the prescriptive period of the action for illegal
dismissal should commence."</p>

<p class="BODY">In an illegal dismissal case, the cause of action accrues from
the time the employee was unjustly terminated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">[See </span>Ramos v. Our Lady of <st1:place><st1:placename>Peace</st1:placename>

741.]<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In this case private respondent's
cause of action arising from his alleged <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">illegal
dismissal accrued on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="7"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">July 17, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, the effective date of the termination of
his employment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court cannot sustain <span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span>
argument that it was only when PEPSI refused to reinstate private respondent to
his former position, after the dismissal of the criminal case on <st1:date year="1984" day="25" month="5">May 25, 1984</st1:date>, that the latter's cause
of action <span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">accrued.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Guanzon</span> was

1979.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He could have immediately
challenged his dismissal without waiting for the outcome of the criminal
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His right to </span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">file an action for illegal dismissal is now
barred </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">prescription precisely because he chose to
wait for the dismissal of the criminal case before filing his complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Nor is there any merit to private respondent's claim that had he
"filed a [complaint for illegal dismissal] while the criminal case was
pending, it would have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">without any
basis" as it "would be premature" [Memorandum for Respondent, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">p. 3; </span><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rollo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">, p. 119.] Private respondent's right to file an action for illegal
dismissal was not dependent upon the outcome of the criminal case against
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the alleged violations
of the company rules and regulations were the same cause for the filing of <span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">the criminal case
against him is of no moment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private
respondent's guilt or innocence in the criminal case is not determinative of
the existence of a just or authorized cause for his dismissal [National
Organization of Laborers and Employees v. <span class="SpellE">Roldan</span>, 95

Distance Telephone Co. v. National Labor Relations Commission, G.R. No. 63191,
April 30, 1984, 129 SCRA 163.] The filing of the criminal case against private
respondent did not have the effect of suspending or interrupting the
prescriptive period <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">for </span>the
filing of the action for illegal dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An action for illegal dismissal is an administrative case which is
entirely separate and distinct from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>criminal
action for <span class="SpellE">estafa</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Each may proceed independently of the other [<span class="SpellE">Manikad</span>

<p class="BODY">Finally, private respondent contends that, granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that his cause of action had prescribed,
petitioner is <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from setting up the defense of
prescription since it failed to file its motion to dismiss on time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He claims that when petitioner PEPSI was
served with summons, it did not file an answer <span class="GramE">nor</span> any
pleading to challenge the complaint [Memorandum for Respondent, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 121.] It was only when the case was set for
hearing on February 27, 1985 that counsel for petitioner requested for time to
submit responsive pleading and subsequently filed the motion to dismiss
[Comment of NLRC, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">p. </span>85.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner, on the other hand, argues that there was no waiver of
the defense of prescription since it was only after February 4, 1985 that a
copy of the complaint and notice of hearing were served upon its counsel as
shown by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the postmark appearing on the
cover letter thereof [Petitioner's Reply, pp. 1-2; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">In its Comment to the instant petition, the <span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">respondent NLRC
sustains the contention of private respondent that the motion to dismiss was
filed out of time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the position of
respondent Commission that the motion to dismiss should have been filed by the
petitioner "at least ten (10) days from the time the copy of the complaint
was served upon it" [<span class="SpellE">NLRC's</span> Comment, p. 5; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 85.]<o:p></o:p></span></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, after considering the foregoing arguments <span class="CharacterStyle4"><span style="mso-ansi-font-size:12.0pt">and the

<p class="BODY">Nowhere is it provided that the motion to dismiss should be filed
with the Labor Arbiter within ten (10) days from receipt of the complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">And even if we apply the technical rules of procedure obtaining
