				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal from the decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila (now Regional Trial Court) granting the petition for
Prohibition and <i>Mandamus</i> filed by Alfredo Velasco and <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> Velasco.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This was appealed by the parties to the Court of Appeals but the latter
court issued a resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="4">April
 9, 1980</st1:date> certifying the appeal to <span class="GramE">Us</span> since
only pure questions of law are involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts of the case as stated by the Court of
Appeals in its resolution are as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> [O]n
March 28, 1973 <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> <span class="SpellE">Acebuche</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Primitiva</span> <span class="SpellE">Caranyangan</span>, Cora
Donor and Catalina <span class="SpellE">Ogaya</span> private respondents, thru
their common authorized representative Rolando <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
filed with the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) complaints against
the herein petitioners, owners and proprietors of the Belen’s Restaurant of <span class="SpellE">Intramuros</span>, Manila, for overtime pay and salary
differentials under the Minimum Wage Law, docketed therein as NLRC Cases Nos. 1953,
2290 and 2427; that after due proceedings in the NLRC, the Commission headed by
chairman <span class="SpellE">Amado</span> G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>,
rendered a decision on August 15, 1973 ordering the petitioners to pay the
claimants the total amount of P14,087.00 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. K);
that upon appeal to respondent Secretary of Labor, the latter rendered a
decision on December 5, 1973 reducing the awards due to the private respondents
due to a mistake in computation (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. L); that a
motion for reconsideration by the petitioners was denied by the respondent
Secretary of Labor in his order dated <st1:date year="1974" day="14" month="2">February
 14, 1974</st1:date> (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. M); that the petitioners
filed with the Bureau of Labor Relations on March 12, 1974 a notice of appeal
stating that they were appealing the decision and order to the Office of the
President (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. N); that on June 10, 1974, Assistant
Executive Secretary <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span> Zamora addressed a letter
to the Chief of the Constabulary to cause compliance by the petitioners of the
decision of the Secretary of Labor within five days from the receipt of said
letter, pursuant to Section 10 of P.D. No. 21 which provides for the arrest and
detention of any person failing to comply with a decision or order of the NLRC
(<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. P); that the petitioners in turn wrote
Assistant Executive Secretary Zamora for a reconsideration of the latter’s
directive of <st1:date year="1974" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1974</st1:date>
on the main ground that their appeal from the decision of the Secretary of
Labor has not yet been resolved (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. Q); that on
July 12, 1974 Assistant Executive Secretary Zamora wrote the petitioners
stating that his Office could not entertain the appeal of the petitioners ‘in
view of the President’s instructions that henceforth this Office should take
cognizance of appeals in labor cases from the Secretary of Labor only those
involving national interest and those labor cases pending appeal in this office
not involving national interest should be remanded or returned to the Secretary
of Labor for appropriate action and/or execution’ (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
R); that on July 15, 1974, the petitioners filed with the lower court the present
petition for prohibition and <i>mandamus</i> with a prayer for the issuance of
a preliminary injunction - subsequently amended on July 29, 1974, seeking to
restrain the Secretary of Labor and the Assistant Executive Secretary from
implementing the decision of the Secretary of Labor, alleging that since
petitioners’ appeal to the Office of the President has not yet been resolved,
the decision of the Secretary of Labor has not yet become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>, so that the directive of the Assistant Executive
Secretary to implement said decision is therefore null and void; that the lower
court issued an order on October 31, 1974 directing the respondent to answer
the petition and issued a writ of preliminary injunction enjoining the public
respondents from implementing the decision of the Secretary of Labor dated
December 5, 1973 and the order of February 14, 1974, as well as the directives
of the respondent Assistant Executive Secretary dated June 10, 1974 and July
12, 1974; that after the public respondents had filed their Answer to the
amended petition, the lower court, after declaring the private respondents in
default for failure to file their answer, conducted a hearing therein, after
which it rendered its decision on September 30, 1975, x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span>.” (pp. 46-47, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision
of the trial court reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>“The Court will therefore limit itself to making the preliminary
injunction issued in this case permanent and respondent public officials, their
agents, representatives and/or persons acting under them are prohibited and
enjoined from implementing the decision of the Secretary of Labor dated
December 5, 1973 and order of February 4, 1974, and the letters of respondent
Assistant Executive Secretary dated June 10, 1974 and July 12, 1974, until such
time as petitioners’ appeal has been given due course or otherwise disposed of
in accordance with any official change in the applicable law.” (p. 45, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the decision, both parties appealed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent public officials, in their appeal
assigned the following errors of the trial court:</p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">“I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN ISSUING INJUNCTION PROHIBITING IMPLEMENTATION OF THE DECISION OF THE
SECRETARY OF LABOR DATED <st1:date year="1973" day="5" month="12">DECEMBER 5,
 1973</st1:date>.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">“II<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN HOLDING THAT PETITIONERS HAVE STILL A RIGHT TO APPEAL FROM THE
DECISION OF THE SECRETARY OF LABOR WHICH WAS ALLEGEDLY VIOLATED BY RESPONDENTS?APPELLANTS
PUBLIC OFFICIALS WHICH SHOULD BE PROTECTED BY INJUNCTION.</blockquote>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight: normal;">“III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE ‘INTEGRITY’ OF THE
DECISION OF THE SECRETARY OF LABOR DATED DECEMBER 5, 1973 SUFFERS FROM TAINT OF
UNDUE INFLUENCE WHICH IS ADDITIONAL REASON FOR ENJOINING ITS IMPLEMENTATION.”
(pp. 1-2, Brief for the Respondents-Appellants)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, petitioners in their appeal made the following
assignment of error:</p>

<blockquote>“THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN HOLDING IN ITS ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 17,
1975 THAT IT HAD NO JURISDICTION TO REVIEW THE CORRECTNESS OF THE DECISION OF
THE SECRETARY OF LABOR AND ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE SECRETARY IN NLRC CASES NOS.
1953, 2290 and 2497.” <span class="GramE">(p. 42, Brief for the Petitioners as <span class="SpellE">Appellees</span> and Appellants.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing assignment of errors by the parties, the
following issues are presented to this Court for resolution:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>1) whether or not the petitioners-appellants
have the right of appeal to the President of the Philippines under the
provision of P.D. No. 21; and 2) whether or not the Court of First Instance,
(now Regional Trial Court) of Manila has the jurisdiction to issue the writ of
injunction prohibiting the implementation of the decision of the Secretary of
Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue on whether petitioners can appeal to the Office of the
President from the Secretary of Labor shall be decided in accordance with the
law in force at that time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article 293
of the Labor Code, as amended, provides:</p>

<blockquote>“ART. 293.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Application of
law enacted prior to this Code.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>-- All
actions or claims accruing prior to the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
of this Code shall be determined in accordance with the laws in force at the
time of their accrual.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Moreover, Article 299 of the same Code
states, in part:</p>

<blockquote>“ART. 299.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Disposition of
pending cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>Cases on labor relations on appeal with the
Secretary of Labor or the Office of the President of the Philippines as of the
date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of this Code shall remain under
their respective jurisdiction and shall be decided in accordance with the rules
and regulations in force at the time of appeal.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The applicable law then governing appeals to the Office the
President is Presidential Decree No. 21, promulgated on October 14, 1972.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Section 5 of P.D. No. 21 provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“SEC. 5.</span><span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The decision of the Commission shall be immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span>
unless appealed to the Secretary of Labor who shall act on all cases within
five (5) days from filing.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>latter’s</u>
<u>decision</u> <u>is</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>appealable</u></span> <u>to</u>
<u>the</u> <u>President</u>.” (Emphasis ours) </blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> section expressly
provides for the remedy of appeal to the office of the President from the
decision of the Secretary of Labor without qualification.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is only when Presidential Decree No. 1367
was promulgated on May 1, 1978 that the decision of the Secretary of Labor in
labor cases shall be immediately <span class="SpellE">executory</span> provided
that the President of the Philippines may assume jurisdiction over cases which
he considers national interest cases.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Subsequently, Presidential Decree 1391 promulgated on May 29, 1978
further eliminated appeals from the NLRC to the Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, petitioners Alfredo and <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> Velasco could still avail of the remedy of appeal
to the President when the decision of the Secretary of Labor was rendered on
December 5, 1973.</p>

<p class="BODY">The second issue involves the jurisdiction of the trial court to
enjoin or restrain the implementation and execution of the decision of the
Secretary of Labor in labor cases. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>The
rule is settled that regular courts have no jurisdiction to act on labor cases
or various incidents arising <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Jurisdiction to try and
adjudicate such cases pertain</span> exclusively to the proper labor officials
of the Department of Labor (Associated Labor Unions (ALU-TUCP) v. <span class="SpellE">Borromeo</span>, G.R. 75736, September 29, 1988, 166 SCRA
99).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Regular courts, being ill-prepared
to apply labor laws, should not interfere in labor cases (Goodrich Employees
Association v. CFI of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, L-30211, October 5,
1976, 73 SCRA 297).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the Court of
First Instance had no jurisdiction in the case at bar to issue the writ of
injunction to restrain the enforcement of the decision rendered by the
Secretary of Labor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where the issue is
lack of authority or arbitrary or improvident exercise thereof, the decision of
the Secretary of Labor may only be questioned and reviewed through a petition
for <i>certiorari</i> with the Supreme Court, which is the proper forum for it
(<span class="SpellE">Asiaworld</span> Publishing House Inc. v. <span class="SpellE">Ople</span>. G.R. 56398, July 23, 1987, 152 SCRA 219).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span class="GramE">We</span> find the
decision of the trial court null and void for lack of jurisdiction in enjoining
the Secretary of Labor from implementing his decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the remedy of appeal to which the petitioners are entitled
under the applicable law then, this Court deems it impractical to allow the
parties to still pursue their appeal to the Office of the President at this
time considering that under the present law, the Labor Code, as amended, the
President may only assume jurisdiction only in cases which the latter considers
to be of national interest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With respect
to those labor cases which do not involve national interest, such as the case
at bar, the machinery or body in the Office of the President governing such
appeals apparently <span class="GramE">is no longer existing</span> under the
present law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, for just and
equitable considerations, this Court instead shall grant the petitioners the
opportunity to file a proper petition for <i>certiorari</i> within a reasonable
time questioning the decision on the merits of the Secretary of Labor.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the assailed decision of the Court of First
Instance of Manila (now Regional Trial Court) Branch XX in Civil Case No. 94698
dated September 30, 1975 is hereby REVERSED AND SET ASIDE for lack of
jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners Alfredo and <span class="SpellE">Adelina</span> Velasco shall be allowed the right to file a proper
petition to this Court assailing the decision of the Secretary of Labor dated
December 5, 1973 in NLRC Cases Nos. 1953, 2290 and 2427.</p>
