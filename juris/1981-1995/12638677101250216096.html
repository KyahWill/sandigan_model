sentencing the two accused to life imprisonment for <span style="">violation </span>of the Dangerous Drugs law.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The </span>records show
that on <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1988</st1:date>,
the N<span style="">arcotics </span>Command (NARCOM)

</span>PS/Lt. Emmanuel <span class="SpellE">Ughoc</span>, Deputy Executive
Officer <span style="">and Chief of </span>Operations
Division thereof, formed a team to <span style="">entrap
the duo.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He designated SSgt. Hermes <span class="SpellE">Recla</span> as team leader, and certain PO3 Gomez and about seven
civilian agents as back-up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon,
they motored to </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Nichols</span></st1:placename><span style="">
 </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Heights</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">SSgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span> approached the <span class="SpellE">targetted</span> area whereupon two persons accosted him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Recla</span> informed them
that he was looking for a certain Sammy (the accused Samuel <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>)
from whom to buy marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Almario</span> then introduced himself as the "Sammy",
and asked for the money.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Recla</span> handed him a marked twenty-peso bill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The accused <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>
produced nine marijuana cigarettes which he handed to <span class="SpellE">Recla</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter then tapped his head as a cue to
his back-up, who waited in the distance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Shortly, the team swooped down on the two and announced a bust.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ughoc</span> recovered the marked
twenty-peso bill from <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>, together with six more
sticks of marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The effects were then
submitted for laboratory </span>examination, where Myrna Areola, forensic
analyst, positively identified them as marijuana.</p>

<p class="BODY">On September 27, 1988, Asst. City Fiscal Virginia <span class="SpellE">Palanca</span>-Santiago filed an information, formally accusing <span class="SpellE">Anciano</span> and <span class="SpellE">Almario</span> of marketing
prohibited substances (marijuana) in violation of Section 4, Article II, in
relation to Section 21, Article IV, of the Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">On arraignment, the two entered pleas of "not guilty".</p>

<p class="BODY">Both accused denied the charges and alleged that at <span style="">about </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="17">5:00</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1988" day="24" month="9">September 24, 1988</st1:date>,
they were <span style="">playing basketball at </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span style="">Nichols</span></st1:placename><span style=""> </span><st1:placetype><span style="">Heights</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span style=""> after which they rested under a tamarind
tree.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All of a sudden, a three-wheel
motorcycle arrived, where two armed persons dismounted, pointed their firearms
at them, and warned: "This is an arrest, don' t run."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">They were allegedly bodily searched and later handcuffed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That notwithstanding, they allegedly found
nothing in their persons.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
later brought to the police headquarters.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The two also claimed that
they had in fact worked for Lt. </span><span class="SpellE">Ughoc</span> and
SSgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span> as informers, and were responsible for
successful drug busts in the past.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused <span class="SpellE">Almario</span> added that in 1986,
he informed Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span> that he was quitting as an
informer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That allegedly marked <span class="SpellE">Recla</span>, who warned him: "If I see you again, you better
watch out."<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On rebuttal, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ughoc</span> denied that the
two accused ever worked as informers because he had enough men to perform
intelligence work for NARCOM.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
admitted, however, having known <span class="SpellE">Almario</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">As indicated at the outset, the court convicted the two accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The two now urge a reversal, alleging that the trial court erred,
in the main, in its appreciation of the evidence.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have repeatedly held that the matter of appreciating<span style=""> </span>evidence and assessing the credibility
of witnesses is an undertaking that rests primarily with the trial court.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the defense has not convincingly shown why Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ughoc</span> or SSgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span> should
testify falsely against them, unless otherwise, they said the truth.</p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the accused <span class="SpellE">Almario</span> <span style="">was </span>known to Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ughoc</span>
and SSgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span> does not discount the possibility of
marijuana pushing on the part of both accused.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Almario</span> insists that they could not have so
confidently passed the illegal plant to SSgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span>
because they knew that he was a NARCOM agent is not only contradicted by hard
evidence that marijuana was in fact found in their persons, it is not, in
addition, inconsistent with the <span class="SpellE">NARCOM's</span> claims that
the two were in fact peddlers of marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Indeed, the accused could have precisely, and so self-assuredly, handed
the nine marijuana cigarettes to the sergeant because they knew him.</p>

<p class="BODY">We can not accept pretensions that the "bust" was the
mere handiwork of SSgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span>, who had resented the
accused <span class="SpellE">Almario's</span> quitting work for NARCOM two years
before.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We find it inconceivable why
SSgt. <span class="SpellE">Recla</span> could have so recklessly contrived a
false bust for that reason alone, especially when the <span class="SpellE">Cebu</span>
NARCOM has been shown to have enough men to assist it in gathering intelligence.</p>

<p class="BODY">The arrest of the accused without a warrant is incidentally
sanctioned by the Rules, "[w]hen, in [the peace officer's] presence, the
person to be arrested has committed, is actually committing, or is attempting
to commit an offense."<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The arrests in question fall within <span style="">"is
</span><span class="SpellE">actualy</span> committing", the second mode, and
in that case, police action was justified.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>To be sure, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Ughoc</span>, <span style="">et </span>al. could have easily procured a judicial warrant since he <span style="">was aware of the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span>
operations days before, instead of resorting to entrapment, but the question is
not why he </span>did not secure one.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The question is whether or not his men acted legally in effecting a <span class="SpellE">warrantless</span> <span class="SpellE">arest</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As we said, we find it justified in the
circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the Decision, dated May 30, 1989, is
AFFIRMED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>With costs against both
appellants.</p>
