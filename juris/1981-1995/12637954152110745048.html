<p class="BODY" align="justify">The death penalty having been imposed on accused 
<span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span>, this 
case comes to <span class="GramE">Us</span> on automatic review.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">The facts of the case, as stated in the decision of 
the trial court, are as follows:</p>
<p class="2Q" align="justify">"By the evidence adduced, the Court is convinced that 
on <st1:date month="5" day="26" year="1984">May 26, 1984</st1:date> at about 
<st1:time hour="11" minute="30">11:30</st1:time> in the evening, Pat. Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Brul</span> is patrolling his beat at <span class="SpellE">Divino</span> <span class="SpellE">Rostro</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>, for it is within 
the vicinity of <span class="SpellE">Patranco</span> (now <span class="SpellE">Philtranco</span> Station), terminal at <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, <span class="SpellE">Albay</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>He is 
therefore in the actual performance of his duty, although he<b><span> 
</span></b>is not in uniform, as most of the policemen <span>are now, due to the 
prevailing peace and order situation in the country.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="2Q" align="justify"><span>While performing his duty as such, it is not 
clear why he went inside Hilda's Beerhouse, but he did, and while he was inside 
said establishment, he saw the group of Solomon <span class="SpellE">Senson</span>, a buy and sell man; <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> <em>alias</em> 
Sending but whose real name is <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> now one of the accused, Mariano Serrano, the 
other, accused, an employee of the Bureau of Land Transportation at <span class="SpellE">Tabaco</span>, Agency and one <span class="SpellE">Leoncio</span> 
<span class="SpellE">Tea√±o</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>They were drinking beer in the 
place when Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> arrived.<span>&nbsp; </span>Upon 
entering the establishment mentioned, Solomon <span class="SpellE">Belison</span>, 
who appears to be spending for the group, invited Patrolman Vicente <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> to join them.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Knowing 
the group, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> consented, and Solomon 
<span class="SpellE">Belison</span> ordered a beer for him.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is 
not clear whether Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> acceded to the invitation 
or not, but the fact is his presence was resented by accused <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> because Pat. 
<span class="SpellE">Brul</span> stood there without the group's 
permission.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="2Q" align="justify"><span class="GramE">For one reason or another, and not 
so clear, Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> got hold of a peeling 
knife, (not a dagger as testified to by accused <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span>) and told them 
that he will use it to peel something.<span>&nbsp; </span>As admitted by Solomon 
<span class="SpellE">Belison</span>, at the time, there was no appetizer on the 
table (<span class="SpellE">pulutan</span>).<span>&nbsp; </span>This knife was taken by 
accused <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> 
from Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span>, deposited it in the counter, as it 
appears that accused <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span>, who is a parolee, resents authorities, especially 
those connected with the military.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span>, not even getting angry, despite having been disarmed 
of his peeling knife, got the knife from the counter.</p>
<p class="2Q" align="justify">At this point, Pat. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> went out, with his back turned and accused <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> following, and 
the latter snatched the service revolver of Pat. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> from his waist, as the gun is tucked in the waist of 
Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Brul</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span><span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">After snatching it from 
Pat.</span> <span class="SpellE">Brul</span>, Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> 
asked that the gun to be returned to him, but instead of doing so, accused <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span>, fired the 
gun.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is not clear as to what direction did said accused fire 
it; but said accused claimed that it was on the ground.<span>&nbsp; </span>This shot 
was heard by <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barrameda</span>, an owner of a store nearby, who went to the door 
<span>of his store and tried to find out what is happening.<span>&nbsp; </span>It was 
at this point, that this witness, (<span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barrameda</span>) who appeared to the Court as an unbiased and 
truthful witness, saw what happened.<span>&nbsp; </span>From his account of the 
incident, it was clearly established that Pat. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> was trying to get back his gun which was snatched away 
from his waist by the accused, <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> </span><span class="SpellE"><span>Balmaceda</span></span><span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Pat <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> pleaded, to no avail, and accused <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> even taunted and insulted Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> by saying, "If this is your gun, why is it in my 
possession." </span>This insult or taunt, did not even caused (<em>sic</em>) the 
victim to become violent, and instead pleaded for the return of the gun as he 
not only knew that he will have no face to report to his Station without a 
service firearm and which was taken away from his by a parolee.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Brul</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> then did the only thing he knew; to go after the accused 
and try to get the gun, and so they grappled for its possession.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>At this point, it must be stated that the late Pat. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> is well within his right to recover his 
property.<span>&nbsp; </span>It is also at this point that he sustained the 
contusions of his body which was of course logically inflicted by the accused 
<span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

<st1:date month="6" day="29" year="1985">June 29, 1985</st1:date>)."</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">Appellant assigns the following errors allegedly 
committed by the trial court:</p></blockquote>
<ol><li>The trial court erred in not finding that accused <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> acted in self-defense.<br><br></li><li>Assuming <span class="SpellE"><em>arguendo</em></span> that defendant's 
culpability for the death of Pat. Vicente <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> has 
been established by proof <span>beyond reasonable doubt and the justifying 
circumstance of self-defense cannot be considered in defendant's favor, 
nevertheless, the trial court erred in not appreciating the attendance of 
mitigating circumstances in defendant's favor such as incomplete self-defense 
and voluntary surrender.<o:p><br><br></o:p></span></li><li><span></span>The trial court erred in holding that the firearm allegedly 
used in this was unlicensed.<span><o:p></o:p></span></li></ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="OTHERHEADING" align="justify"><em>Anent the 
first and second assignments of error</em><u>:</u></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">The elements of self-defense are:<span>&nbsp; </span>(a) 
unlawful aggression; (b) reasonable necessity of the means employed to prevent 
or repel it; and (c) lack of sufficient provocation on the part of the person 
defending himself. (Art. 11 par. 1, Revised Penal Code).</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">According to accused - appellant, the foregoing 
three (3) elements are present ‚Äî</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">(a)<span>&nbsp; </span>Unlawful aggression ‚Äî in invoking 
self-defense appellant claims that Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> drew a 
knife and stabbed appellant.<span>&nbsp; </span>When appellant felt he was injured, 
he tried to get the gun from the waist of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>In their grappling for possession of the 
gun, it exploded and killed Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Brul</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">(b)<span>&nbsp; </span>Reasonable necessity of the means 
employed ‚Äî upon sustaining a stab wound in his abdomen accused contends that he 
cannot be tasked thereafter with <span class="SpellE">cooly</span> appraising what 
action to take next.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, his act of firing at his 
assailant, whether intentionally or by accident can be justified by his instinct 
of self-preservation.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">(c)<span>&nbsp; </span>Lack of sufficient provocation ‚Äî 
that not one of accused' actions on the night of <st1:date month="5" day="20" year="1984">May 20, 1984</st1:date> can be considered provocative.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">According to the Solicitor General ‚Äî there was no 
previous unlawful attack that placed appellant's life in danger.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Prosecution witness <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Barrameda</span> testified that Pat <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> 
<span>was not holding a knife at the time he was arguing with appellant for the 
latter to return the gun.<span>&nbsp; </span>He likewise testified that he never saw 
the victim even try to stab appellant when they grappled for the possession of 
the gun.<span>&nbsp; </span>In fact, while Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul's</span> hand 
was later found with a knife, there was no drop of blood thereon thus, <span class="GramE">negating</span> appellant's claim that he was stabbed and wounded by 
Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Brul</span></span><span class="GramE"> 
which allegedly forced him to shoot the victim.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>Moreover, 
the evidence shows that appellant was one (1) meter away when he shot the 
victim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">Neither was there lack of sufficient provocation on 
the part <span>of </span>appellant.<span>&nbsp; </span>On the contrary it was 
appellant who, without being insulted or attacked by Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Brul</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> 
wrested away from the latter a small peeling knife.<span>&nbsp; </span>Not contented 
with that, appellant snatched from behind the revolver of Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span> when the latter was going out.<span>&nbsp; </span>Therefore, 
all the provocations came from appellant.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">There being no unlawful aggression nor <span class="GramE">sufficient provocation from the victim, there is</span> undoubtedly 
no reasonable necessity for appellant to shoot the victim.</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">Consider too appellant's failure to plead and/or 
invoke said defense before any of the apprehending and/or investigating 
officers.<span>&nbsp; </span>He should have come out and told the authorities that he 
killed the victim merely to defend himself.<span>&nbsp; </span>Instead appellant went 
into hiding.<span>&nbsp; </span>Flight is incompatible with innocence.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" class="OTHERHEADING" align="justify">As to the third 
assignment of error:</p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify"><span>Appellant claims that he cannot be convicted 
of homicide with the </span>use of illegally possessed firearm on the ground 
that said firearm was licensed under the name of Pat. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Brul</span></span><span class="GramE">.</span></p>
<p class="BODY" align="justify">This contention was extensively discussed in the 
decision of the trial court, as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="2Q" align="justify">"And finally as to whether accused <span class="SpellE">Sendencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Balmaceda</span> used an 
unlicensed firearm in shooting Pat. <span class="SpellE">Brul</span>, the court is 
certain and has not entertained any doubt that he did.<span>&nbsp; </span>In the 
first place, the accused is admittedly a parolee; As such he cannot be granted 
any license to carry firearm, such less given a permit to carry it outside his 
residence.<span>&nbsp; </span>Second:<span>&nbsp; </span>The firearm used in the 
commission of the offense is the 38 caliber service revolver of the victim, so 
it cannot be licensed to the aforesaid accused.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Third, the accused actuation after shooting Pat.</span> Vicente 
<span class="SpellE">Brul</span>, in running away with the latter's service 
revolver, and up to now, the accused has not only failed to surrender it, but 
even disclaims having taken it, when it has been satisfactorily shown that he 
took it, is an evident showing of his interest not only to keep it for himself 
but also to appropriate it."</p></blockquote>
