Daniel Sanchez's action in the former court raised an issue -- the validity of
the sheriff's levy on the conjugal partnership assets of the Sanchez Spouses --
different from those adjudicated in the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
Court, and Sanchez was not a party to the case tried by the latter.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">From this verdict Lourdes
Mariano has appealed to this Court, contending that the Appellate Court
committed reversible error -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>1) in ruling that the conjugal partnership of Daniel and Esther
Sanchez could not be made liable for Esther's judgment obligation arising from
the spouses' joint business with Lourdes Mariano;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2) in ruling that the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Court
of First Instance had not interfered with the execution process of the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> Court of First Instance; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) when its Eighth Division decided the petition of Lourdes Mariano
although the case had been raffled to the Seventh Division and the latter had
in fact given due course to the petition.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">1. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>There is no dispute
about the fact that Esther Sanchez was engaged in business not only without
objection on the part of her husband, Daniel, but in truth with his consent and
approval.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn21" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">1</span></span></a> It is also established that, as
expressly acknowledged by Esther herself and never denied by Daniel, the
profits from the business had been used to meet, in part at least, expenses for
the support of her family, i.e., the schooling of the children, food and other
household expenses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">2</span></span></a> Under the
circumstances, Lourdes Mariano's action against Esther Sanchez was justified,
the litigation being "incidental to the ** business in which she is
engaged,"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">3</span></span></a> and consequently, the conjugal
partnership of Daniel and Esther Sanchez was liable for the debts and
obligations contracted by Esther in her business since the income derived <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, having been used to defray some of the expenses
for the maintenance of the family and the education of the children, had
redounded to the benefit of the partnership.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">4</span></span></a> It was
therefore error for the Court of Appeals to have ruled otherwise.</p>

<p class="BODY">2. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>It was also error for
the Court of Appeals to have held that there was no interference by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Court of First Instance with the execution
process of the <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
  Court</st1:address></st1:street>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The rule, one of great
importance in the administration of justice, is that a Court of First Instance
has no power to restrain by means of injunction the execution of a judgment or </span>decree
of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">another judge of concurrent or
coordinate jurisdiction.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">5</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> But this is precisely what was done by the <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City Court of First Instance:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It enjoined the execution of a judgment
authorized and directed by a co-equal and coordinate court, the <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span> City Court of First Instance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It did so on the claim of Daniel Sanchez that
the property being levied on belonged to the conjugal partnership and could not
be made liable for the wife's obligations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The question that arises
is whether such a claim -- that property levied on in execution of a judgment
is not property of the judgment debtor, Daniel Sanchez's wife, but of the
conjugal partnership of the Sanchez Spouses -- is properly cognizable by a
Court other than that which rendered judgment adversely to the wife.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">To be sure, Section 17,
Rule 39 of the Rules of Court, authorizes a "third person," i.e.,
"any other person than the judgment debtor or his agent," to
vindicate "his claim to the property by any proper action." The
section reads as follows:</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">1</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

an affidavit of his title thereto or right to the possession thereof, stating
the grounds of such right or title, and serve the same upon the officer making
the levy, and a copy thereof upon the judgment creditor, the officer shall not
be bound to keep the property, unless such judgment creditor or his agent, on
demand of the officer, indemnify the officer against such claim by a bond in a
sum not greater than the value of the property levied on.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In case of disagreement as to such value, the
same shall be determined by the court issuing the writ of execution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The officer is not liable for damages, for the taking or keeping of
the property, to any third-party claimant, unless a claim is made by the latter
and unless an action for damages is brought by him against the officer within
one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of the filing of the bond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><i><u>But nothing herein contained shall
prevent such claimant or any third person from vindicating his claim to the

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The "proper

</span>What <span class="SpellE">Rejuso</span> did was to institute, <i>together

same court against the sheriff and the judgment creditor, <span class="SpellE">Estipona</span>,
for the purpose of annulling the levy, execution sale, and writ of possession
issued in the first action in respect of their residential house and lot, on
the theory that that property was conjugal in character and "hence, not
subject to such proceedings considering that <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span>
was not a party to the previous case." The action was however dismissed by
the court on the ground that it had "no jurisdiction over the subject </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">matter of the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

court had no jurisdiction to "vacate or annul and/or enjoin the
enforcement of the processes issued by another branch in another case,"
and since <span class="SpellE">Rejuso</span> had already raised the same issues
in the first case, without success, he should not be allowed to "get from
another branch ** what he failed to get ** (from) Branch I." This Court
affirmed that judgment of dismissal,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">5</span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> holding that <span class="SpellE">Rejuso's</span>
