				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In a sworn complaint dated <st1:date year="1986" day="3" month="7">3
 July 1986</st1:date>, Alberto <span class="SpellE">Patangan</span> charged Atty.
Reynaldo <span class="SpellE">Concha</span>, Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial
Court of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del Norte and Deputy Provincial
Sheriff, with abuse of authority, non­-performance of duty and ignorance of the
law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The complaint arose out of the failure of respondent to execute
or enforce the writ of execution <span class="GramE">issued</span> by the <st1:place><st1:placename>Municipal</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
Branch 2, in Civil Case No. A-2641 entitled "Alberto <span class="SpellE">Patangan</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Florinette</span> <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span>",
a case brought for the collection of a sum of money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The writ of execution related to the
enforcement of a judgment obtained by the complainant in the amount of P9<span class="GramE">,312.00</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent filed his Comment dated <st1:date year="1987" day="26" month="1">26 January 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The relevant facts as found by the Office of the Court Administrator are
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="4">April 23, 1986</st1:date>
A.M., complainant handed respondent a writ of execution issued by the MTC of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City in connection with Civil Case No. <span class="GramE">A-2641 for collection of a sum of money.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He urged that the same be served immediately
as defendant therein was determined to transfer her residence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent confronted her in one of the RTC <span class="SpellE">salas</span> but failed to serve the writ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant, however, promised to pay in cash
at <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 P.M.</st1:time> on that same day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 P.M.</st1:time>
defendant failed to make payment as promised.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Complainant was required to pay a P200.00 deposit for the service of the
writ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, respondent in the
company of his Deputy, Lope D. <span class="SpellE">Canturias</span>, went to
defendant <span class="SpellE">Magpulong's</span> residence at <span class="SpellE">Miputak</span>, of the same city.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>While there they found <span class="SpellE">personalties</span> belonging
to defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again complainant was
insisting that the writ be served.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Visibly irked, respondent countered that complainant should
not teach the Sheriff, as he knows what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also stated that, <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span> had 60 days
within which to produce the money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span> pleaded for a little time so she could dispose of
her properties at the right price.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Respondent warned <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span> not to remove any
of the items without his authority.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Not satisfied, complainant watched from some distance (as he
did not have money to hire security guards) to make sure defendant did not
abscond, but at <st1:time minute="0" hour="21">9:00 P.M.</st1:time> he got
hungry and left for home.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The following day complainant found out defendant had left
for <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City,
taking all her personalities with her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He informed respondent, but was advised to deposit P500.00 for expenses
so his deputy could serve the writ at <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span> de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
complainant failed to put up the deposit as he had no more money.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"By way of comment, respondent pointed out that the case arose
out of a <span class="SpellE">Masiao</span> game with defendant as financier and
complainant's wife as coordinator, who advanced money to cover winnings of
bettors who placed bets with her <span class="SpellE">totalling</span> a claim of
P29<span class="GramE">,000</span> reduced to P9,312 by virtue of an amicable
settlement signed by them before <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Captain <span class="SpellE">Digal</span> of <span class="SpellE">Miputak</span>, <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When
the 1st installment fell due, defendant failed to pay and spouses <span class="SpellE">Patangan</span> came before the Municipal Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> to ask for a writ of execution.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent avers that this is not the first time that the
Office of the Provincial/City Sheriff had been made a collection agent in the
game of <span class="SpellE">Masiao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>But with the writ of execution issued, respondent had no choice but to
try and serve the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Complainant
demanded that respondent act on and serve the writ immediately, and
notwithstanding his explanation that he could not, on the spot, pull out one
Deputy Sheriff to implement the writ on his say-so, as he had a limited number
with two on leave, taking the Bar Review classes in Manila, and another, the
victim of a heart attack which left him totally disabled and paralyzed and
confined at hospital.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The remaining
Deputy Sheriffs had their hands full serving other writs of execution and/or
summons of earlier dates whose 60 days are almost up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He explained that they have had to schedule
the implementation of writs to be able to serve other writs before they
expire.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But due to complainant's <span class="SpellE">importunings</span> and insistence and having been made to believe
by complainant that <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span> was no longer a resident
of <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span> and was a great swindler, respondent
acceded to his request and ordered his Deputy Sheriff, Jose <span class="SpellE">Centino</span>,
to cancel his day's schedule to serve the writ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Providentially, however, Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Centino</span> met <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span> at the entrance of Branch VI session hall
attending to another civil case arising from <span class="SpellE">Masiao</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Whereupon she was served
and informed of the aforesaid writ of execution.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"When first confronted, defendant tried to evade liability by
refusing to acknowledge the writ served upon her, on the pretext that she did
not know anything about this obligation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Brought to respondent's office she was apprised of the nature of the
writ and though she insisted for some time that she did not owe anyone in <span class="SpellE">Dipolog</span>, she finally relented when shown and confronted by
the undersigned with the amicable settlement signed by her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She later said she forgot all about it, that
it arose from a <span class="SpellE">Masiao</span> game, and that Major <span class="SpellE">Encabo</span> could attest to this.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"At <st1:time minute="0" hour="14">2:00 P.M.</st1:time>
defendant failed to show up.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The spouses
<span class="SpellE">Patangan</span> could not pay the sheriff's fees but
promised to pay the next day, April 24, and respondent favorably acted on their
request.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the spouses' insistence that the writ be served even late
in the afternoon, notwithstanding respondent's reluctance due to nighttime
limitations, respondent again acceded to complainant's request.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And with additional Deputy Sheriff Lope D. <span class="SpellE">Canturias</span> they proceeded to <span class="SpellE">Magpulong's</span>
rented house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Enroute</span>,
they passed by Fiscal Orlando Velasco and the lawyer of Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span> and the defendant herself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They invited them for the ride to defendant's
house.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On reaching the house respondent's party found movable
properties consisting of a <span class="SpellE">narra</span> dining round table
with six <span class="SpellE">seaters</span> also in carvings, two <span class="SpellE">sleeprite</span> beds, a TV cart, a mini tricycle, etc.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent again tried to persuade <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span>
to affix her signature on the writ, especially since she now had a lawyer
present to assist her, but she continued to refuse.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"At this point respondent prepared in his
own handwriting the Sheriff's 'Officer's Levy on the described personalities
(Annex 2 of Comment).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While he
was thus making the levy, <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span> again pleaded
that she be given time to produce the amount of P9,312.00 the following day so
she could get a fairer price for the items, and again promised to settle the
amount at 2:00 P.M. the next day, April 24, 1986.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After the constructive levy and seizure had been made by
respondent, he ordered the padlocking of the main and back doors and windows of
<span class="SpellE">Magpulong's</span> house to safeguard the seized chattels
but because it was past 6:00 P.M. and was getting dark, he had to accede to her
request that as she had just arrived that day from <span class="SpellE">Cagayan</span>
de <span class="SpellE">Oro</span> City, and as she had no other place to sleep,
she be allowed to stay in the house to pass the night.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She even shed copious tears, threatening to
commit suicide if her request to sleep in the house were not granted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With the representation of counsel, that a
modicum of compassion and human consideration be given to her, respondent
relented.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Defendant promised to pay in
full at the Office of the Provincial Sheriff at <st1:place><st1:placename>Capitol</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>Building</st1:placetype></st1:place> the next day.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Believing, albeit mistakenly, in her sincerity and candor
respondent yielded to her request of shelter for the night, on condition and
with a stern warning that no removal whatsoever of the chattels <span class="GramE">be</span> made without the sheriff's permission or that of the
Court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Notwithstanding respondent's explanation that the writ had in
fact been served and an officer's levy made and that defendant's refusal to
sign the same <span class="GramE">was</span> of no moment, complainant's wife was
insisting that the writ of execution be now served on defendant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent had to admonish the couple not to
teach the Sheriff as he knows what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because complainant's wife was, to respondent's mind demanding so many
things already excessive, unreasonable and unjust, he reprimanded her saying
the lifetime of the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> writ has (sic) still
sixty (60) days [within which] for the Sheriff to implement x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> despite the fact that
complainant's wife has not yet paid the legal fees on Sheriff's fees and
expenses, and in order just to accommodate her x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> no less than the undersigned (provincial Sheriff) himself
together with his two (2) other Deputy Sheriff's proceeded to Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Magpulong's</span> house even after office hours.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The undersigned furthermore explained to
complainant's wife that due to the urgency of her request and in cases like
that, the one asking for the implementation of the writ has to provide the
laborers and at least a cargo truck to haul the validly levied chattels to the
Office of the Provincial Sheriff, and because it was already 6:00 o'clock in
the evening of April 23, 1986, complainants were nevertheless, advised to
provide at their expense a security guard in order to safeguard the seized
personal properties; but all these suggestions were not feasible for reason
that the complainants had no money at that time, neither were they prepared for
that, hence they were advised to watch for themselves as having admitted by
complainant himself under par. V of his complaint x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
x.' (Comment. pp. 15-16).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Respondent in 'all sincerity and candor' vehemently denies
allegations of abuse of authority, non-performance of duty and ignorance of the
law".</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We note, in the first place, that respondent's attitude in
respect of the performance of his official duties leaves much to be
desired.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We discern a marked reluctance
on the part of the respondent promptly to carry out his duty which was to serve
the writ of execution upon the judgment debtor, to locate and take possession
of the property, personal or real, of the judgment debtor, to levy upon the
same and to dispose of such property by public sale in accordance with the
Revised Rules of Court and applicable regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We observe in the behavior of respondent the
deplorable attitude that he was bestowing upon the complainant a big favor by
serving the writ of execution, which was his bounden duty to carry out in the
first place, for which the complainant should have been properly grateful.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent was annoyed and irritated by
the complainant's persistent but understandable requests that the writ of
execution be served and carried out promptly.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="GramE">The complainant had warned, and apparently convinced,
the respondent that the judgment debtor Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Magpulong</span>
"was no longer a resident of </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Dipolog</span></span></st1:placename><span class="GramE"> </span><st1:placetype><span class="GramE">City</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span class="GramE"> and that she was a great swindler".</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
This warning apparently produced no effect on the respondent who appeared to be
more concerned about payment by the complainant of sheriff's fees and expenses
and the complainant's lack of ready cash with which to pay such fees and
expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, contrary to the insistence of the
respondent, he did not have sixty days within which to implement the writ of
execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under Section 11 of Rule 39
of the Revised Rules of Court, the writ of execution is returnable to the clerk
or judge of the court issuing it "at any time not less than ten (10) nor
more than sixty (60) days after its receipt by the officer" who must
execute it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it is the return of
the writ that may be <span class="GramE">effected</span> within sixty days after
receipt of the writ by the officer who is to carry it out.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But such officer must act with all
appropriate celerity in serving and implementing the writ; he has no discretion
whether to execute it or not.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> A
sheriff who delays the service and execution of the writ does so at his own
peril if, by his malfeasance or misfeasance, he fails to implement the writ and
causes damage to the judgment creditor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>As pointed out in <span class="SpellE">Moya</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Bassig</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"It is undisputable that the most difficult phase of any
proceeding is the execution of judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hence, <u>the officers charged with the delicate task of the enforcement
and/or implementation of the same must</u>, in the absence of a restraining
order, <u>act with considerable dispatch, in executing the writ so as not to
unduly delay the administration of justice</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise, the decisions, orders or other processes of the courts of
justice and the like would be futile.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Stated differently, the judgment if not executed would be just an empty
victory on the part of the prevailing party."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The respondent found a substantial quantity of personal property,
in all probability sufficient to generate the amount due, belonging to the
judgment debtor in the house where she was staying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent failed to take possession of
such personal properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
promptly taking control and possession of such personality, respondent,
purporting to be moved by the copious tears of the judgment debtor (whom respondent
acknowledged to be a "great swindler"), and professing a sudden surge
of humani­tarian feeling, left the judgment debtor in possession of her
personal properties free to abscond with her property, as she did abscond.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Had respondent moved with a little more
dispatch, he should have been able to carry out the levy and taken possession
earlier during the day and avoided the furtive withdrawal of the debtor's
property under cover of night and the debtor's flight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The respondent had, by his own statement,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
already agreed to the request of complainant's wife that sheriff's fees and
expenses be paid the following day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To
leave the judgment debtor in control and possession of her personal property,
without any arrangements for the security thereof other than a supposed oral
adjuration by the respondent, was, in effect, to lift the levy, the writ having
been already served on the judgment debtor and constituted, in the
circumstances of this case, gross dereliction of duty.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, we find the respondent GUILTY of dereliction of
duty and he is hereby DISMISSED from the service, with forfeiture of all
retirement benefits and with prejudice to re-employment in any other branch or
agency of the government, including government owned or controlled
corporations.</p>
