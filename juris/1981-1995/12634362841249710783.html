				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The principal issue posed in the present controversy is: what is
the appropriate mode of computation of the 13th month pay of employees who
receive a fixed or guaranteed salary <u>plus</u> sales commissions?</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Philippine Duplicators, Inc. is a domestic corporation
engaged in the distribution of foreign-made copying machines and related
consumables. In petitioner's employ are salesmen who are paid a fixed or
guaranteed salary plus commissions, which commissions are computed on the
selling price of the duplicating machines sold by the respective salesmen.</p>

<p class="BODY">P.D. No. 851, promulgated on 16 December 1975, prescribed payment
of 13th month pay in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1.  All employers
are hereby required to pay all their <u>employees receiving a basic  salary of not more than P1,000.00</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>a month</u>, regardless of the nature
of the employment, a 13th month pay not later than December 24 of every
year." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The Rules and Regulations Implementing
P.D. No. 851, issued by the Secretary of Labor and Employment on 22 December
1975, defined the following basic terms:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"(a)  '13th month pay' shall mean </span>one-twelfth
(1/12) of the basic salary of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">a
employee </span>within a calendar year;</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)  '<u>basic salary</u>' shall include <u>all
remunerations or earnings paid by an employer to an employee for services
rendered</u>, but may not include cost of living allowances granted pursuant to
President Decree No. 525 or Letter of Instructions No. 174, profit-sharing
payments, and all allowances and monetary benefits which are not considered or
integrated as part of the regular or basic salary of the employee at the time
of the promulgation of the Decree on December 16, 1975." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 13 August 1986, President Corazon C. Aquino, then exercising
both executive and legislative authority, issued Memorandum Order No. 28 which
provided as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 1 of Presidential Decree No. 851 is hereby modified to
the extent that <u>all employers</u> are hereby required to pay <u>all their
rank-and-file employees</u> a 13th month pay not later than December 24 of
every year." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In connection with and in implementation
of Memorandum Order No. 28, Minister Augusto S. Sanchez of the then Ministry of
Labor and Employment issued MOLE Explanatory Bulletin No. 86-12 on 24 November
1986. Item No. 5 (a) of this issuance read:</p>

<blockquote>"Employees who are paid a fixed or guaranteed wage <u>plus </u>commission
are also entitled to the mandated 13th month pay, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">based on their total earning[s] during the calendar year</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">, i.e., <u>on both their fixed and guaranteed
wage and commission</u>."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Private respondent union, for and on behalf of its
member-salesmen, asked petitioner corporation for payment of 13th month pay
computed on the basis of the salesmen's fixed or guaranteed wages <u>plus</u>
commissions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner corporation refused the union's request, but stated it
would respect an opinion from the MOLE. On <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">17 </span>November 1987, acting upon a request for opinion submitted by
respondent union, Director Augusto G. Sanchez of the Bureau of Working Conditions,
MOLE, rendered an opinion to respondent union declaring applicable the
provisions of Explanatory Bulletin No. 86-12, Item <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">No. 5 (a): <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"x x x [S]ince the <u>salesmen</u> of Philippine Duplicators
are <u>receiving a fixed basic wage plus commission on sales</u> and not purely
on commission basis, they are entitled to receive 13th month pay provided that
they worked at least one (1) month during the calendar year.  May we add at this point that <u>in
computing such 13th month pay, the total commissions of said salesmen for the
calendar year shall he divided by twelve (12)</u>." (Underscoring
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding Director Sanchez' opinion or ruling, petitioner
refused to pay the claims of its salesmen for 13th month pay computed on the
basis of both fixed wage plus sales commissions.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent union thereupon instituted a complaint against
petitioner corporation for payment of the demand of its salesmen-members for
13th month pay. The union averred that the salesmen received 13th month pay
computed <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">only</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>on the basis of their fixed or
guaranteed wage. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Its </span>basic
contention was that pursuant to Memorandum Order No. 28, above quoted, in
relation to the Explanatory Bulletin No. 86-12, also quoted above, the 13th
month pay of salesmen receiving a fixed salary and commissions should be
computed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">on </span>the basis of their
total earnings for the calendar year, i.e., <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">on both the fixed salary and sales commissions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">After submission </span>of
the parties' respective position papers, the Labor Arbiter rendered a decision
dated 24 October 1989 directing petitioner corporation to pay 13th month pay to
its salesmen computed in accordance with the requirements of Explanatory <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Bulletin No. 86-12.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner appealed to the National Labor Relations Commission
("NLRC"), formulating the basic issue in terms of "whether or
not an employer is liable to give his employee a separate 13th month pay on
commissions independently of, aside from and in addition to, 13th month pay on
basic wage." Petitioner maintained that the commissions earned by its
salesmen fell outside the scope of the term "basic salary" for
purposes of computing the 13th month pay of employees. Expansion of the scope
of the term "basic salary", for purposes of computing 13th month pay,
is beyond the authority and prerogatives of the DOLE Secretary, petitioner
argued, since such expansion required legislative authority.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 November 1992, the NLRC affirmed the award of the Labor
Arbiter, declaring that it (the NLRC) was not vested with authority to pass
upon the validity of Explanatory Bulletin No. 86-12, which issuance by
Secretary Augusto S. Sanchez remain operative as a source of rights until
declared invalid by the proper authorities, i.e., the Supreme Court. Petitioner
moved for reconsideration of the decision, without success.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this recourse.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner reiterates its contention that Explanatory Bulletin
No. 86-12 issued by Secretary Augusto S. Sanchez, as well as the opinion dated
17 November 1987 of Director Augusto G. Sanchez rendered upon request of
respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">union, are void and without
force and effect. Petitioner contends that Explanatory Bulletin No. 86-12 runs
counter to Section 2 (b) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations Relating to
P.D. No. 851, quoted earlier. Petitioner insists also that Explanatory Bulletin
No. 86-12 was in any case rendered ineffective by Item No. 4 (a) of the
"Revised Guidelines on the Implementation of the 13th Month Pay"
issued by Secretary Franklin M. Drilon on 16 November 1987, which Item provides
in part as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"4.  <u>Amount and
payment of 13th Month Pay</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>(a)  MINIMUM AMOUNT - The
minimum 13th month pay required by law shall not be less than 1/12 of the total
basic salary earned by an employee within a calendar year. For the year 1987,
the computation of the 13th month pay shall include the cost of living
allowance (COLA) integrated into the basic salary of a covered employee
pursuant to Executive Order 178.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x</blockquote>

<blockquote>The "<u>basic salary" of an employee for the purpose of
computing the 13th month pay</u> shall include all remunerations or earning
paid by this employer for services rendered but <u>does not include allowances
and monetary benefits which are not considered or integrated as part of the </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">regular o</span>r basic salary</u>, such as
the cash equivalent of unused vacation and sick leave credits, overtime,
premium, night differential and holiday pay, and cost of living allowances.
However, these salary-related benefits should be included as part of the basic
salary in the computation of the 13th month pay if by individual or collective
agreement, company practice or policy, the same are treated as part of the
basic salary of the employees." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioner thus reads the above
provisions as expressly excluding sales or incentive commissions from the coverage
of "basic salary" for purposes of computing 13th month pay.
Petitioner also denies that it had any company policy treating said commissions
as part of its salemen's fixed or basic salary. Petitioner asserts that neither
P.D. No. 851 nor the amendatory Memorandum Order No. 28 expressly or impliedly
considered "commissions" as part of "basic salary" for
purposes of computing the 13th month pay due to its salesmen. Accordingly,
petitioner insists that Explanatory Bulletin No. 86-12 constituted an invalid
expansion of the scope of P.D. No. 851, as well as Memorandum Order No. 28.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petition must fail.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the first place, Article 97 (f) of the Labor Code defines the
term "wage" (which is equivalent to "salary," as used in
P.D. No. 851 and Memorandum Order No. 28) in the following terms:</p>

<blockquote>"(f)  '<u>Wage</u>'
paid to any employee <u>shall mean</u> the <u>remuneration or earnings, however
designated,</u> capable of being expressed in terms of money, whether fixed or
ascertained on a time, task, piece, or <u>commission basis</u>, or other method
of calculating the same, which is, <u>payable</u> by an employer to an employee
under a written or unwritten contract of employment <u>for work done or to be
done, or for services rendered or to be rendered</u>, and includes the fair and
reasonable value, as determined by the Secretary of Labor, of board, lodging,
or other facilities customarily furnished by the employer to the employee.
'Fair and reasonable value' shall not include any profit to the employer or to
any person affiliated with the employer." (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">In the instant case, there is no question
that the sales commissions earned by salesmen who make or close a sale of
duplicating machines distributed by petitioner corporation, constitute part of
the compensation or remuneration paid to salesmen for serving as salesmen, and
hence as part of the "wage" or "salary" of petitioner's
salesmen. Indeed, it appears that petitioner pays its salesmen a small fixed or
guaranteed wage; the greater part of the salemen's wages or salaries being
composed of the sales or incentive commissions earned on actual sale closed by
them. No doubt this particular salary structure was intended for the benefit of
petitioner corporation, on the apparent assumption that thereby its salesmen
would be moved to greater enterprise and diligence and close more sales in the
expectation of increasing their sales commissions. This, however, does not
detract from the character of such commissions as part of the salary or wage
paid to each of its salesmen for rendering services to petitioner corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The term "basic salary" used in P.D. No. 851 and
Memorandum Order No. 28 is not to be confused with the term "fixed or
guaranteed wage." The term "basic salary" is used to distinguish
wage or salary from "<u>fringe benefits</u>" which are <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">not</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> </span>integrated into "basic salary" for certain specific
purposes. In <u>San Miguel Corporation v. Inciong</u>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a> the
catch-all phrase "allowances" and "monetary benefits" which
are deemed not considered or integrated as part of "basic salary" was
construed to refer to "any and all additions which may be in the form of
allowances or 'fringe' benefits." These fringe benefits include payments
for sick leave, vacation leave or maternity leave; premium pay for work
performed on rest day and special holidays; premium pay for regular holidays
and night differential pay; and cost of living allowances.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a> Sales
commissions form part of the "wage" or "salary" of salesmen
and are <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">not</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>in the nature of an
"allowance" or "additional fringe" benefit. Once more, we
note that in the instant case, sales commissions form the bulk of the salaries
or wages of petitioner's salesmen.</p>

<p class="BODY">This Court has had prior occasion to consider the nature of
commissions earned by salesmen. In <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Songco
v. National Labor Relations Commission</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>the Court was called upon to
determine whether earned sales commissions should be included in the monthly or
fixed salaries of petitioners for purposes of computing their separation pay.
The Court, in declaring that sales commissions must be included in the salary
base of salesmen for purposes of computing separation pay, stressed that:</p>

<blockquote>" <u>'Salary</u>,' the etymology of which is the Latin word
'salarium,' <u>is often used interchangeably with 'wage</u>,' the etymology of
which is the Middle English word 'wagen.' <u>Both words generally refer to one
and the same meaning</u>, that is, <u>a</u><i><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt"> </span></u></i><u>reward or recompense for services performed</u>.  Likewise, 'pay' is the synonym of 'wages'
and 'salary' (Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Ed.).  <u>Inasmuch as the words 'wages,' 'pay' and 'salary' have the same
meaning, and commission is included in the definition of 'wage,' the logical
conclusion, therefore, is, in the computation of the separation pay of
petitioners, their salary base should include also their earned sales  commissions</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:
2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x
x x<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>We agree with the Solicitor General that granting, <u>in gratia
argumenti</u>, that the commissions were in the form of incentives or
encouragement, so that the petitioners would be inspired to put a little more
industry on the jobs particularly assigned to them, <u>still these commissions
are direct remunerations for services rendered which contributed to the
increase of  income of Zuellig.
Commission is the recompense, compensation or reward of</u> an agent, <u>salesman</u>,
executor, trustees, receiver, factor, broker or bailee, when the same is
calculated as a percentage on the amount of his transactions or on the profit
to the principal (Black's Law Dictionary, 5th Ed., citing Weiner v. Swales, 217
Md. 123, 141 A. 2d 749, 750).  <u>The
nature of the work of a salesman and the reason for </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">such </span>type of remuneration for services
rendered demonstrate clearly that commissions are part of petitioners' wage or
salary</u>. x x x."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the second place, contrary to petitioner's contention, P.D.
No. 851 in defining the term "basic salary" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">did <u>not</u></span> exclude from the ambit thereof sales commissions
which are paid along with fixed or guaranteed wages. As pointed out above, what
Section 2(b) of the Implementing Rules and Regulations Implementing P.D. No.
851 excluded from the scope of "basic salary" were
"profit-sharing payments and all allowances and monetary benefits which
are not considered or integrated as part of the regular or basic salary of the
employees x x x," which properly refer to "fringe benefits."</p>

<p class="BODY">In the third place, both the opinion rendered by Director Augusto
G. Sanchez and the Explanatory Bulletin No. 86-12 issued by Secretary August S.
Sanchez, constitute contemporaneous administrative construction of the meaning
of the term "basic salary," and the two (2) issuances construed the
term "basic salary" as embracing both fixed or guaranteed wage and
sales commissions.  As long ago as 1903,
this Court stressed that</p>

<blockquote>"the principle that the
contemporaneous construction of a statute by the executive officers of the government,
whose duty it is to execute it, is entitled to great respect, and should
ordinarily control and construction of the statute by the courts, is so firmly
embedded in our jurisprudence that no authorities need be cited to support
it."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, it must be noted that the construction given by Director
Sanchez and Secretary Sanchez was adopted and reiterated by Secretary Franklin
M. Drilon in promulgating, on 16 November 1987, the "Revised Guidelines on
the Implementation of the 13th Month Pay Law." Item No. 5 (a) of these
Revised Guidelines, which petitioner corporation has curiously chosen to
ignore, while citing Item No. 4 (a) of the same Guidelines, reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"5.  <u>13th Month Pay
for Certain Types of Employees</u>.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">(a)  <u>Employees Paid by
Results</u>. -- Employees who are paid on piece work basis are by law entitled
to the 13th month pay.</p>

<p class="2Q">Employees who are paid a fixed or guaranteed wage plus commission
are also entitled to the <u>mandated 13th month pay, based</u> <u>on their
total earnings during the calendar year</u>, i.e., <u>on both their fixed or
guaranteed wage and commission</u>.</p>

<blockquote>x x x<span style="mso-tab-count:3">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x

x"</blockquote>

<blockquote>(Emphases supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To recapitulate, the 13th month pay of employees paid a fixed or
guaranteed wage <u>plus</u> sales commissions must be equivalent to one-twelfth
(1/12) of the total earnings (fixed or guaranteed wage-<u>cum</u>-sales
commissions) during the calendar year. Considering that petitioner has excluded
from the computation of the 13th month pay the sales commissions earned by its
individual salesmen, we believe and so hold that petitioner must be held liable
to pay for the deficiency.</p>
