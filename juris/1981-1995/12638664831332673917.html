<blockquote><span class="GramE">"On </span><st1:date year="1968" day="4" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 4, 1968</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">,
plaintiff Jose E. <span class="SpellE">Pagsibigan</span>, then vice-president and
general manager of <span class="SpellE">Rentokil</span> (<span class="SpellE">Phils</span>.)</span>
Inc., a local firm dealing in insecticides, pesticides and related services
appurtenant thereto, purchased a plane ticket for a Manila-Taipei-<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>-Manila flight from the <span class="SpellE">Transaire</span>
Travel Agency.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The said agency, through
its <span class="SpellE">Cecille</span> Baron, contacted the Manila Hotel branch
of defendant Philippine Air Lines which at that time was a sales and ticketing
agent of defendant China Air Lines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On
June 6, 1968, PAL, through its ticketing clerk defendant Roberto <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, cut and issued CAL Ticket No. 017991 for a
Manila-Taipei-<span class="SpellE">Hongkong</span>-Manila flight.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>According to the plane ticket, the plaintiff
was booked on CAL CI Flight No. 812 to depart from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
for <st1:city><st1:place>Taipei</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1968</st1:date> at 1720 hours (<st1:time minute="20" hour="17">5:20 p.m.</st1:time>), Exhibit A.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1968</st1:date>,
one hour before the scheduled time of the flight as stated in his ticket, the
plaintiff arrived at the airport to check in for CI Flight No. 812.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arriving at the airport, the plaintiff
was informed that the plane he was supposed to take for <st1:city><st1:place>Taipei</st1:place></st1:city>
had left at <st1:time minute="20" hour="10">10:20</st1:time> in the morning of
that day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PAL employees at the
airport made appropriate arrangements for the plaintiff to take <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> flight to <st1:city><st1:place>Taipei</st1:place></st1:city>
the following day, <st1:date year="1968" day="11" month="6">June 11, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff took said flight and arrived in
<st1:city><st1:place>Taipei</st1:place></st1:city> around noontime of the said
date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1968" day="8" month="7">July 8, 1968</st1:date>,
the plaintiff, through counsel, made formal demand on defendant PAL for moral
damages in not less than P125<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for what the
plaintiff allegedly suffered as a result of his failure to take the flight as
stated in his plane ticket.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Exhibit E)
After a series of negotiations among the plaintiff, PAL and CAL failed to reach
an amicable settlement, the plaintiff instituted this action in the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, on <st1:date year="1969" day="22" month="9">September 22, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his complaint, plaintiff prays for the
recovery of P125<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as moral damages and
P25,000.00 for and as attorney's fees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The moral damages allegedly arose from the gross negligence of defendant
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> in stating on the plane tic<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">k</span>et that the time of departure was
1720 hours, instead of 1020 hours which was the correct time of departure in
the revised summer schedule of <st1:state><st1:place>CAL</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff claims that by reason of his
failure to take the plane, he suffered besmirched reputation, embarrassment,
mental anguish, wounded feelings and sleepless nights, inasmuch as when he went
to the airport, he was accompanied by his business associates, close friends
and relatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He further averred that
his trip to <st1:city><st1:place>Taipei</st1:place></st1:city> was for the
purpose of conferring with a certain <span class="SpellE">Peng</span> <span class="SpellE">Siong</span> Lim, president of the Union Taiwan Chemical
Corporation, scheduled at <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 a.m.</st1:time> on

<blockquote>"Defendant Philippine Air Lines alleges in its answer that the
departure time indicated by <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> in the ticket
was furnished and confirmed by the reservation office of defendant China Air
Lines.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It further avers that CAL had not
informed <span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> Manila Hotel Branch of the revised
schedule of its flight, nor provided it with revised timetable:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that when the travel agency sought to
purchase the ticket for the plaintiff on CAL CI Flight No. 812 for June 10,
1968, <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> who was then the ticketing clerk on
duty, checked with the reservation office of CAL on the availability of space,
the date and the time of said flight; that <span class="SpellE">CAL's</span> Dory
Chan informed <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> that the departure time of
Flight No. 812 on June 10, 1968 was at <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">5:20
</span>in the afternoon of said date.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>PAL asserted a cross-claim against <st1:state><st1:place>CAL</st1:place></st1:state>
for attorney's fees and for reimbursement of whatever amount the court may
adjudge PAL to be liable to the plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> adopted the defenses of his
co-defendant PAL.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“Defendant China Air Lines, for its part, disclaims liability for
the negligence and incompetence of the employees of PAL.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It avers that it had revised its schedule
since April 1, 1968, the same to be effective on April 20, 1968, and the said
revised schedule was adopted only after proper petition with and approval of
the Civil Aeronautics Board of which all airlines, including defendant PAL,
were notified; that both printed copies of the international timetable and of
the mimeographed notices of the official schedule and flight departure
schedules were distributed to all its sales agents, including PAL; that after
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the new time schedules.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">PAL's</span> Manila Hotel
office had been issuing and selling tickets based on the revised time schedule;
and that, assuming that the plaintiff is entitled to reco<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">v</span>er damages, the liability is on PAL
and not on <st1:state><st1:place>CAL</st1:place></st1:state>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A cross-claim was likewise asserted by <st1:state><st1:place>CAL</st1:place></st1:state>
against its co?defendant PAL.<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>"After due trial, the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered
judgment laying the blame for the erroneous entry in the ticket as to the time
of departure to defendant Roberto <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, ticketing
agent of defendant PAL, and that no employee of CAL contributed to such
erroneous entry.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was further ruled
that the plaintiff had no reason to claim moral damages but may be entitled to
recover exemplary damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the decision makes the following

<p class="BODY">From said decision of the court below, all the parties, except
China Air Lines, Ltd. appealed to respondent court which, however, sustained
the ruling of the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">denying <span class="SpellE">Pagsibigan's</span> claim for moral damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It concluded that Roberto <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>
did </span>not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">act with malice or in
bad faith in making a wrong entry of the time of departure on the ticket, and
that the mistake committed by <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> appears to be
an honest one done in good faith.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Respondent court also ruled out the claim for exemplary damages
for lack of legal basis.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, as
earlier noted, it awarded <span class="SpellE">Pagsibigan</span> P20<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> as nominal damages, under Article 2221 of the Civil
Code, for the vindication of a legal wrong committed against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the liability of the parties, respondent <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">court held:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"There can be little question as to the liability of PAL and <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> for the damage caused to the plaintiff due to the
erroneous entry in the plane ticket made by the latter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They seek to justify the erroneous statement
as to the time of departure on the ground that such was the time given by Dory
Chan to <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> when the latter called up for the
reservation in favor of plaintiff.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Aside
from the fact that Dory Chan had vigorously disclaimed having given such
information to <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>, We are convinced that, as
the trial court had found, <st1:state><st1:place>CAL</st1:place></st1:state>
had no share in the error committed by <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> in
indicating the time of departure of Flight No. 812.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PAL had shown through the testimony of Carmen
<span class="SpellE">Ibazeta</span> <span class="SpellE">Gallaga</span>, ticket
representative of PAL at the Manila Hotel Office, that they received circulars
and timetables of airlines in the PAL main office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It further appears that on two occasions,
defendant PAL cut and issued tickets for <st1:state><st1:place>CAL</st1:place></st1:state>
based on the new schedule even before <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="6">June
 10, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a matter of
fact, the other entries of time departures in the ticket issued to the plaintiff
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">are </span>in accordance with the
revised schedule, and that the only error therein was with respect to the
departure from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> on <st1:date year="1968" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1968</st1:date>.<span style="font-size:

qualification, what is sought to be imposed is the direct and primary liability
of PAL as an employer under said Article 2180.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">When an injury is caused by the negligence of an employee, there
instantly <span class="GramE">arises</span> a presumption of law that there was

selection.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption, however, may

<p class="BODY">Hence, to escape <span class="SpellE">solidary</span> liability for
the quasi-<span class="SpellE">delict</span> committed by <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span>,
it is imperative that PAL must adduce sufficient proof that it exercised such
degree of care.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>PAL<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> failed to overcome the presumption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As found by respondent court, CAL had revised

selling tickets based on the revised time schedule before June 10, 1968.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">PAL'S main defense is that it is only an agent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As a general proposition, an agent who duly
acts as such is not personally liable to third persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, there are admitted exceptions, as in

committed by his <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent court found that the mistake committed by <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> was done in good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While there is no evidence that he acted with
malice, we can not entirely condone his actuations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an employee of PAL, the nature of his
functions requires him to observe for the protection of the interests of
another person that degree of care, precaution <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and vigilance which the circumstances justly demand.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He</span> committed a clear neglect of duty.</p>

<p class="BODY">Ergo, for his negligence, <span class="SpellE">Espiritu</span> is
primarily liable to respondent <span class="SpellE">Pagsibigan</span> under
Article 2176 of the Civil Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the
failure of PAL to rebut the legal presumption <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

also primarily liable under Article 2180 of the same code which explicitly
provides that employers shall be liable for the damages caused by their
