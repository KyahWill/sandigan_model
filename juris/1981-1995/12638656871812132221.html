				<BR><STRONG>GRINO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal of the petitioner from the decision of the
Court of Appeals dated <st1:date year="1987" day="23" month="9">September 23,
 1987</st1:date> in CA-G.R. CV No. 04196, affirming the decision of the trial
court which dismissed, for being premature, the complaint for partition and
accounting with damages which the petitioner filed on <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1978</st1:date> against her step-mother, <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> Paler <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span> (her father's second wife) and her eight (8)
step-brothers and sisters involving the properties left by her father, the late
Pedro N. <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span>, who died intestate on June 2,
1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner alleged that she
has not received her lawful share and participation in the estate of her father
which is in the possession of, administered, and enjoyed by her step-mother and
her children.</p>

<p class="BODY">In their answer to her complaint, the defendants denied the
allegation that Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span> left no debts because
the truth is that he had borrowed P32<span class="GramE">,000</span> from various
banks to finance a long litigation over properties of some 166 hectares which
he had acquired through a sales patent from the Bureau of Lands.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those lands, bordering the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> River, were at that time the subject of several cases
(filed by several claimants) which had been consolidated and are, according to
the defendants, docketed and pending in the Court of Appeals as CA-G.R. No.
56855-R, and otherwise known as the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendants further alleged that the
action for partition is premature because on <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="8">August 5, 1975</st1:date>, <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> and <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span> Paler <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span> signed an agreement whereby <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span>
agreed not to demand the delivery of her 1/11 share of her father's estate
until after the termination of the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case because
the income from her father's other properties would be used to pay the expenses
of the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case as the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>
lands were <span class="GramE">in</span> the possession of their
adversaries.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial court and the
Court of Appeals held that petitioner is bound by that agreement which,
"not being contrary to law, morals, good customs, public policy or public
order is regarded as the law between the parties thereto (Castro vs. Court of
Appeals, 99 SCRA 722; <span class="SpellE">Escano</span> vs. Court of Appeals,
100 SCRA 197)." <span class="GramE">(p. 20, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>.)</span>
The Court of Appeals further observed:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> The
terms of such contract and rationale behind them being clear, the literal
meaning of such stipulations controls and governs (<span class="SpellE">Sy</span>
vs. Court of Appeals, 131 SCRA 116).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Here, the said provision in question is clear and must govern.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The failure of the other co-owners, the children
by the second marriage, the herein co?defendants-<span class="SpellE">appellees</span>
of their mother, to give their imprimatur to such duly executed contract did
not in any way affect its binding effect upon the parties thereto who had
signed and acknowledged the same to be their free and voluntary act and deed,
such as the appellant herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Those who
have not yet signed said agreement are not, of course, precluded from asking
for partition; but to repeat, appellant here who had already inked the same
cannot now escape the effects thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Under Art.</span> 491, New Civil Code of the Philippines, each
co-owner may demand at any time the partition of the thing owned in common,
insofar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">as </span>his share <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">is </span>concerned; but obviously, such right
being for the convenience of the co-owner concerned, she may waive or delay the
exercise of the right to ask for partition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>So there was nothing illegal or in contravention of law in the agreement
entered into by appellant not to partition until after the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>
case shall have come to an end.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Only
after the termination of the said case may an action for partition <span class="GramE">be</span> initiated by the appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As this case <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">was </span>commenced during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case, the trial court was right in ordering
its dismissal on the ground of <span class="SpellE">prematurity</span> in the filing
thereof." (pp. 20-21, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The only issue in this case is whether the Court of Appeals erred
in holding that the petitioner's action for partition is premature.</p>

<p class="BODY">The record shows that on February 9, 1974, a joint decision was
rendered in favor of Pedro <span class="SpellE">Abuton</span> by the Court of
First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Zamboanga</span> del <span class="SpellE">Sur</span>,
Branch I at <span class="SpellE">Pagadian</span> City in the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>

<p class="BODY">Hence, when <span class="SpellE">Felicidad</span> commenced her action
for partition on <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1978</st1:date>,

Court's Second Division denied the petition in a resolution dated <st1:date year="1980" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1980</st1:date> "for having been

<p class="BODY">It seems, however, that besides eliciting this admission from <span class="SpellE">Paciencia</span>, <span class="SpellE">Felicidad's</span> counsel
did nothing more to prove that the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case was
finished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It does not appear that the
decisions of the trial court, the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court in the
<span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case, and the entry of judgment in this Court,
were presented as evidence in the partition case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As observed by the Court of Appeals:</p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The trial court may have inadvertently overlooked
<span class="SpellE">Paciencia's</span> admission that the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>
case was finished, or, it chose to be technical because <span class="SpellE">Felicidad's</span>
complaint for partition was in fact prematurely filed <u>before</u>, not after,
the decision in the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case became final.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For the past ten (10) years, the petitioner
has vainly and stubbornly fought all the way to the Court of Appeals and this
Court to prove that the trial court erroneously ruled that her action for
partition was premature, when what she should have done, after the Supreme
Court entered judgment in the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case on May 28,
1980, was to amend her defective complaint for partition, or file a new one
containing the requisite allegations showing that she had a sufficient cause of
action or that it had accrued.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court and the Court of Appeals did not err in
dismissing the petitioner's complaint for partition for being premature because
when it was filed on <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="2">February 6, 1978</st1:date>,
her cause of action had not yet accrued; at that time the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span>
case was still pending in the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since the termination of the <span class="SpellE">Salug</span> case was a
condition precedent for the filing of said action for partition, non-compliance
with that condition affected the existence of her cause of action (<span class="SpellE">Galuba</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span>, 157 SCRA 627;
Mendoza vs. CA, 19 SCRA 756).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
rendered her complaint defective and subject to dismissal for lack of cause of
action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defect is not cured by the
occurrence of the condition during the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of
the action.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review is denied for lack of
