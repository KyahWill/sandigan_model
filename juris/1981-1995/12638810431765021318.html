themselves orchestrated or allowed to happen) was used by them as an excuse for

Meanwhile, from 2 to 6 August 1988, conflicting reports on the disposition by
the PCGG of the "<span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> corporations"
were carried in various metropolitan newspapers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, one newspaper reported that the <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> firms had not been sequestered because of the
opposition of certain PCGG officials who "had worked previously as lawyers
of the Marcos crony firms." Another daily reported otherwise, while others
declared that on 3 March 1986, or shortly after the EDSA February 1986
revolution, the "<span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> companies" were
sold for P5 million, without PCGG approval, to a holding company controlled by <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>, and that Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>,
the President's brother-in-law, had effectively taken over the firms, even
pending negotiations for the purchase of the corporations, for the same price
of P5 million which was reportedly way below the fair value of their assets.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On 13 September 1988, the Senate Minority Floor Leader, Hon. Juan
Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span> delivered a speech "on a matter of
personal privilege" before the Senate on the alleged "take­over of
SOLOIL Incorporated, the flagship of the First Manila Management of Companies
(FMMC) by Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>" and called upon

Thereafter, the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee started its investigation on the

</span>Petitioner Jose F.S. <span class="SpellE">Bengzon</span>, Jr. likewise

his co-defendants in Civil Case No. 0035 before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.</p>

thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">Before discussing the issues raised by petitioners and <span class="SpellE">intervenor</span>, we will first tackle the jurisdictional
question raised by the respondent Committee.</p>

<p class="BODY">In its comment, respondent Committee claims that this Court
cannot properly inquire into the motives of the lawmakers in conducting
legislative investigations, much less can it enjoin the Congress or any of its
regular and special committees -- like what petitioners seek -- from making
inquiries in aid of legislation, under the doctrine of separation of powers,
which obtains in our present system of government.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is untenable.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Angara</u></span><u> vs. Electoral Commission</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
the Court held:</p>

<blockquote>"The separation of powers is a fundamental principle in our
system of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It obtains not
through express provision but by actual division in our Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each department of <span style="">the government has exclusive cognizance of matters within its
jurisdiction, and is supreme within its own sphere.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But it does not follow from the fact that the
three powers are to be kept separate and distinct that the Constitution
intended them to be absolutely unrestrained and independent of each other.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Constitution has provided for an
elaborate system of checks and balances to secure coordination in the workings
of the various departments of the government.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"But in the main, the Constitution has blocked out with deft
strokes and in bold lines, allotment of power to the executive, the legislative<span style=""> and the judicial departments of the
government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The overlapping and
interlacing of functions and duties between the several depart­ments, however,
sometimes makes it hard to say just where the one leaves off and the other
begins.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In times of social disquietude
or political excitement, the great landmarks of the Constitution are apt to be
forgotten or marred, if </span>not entirely obliterated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In cases of conflict, the judicial department
is the only constitutional organ which can be called upon to determine the
proper allocation of powers between the several departments and among the
integral or constituent units thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span>

<blockquote>The Constitution is a definition of the powers of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Who is to determine the nature, scope and
extent of such powers?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">Constitution itself has provided for the
instrumentality of the judiciary as the rational way.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And when the judiciary mediates to allocate
constitutional boundaries; it does not assert any superiority over the other
departments; it does not in reality nullify or invalidate an act of the
legislature, but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation assigned to it
by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the
Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the rights
which that instrument secures and guarantees to them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in truth all that is involved in what
is termed 'judicial supremacy' which properly is the power of judicial review
under the Consti­tution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even then, this
power of judicial review is limited to actual cases and controversies to be
exercised after full opportunity of argument by the parties, and limited
further to the consti­tutional question raised or the very <span class="SpellE"><u>lis</u></span>
<span class="SpellE"><u>mota</u></span> presented.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any attempt at abstraction could only lead to
dialectics and barren legal questions and to sterile conclusions unrelated to
actualities.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Narrowed as its function
is in this manner, the judiciary does not pass upon questions of wisdom,
justice or expediency of legislation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>More than that, courts accord the presumption of constitutionality to
legislative enactments, not only because the legislature is presumed to abide
by the Constitution but also because the judiciary in the determination of
actual cases and controver­sies must reflect the wisdom and justice of the
people as expressed through their representatives in the executive and
legislative departments of the government."</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The "allocation of constitutional boundaries" is a task
that this Court must perform under the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, as held in a recent case,<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
"(t)he political question doctrine neither interposes an obstacle to
judicial<span style="">&nbsp; </span>determination of the rival
claims.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The jurisdiction to delimit
constitutional boundaries has been given to this Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It cannot abdicate that obligation mandated
by the 1987 Constitution, although said provision by no means does away with
the applicability of the principle in appropriate cases."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is thus of the considered view that it has jurisdiction
over the present controversy for the purpose of determining the scope and
extent of the power of the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee to conduct inquiries
into private affairs in purported aid of legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming to the specific issues raised in this case, petitioners
contend that (1) the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee's inquiry has no valid
legislative purpose, i.e., it is not done in aid of legislation; (2) the sale
or disposition of the <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> corporations is a
"purely private transaction" which is beyond the power of the Senate
Blue Ribbon Committee to inquire into; and (3) the inquiry violates their right
to due process.</p>

<p class="BODY">The 1987 Constitution expressly recognizes the power of both
houses of Congress to conduct inquiries in aid of legis­lation.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, Section 21, Article VI thereof provides:</p>

<blockquote>"The Senate or the House of Representatives or any of its
respective committee may conduct inquiries in aid of legislation in accordance
with <span style="">its duly published rules of
procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The rights of persons

<p class="BODY">A perusal of the speech of Senator <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>
reveals that he (Senator <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>) made a statement
which was published in various newspapers on 2 September 1988 accusing Mr.
Ricardo "Baby" <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> of "having taken
over the FMMC Group of Companies." As a consequence thereof, Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> wrote a letter to Senator <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>
on 4 September 1988 categorically denying that he had "taken over"
the FMMC Group of Companies; that former PCGG Chairman Ramon Diaz himself
categorically stated in a telecast interview by Mr. Luis Beltran on Channel 7
on 31 August 1988 that there has been no takeover by him (<span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>);
and that these repeated alle­gations of a "takeover" on his (<span class="SpellE">Lopa's</span>) part of FMMC are baseless as they are malicious.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> reply prompted Senator <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>, during the session of the Senate on 13 September
1988, to avail of the privilege hour,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> so
that he could respond to the said <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> letter, and
also to vindicate his reputation as a Member of the Senate of the Philippines,
considering the claim of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> that his (<span class="SpellE">Enrile's</span>) charges that he (<span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>)
had taken over the FMMC Group of Companies are "baseless" and
"malicious." Thus, in his speech,<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>

privilege; the privilege being that I received, Mr. President, a letter dated
September 4, 1988, signed by Mr. Ricardo A. <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>,
a.k.a. or Baby <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>, wherein he denies categori­cally

management of SOLOIL in <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span>,
management officials assured him that relatives of the President of the
Philippines were personally discussing and representing SOLOIL so that the
order of sequestration would be lifted and that the new owner was Mr. Ricardo
A. <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Our sequestration work of SOLOIL in <span class="SpellE">Tanauan</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:place> was not heeded by
management because they said another representation was being made to this
Commission for the eventual lifting of <span style="">our
sequestration order.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They even assured
us that Mr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> and <span class="SpellE">Peping</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cojuangco</span> were personally discussing and representing
SOLOIL, so the order of sequestration will finally be lifted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While we attempted to carry on our order,
management refused to cooperate and vehemently turned down our request to make
available to us the records of the company.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In fact it was obviously clear that they will meet us with force the
moment we insist on doing normally our assigned task.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view of the impending threat, and to avoid
any untoward incident we decided to temporarily suspend our work until there is
a more categorical stand of this Commission in view of the seemingly
influential representation being made by SOLOIL for us not to continue our
work.’<o:p></o:p></span></p>

five, which reads as follows, and I quote Mr. President:</blockquote>

our desire is to achieve respectability and stability of the government.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Senator <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>
concluded his privilege speech in the following tenor:</p>

<blockquote>"Mr. President, it may be worthwhile for the Senate to look
into the possible violation of the law in the case particularly with regard to
Republic Act No. 3019, the Anti-Graft and Corrupt <span style="">Practices Act, Section 5 of which reads as follows and I quote:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'Sec. 5. Prohibition on certain relatives. -- It shall be unlawful

of the officials concerned but depends upon compliance with requi­sites
provided by law, nor to any act lawfully performed in an official capacity or
in the exercise of a profession.'<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Mr. President, I have done duty to this Senate and to
myself.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>I leave it to this august Body
to make its own conclusion."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Verily, the speech of Senator <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>
contained no suggestion of contemplated legislation; he merely called upon the
Senate to look into a possible violation of Sec. 5 of RA No. 3019, otherwise
known as "The Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act." In other words,
the purpose of the inquiry to be conducted by respondent Blue Ribbon Committee
was to find out whether or not the relatives of President <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
particularly Mr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>, had violated the law
in connection with the alleged sale of the 36 or 39 corporations belonging to
Benjamin "<span class="SpellE">Kokoy</span>” <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>
to the <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> Group.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There appears to be, therefore, no intended legislation involved.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is also not impressed with the respondent Committee's
argument that the questioned inquiry is to be conducted pursuant to Senate
Resolution No. 212.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said resolution
was introduced by Senator Jose D. <span class="SpellE">Lina</span> in view of the
representations made by leaders of school youth, community groups and youth of
non-governmental organizations to the Senate Committee on Youth and Sports
Development, to look into the charges against the PCGG filed by three (3)
stockholders of Oriental Petroleum, i.e., that it had adopted a
"get-rich-quick scheme" for its nominee-directors in a sequestered
oil, exploration firm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pertinent
portion of Senate Resolution No. 212 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, recent developments have shown that no less than the
Solicitor-General has stated that the PCGG Chairman and at least three
Commissioners should resign and that the agency should rid itself of
'ineptness, incompetence and corruption' and that the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
has reportedly ordered the PCGG to answer charges filed by three stock<span style="">holders of Oriental Petroleum that it had
adopted a 'get-rich-quick scheme' for its nominee-directors in a sequestered
oil exploration firm;<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, leaders of school youth, community groups and youth
of non-governmental organization had made representations to the Senate
Committee on Youth and Sports Development to look into the charges against PCGG
since said agency is a symbol of the changes expected by the people when the
EDSA revolution took place and that the ill-gotten wealth to be recovered will
fund priority projects which will benefit our people such as CARP, free
education in the elementary and secondary levels, reforestation, and employment
generation for rural and urban workers;</blockquote>

<blockquote>"WHEREAS, the government and the present leadership must
demonstrate in their public and private lives integrity, honor and efficient
management of government services lest our youth become disillusioned and lose
hope and return to <span style="">an ideology and form
of government which is repugnant to true freedom, democratic partici­pation and
human rights:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Now, therefore, be it.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Resolved by the Senate, That the activities of the
Presidential Commission on Good Government be investigated by the appropriate
Committee in connection with the implementation of Section 26, Article XVIII of
the Constitution." <a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Thus, the inquiry under Senate Resolution No. 212 is to look into
the charges against the PCGG filed by the three (3) stockholders of Oriental
Petroleum in connection with the implementation of Section 26, Article XVIII of
the Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">It cannot, therefore, be said that the contemplated inquiry on
the subject of the privilege speech of Senator Juan Ponce <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>,
i.e., the alleged sale of the 36 (or 39) corporations belonging to Benjamin
"<span class="SpellE">Kokoy</span>" <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>
to the <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> Group is to be conducted pursuant to
Senate Resolution No. 212, because, firstly, Senator <span class="SpellE">Enrile</span>
did not indict the PCGG, and, secondly, neither Mr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span>
nor the herein petitioners are connected with the government but are private
citizens.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears, therefore, that the contemplated inquiry by
respondent Committee is not really "in aid of legislation" because it
is not related to a purpose within the juris­diction of Congress, since the aim
of the investigation is to find out whether or not the relatives of the
President or Mr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> had violated Section 5
of RA No. 3019, the "Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act", a matter
that appears more within the province of the courts rather than of the
legislature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, the Court may take
judicial notice that Mr. Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> died during the
<span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <u>John</u> <u>T</u>. <u>Watkins</u> <u>vs</u>.

it was held:</p>

laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It includes surveys of defects in our social,
econo­mic, or political system for the purpose of enabling Congress to remedy
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It comprehends probes into

judicial departments of government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>No
inquiry is an end in itself; it must be related to and in furtherance of a
legitimate task of Congress. Investigations conducted solely for the personal
aggrandizement of the investigators or to ‘punish’ those investigated are
indefensible</u>." (underlining supplied)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0.5in;">It can not be overlooked that when
respondent Committee decided to conduct its investigation of the petitioners,
the complaint in Civil Case No. 0035 had already been filed with the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A
perusal of that complaint shows that one of its principal causes of action
against herein petitioners, as defendants therein, is the alleged sale of the
36 (or 39) corporations belonging to Benjamin "<span class="SpellE">Kokoy</span>"
<span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Since the issues in said complaint had long been joined by the filing of
petitioners' respective answers thereto, the issue sought to be investigated by
the respondent Committee is one over which jurisdiction had been acquired by
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In short, the issue has been pre-empted by that court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To allow the respondent Committee to conduct
its own investigation of an issue already before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>
would not only pose the possibility of conflicting judgments between a
legislative committee and a judicial tribunal, but if the Committee's judgment
were to be reached before that of the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
the possibility of its influence being made to bear on the ultimate judgment of
the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span> can not be discounted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In fine, for the respondent Committee to probe and inquire into
the same <span class="SpellE">justiciable</span> controversy already before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>, would be an encroachment into the exclusive

<p class="BODY">Now to another matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It

This right construed as the right to remain completely silent may be availed of
by the accused in a criminal case; but it may be invoked by other witnesses
only as questions are asked of them.</p>

the Court reiterated the doctrine in <u>Cabal vs. <span class="SpellE">Kapunan</span></u><span style="">&nbsp; </span>(6 SCRA 1059) to <span class="SpellE">illustate</span>
the right of witnesses to invoke the right against self-incrimination not only

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><span style="text-transform: uppercase;">dissenting Opinion<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ,<i> J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I regret I am unable to give <span style="">my </span>concurrence.  I do not
agree that the investigation being conducted by the Blue Ribbon Committee is
not in aid of legislation.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Arnault v. Nazareno, 87 Phil. 29, this Court observed that “we
are bound to presume that the action of the legislative body was with a
legitimate object if it is capable of being so construed, and we have no right
to assume that the contrary was intended.  (People <u>ex</u> <u>rel</u>. McDonald vs. Keeler, 99 N.Y. 463; 52 Am.
Rep., 49; 2 N.E., 615, quoted with approval by the U.S. Supreme Court in
McGrain vs. Daugherty, 273 U.S. 135).  As far <span style="">as </span>I know, that is
still the rule today.</p>

<p class="BODY">More importantly, the presumption is supported by the established
facts.  The inquiry is sustainable as <span style="">an </span>implied power of the legislature and
even <span style="">as </span>expressly limited by the
Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inquiry deals with alleged manipulations of public funds and
illicit acquisitions of properties now being claimed by the PCGG for the
Republic of the Philippines.  The
purpose of the Committee is to ascertain if <span style="">and </span>how such anomalies have been committed.  It is settled that the legislature has a
right to investigate the disposition of the public funds it has appropriated;
indeed, “an inquiry into the expenditure of all public money is an
indispensable duty of the legislature.” Moreover, an investigation of a
possible violation of a law may be useful in the drafting of amendatory
legislation to correct or strengthen that law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <u>ponencia</u> quotes lengthily from Senator Enrile's speech
and concludes that it “contained no suggestion of contemplated legislation; he
merely called upon the Senate to look into a possible violation of Section 5 of
R.A. No. 3019.” However, according to McGrain v. Daugherty, <u>supra:</u></p>

<blockquote>Primarily, the purpose for which legislative inquiry and
investigation is pursued is to serve as an aid in legislation.  Through it, the legislature is able to
obtain facts or data in aid of proposed legislation.  However, <u>it is not absolutely necessary that the resolution
ordering an investigation should in terms expressly state that the object of
the inquiry is to obtain data in aid of proposed legislation</u>.  It is enough that such purpose appears from
a consideration of the entire proceedings or one in which legislation could be
had and would be materially aided by the information which the investigation
was calculated to elicit.  <u>An express
avowal of the object would be better, but such is not indispensable</u>.  (Emphasis supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners' contention that the questioned investigation
would compel them to reveal their defense in the cases now pending against them
in the Sandiganbayan is untenable.  They
know or should know that they cannot be compelled to answer incriminating
questions.  The case of Chavez v. Court
of Appeals, 24 SCRA 663, where we held that an accused may refuse at the outset
to take the stand on the ground that the questions to be put by the prosecutor
will tend to incriminate <span style="">him is, </span>of
course, not applicable to them.  They
are not facing criminal charges before the Blue Ribbon Committee.  Like any ordinary witness, they can invoke
the right against self-incrimination only when and as the incriminating
question is propounded.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">While it </span>is true<span style=""> </span>that the Court is now allowed more <span style="">leeway in reviewing the traditionally
political acts </span><span style="">of </span>the <span style="">legislative and executive departments, </span>the
power must be exercised with the <span style="">utmost
</span>circumspection lest we unduly trench on their prerogatives and
disarrange the constitutional separation of powers.  That power <span style="">is </span>available
to us only if there is a clear showing of a grave abuse of discretion, which I
do not see in the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY">Guided <span style="">by the presumption
and the </span>facts, I vote to <span style="">D</span>ISMISS
the petition.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">DISSENTING OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">GUTIERREZ, JR., <i>J.</i>:</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">I regret that I must
express a strong dissent to the Court’s opinion in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is asserting a power which I believe we do not
possess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are encroaching on the turf
of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are prohibiting the
Senate from proceeding with a constitutionally vested function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We are stopping the Senate Blue Ribbon
Committee from exercising a legislative prerogative - investigations in aid of
legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We do so because <span style="">we </span>somehow feel that the purported aim
is not the real purpose.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court has no power to second guess the motives behind an act
of a House of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither can we
substitute our judgment for its judgment on a matter specifically given to it
by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The scope of the
legislative power is broad.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
encompasses <span style="">practically every aspect of
human or corporate behavior capable of regulation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>How can this Court say that unraveling the
tangled and secret skeins behind the acquisition by Benjamin "<span class="SpellE">Kokoy</span>" <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span> of 39
corporations under the past regime and their sudden sale to the <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> Group at the outset of the new dispensation </span>will
<span style="">not result in useful legislation?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The power of either House
of Congress to conduct investigations is inherent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It needs no textual grant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As stated in <span class="SpellE">Arnault</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Nazareno</span>, 87 Phil. 29 (1950)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Our form of government being patterned after the American
system - the framers of our Constitution having drawn largely from American
institutions and practices - we can, in this case, properly draw also from
American precedents in interpreting analogous provisions of our Constitution,
as we have done in other cases in the past.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Although there is no provision in the Constitution expressly
investing either House of Congress with power to make investigations and exact
testimony to the end that it may exercises its legislative functions <span class="SpellE">advisely</span> and effectively, such power is so far incidental
to the legislative function as to be implied.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In other words, the power of inquiry - with process to enforce it - is
an essential and appropriate auxiliary to the legislative function.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A legislative body cannot legislate wisely or
effectively in the absence of information respecting the conditions which the
legislation is intended to affect <span style="">or </span>change;
and where the legislative body does not itself possess the requisite
information - which is not infrequently true - recourse must be had to others
who do possess it." xxx (At p. 45)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The framers of the
present Constitution were not </span><span style="">content
</span>to <span style="">leave the power inherent,
incidental </span>or <span style="">implied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The power is </span><span style="">now </span><span style="">expressed as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 21.</span><span style="">&nbsp; </span>- The Senate or the House <span style="">of </span>Representatives or any of its
respective committees may conduct inquiries in aid of in accordance with its
duly published rules of procedure.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
rights of persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries shall <span style="">be </span><span style="">respected."<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Apart from the formal requirement of publishing the rules of
procedure, I agree <span style="">that </span>there
are three queries <span style="">which, if answered in
the affirmative, may give us cause to intervene.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">First, is the matter being investigated one on which no valid
legislation could possibly be enacted?</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Second, is Congress
encroaching on terrain which the Constitution has reserved as the exclusive
domain of another branch of government?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">And third, is Congress violating the basic liberties of an
individual?</p>

<p class="BODY">The classic formulation of the power of the Court to interpret the
meaning of "in aid of legislation" is <span style="">expressed in <span class="SpellE">Kilbourn</span> v. Thompson, 103 U.S.
168 (1880).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The House of
Representatives passed a resolution creating a committee to investigate the
financial relations between Jay Cooke and Co., a depositary of federal funds
and a real estate pool.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A debtor of Jay
Cooke and Co. <span class="SpellE">Kilbourn</span>, general manager of the pool
refused to answer questions put to him by the Committee and to produce certain
books and papers.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, he was
ordered jailed for forty-five days. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>He</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">brought
an action for false imprisonment and the Supreme Court decided in his favor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;"><span style="">Speaking
through Justice Miller, the Court ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The resolution adopted as a sequence of this preamble
contains no hint of any intention <span style="">of </span>final
action by Congress on the subject.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
all the argument <span style="">of </span>the case no
suggestion has been made of what the House of Representatives or the Congress
could have done in the <span style="">way </span>of
remedying the wrong or securing the creditors of Jay <span style="">Cooke </span>and Co., or even the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United
  States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><span style="">Was </span>it to be simply a
fruitless investigation into the personal affairs of individuals?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If so the House of Representatives had no
power or authority in the matter more than any other equal number of gentlemen
interested for the government of their country.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>By fruitless we mean that it could result in no valid legislation on the
subject to which the inquiry referred." (<span class="SpellE">Kilbourn</span>
v. Thompson, id. at page 388)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The <span class="SpellE"><u>Kilbourn</u></span>
decision is, however, circa 1880.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
world has turned over many times since that era.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The same court which validated separate but
equal facilities against charges of racial discrimination and ruled that a
private contract may bar improved labor standards </span><span style="">and </span><span style="">social justice legislation has reversed itself on these and many other
questions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

express terms of the Senate resolution directing the investigation of a former
Attorney General for non-<span class="SpellE">feasance</span>, misfeasance, and
malfeasance in office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It </span><u>presumed</u>

manifest when it is <span style="">reflected </span>that
the functions of the Department of Justice, the powers and duties of the
Attorney-General and the duties of his assistants, are all subject to
regulation by congressional legislation, and that the department is maintained
and its activities are on under such carried appropriations as in the judgment
of Congress are needed from year to year.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The only legitimate object the Senate could have <span style="">in </span>ordering the investigation was <span style="">to </span>aid it in legislating, and we think
the subject matter was such<span style=""> </span>that

contained no avowal, but disclosed that it definitely related to the
administration of public <span style="">office </span>the
duties of which were subject to legislative regulation, the court said (pp.
485, 487):<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘Where public institutions
under the control of the State are ordered to be investigated, it is generally
with the view of some legislative action respecting them, and the same may be
said in respect of public officers,’ And again ‘<u>We</u> <u>are</u> <u>bound</u>

<p class="BODY">The <span style="">even </span>broader <span style="">scope </span>of legislative investigations in
the Philippine context is explained by a member of the Constitutional
Commission.</p>

<blockquote>The requirement that the investigation be ‘in <span style="">aid </span>of legislation’ is an essential
element for establishing the jurisdiction of the legislative body.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is, however, a requirement which is not
difficult to satisfy because, unlike in the United States, where legislative
power is shared by the United States Congress and the state legislatures, the
totality of legislative power is possessed by the Congress and its legislative
field is well-nigh unlimited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘It would
be difficult to define any limits by which the subject matter of its inquiry
can be bounded.’ (<u>Supra</u>, at p. 46) Moreover, it is not necessary that
every question propounded to a witness must be material to a proposed
legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>‘In other words, the
materiality of the question must be determined by its direct relation to the
subject of the inquiry and not by its indirect relation to <span style="">any </span>proposed or possible legislation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reason is that the necessity or <span style="">lack </span>of necessity for legislative
action <span style="">and </span>the form and character
of the action itself are determined by the sum total of the information <span style="">to </span>be gathered as a result of the
investigation, and not by a fraction of such information elicited from a single
question.’ (<st1:state><st1:place>Id.</st1:place></st1:state> at 48)</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the basis of this interpretation of what ‘in aid of legislation’
means, it can readily be seen that the phrase contributes practically nothing
towards protecting witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Practically any investigation can be in <span style="">aid </span>of the broad legislative power of Congress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The limitation, therefore cannot effectively
prevent what <span class="SpellE">Kilbourn</span> v. Thompson (103 U.S. 168
[1880]) characterized as ‘roving commissions’ or what Watkins v. <st1:country-region><st1:place>United

Vol. II. 1st Ed., page 132).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above principles to the present case, it can readily
be seen that the Senate is investigating an area where it may potentially
legislate.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The ease <span style="">with which relatives of the President were
allegedly able to amass great wealth </span>under <span style="">the past regime </span>is <span style="">a
legitimate area of inquiry.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And if we
tack on the alleged attempts of relatives of a succeeding administration to
duplicate the feat, the need for remedial legislation becomes more imperative.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

determine conflicting claims of authority.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It is indeed the function of this Court to allocate constitutional
boundaries but in the exercise of this "umpire" function we have to </span>take
<span style="">care that we do not keep any of the
three great departments of government from performing functions peculiar to
each department or specifically </span>vested <span style="">to it by the Constitution.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When
a power is vested, it carries with it everything legitimately needed to
exercise it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It may be argued that the

</span>The aim is to arrive at policy determinations which may or may not be

the Committee can recommend to Congress how the situation which enabled
get-rich-quick schemes to flourish may be remedied.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the subjects of the

Congress to investigate for its own purposes.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">I submit that the filing of indictments or <span class="SpellE">informations</span>

stop the progress of legislative investigations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The other ground which I consider the more important one is where
the legislative investigation violates the liberties of the witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Constitution expressly provides that "the rights of
persons appearing in or affected by such inquiries shall be respected."</p>

<p class="BODY">It should be emphasized that the constitutional restriction does
not call for the banning or prohibition of investigations where a violation of <span style="">a </span>basic right is claimed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It only requires that in the course of the
proceedings, the right of persons should be <u>respected</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">What the majority opinion mandates is a blanket prohibition
against <span style="">a </span>witness testifying at
all, simply because he is already facing charges before the <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To my mind, the Constitution allows him to
interpose objections whenever an incriminating question is posed or when he is
compelled to reveal his court defenses, but not to refuse to take the witness
stand completely.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE"><u>Arnault</u></span> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Nazareno</u></span>, supra, illustrates the reticence, with
which the court views petitions to curtail legislative investigations even
where an invocation of individual liberties is made.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>Arnault</u></span>, the entire country
already knew the name of the presidential relative whom the Senate was trying
to link to the <span class="SpellE">Tambobong-Buenavista</span> estates

when <span class="SpellE">Arnault</span> refused to answer specific questions

indefinite visit until the name which the Senate wanted him to utter was
extracted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only when the imprisonment
became unreasonably prolonged and the situation in Congress had changed was he
released.</p>

<p class="BODY">I <span style="">agree </span>with the respondents that the sale of 39 <span class="SpellE">Romualdez</span>
corporations <span style="">to </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Lopa</span> is not <span style="">a </span>purely
private transaction into which the Senate may not inquire.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this were so, much of the work of the

illegally acquired wealth would be negated.<span style="">&nbsp;
