				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petition for <i>certiorari</i> seeking to set aside and annul the
decision, dated November 22, 1982, of public respondent National
Telecommunications Commission (NTC, for short), approving the application of
the Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT, for short) of its revised
schedule for its Subscriber Investment Plan (SIP) for the entire service area,
including the ex-RETELCO area; as well as the order of January 14, 1983 which
denied the motion for reconsideration of petitioner Philippine Consumers
Foundation, Inc. (PCFI, for short).</p>

<p class="BODY">Records show that on <st1:date year="1980" day="20" month="3">March
 20, 1980</st1:date>, private respondent PLDT filed an application with the NTC
for the approval of a revised schedule for its Subscriber Investment Plan
(SIP), docketed as Case No. 82-27.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 14, 1982, the NTC issued an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
order provisionally approving the revised schedule which, however, was set
aside by this Court on August 31, 1982 in the case of "Samuel Bautista vs.
NTC, et al.," 116 SCRA 411.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Court therein ruled that "there was necessity of a hearing by the
Commission before it should have acted on the application of the PLDT so that
the public could air its opposition, particularly the herein petitioner and the
Solicitor General, representing the government.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>They should be given the opportunity to substantiate their objection
that the rates under the subscriber investment plan are excessive and
unreasonable and, as a consequence, the low income and middle class group
cannot afford to have telephone connections; and, that there is no need to
increase the rate because the applicant is financially sound."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="22" month="11">November 22, 1982</st1:date>,
the NTC rendered the questioned decision permanently approving <span class="SpellE">PLDT's</span> new and increased SIP rates, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, this Commission finds that
applicant's reduced proposals for its revised Subscriber Investment Plan
Schedule, upon further reductions herein ordered <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">with respect </span>to subscriber investments for new installations of
single residential telephones in the Metro Manila and Provincial Service Areas,
are all within the 50%-of-cost limit provided in P.D. 217; that they are just
and reasonable and in consonance with the public policies declared in said
decree; and that it is in the public interest that applicant's revised SIP
Schedule be, as it is hereby APPROVED, as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration of the above
judgment on December 14, 1982, and after a month, or on January 14, 1983, NTC
denied said motion for reconsideration.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is the submission of petitioner that the SIP schedule
presented by the PLDT is pre-mature and, therefore, illegal and baseless,
because the NTC has not yet promulgated the required rules and regulations
implementing Section 2 of Presidential Decree No. 217 which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"Section 2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Department of Public Works, Transportation and Communications through its <u>Board
of Communications and/or appropriate agency shall see to it that the herein
declared policies for the telephone industry are immediately implemented and
for this purpose pertinent rules an</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">d</span>
regulations may be promulgated</u> x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>." (Underscoring supplied).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Petitioner avers that the
"substitute procedural vehicle utilized by NTC in allowing the
establishment of SIP by PLDT was by treating the appropriate Petition of PLDT
as if the same were a <u>rate</u> <u>case</u> over which the Rules of Practice
was applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>NTC proceeded to invoke
the summary powers provided for in the Rules of Practice to fully bear on the
hapless consumer, notably the repressive 'Provisional <span class="SpellE">Reliefs</span>;'
(pp. 5-6, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>) that at the hear<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ings thereof, "NTC limited the numerous <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> in the instant Application, among them PCFI, by
applying the two-<span class="SpellE">oppositor</span> rule.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This means that only two of the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span> will be heard in representation of all the <span class="SpellE">oppositors</span>, again pursuant to the procedure laid down in
the Rules of Practice." (p. 130, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>) Further,
the NTC invoked its extraordinary powers pursuant to Section 3 of Rule 15 of
the Rules of Practice, "whereby even without an iota or proof to
substantiate its application, NTC allowed the desired increase purportedly on a
provisional basis." (p. 129, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The question is whether
or not respondent acted with grave abuse of discretion when it approved the
Revised Subscriber Investment Plan (SIP) of respondent PLDT in the absence of
specific rules and regulations implementing Presidential Decree No. 217.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner claims that these implementing
rules and regulations are mandatory pre-requisite for the approval of said SIP
rates.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Respondent NTC admits the
absence of rules and regula­tions referred to in PD 217.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it contends that nowhere in said
decree is there any legal provision making the promulgation of rules a
mandatory pre-requisite to the establishment of SIP and the determination of
its schedules; that since respondent NTC is enjoined to implement the declared
policies of the decree, for its immediate implementation, it may rely on
existing Rules of Practice; that under the same Rules of Practice all existing
subscriber investment plans were presented, considered and approved by the NTC;
that the promulgation of the rules is inherently an internal and administrative
matter and therefore, is not a proper subject of litigation, much less a duty
of the NTC to accomplish; and, that public respondent may or may not promulgate
the rules in the immediate implementation of said decree as the word used there
is "may."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We are not persuaded.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Presidential Decree No.
217 was promulgated on June 16, 1973 and paragraph 4 of Section 1 thereof
provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In line with the objective of spread­ing ownership
among a wide base of the people, the concept of telephone subscriber
self-financing is hereby adopted whereby a <u>telephone subscriber finances
part of the capital investments in telephone installations through the purchase

(Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">There is merit in the

rules and regulations because:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

innovative and untested such that existing substantive and procedural laws
would not be applicable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the
Subscriber Investment Plan (SIP) was so set up precisely to ensure the
financial viability of public telecommunications companies which in turn
assures the enjoyment <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span>the
population at minimum cost the benefits of a telephone facility.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The SIP has never been contemplated prior to P.D. 217.</blockquote>

optimum number of individuals may enjoy telephone service, there is no
limitation on the profitability of such companies.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, while P.D. 217 encourages the
profitability of public telecommunication companies, the Public Service Act
limits the same.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of such rules and regu­lations,
there is outright confusion among the rights of PLDT, the consumers and the
government itself.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As may clearly be
seen, how can the Decision be said to have assured that most of the population
will enjoy telephone facilities?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Did the
Decision likewise assure the financial viability of PLDT?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Was the government's duty to provide
telephone service to its constituents <span class="SpellE">subserved</span> by
the Decision?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These questions can never
be answered unless such rules and regulations arc set up.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"3.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Finally, it should be emphasized that NTC is <span class="SpellE"><u>estopped</u></span> from claiming that there is no need to
promulgate such rules <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and </span>regulations.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the case of PCFI vs. NTC, G. R. No. 61892,
now pending resolution before this Honorable Tribunal, <u>NTC totally refused
to act on a petition filed by PLDT precisely for the promulgation of such rules
and regulations</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>Why then did NTC refuse to act on such petition if and when there
is no need for the promulgation of such rules and regulations</u>?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>After all, NTC could have simply ruled
that the petition in G. R. No. 61892 is unnecessary because such rules and
regulations are also unnecessary</u>." (pp. 135-136, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>)</blockquote>

the present economic condition obtaining in the country.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The approved rate defeats the purpose of the
decree which is to spread ownership among the wide base of investors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The State, in Presidential Decree No. 217
promulgated on June 16, 1973, adopted the basic policies of the telephone
industry which, among others, are:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the attainment of efficient telephone service for as wide an area as possible
at the lowest reasonable costs to the subscriber; (2) the capital requirements
of telephone utilities obtained from ownership funds shall be raised from a
broad base of investors, involving as large a number of individual investors as
may be possible; and (3) in any subscriber self-financing plan, the amount of
subscriber self-financing will, in no case, exceed fifty per centum (50%) of
the cost of the installed telephone line, as may be determined from time to
time by the regulatory bodies of the State.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The load on the back of
our people is heavy enough.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Let us not
increase its weight further.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Noteworthy
is the concurrence of Justice Vicente <span class="SpellE">Abad</span> Santos in
the case of Bautista vs. NTC (supra) that "the PLDT which is reported to
have made over 100 million pesos in profits in just six months but with its
service so poor that even the First Lady has taken notice should think of
improved service before increased profits."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

burden on the telephone subscribers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
plan to expand the company program and/or improve its service is laudable, but
the expenses should not be shouldered by the telephone subscribers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Considering the multi-million profits of the
company, the cost of expansion and/or improvement should come from part of its
huge profits.</p>

should have appealed the decision of respondent NTC, instead of filing the
