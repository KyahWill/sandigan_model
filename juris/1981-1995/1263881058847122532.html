				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Hon. Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>, presiding
Judge of Branch 5, Regional Trial Court, <span class="SpellE">Dinalupihan</span>,
<st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>, is the respondent in
these five administrative cases for gross misconduct:</p>

<p class="BODY">In his column "On Target", columnist Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tulfo</span> of the Philippine Daily Inquirer, a newspaper pf
general circulation (November 15, 1989), referred to "a regional trial
court in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>… extorting
money from persons who have pending cases in his <span class="SpellE">sala</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
"The amount ranges," he wrote subsequently, "from P50 up to how
much a litigant can afford . . ." and that in addition, "the judge <span class="SpellE">encashes</span> checks far bail bonds and spends the amount for
himself."<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="18" month="1">January 18, 1990</st1:date>,
as a consequence of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Tulfo's</span> information, the
Court issued a Resolution directing the Court Administrator to conduct an
investigation of the matter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="25" month="1">January 25, 1990</st1:date>,
then Court Administrator <span class="SpellE">Meynardo</span> <span class="SpellE">Tiro</span>
filed a Complaint in which he alleged:</p>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The person alluded is herein respondent Judge
of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 5, <span class="SpellE">Dinalupihan</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>, where he maybe served with summons and other court
processes;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Criminal Cases Nos. DH-044-88, DH Nos.
035-88 and DH-047-87 are pending before respondent's court;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
Criminal Cases, respondent issued an Order dated July 18, 1989 directing his
Deputy Sheriff to receive for and in behalf of the court any cash or check as
payment for the confiscated bonds; if however the payment is in the form of a
check, the same must be in the sheriff's name for encashment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The above-mentioned allegations were
affirmed by Deputy Sheriff <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A perusal of the letter dated <st1:date year="1989" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1989</st1:date> to Ramon <span class="SpellE">Tulfo</span> also denounced the actuations of respondent of
accepting bribes from party litigants;<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">At the same time, the Court Administrator addressed a request to
the National Bureau of Investigation for further investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="30" month="1">January 30, 1990</st1:date>,
the Court issued a Resolution directing Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
to answer the Complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="12" month="3">March 12, 1990</st1:date>,
Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> filed an Answer, admitting having
issued two orders in connection with Criminal Cases Nos. DH-039-87, DH-047-87,
and DH-044-88, both authorizing the branch sheriff Antonio <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>,
to accept certain bail payments of P13,200.00 and P14,000.00 in his (<span class="SpellE">Leaño's</span>) name, subject to "full responsibility and
accountability"<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That recourse was necessary,
according to him, because of the alleged insolvent condition of the bondsman
and in order to insure future payment, if warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He also claimed that he later issued an order
directing <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> to turn over the sum of P13,200.00 to
the Clerk of Court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He denied, however,
having received by himself or through <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> (in spite
of his order) the other sum of P14,000.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As to the letter addressed to <span class="SpellE">Tulfo</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tulfo's</span> source apparently), accusing him of extorting money
from litigants, he denied the veracity thereof and challenged the credibility
of <span class="SpellE">Tulfo</span> himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">Meanwhile, the National Bureau of Investigation, on <st1:date year="1990" day="9" month="5">May 9, 1990</st1:date>, forwarded its report,
stating:</p>

<blockquote>"03.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Investigation disclosed that there is truth
to the allegation about the corrupt and nefarious practices of Subject RTC
Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in an agrarian case pending
before his sala entitled Agustin v. <span class="SpellE">Jarin</span> docketed as
Civil Case No. DH-04987, plaintiff <st1:city><st1:place>SALVADOR</st1:place></st1:city>
AGUSTIN of Hermosa, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>
filed an <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span> case against his leasehold tenant
ALFONSO JARIN for not paying his leasehold rental.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Plaintiff SALVADOR AGUSTIN was able to secure
a favorable discussion (sic) from Subject Judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, AGUSTIN has to pay the Judge the
total amount of P10,000.00, aside from the goods that the Judge would ask from
plaintiff almost every hearing of the case, like <span class="SpellE">sugpo</span>,
and <span class="SpellE">alimango</span> and sometimes P1,000 to P2,000.00.</blockquote>

<blockquote>04.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case of Francisco <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz v. Pedro Valencia a civil case for <span class="SpellE">ejectment</span>,
Judge BARTOLOME, in his decision, ordered defendant PEDRO VALENCIA to pay the
sum of P75,000.00 to plaintiff FRANCISCO DELA CRUZ as rental for the fishpond
located at <span class="SpellE">Abucay</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Reliable information had it that out of the
P75,000, Judge BARTOLOME pocketed P50,000; P20,000 was given to the lawyer
of<span style="">&nbsp; </span>FRANCISCO DELA CRUZ as attorney's fee
and only the remaining P5,000 was given to plaintiff FRANCISCO DELA CRUZ.</blockquote>

<blockquote>05.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In that case of People of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
v. <span class="SpellE">Lazaro</span> Martin, et al., docketed as Criminal Case
No. DH-03987 for violation of Section 68 of PD No. 705 and the case of People

the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The said amount represents the
payment for the confiscated bond in the said criminal cases.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another criminal case No. DH-04486 for <span class="SpellE">Estafa</span>) the same Judge also directed the Deputy Sheriff
ANTONIO LEAÑO to get the cash payment of P14,000 representing the confiscated
bond of the said case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Subject Judge,
evidently in connivance with the above-named Deputy Sheriff, misappropriated the
sum of P14,000.”<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On September 27, 1990, the respondent Judge filed another Answer
denying the allegations of the Bureau specifically:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) as to Agustin v. <span class="SpellE">Jaring</span>,
that had "any monkey business" attended its resolution, "the
losing party ... would have taken some positive steps against" him,<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
(Id., p. 17) and that on the contrary, his decision was in fact affirmed by
this Court;<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> (<span class="SpellE">Jaring</span> v. Court of Appeals, G.R. No. 92965) and (2) as to
Francisco v. Valencia, that he did order the deposit of the sum of P75,000 as
unpaid rentals for the leasing of a fishpond, but denied misappropriating the
same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He likewise presented a statement
of Atty. Dante <span class="SpellE">Ilaya</span> denying having been interviewed
by the National Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the Court received two more complaints, one from
publishers of certain <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> newspapers, accusing
Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> of deliberate violation of
Presidential Decree No. 1079 and demanding, through "his Clerk of Court
and his Deputy Sheriff,<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
advance commission,"<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
and another, <span class="SpellE">proferred</span> by <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span>
Governor Leonardo Roman requesting the transfer of the respondent Judge to
"another assignment”<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
on the ground of "numerous complaints on nefarious activities."<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The respondent Judge answered the publishers' complaint, admitting that he did
not adopt the raffle system required by Presidential Decree No. 1079 but
rather, the "rotation system" which "provides an equal and
better chance and opportunity for participating publishers and editors..."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="18" month="10">October 18, 1990</st1:date>,
the Court issued a Resolution referring these cases to Justice Oscar Herrera of
the Court of Appeals for investigation, report, and recommendation.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1991" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1991</st1:date>,
Justice Herrera submitted his report, finding Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
guilty of gross misconduct.</p>

<p class="BODY">After going over the records of these cases, we agree with the
factual findings of the Investigator, adopt the report of Justice Herrera, and
on the basis of our review, mete out the penalty of dismissal from the service
against Judge Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court is fully convinced that enough facts have been
established to warrant the penalty.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, the issuance of the orders in which Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
authorized his sheriff, Antonio <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>, to accept
payment of bail bonds was itself improper, because <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>
was (is) not a bonded officer to whom checks may be payable in an official
capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Payment to <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>,
unlike payment to the Clerk of court, amounted therefore to payment to <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> in his personal capacity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Judge's orders therefore allowed <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>, and if he wanted to, the Judge himself, to make use
of money belonging to the Government by means intended to pre-erase future
liability and to conceal future questions as to legality.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is no defense that he, Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
did instruct <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> to turn over to the Clerk of Court
the sum of P13,200.00 (subject of the first questioned order), because as we
said, the very order was unlawful to begin with and second, if the money were
payable, after all, to the Clerk of Court, there was no reason to make the
bondsman's check payable to <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>, if the Judge did
not after all have any "monkey business" (his words) in mind.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He could not have mitigated his misconduct
vesting on <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> "full responsibility" for
possible misdemeanors on <span class="SpellE">Leaño's</span> part because <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> had no responsibility to begin with if the bond
payments were made payable in his name.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records show that Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>
did receive the money notwithstanding his denials; this is a fact that came
from the lips of <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> himself.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Apparently, Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> had been in
the habit of <span class="SpellE">encashing</span> the Government's checks, and
as <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> would once more confirm, he, Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> had issued similar orders (<span class="SpellE">mga</span>
<span class="SpellE">sampu</span> <span class="SpellE">po</span>")<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
before.</p>

<p class="BODY">What aggravates the misconduct is that the respondent Judge,<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt; color: white;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>in
an effort to exonerate himself and to cover up for his misconduct after the
affair had blown up, began a pattern of falsifying evidence, first by making
his clerk, Marissa <span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span>, prepare (in vain) an
antedated receipt evidencing supposedly the fact that he turned over to the
court the money covering the <span class="SpellE">encashed</span> checks;<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
and second, by making <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> sign a prepared <span class="SpellE">Sinumpaang</span> <span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span> in which he, <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>, allegedly attempted to remit to the Clerk of Court
who allegedly refused to accept it.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> was in a
hurry, most important, to exculpate himself and no less significant, to find a
scapegoat -- <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> who he had, in the first place,
sought to carry the responsibility (he "has full responsibility and
accountability”) when obviously, as judge, the responsibility was his and his alone.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>True to his designs, he orchestrated a charge
against <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> arising from the loss of money,
intended for no other purpose than to consummate a <span class="SpellE">coverup</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court agrees with the Investigator that <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>
was a reliable witness -- and the events indeed speak for themselves -- and
quite to the contrary, the Court can not say the same thing for the respondent
Judge's own witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court does not find Judge <span class="SpellE">Eliseo</span> <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>, who purportedly notarized the <span class="SpellE">Sinumpaang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Salaysay</span> in question, as well as court stenographer
Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Olavides</span>, who allegedly took down "<span class="SpellE">Leaño's</span> statement", to be worthy witnesses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court can not believe that Judge <span class="SpellE">Penaflor</span> merely neglected to read the same before affixing
his signature thereon when as Judge, he should be the first person expected to
be meticulous and scrupulous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidently,
he too was seeking to relieve himself from liability for notarizing a falsified
document.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the Investigator found his
explanation to be none but a "poor excuse,"<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
so we find it to be a lame attempt to mislead the investigating officer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Marilyn <span class="SpellE">Olavides</span> in
fact contradicted him, when she testified that she brought the paper to him for
signature, but that he refused initially, to sign it, meaning that he, Judge <span class="SpellE">Peñaflor</span>, was aware of what it was all about.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Justice Herrera was also correct in denying credence to the
testimony of Jose <span class="SpellE">Palera</span>, Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome's</span>
aide and driver, whom Justice Herrera noted, was "a bodyguard...ready to
die for [his] employer."<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact of the matter is that Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome's</span>
acts, as earlier stated, speak for themselves:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(1) his orders authorizing <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> to accept
money were by themselves in contravention of law; <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>,
a Deputy Sheriff (branch sheriff) had no authority to receive money in his
name, for the court; (2) his orders facilitated, as they were meant to
facilitate, the turnover of legitimate court money into private hands (without
the Judge being responsible ostensibly; (3) his behavior after the matter
reached the attention of the Court--making <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span> sign
a prepared (false) statement absolving him and indirectly inculpating <span class="SpellE">Leaño</span>; (4) engineering a "drive" to cleanse his
name by way of a spurious petition<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
although he, judge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
had not yet been found guilty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These
events impress the Court fully that the facts speak for themselves and no
explanation is possible to extract any meaning from them other than the meaning
they in fact convey.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court turns to the publisher’s charges.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Presidential Decree No. 1079, we quote:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 2. The executive judge of the court of first instance
shall designate a regular working day and a definite time each week during
which the said judicial notices or advertisements shall be distributed
personally by him for publication to qualified newspapers or periodicals as
defined in the preceding section, which distribution shall be done by <span style="">raffle:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Provided, That should the circumstances require that another day be set
for the purpose, he shall notify in writing the editors, and publishers
concerned at least three (3) days in advance of the designated date:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Provided, further, That the distribution of
the said notices by raffle shall be dispensed with in case only one newspaper
or periodical is in operation in a particular province or city.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the raffle system is indispensable not
only because it is the decree of the law but in order to avoid favoritism--a
rung away from the ladder of graft and corruption--by judges.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge's "rotation system" is plainly, in
violation of the Decree.</p>

<p class="BODY">The court can not accept the respondent's attempt to justify the
"rotation system" because of his alleged concern for equitable
division of work, as it were, among <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place><span class="SpellE">'s</span> various periodicals.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>First, save in those cases where only one periodical is circulated in
the province or city, the law provides for no exemption.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Second, there can be no more equitable method
than the raffle system.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Third it is too
easy to justify an unlawful act with "good intentions."</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge was wrong in entrusting publications to
Roberto <span class="SpellE">Rubiano</span>, the court interpreter, when under
Presidential Decree No. 1879, it was his duty to notify in writing the editors
and publishers.</p>

<p class="BODY">The National Bureau of Investigation's finding is that the
respondent Judge misappropriated money belonging to one of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Justice Herrera found no conclusive evidence
that the Judge indeed "pocketed" the sum of P75,000.00 (representing
judicial deposit of unpaid rentals in connection with a pending case).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it is indeed peculiar:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) why the money should have been delivered
to the Judge himself rather than to the clerk of court<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
or arguably, the party himself to whom it was payable and (2) why it was
necessary for the Judge to accept the money so that he, the Judge could deliver
it to the party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds it strange, that it was necessary for the
ceremony where the Judge accepted the money and the Judge delivered the money
to the owner--and why the Judge took extra pains to have the record reflect
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We can speculate on motivations for
a long time.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The fact remains that
judges, fairly or unfairly, are not ordinary employees -- they should not place
themselves in a position leading to speculations of misbehavior.</p>

<p class="BODY">The judge's office is an exalted office, so we have repeatedly
held,<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
and the judge himself should be beyond suspicion.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While the charge of demanding bribes has not been proven, the
Court is just as concerned about the poor reputation that Judge Jose <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> has developed in <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bataan</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A Judge anywhere should be the last person to
be perceived as no better than a mulcting traffic cop or a corrupt bureaucrat
out to make money at every turn.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
reputation of the respondent unfortunately appears to have preceded him, and
while situations are possible where a judge is unfairly ruined by
well-orchestrated attempts of disgruntled litigants or power blocks or
influential members of the community whose interests are threatened by a
judge's zeal and integrity, Judge <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> has in
this case shown not one shred of evidence that the mounting complaints against
him are the byproducts of similar maneuvers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>At any rate, the thing itself has spoken, and it has spoken eloquently.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds this occasion proper to remind our brethren
everywhere that judges are the epitome of moral rectitude in society -- even if
nobody else is.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judges are not common
men and women, whose errors men and women forgive and time forgets.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judges sit as the embodiment of the people's
sense of justice, their last recourse where all other institutions have
failed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, they bring stability to
society, especially where society is under stress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should prove that the system, after all,
works, even if the system has, after all, its built in weaknesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Code of Judicial Conduct prescribes an awesome responsibility
for judges, among them, to “avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety
in all activities."<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
It is an "unfair" responsibility, to be sure, in a regime that honor
merits beyond appearances of demerits.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Yet it underscores a judge's exalted position, that above his individual
merits, he too appears meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">Judge Jose <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span> has clearly
betrayed his robes and if the perception of the inhabitants of <span class="SpellE">Bataan</span> has not been kind to him, he probably deserves it;
the damage which his misconduct has rubbed off on the judiciary in particular
and the solemn institutions of our constitutional democracy in general, is not
deserved by his honest and hardworking fellow workers in government.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, Judge Jose T. <span class="SpellE">Bartolome</span>,
is hereby DISMISSED from the service with prejudice to his reinstatement or
appointment to any public office including government-owned or controlled
corporations and his retirement benefits, if any, are ordered forfeited.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Let a copy of this resolution be included in his
record and served on all courts throughout the land.</p>
