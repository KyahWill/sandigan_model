<p class="BODY">Notwithstanding said findings of facts, the IAC ruled that accused

the trial court, dated <st1:date year="1983" day="23" month="1">January 23,

<blockquote><span>(p. 21, <span class="SpellE"><em>rollo</em></span>)</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<p class="BODY">The contentions of petitioner are well-taken.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
crimes charged are clearly capital offenses as the phrase is defined in Sec. 5 
Rule 114 of the Rules of Court.<span>&nbsp; </span>An offense is capital, if it may 
be punished by death under both the law prevailing at the time of its commission 
and that prevailing at the time of the application for bail, even if after 
conviction a penalty less than death is imposed.<span>&nbsp; </span>In its assailed 
decision, respondent IAC concurred with the trial court that the charges against 
accused are capital offenses and that the evidence of guilt of the accused is 
strong.<span>&nbsp; </span>However, the respondent Court ruled that while the 
evidence clearly established that the petitioner<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> "was responsible for the shooting of Atty. 
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>, Lt. <span class="SpellE">Rumbaoa</span> and 
Patrolman <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span> and he so admitted responsibility for 
their death in his confession" the crime is ostensibly that of homicide merely, 
not murder.</p>
<p class="BODY">The criterion to determine whether the offense charged is capital 
is the penalty provided by the law regardless of the attendant 
circumstances.<span>&nbsp; </span>As pointed out by the petitioner in its memorandum, 
the rationale of the provision lies in the difficulty and impracticability of 
determining <span>the </span>nature of the offense on the basis of the penalty 
actually imposable.<span>&nbsp; </span>Otherwise, the test will require consideration 
not only of evidence showing commission of the crime but also evidence of the 
aggravating and mitigating circumstances.<span>&nbsp; </span>Thus, there has to be 
not only a complete trial, but the trial court must also already render a 
decision in the case.<span>&nbsp; </span>This defeats the purpose of bail, which is 
to entitle the accused to provisional liberty pending trial."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> </p>
<p class="BODY">The posture taken by the respondent Court in granting bail to the 
accused and in disregarding the findings by the trial court of the guilt of the 
accused (respondent herein) is a clear deviation from Our ruling laid down in 
the case of <span class="SpellE">Bolanos</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">dela</span> 
Cruz, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>"Under the Constitution, all persons shall, before conviction, be 
<span class="SpellE">bailable</span> by sufficient sureties, except those charged 
with capital offenses when evidence of guilt is strong.<span>&nbsp; </span><em>It is 
the trial court which is tasked to determine whether or not the evidence of 
guilt is strong and it has determined the affirmative in this case after 
consideration of the evidence already presented by the prosecution.&nbsp; In the 
absence of manifest abuse of discretion, We are not prepared to substitute our 
judgment for that of the trial court</em>." <span class="SpellE">Bolanos</span> 
vs. <span class="SpellE">Dela</span> Cruz, supra) (Underscoring supplied for 
emphasis) (p. 164, <span class="SpellE">rollo</span>)</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">Anent the issue of whether or not the deceased Lt. <span class="SpellE">Rumbaoa</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span> were killed 
while in the performance of their duties, the evidence shows that while both 
were admittedly in civilian clothes during the incident in question they were in 
the performance of their duties as police officers when fired upon and killed by 
the bullets of the accused.<span>&nbsp; </span>As peace officers, their initial 
reaction to the shooting was to assert their authority in protecting and 
covering civilians from the indiscriminate firing by the accused.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Accused instead suddenly and without warning, successively shot Lt. <span class="SpellE">Rumbaoa</span> and Pat. <span class="SpellE">Sagun</span> to death 
knowing fully well that they were peace officers.<span>&nbsp; </span>Although both 
were armed with their service guns, they were unable to offer resistance and put 
up a defense due to the suddenness and close succession of the shots.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>This is indicated by the fact that a revolver still tucked in its holster 
was found at the crime scene beside the bodies of the victims showing that one 
of the victims was unable to pull out his gun.</p>
<p class="BODY">The commission of the crimes charged was attended by treachery as 
established by the testimony of the eyewitness <span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yanuaria</span> to the shooting 
of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> and by strong evidence as to the 
treacherous shooting of the two peace officers.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Virgilio</span> <span class="SpellE">Yanuaria</span> testified that 
accused suddenly and without warning shot the deceased Atty. Norberto <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> when the latter turned his back towards the accused 
and returned to his table to eat.<span>&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> was fatally hit on the back of his head and fell to 
the cement floor.<span>&nbsp; </span>Atty. <span class="SpellE">Maramba</span> did not 
sense any danger that he would be shot by the accused considering that he and 
the accused knew each other personally and that, as respondent <span>admitted, 
there was no previous grudge or misunderstanding between him (accused) and Atty. 
<span class="SpellE">Maramba</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Successive shots hit the two 
peace officers who were caught by surprise as a result of which they 
died.<span>&nbsp; </span>The deceased had no inkling that the accused was armed and 
that he would be carried by passion to resort to violence considering his 
prominent stature in the locality.<span>&nbsp; </span>On these issues the trial court 
ruled:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"There is treachery although the shooting was frontal, when the 
attack was so s<span>udden </span>and unexpected that the victim was not in a 
position to offer an effective defense (<em>People vs. Cuadra</em>, L-27973, 
October 23, 1978), and when there was a deliberate surprise attack upon an 
unarmed victim, the killing is murder qualified by treachery (<em>People vs. 
Alegria</em>, L-40792, August 18, 1978), and furthermore, sudden, unexpected, 
without warning, and without giving the victim the opportunity to defend himself 
or repel the initial attack, the qualifying circumstance of treachery is evident 
and the crime committed is murder (<em>People vs. Candado</em>, L-34089, -90, 
August 9, 1979;<em> People vs. Pay-an</em>, L-39089-90, July 31, 
1978)."</blockquote>
