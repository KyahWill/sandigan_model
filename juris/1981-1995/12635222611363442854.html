The petitioner, Felipe G. Tac-An, is a lawyer whose services were 
engaged by the brothers Eleuterio Acopiado and Maximino Acopiado who 
were accused of frustrated murder and theft of large cattle before the 
Municipal Court of New Piñan, Zamboanga del Norte in March, 1960.
<p>
On April 4, 1960, Tac-An caused a document entitled, "Deed of Quitclaim"
 to be thumb-marked by the Acopiado brothers whereby I for the sum of 
P1,200.00 representing his fees as their lawyer in the criminal cases, 
they conveyed to him a parcel of land with an area of three hectares.  
The document was acknowledged before Notary Public Pacifico Cimafranca 
on the same date who explained its contents to the Acopiados.
</p><p>
On April 6, 1960, or two days after the execution of the deed, the 
Acopiados told Tac-An that they were terminating his services because 
their wives and parents did not agree that the land be given to pay for 
his services.  They also said that they had hired another lawyer, a 
relative, to defend them.  But Tac-An continued to represent them.
</p><p>
In the case for frustrated murder, the Acopiados were acquitted.  The 
cases for theft of large cattle were dismissed due to the desistance of 
the complainants.
</p><p>
On April 2, 1961, Eleuterio sold his share of the land previously 
conveyed to Tac-An to Jesus Paghasian and Pilar Libetario but the latter
 did not take possession thereof.
</p><p>
In June, 1964, Tac-An appointed Irineo Villejo, a barrio captain, as his
 overseer in the land.  On July 2, 1964, Tac-An also secured the 
approval of the Provincial Governor of Zamboanga del Norte to the Deed 
of Quitclaim.  And on October 7, 1964, Tac-An filed a complaint against 
the Acopiado brothers, Paghasian and Libetario in the CFI of Zamboanga 
del Norte.  He prayed that he be declared the owner of the land; that 
the sale made in favor of Paghasian and Libetario be annulled; and that 
he be paid damages, attorney's fees,etc.
</p><p>
The Court of First Instance decided in favor of Tac-An whereupon the Acopiados, et al. appealed to the Court of Appeals.
</p><p>
The Court of Appeals voided the transfer of the land to Tac-An but held 
that for his services in the criminal cases he was entitled to the 
agreed upon amount of P1,200.00.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals 
reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "WHEREFORE, the judgment appealed from is hereby reversed and set 
aside.  In lieu thereof, another one is rendered ordering the defendants
 Acopiados to pay the plaintiff the sum of P1,200.00 with interest at a 
legal rate from the date of the finality of this judgment until full 
payment thereof.  No pronouncement as to costs. " (Rollo, pp. 40-41.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Petitioner Tac-An prays that the decision of the Court of Appeals be set
 aside and that the decision of the Court of First Instance be upheld 
instead.
</p><p>
The petition is not impressed with merit.
</p><p>
The Court of Appeals found as a fact that the Acopiado brothers fully 
understood the tenor of the Deed of Quitclaim which they executed.  But 
the Court of Appeals also found as a fact that the Acopiado brothers are
 Non-Christians, more specifically Subanons, and that each is married to
 a Subanon.  And because they are Non-Christians, the Court of Appeals 
applied Section 145 of the Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu 
which reads as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 145.  <em>Contracts with Non-Christians requisites</em>. - 
Save and except contracts of sale or barter of personal property and 
contracts of personal service comprehended in chapter seventeen hereof 
no contract or agreement shall be made in the Department by any person 
with any Moro or other non-Christian tribe or portion thereof the 
Department or with any individual Moro or other non-Christian 
inhabitants of the same for the payment or delivery of money or other 
things of value in present or in prospective, or in the manner affecting
 or relating to any real property, unless such contract or agreement be 
executed and approved as follows: </p>
  <p align="center">
    x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x x x</p>
  <p> "(b)  It shall be executed before a judge of a court of record, 
justice or auxilliary justice of the peace, or notary public, and shall 
bear the approval of the provincial governor wherein the same was 
executed or his representative duly authorized in writing for such 
purpose, indorsed upon it."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It should be stated that under Section 146 of the same Code, contracts 
or agreements made in violation of Sec. 145 shall be "null and void."
</p><p>
It should be recalled that on July 2, 1964, Tac-An secured the approval 
of the Provincial Governor of Zamboanga del Norte to the Deed of 
Quitclaim and that should have satisfied the requirement of Sec. 145 of 
the Administrative Code for Mindanao and Sulu.  But it appears that on 
April 12, 1965, while Tac-An's suit was pending in the trial court, the 
Governor of Zamboanga del Norte revoked his approval for the reasons 
stated therein.
</p><p>
The petitioner now asserts that the revocation of the approval which had
 been given by the Provincial Governor has no legal effect and cannot 
affect his right to the land which had already vested.  But as Justice 
Conrado M. Vasquez, with Justices Mateo Canonoy and Ameurfina M. Herrera
 concurring, said:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The approval by Provincial Governor Felipe Azcuna appearing on 
the face of the Deed of Quit­claim (Exh. "E") made on July 2, 1964 may 
no longer be relied upon by the plaintiff in view of the revocation 
thereof by the same official on April 12, 1965 (Exh. 4).  The revocation
 was based on the ground that the signature of Governor Azcuna was 
obtained thru a false representation to the effect that the alleged 
transaction was legal and voluntary when in truth and in fact, as found 
out later, the said parcel of land was the subject matter of a court 
litigation; and, moreover, the non-Christian vendors were not brought 
before him for interrogation, confirmation or ratification of the 
alleged deed of quitclaim.  The fact that the revocation was made after 
the filing of instant action on October 10, 1964 does not vitiate the 
aforesaid action of the Provincial Governor.  Significantly, no attempt 
was made to disprove the truth of the reasons stated in the certificate 
of revocation (Exh. 4)." (Rollo, p. 37.) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The petitioner also argues that the Administrative Code of Mindanao and 
Sulu was repealed on June 19, 1965 by Republic Act No. 4252, hence the 
approval of the Provincial Governor became unnecessary.  Suffice it to 
say that at times material to the case, i. e. when the Deed of Quitclaim
 was executed, when the approval by the Provincial Governor was given 
and when the approval was revoked, Sections 145 and 146 of the 
Administrative Code of Mindanao and Sulu were in full force and effect 
and since they were substantive in nature the repealing statute cannot 
be given retroactive effect.  It should also be stated that the land in 
question must be presumed to be conjugal in nature and since the spouses
 of the Acopiado brothers did not consent to its transfer to the 
petitioner, the transaction was at least voidable.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, finding the petition to be lacking in merit, the same is hereby dismissed with costs against the petitioner.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Makasiar, (Chairman), Aquino, Concepcion, Jr., Guerrero</em>, and <em>De Castro, JJ.</em>, concur.
</p><p>
<em>Escolin, J.,</em> no part.
