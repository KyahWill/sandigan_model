<p class="BODY">The accused has appealed.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution has summarized its evidence as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the evening of <st1:date year="1972" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1972</st1:date>,
Federico <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, Arthur <span class="SpellE">Mangandel</span>

<span class="SpellE">Maranan</span>, disrupted the game by grabbing the coins
being used therein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When Federico <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> told him that they were not adversaries, the
appellant got mad and uttered bad words against the former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Federico <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, who
was a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver, together with a fellow driver,
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, left and proceeded to <st1:place><st1:placename>A.</st1:placename>

<blockquote>"Upon their return, at around <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00
 o'clock</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time>,
Rolando <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span> was at the wheel of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> of Federico <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the front seat of the same <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> was Federico <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>,
seated between the driver and Alfonso Santos nicknamed 'Jun'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>

in <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, appellant, who was at the
corner of <st1:street><st1:address><span class="SpellE">Bulacan</span> Street</st1:address></st1:street>,
near a drum, and from that distance of barely four (4) meters away from the
vehicle, aimed a .22 caliber gun at them and fired twice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alfonso Santos nicknamed 'Jun' was hit on the
forehead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He fell from the vehicle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another passenger, Lorenzo Francisco,
nicknamed '<span class="SpellE">Enchong</span>', who was seated at the rear, was
also hit on the right knee (pp. 10-14, 16-20, &amp; 30, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>,
April 14, 1977; pp. 8-11, <span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, May 10, 1977).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The defense invokes alibi, with the accused giving his own
version of the incident as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that
between the hours of eleven o'clock and twelve o'clock in the evening of April
21, 1972, he was driving a Lady Helen taxi as he was on night shift starting
from five o'clock in the afternoon of April 22, 1972 up to five o'clock in the
morning of April 23, 1972; that the gambling incident happened on April 21,
1972 and not on April 22, 1972; that when he arrived at the gambling place,
Federico <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> was holding the coins used as "<span class="SpellE">pangara</span>"; that after he noticed that his friends were
losing the game in an unclean manner, he asked that the gambling be stopped
because he knew that <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> was a hustler; that
shortly after, his friends grabbed their money from <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>,
who got mad and uttered foul language against him, saying "<span class="SpellE">Putang</span> <span class="SpellE">ina</span> mo, <span class="SpellE">bakit</span> mo <span class="SpellE">kami</span> <span class="SpellE">pinakikialaman</span>";
that <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> tried to fight him, but he avoided trou­ble,
so, he went home right away; that around nine o'clock in the morning of April
23, 1972, while he was on his way home, he saw <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
again somewhere at 10th Avenue who uttered these words in the vernacular:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"If not for you, no one will be shot at;
you are a '<span class="SpellE">sumbungero</span>' "; that immediately after
the said incident, he went home to take a rest; that <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
did not mention to him the names of those who were allegedly shot at; that he
does not know the deceased Alfonso Santos nor the injured per­son, Lorenzo
Francisco; that he learned of their having been shot only on April 23, 1972
when he was about to report for work at <span class="SpellE">Tandang</span> <span class="SpellE">Sora</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant denied having fired at the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> where the victims were riding but declared that he
knows of no reason why the prosecution witnesses would implicate him in this
case.</p>

<p class="BODY">On cross-examination, appellant admitted that <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
is smaller than he; that he knows <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> as a <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> driver, but does not know Lorenzo Francisco; that
he has no grudge against <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> with whom he had <span class="SpellE">quarrelled</span> because he was able to stop the gambling and he
is not an aggressive person; that after April 22, 1972, he and his wife moved
their residence to <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> where his brother lives;
that he learned on April 23, 1972 that he was being sought by the police, so,
he informed his brother about the incident in <span class="SpellE">Caloocan</span>
City involving him; that his brother advised him to present himself to the
police authorities so that the truth may be known but he did not obey such
advice; that he did not report to the police prior to his arrest because he was
afraid, as he would have to pass by the scene of the incident and was worried
about the threats against his life made by <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> and
his companions who are tough guys in the place; that after April 23, 1972, he
continued to drive the Lady Helen taxi, taking no definite routes, but drove
around the Metro Manila area; that after May, 1972, he did not know that he was
the subject of a warrant of arrest for the alleged crime of murder, and that he
had no knowledge that a criminal complaint had been filed against him; and that
he was suddenly arrested in 1976 at his workplace at <span class="SpellE">Tandang</span>
<span class="SpellE">Sora</span>, <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that although the warrant for the arrest of
appellant was issued on <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="7">July 6, 1972</st1:date>
it remained <span class="SpellE">un­served</span> and was instead referred to the
National Bureau of Investigation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin-top:15.0pt;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:

<blockquote>The Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> erred in appreciating and making the
circumstance of flight as basis in convicting accused-appellant despite the
absence of direct or corroborative evidence showing his guilt or participation
in the offense charged."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We find no merit to either assignment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The prosecution witnesses, Federico <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
and Lorenzo Francisco, both of whom were passengers of the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span>
at the time of the shooting incident, positively identified appellant as the
assailant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The categorical
identification by said two eyewitnesses was not successfully rebutted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> knew the
accused at least ten (10) years prior to the incident<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>,
while Francisco knew him well since he was a small boy because his eldest
sister used to hire appellant's jeep.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
It was also established that the scene of the crime was brightly illu­minated
as there was light from the electric post aside from the lights coming from the
gasoline station just on the oppo­site side of the road. <a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant was not without motive in consummating his criminal
design.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same date of the shooting
incident, appellant and <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> had a heated
confrontation while the latter and friends of the accused were gambling when
appellant disrupted and stopped the game.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Despite assertions on appellant's part that he harbored no grudge
against <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> after their quarrel, the circumstances
of the shooting incident belie his contention and bespeak of his motive in
firing at the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> in which <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>
was riding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant fired at the
intended victim, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, but hit, instead, two of his
co-passengers that resulted in the killing of Alfonso Santos and injury to
Lorenzo Francisco.</p>

<p class="BODY">While, as in the case at bar, motive is unnecessary to prove
appellant's guilt since the eyewitnesses positively identified appellant as the
assailant, yet, there is enough proof of such appellant's motive, which tends
to corroborate the evidence establishing his guilt.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's defense of alibi is unavailing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His allegations that he was somewhere else at
the time of the commission of the crime as he was then driving a Lady Helen
taxi on night shift starting from five o'clock in the afternoon of April 22,
1972 up to five o'clock in the early morning of April 23, 1972, are mere
self-serving statements and bare assertions, uncorroborated by other competent
evidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alibi cannot pre­vail against
positive identification by prosecution witnesses.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Significant, too, is the fact that appellant had not positively
shown that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of said
crime at the time of its commission.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant's admission that in driving his taxi he had no definite route, but
that he drove it within the Greater Manila area only, does not rule out the
physical possibility that appellant could have driven his cab to the scene of
the crime at or about the time of the shooting incident and there he waited for
his intended victim, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the alleged conflicting and irreconcilable
testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> and Francisco -- <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> testified that appellant was in a kneeling position
when the latter fired on them, while Francisco declared that appellant was
standing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defense then makes capital
of the fact that if the appellant were in a kneeling position when he pulled
the trigger of the gun, the trajectory of the bullet on the victim Alfonso
Santos could not have been downwards from the point of the entry at the
forehead.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
This circumstance, however, was well-explained, by Dr. Orlando Salvador, the
NBI Medico-Legal Officer who autopsied the victim's cadaver, who stated that it
was difficult to ascertain the relative position of the victim when he was shot
considering the mobility of the head which was fatally hit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We quote the pertinent portions of his
testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now<i>,
</i>this wound on the forehead, from the nature and description of this wound,
can you tell this Court what would be the position of the victim at the time he
was allegedly shot at?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well,
the head being a movable portion of the body, it would be hard to pinpoint the
position.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because of the mobility of the
head, it can be moved either side.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But
granting if the two (2) are facing each other, the head must be bowed a little.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If the victim is shorter or if they are of
the same height, it should be bowed or the gun should be a little bit lower or
if the gun is pointed, it should be bowed a little.</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the triggerman is in a
higher elevation?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>FISCAL:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a seated position ...</blockquote>

<blockquote>COURT:</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
is the relative position of the assailant and the victim, were they facing each
other or what?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A <span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well,
as I said, because of the mobility of the head, you cannot exactly pinpoint the
exact position.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
the body of that matter, the body is movable also?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well,
if the victim is sitting down like I do now and the assailant is on your side,
your Honor, I should have to position my face on your direction and little bit
stooping.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
that case, the Court gathers that more or less, they were facing each other?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
your Honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Because the head was facing the assailant?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, your Honor, may be on the
side or just in front.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Either
directly <span class="SpellE">infront</span> or the assailant is a little bit on
the side?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes,
sir."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">And, as aptly observed by the Solicitor
General, "the victim could have unintentionally moved his head or that he
tried to duck from the shot, both of which would explain the downward
trajectory of the bullet."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:.5in">Appellant also claims that <span class="SpellE">Lirio's</span> head count of four (4) passengers inside the <span class="SpellE">jeepney</span> at the time of the shooting incident is contrary to
Francisco's declaration that there were at least thirteen (13) passengers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Likewise, appellant pointed out that <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> estimated the relative distance of the accused from
the motor vehicle when the latter fired his gun upon the jeep to be about four
(4) meters away, as against Francisco's estimate of approximately ten (10)
meters.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find them, however, to be
only minor details that do not destroy the veracity and credibility of said
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It simply shows that the
witnesses were not coached or rehearsed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this case, it has not been successfully shown that the Trial
Court had overlooked certain facts of substance and value, that, if properly
considered, might affect the outcome of the case.</p>

<p class="BODY">In respect of the second assignment of error, the defense
incorrectly alleges that the circumstance of appellant's flight was the Trial
Court's basis in convicting him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That
was not so.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Flight was merely considered
by the Trial Court as an additional circumstance indicative of guilt.</p>

<p class="BODY">By his own admission, appellant learned on April 23, 1972, or a
day after the shooting incident, that the police authorities were looking for
him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Despite such knowledge and
notwithstanding the advice of his brother to report to the police to find out
why he was being sought by the authorities, he did not present himself nor
surrender to the police.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
appellant stated that he avoided passing by the crime scene because he was
allegedly worried about the threats made by <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span> and
his companions against his (appellant's) life.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Instead, appellant transferred his residence to <st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE">Pasig</span></st1:place></st1:city> so that he could not be
arrested until four years later.</p>

<blockquote>“While the flight of an accused person after the commission of an
offense creates no legal presumption of guilt, it is nevertheless a
circumstance which is admissible in evidence against him, and, if not explained
in a manner consistent with his innocence, is to be considered as tending to
show that he was the person who committed the deed”.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote>"Flight of accused after commission of the offense is a
circumstantial evidence indicating guilt, on the biblical adage that '. . . the
wicked flee when no man <span class="SpellE">pursueth</span>, but the righteous
are as bold as the lion'".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn20" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In sum, there is proof beyond reasonable doubt of appellant's
guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The crime is Murder, qualified by
treachery under Article 248 (1) of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Appellant had positioned himself at a
distance from moving vehicles and near a drum in such a way that there was no
danger nor risk to himself arising from any defense that the intended victim
might make.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, without any
warning, he shot his target, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>, who was then
unarmed and had no chance of putting up a defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither could the two individuals, who were
hit, have put a defense against the attack.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That the fatality was not the intended victim, <span class="SpellE">Lirio</span>,
as the gunshot directed at the latter killed instead, Alfonso Santos, does not
exonerate appellant from criminal liability.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He is responsible for the consequences of his acts.</p>

<blockquote>"As the appellant committed the act with intent to kill and
with treachery, the purely accidental circumstance that as a result of the
shots a person other than the one intended was killed, does not modify the
nature of the crime nor lessen his criminal responsibility, and he is
responsible for the consequences of his acts".<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<blockquote>"The qualifying circumstance of treachery may be properly
considered even when the victim of the attack was not the one whom the
defendant intended to kill, if it appears from the evidence that neither of the
two persons could in any manner put up defense against the attack or become
aware of it".<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn22" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>,
