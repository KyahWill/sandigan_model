COURT OF APPEALS AND RURAL BANK OF SALINAS, INC., RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Rural Bank of Salinas, Inc. on <st1:date year="1969" day="17" month="2">February 17, 1969</st1:date> filed an action to foreclose a mortgage
on two lots with an area of 1,923 square meters located at <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> which the
spouses Pedro S. <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span> and Carmen Tan executed on <st1:date year="1967" day="9" month="2">February 9, 1967</st1:date> as security for a
loan of P16<span class="GramE">,000</span> maturing after 270 days.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span> spouses pleaded that the
suit was premature because they had made representations to the bank that they
be allowed to sell the lots in order to pay the mortgage debt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span> and their counsel did not
appear at the "initial hearing" scheduled on <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="9">September 19, 1969</st1:date>. Instead, they caused to be
filed on that date a motion for postponement on the ground of illness which the
lower court denied (p. 43, Record on Appeal). A copy of the denial order was
allegedly received by <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span> on <st1:date year="1969" day="27" month="10">October 27, 1969</st1:date>. The bank presented its
evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>. In its decision
dated October 24, 1969 the lower court ordered the <span class="SpellE">Ravelo</span>
spouses to pay the bank within ninety days from the finality of the decision
P16<span class="GramE">,000</span> with 12% interest <u>per</u> <u>annum</u> from
December 12, 1967, plus P500 as attorney's fees, and, if no payment was made,
then the mortgaged lots should be sold to pay the amount of the debt. A copy of
the decision was received on <st1:date year="1969" day="4" month="11">November
 4, 1969</st1:date> by the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span>' lawyer.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court in its order of <st1:date year="1970" day="19" month="1">January 19, 1970</st1:date> denied the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span>'
motion to set aside the judgment "by default" and granted the bank's
motion for reconsideration by increasing the attorney's fees to P1<span class="GramE">,600</span> in accordance with the stipulation in the mortgage
contract. The judgment became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The sheriff sold the mortgaged properties on <st1:date year="1970" day="21" month="8">August 21, 1970</st1:date> to the bank for P6<span class="GramE">,000</span>. (The bank in its <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span>
brief offered to allow the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span> to redeem the
mortgaged lots by paying P16<span class="GramE">,000</span> plus interest and
bank charges within sixty days from the receipt of the brief.)</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank filed a motion for confirmation of the sheriff's sale.
It was opposed by the mortgagors. It was confirmed in the lower court's order
of <st1:date year="1971" day="22" month="3">March 22, 1971</st1:date>. The <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span> appealed that order to the Court of Appeals which
affirmed the lower court's order on <st1:date year="1974" day="16" month="12">De­cember
 16, 1974</st1:date>. The <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span> appealed to this
Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Their three assignments of error have no relevance to the said
confirmation order. They assail the pro­ceedings leading to the rendition of
the judgment from which they did not appeal. They contend that the trial court
erred in omitting the mandatory pre-trial and that the Court of Appeals erred
in holding that the <span class="SpellE">Rave­los</span> had waived it by not
raising that omission in the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><u>The fact is that the bank filed a motion to set the case for
pre-trial</u>, a pleading act included in the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span>'
record on appeal. Acting on that motion, the trial court set the case for
"initial hearing on <st1:date year="1969" day="19" month="9">September 19,
 1969</st1:date>" (p. 14, Record on Appeal; pp. 9-10, Bank's Brief).</p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly contended by the bank that "initial
hearing" <u>was intended as a pre-trial</u> but the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span>
moved for postponement and did not appear at that initial hearing. It has been
held that the omission of the court to specify in a notice of hearing that it
was a notice of pre-trial is not an irregularity (<span class="SpellE">Trocio</span>
vs. <span class="SpellE">Labayo</span>, L-35701, September 19, 1973, 53 SCRA 97).</p>

<p class="BODY">If the defendant does not appear at the pre-trial, the plaintiff
may be allowed to present his evidence (<st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pangasinan</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
and <span class="SpellE">Soriano</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Palisoc</span>, 116
Phil. 609).</p>

<p class="BODY">Since the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span> did not appeal from
the judgment, they cannot now complain that the trial court erred in allowing
the bank to present its evidence <u>ex</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>parte</u></span>.
The lower court acted properly in denying the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span>'
motion for postponement. <u>They had no valid defense to the action</u>. The
instant appeal is manifestly frivolous and dilatory.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is
affirmed with costs against the <span class="SpellE">Ravelos</span>.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDRED.</span></p>
