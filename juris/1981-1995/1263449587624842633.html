				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY"><span style="">Poised for resolution in
this Petition for <i>Certiorari</i> with Preliminary Injunction is the sole
issue of whether or not petitioners' claim for moral, actual, compensatory and
exemplary damages, together with attorney's fees and costs, constitutes a
compulsory counterclaim.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Private respondent, Juan <span class="SpellE">Pambuan</span>, Jr., filed a Com­plaint for <span class="SpellE">Reconveyance</span>
and Damages of approximately P400,000.00 against petitioners before the Court
of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pasay</span>
City (Civil Case No. 5023-P) for an alleged wrongful sale at public auction of
a certain real property.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
presented their Answer with a counter-claim, on account of the "malicious
and unfounded action," for moral damages in the amount of P600<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>; actual and compensatory damages of P100,000.00;
exemplary damages of P50,000.00; attorney's fees of P30,000.00, plus P200.00
per appearance of counsel as representation and <span class="SpellE">travelling</span>
expenses.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">On the same day that they
filed their Answer, petitioners filed an ex-<span class="SpellE">parte</span>
Motion for exemption from pay­ment of legal fees on their counterclaim alleging
that it was compulsory in nature and that under section 5(a), </span><span style="">Rule 141, only a permissive counterclaim is
subject to payment of legal fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since the Branch Clerk of
Court required peti­tioners to deposit the amount of P1<span class="GramE">,410.00</span>
pending resolution by the Court, petitioners complied subject to refund.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That was on </span><st1:date year="1976" day="15" month="3"><span style="">March 15, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Petitioners' Motion remained unresolved notwithstanding reiterations
made on </span><st1:date year="1978" day="5" month="5"><span style="">May 5, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">,
</span><st1:date year="1979" day="12" month="1"><span style="">January 12, 1979</span></st1:date><span style=""> and on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="8"><span style="">August 20, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Eventually, on </span><st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="12"><span style="">December 28, 1979</span></st1:date><span style="">, respondent Judge denied petitioners' Motion
for <span class="GramE">refund</span> on the ground that petitioners'
counterclaim is permissive and not compulsory.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The reconsideration prayed for by peti­tioners was denied by respondent
Judge on </span><st1:date year="1980" day="26" month="8"><span style="">August 26, 1980</span></st1:date><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
is these two Orders that are assailed in this Petition, to which we gave due
course on </span><st1:date year="1981" day="2" month="2"><span style="">February 2, 1981</span></st1:date><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Under section 4, Rule 9,
a counterclaim is compulsory in nature 1) if it arises out of, or is
necessarily con­nected with the transaction or occurrence that is the subject
matter of the opposing party's claim; 2) if it does not require for </span><span style="">its </span><span style="">adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the Court cannot
acquire juris­diction; and 3) if the Court has jurisdiction to enter­tain the
claim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>A compulsory counterclaim is
barred if not set up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Conversely, a counterclaim
is permissive where it has no necessary connection with the transaction or
occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim, or even
where there is such connection, the Court has no jurisdiction to entertain the
claim, or if it requires for its adjudication the presence of third persons
over whom the Court, cannot acquire jurisdiction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners' counterclaim
for damages fulfills the necessary requisites of a compulsory
counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are damages claimed
to have been suffered by petitioners </span><span style="">as a </span><span style="">consequence of the
action filed against them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They have to
be pleaded in the same <span class="GramE">action,</span> otherwise, petitioners
would be precluded by the judgment from invoking the same in an independent
action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The pronouncement in Papa vs. <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Banaag</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span></span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> is in point:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Compensatory moral and exemplary
damages, allegedly suffered by the creditor in consequence of the debtor's
action, are also compulsory counterclaim barred by the dismissal of the
debtor's action.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They cannot be claimed
in a subsequent action by the creditor against the debtor."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Aside from the fact that petitioners' counterclaim for damages
cannot be the subject of an independent action, it is the same evidence that
sustains petitioners' counterclaim that will refute private respondent's own
claim for damages, <span class="GramE">This</span> is an additional factor that
characterizes petitioners' counterclaim as compulsory.</p>

<blockquote>"Defendants' counterclaim is compulsory, not only because the
same evidence to sustain it will also refute the cause or causes of action alleged
in plaintiff's com­plaint, but also because from its very nature, it is obvious
that the same cannot remain pending for independent adjudication by the
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Section 2,
Rule 17; Lim <span class="SpellE">Tanhu</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Ramolete</span>,

66 SCRA 426)."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In respect of attorney's fees, it should also be held that where
a claim <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> arises out of the filing of the
complaint they, too, should be considered as in the nature of a compulsory
counterclaim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They should be pleaded or
prayed for in the answer to the complaint in order to be recoverable,
otherwise, they would be barred.</p>
