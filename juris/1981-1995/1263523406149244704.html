This petition seeks the reversal of the decision of the Court of Appeals
 (now Intermediate Appellate Court), dated June 16, 1982, which affirmed
 the decision of the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan ordering 
herein petitioner to pay the private respondent P50,000.00 as damages or
 compensation out of the Assurance Fund.
<p>
The facts as stated in the decision of the lower court are as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Filomena Primicias, during her lifetime, was the owner of a 
parcel of land situated in barrio San Vicente, Municipality of Alcala, 
Pangasinan, designated as Lot No. 2-C, Plan PSU-109394-Amd. 2, with an 
area of 613,916 square meters, and registered in her name under OCT 
10318 (Exhibit B).  On November 24, 1958, she executed a public document
 styled 'Donation <em>Mortis Causa</em>" (Exhibit A) over a 10-hectare 
portion of the said land located on the southeastern part thereof in 
favor of her daughter, plaintiff Paulina Perez, who accepted the 
donation in the same instrument.  On November 26, 1958, the document was
 duly registered and annotated on the memorandum of encumbrances of OCT 
10318. </p>
  <p> "The records disclose that even prior to the execution of the 
aforestated deed of donation, Filomena Primicias had sold to certain 
third parties several portions of Lot 2-C located along the southwestern
 part thereof.  Lot 2-C was subsequently subdivided segregating the 
portions thus sold, as evidenced by subdivision plan PSU­-52185 (Exhibit
 4-C); and on March 28, 1963, the Register of Deeds of Pangasinan issued
 TCT 43170 (Exhibit 4) in the name of Filomena Primicias covering the 
remaining unsold portion of the said land, designated as Lot 2-C-16, 
with an area of 588,244 square meters.  However, the Register of Deeds, 
through negligence or oversight, failed to carry over in TCT 43170 the 
plaintiff's deed of donation which had been annotated on OCT No. 10318. </p>
  <p> "Thereafter Filomena Primicias obtained from defendant Peoples 
Bank and Trust Co. (PBTC) two loans in the amounts of P15,000.00 and 
P28,000.00 which were secured by Lot 2-C-16, as evidenced by the real 
estate mortgages dated April 8 and June 10, 1963, respectively (Exhibits
 6 and 7).  These mortgage deeds were duly registered and the 
corresponding memoranda thereof annotated on TCT No. 43170 on April 8 
and June 10, 1963, respectively. </p>
  <p> ""Filomena Primicias died on June 15, 1965 leaving her said 
obligation unsettled.  On July 15, 1968, PBTC instituted foreclosure 
proceedings, and in due course, the plaintiff, as one of the heirs of 
the deceased, was sent a copy of the notice of extra-judicial sale.  
Whereupon plaintiff made the necessary in­quiries in the Office of the 
Register of Deeds of Pangasinan and discovering that OCT No. 10318 has 
been cancelled and, in lieu thereof, TCT No. 43170 (or 43710) had been 
issued pursuant to the subdivision agreement entered into by Filomena 
Primicias and the transferees of portions of the original Lot 2-C; and 
that the inscription of her deed of donation <em>mortis causa</em> in 
OCT No. 10318 had not been carried over into TCT No. 43710.  To protect 
her interest, the plaintiff, on August 1, 1968, registered anew the deed
 of donation <em>mortis causa</em> (Exhibit C) and caused the entry of an adverse claim on said TCT. </p>
  <p> "On August 7, 1968, the property was sold at public auction; and 
the PBTC, as highest bidder, was issued the corresponding Sheriff's 
Certificate of Sale (Exhibit 8). </p>
  <p> "On June 17, 1969, plaintiff instituted the instant action against
 the PBTC and the Register of Deeds of Pangasinan, seeking par­tial 
annulment of the Sheriff's Certificate of Sale issued in favor of PBTC 
to the extent of the 10-hectare portion donated to her. </p>

    <span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style=""><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</span></p>
  <p> "After the trial, this Court thru the Presiding Judge of Branch V,
 rendered a decision in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant
 bank, ordering the partial annulment of the Sheriff's Certificate of 
Sale dated August 7, 1968, executed in favor of PBTC to the extent of 10
 hectares being claimed by plaintiff and ordering defendant PBTC to 
immediately segregate and reconvey to the plaintiff the said 10 hectares
 portion of Lot 2-C-16 in conformity and in accordance with the terms 
and conditions of the deed of donation <em>inter vivos</em> and, in the 
alternative ordering defendant PBTC, in the event that reconveyance 
thereof is not possible, to pay the plaintiff the sum of P10,000.00 
representing the fair market value of her claims plus interest thereon 
computed at the rate of 6% per annum from the date of the filing of the 
complaint until finally paid and to pay the sum of P1,000.00 as 
attorney's fees and to pay the costs.  (Idem. pp-5-6). </p>
  <p> "However, on appeal by the defendant PBTC, the Court of Appeals 
reversed and set aside the decision of this Court in Civil Case No. 
U-2128 and, accordingly, dismissed the plaintiff's complaint.  In 
reversing and setting aside the decision of Branch V of this Court in 
Civil Case No. U-2128, the Court of Appeals held that 'neither' the 
honest mistake and inadvertence of the Register of Deeds nor the absence
 of negligence on the part of the appellee (now plaintiff herein) could 
pre­judice the rights of appellant bank (PBTC) as an innocent mortgagee 
for value and that the remedy of the appellee was to go against the 
Assurance Fund as provided for by Section 101 of Act 496.  x x x"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
On the basis of the above findings of the appellate court, the trial 
court rendered a decision in favor of the private respondent and against
 herein petitioner, ordering the latter to pay the former out of the 
Assurance Fund, in the amount of P50,000.00 as damages or compensation.
</p><p>
On Appeal, the Court affirmed the findings of the lower court, hence, this petition.
</p><p>
Petitioner assigns the following errors:
</p><p align="center">
I
</p><p align="center">
WHETHER RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE DEED OF DONATION <em>MORTIS CAUSA</em> EXECUTED BY FILOMENA PRIMICIAS IN FAVOR OF PAULINA PEREZ VDA. DE MEIMBAN IS A DONATION <em>INTER VIVOS</em>, AND IN CONSIDERING THAT THERE WAS A VALID TRANSFER TO PAULINA PEREZ VDA. DE MEIMBAN WHO COULD RECOVER FROM THE ASSURANCE FUND.
</p><p align="center">
II
</p><p align="center">
WHETHER RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT FINDING THE PRIVATE 
RESPONDENT NEGLIGENT FOR NOT SEGREGATING THE TEN-HECTARE PORTION OF THE 
LAND DONATED TO HER.
</p><p align="center">
III
</p><p align="center">
WHETHER RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN NOT CONSIDERING THE DEFENSE OF PRESCRIPTION.
</p><p align="center">
IV
</p><p align="center">
WHETHER THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS ERRED IN HOLDING THE ASSURANCE FUND LIABLE.
</p><p>
The principal issue to be determined in the present petition is the nature of the donation, whether it is a donation <em>inter vivos</em> or a donation <em>mortis causa</em>.
</p><p>
Whether a donation is <em>inter vivos</em> or <em>mortis causa</em> 
depends upon the nature of the disposition made.  Did the donor intend 
to transfer the ownership of the property donated upon the execution of 
the donation?  If this is so, as reflected from the provisions contained
 in the donation, then it is <em>inter vivos</em>; otherwise, it is merely <em>mortis causa</em>,
 or made to take-effect after death.  (Castro v. Court of Appeals, 27 
SCRA 1076, 1082, citing Howard v. Padilla and Court of Appeals, G.R. 
Nos. L-7064 and L-7098, April 22, 1955).
</p><p>
According to the petitioner, the donation in question is <em>mortis causa</em>
 since it is clear from the provisions thereof that ownership and 
control of the donated property would be transferred to the private 
respondent only upon the death of the donor.  This being so, therefore 
the deed of donation should have complied with the formalities of a will
 in order to become valid.
</p><p>
The donation provides:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "That for and in consideration of the love and affection which the
 DONOR has for the DONEE, the said Donor by these presents does hereby 
give, transfer, and convey unto the DONEE, her heirs and assigns a 
portion of ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND (100,000) SQUARE METERS, on the 
southwestern part Pro-indiviso of the above described property.  (The 
portion herein donated is within Lot 2-B of the proposed amendment Plan 
Subdivision of Lots Nos. I and 2, Psu-109393), with all the buildings 
and improvements thereon, <em>to become effective upon the death of the DONOR</em>." (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It is crystal clear from the above-quoted deed of donation that the 
donor did not intend to transfer the ownership much less, the possession
 of the donated property to the donee until after the former's death as 
evidenced not only by the caption of the deed but more importantly, by 
what was expressly provided in the donation itself.  That the donor 
retained the ownership of the property was furthermore established by 
the fact that the donor, after executing the above deed, mortgaged the 
same to the PBTC and until her death, did not try to fulfill her 
obligation to the latter in order to free the property from the mortgage
 lien.
</p><p>
As the donation is in the nature of a <em>mortis causa</em> disposition,
 the formalities of a will should have been complied with under Article 
728 of the Civil Code, otherwise, the donation is void and would produce
 no effect.  As we have held in <em>Alejandro v. Geraldez</em> (78 SCRA 
245, 253), "If the donation is made in contemplation of the donor's 
death, meaning that the full or naked owner­ship of the donated 
properties will pass to the donee because of the donor's death, then it 
is at that time that the donation takes effect, and it is a donation <em>mortis causa</em> which should be embodied in a last will and testament.  (Citing Bonsato v. Court of Appeals, 95 Phil. 481)."
</p><p>
The donation in the case at bar was only embodied in a public instrument
 and was not executed in accordance with the formalities of a will.  
Therefore, it could not have transferred ownership of the disputed 
property to the private respondent and its subsequent annotation of 
adverse claim in Transfer Certificate of Title No. 43710 did not produce
 any effect whatsoever.  Consequently, the private respondent cannot 
claim the property, especially after the same had been foreclosed and 
sold at public auction in favor of PBTC.  Necessarily therefore, no 
damages can also be awarded to said respondent from the Assurance Fund 
since as far as the law is concerned, no donation existed which the 
Register of Deeds failed to annotate on the new title of the property.
</p><p>
Inasmuch as all the other issues raised by herein petitioner are anchored on the vital question of whether the donation is <em>inter vivos</em> or <em>mortis causa</em>, we deem it unnecessary to pass upon these other issues.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, the petition is GRANTED and the decisions of the Court of 
Appeals dated June 16, 1982 and the Court of First Instance dated July 
3, 1980 are hereby REVERSED and SET ASIDE.  The complaint filed against 
the petitioner is DISMISSED.  No costs.
</p><p>
SO ORDERED.
</p><p>
<em>Teehankee, Acting C.J., Melencio-Herrera, Plana, Relova</em>, and <em>De la Fuente, JJ.,</em> concur.
