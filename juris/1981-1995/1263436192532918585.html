</span><!--[endif]-->in respect of his conviction for illegal possession of firearm
and ammunition, that the trial court erred in holding Arce as the possessor of
the unlicensed handgun found at or near the scene of the rape.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court summarized the facts it found in the following
manner:</p>

<blockquote>"At about 2:15 in the early morning of January 30, 1990, the
complainant Perlita Acio de Leon accompanied by one Rodalyn Medrano, a 10 year
old girl, went to see her husband Bernard de Leon, alias Boyet, at the Double J
Disco, Centro, Aparri, Cagayan.  They
were not able to see her husband thereat and on their way back home near the
Metro Bank building, Perlita was accosted by a person from behind, later
identified as the accused Alberto Arce, whose face was then covered by a
T-shirt.  Complainant ran towards the
Double J disco to seek assistance but she stumbled, hence, she was overtaken by
the accused and the latter brought her at the back of the Tana ricemill with a
gun caliber 0.38 poked at her left temple.  Meanwhile, her companion Rodalyn Medrano ran to report the incident to
[her] father Rudy Medrano, and the latter together with others, immediately
went to report the incident to the police authorities, who responded
immediately.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When they reached the back of the ricemill, the accused [initially
tore the front portion of the dress of Perlita, then] ordered [her] to remove
her duster which she complied because of the poked gun on her temple.  She was later dragged to a corner of the
ricemill and was forced to lie down.  The accused lowered his pants and underwear, then went on top of her,
holding her tightly with his hands around her neck and kept on kissing
her.  She struggled but the person held
her tightly then lowered the left side of her panty and inserted his penis.  Not being successful to do the sexual intercourse,
the accused again lowered her panty above her knees, but that was the time the
policemen arrived focusing their flashlight.  The accused hit her left eye with the gun telling her to hide, and not
to shout, but she was able to take possession of the gun and shouted for help,
as the accused was confused and probably shocked and afraid, even as she bumped
her head on the cemented wall.  After
which, the accused ran away and jumped into the Apagonan river.  The complainant surrendered the gun to the
police team who rescued her.  The
policemen tried to pursue the accused but failed to overtake him despite
warning shots.  The following morning,
the accused was picked up, and Perlita recognized him, [due to] his voice, as
the real culprit.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At the scene of the crime, the gun which is unlicensed (Exhibit
'C') was recovered, and same was surrendered by complainant; the gray t-shirt
(Exhibit 'D') which was used by the accused was likewise recovered; the duster
(Exhibit 'E') and the green slippers (Exhibit 'F') were also recovered; and the
maong pants (Exhibit 'G') used by the accused which was still wet when the
policemen went to the house of the accused that same morning was likewise
recovered.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The accused put up a defense of alibi x x <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Appellant Arce's view of the facts, insofar as the rape charge is
concerned, was essentially the following:</p>

<p class="BODY">On the night of 29 January 1990, Arce, together with his wife,
his brother and mother, slept in their house in Minanga, Aparri, Cagayan.  He made love with his "common law"
wife Evelyn Vallejo that night, first at around 10:00 <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">o'clock in the evening after which he slept, and then again at
around 4:00 o'clock in the following early morning.  He then slept until 6:00 o'clock a.m.  At 7:00 o'clock that morning, he was picked up by three (3)
policemen from his residence and brought to the PNP Headquarters where he was
identified by complainant Perlita A. de Leon as her attacker and rapist.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant stresses that no prosecution witness had asserted
having actually seen him at the scene of the crime before, during or
immediately after the assault.  He avers
that, therefore, the trial court could not reasonably conclude that he was the
assailant of Perlita A. de Leon and that he was the possessor of the allegedly
unlicensed firearm found at the scene of the rape.  In respect of the rape charge, appellant Arce further argued that
the trial court had erred in finding that rape had been committed against
Perlita A. de Leon, considering the absence of medical evidence establishing
the fact of rape and in view of Perlita's admission that she had been "<u>nearly
raped</u>" and not actually violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have carefully gone over the record of this case and we
consider the above arguments of appellant Arce bereft of merit.  Rape is a crime that is normally witnessed
only by the victim and her assailant; acquittal or conviction of the assailant
would, therefore, frequently depend upon the victim's testimony.  The Court has consistently held that a
person charged with the crime of rape may be convicted thereof on the testimony
of the victim as lone witness, provided that that testimony is credible and
convincing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Testifying on what happened on the night of the physical and
sexual assault upon her, Perlita A. de Leon stated that:  while running away from appellant, who was
chasing her, she stumbled and fell on the road, hurting her hands and bruising
her knees in the process; that appellant caught up with her when she fell to
the ground and then forced her to stand up; that when appellant started
assaulting her behind the ricemill, she was pushed to the ground; that although
her assailant had already partially <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">inserted
his male member into her private part, she fought back and thereby bruising
various parts of her assailant's body; that her continuous struggle prevented
her assailant from fully inserting his male organ into her; that her assailant
pulled open the side of her underwear in a renewed attempt at full
introjection; that her assailant again failed in his effort at full penetration
because he became aware of the police approaching with lights and calling out
complainant's name and arriving at the scene of the crime; that the approach of
the police caused the assailant to strike her in the face, hitting her left eye
with the butt of his handgun in an attempt to silence her; that when she cried
out for help, appellant repeatedly pounded her head against the cement wall of
the ricemill; that she used her elbows to try to shield her head from injury;
that before the police could lay their hands on appellant, despite the warning
shots of the police, appellant ran away into the dark, stumbling towards the
nearby river and plunging into it.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Perlita de Leon's testimony was corroborated in its salient
points by other prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Dr. Romulo A. de Rivera, the Municipal Health Officer and
attending physician of complainant after the rape, corroborated her testimony
concerning her injuries.  The <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">trial court summed up the testimony
of Dr. Rivera in the following terms:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Next to testify for the prosecution was Dr. Romulo de Rivera,
Municipal Health Officer of Aparri, Cagayan.  He declared that he examined Perlita de Leon and he issued a medical
certificate to that effect marked as Exhibit 'I'.  Wound No. 1 located on the left eyelid must have been caused by a
fingernail and the victim and the accused might have been face to face.  It could also be possible that the injury
was caused when the victim was pushed and the said portion hit a rough
surface.  Wound No. 2 located on the left
eyebrow might have been caused when the victim was pushed and the said part
struck a hard surface on the ground.  Wound No. 3 located below the left eye might have been caused by a blunt
instrument.  It could also be caused by
a fist blow.  Wound No. 4 located on the
upper right arm could be possibly caused by a fist blow, blunt instrument or
hand handling tightly that part of the body.  Wound No. 5 located on the left forearm could be possibly caused by a
fingernail, an object with rough surface or maybe when the victim was pushed to
the ground.  Wound No. 6 located on the
left right finger could be possibly caused when it came in contact with hard
surface or when the victim was pushed to the ground.  Wound No. 7 located on the right knee could be possibly caused
when the victim stumbled forward with her knee hitting the ground.  Wound No. 8 could be possibly caused when
the victim was pushed.  Wound No. 9
located on the middle part of the leg could be possibly caused similar to the
injuries of the knee.   <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">All the </span>wounds indicate that there was
violence and these signs of violence might be the result of the victim's
resistance.</u>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring added)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">The circumstance that no medical
examination of the victim's private parts was conducted, does not constitute a
fatal hiatus in the prosecution's evidence.  The Court has previously held that in crimes against chastity, the
medical examination of the victim's genitalia is not an <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">indispensable element for the successful prosecution of the
crime, the purpose of the examination being commonly merely corroborative in
nature.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Perlita de Leon's testimony concerning the events preceding the
assault and rape were also corroborated by Rodalyn Medrano, the 10-year old
child-companion of the complainant on the night of the crime.  Rodalyn Medrano testified to, e.g., the
masked man with the gun chasing the complainant; the direction of the chase;
and the complainant stumbling to the ground while fleeing and sustaining knee
injuries and arm bruises.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Also on the record are the testimonies of Sgt. Pedro Adap, Rudy
Medrano and Corporal Eddie Reyes, all of whom were at the scene of the crime
and who corroborated complainant's testimony on matters contemporaneous with
and immediately after the assault, e.g., complainant's physical condition and
appellant's manner and mode of escape.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn11" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In view thereof, the Court finds no basis for disregarding and
overturning the credence given by the trial court to the testimony of the
complainant.  The observations of the
trial court are worth noting:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x <u>she related her testimony with a ring of truth and
never </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">faltere</span>d</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> even </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">during </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">cross </span>examination.  There was no evidence presented or proved
that she fabricated her story and there was no evidence adduced to show that
she has reason to falsely accuse Alberto Arce</u>.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Settled is the rule that
the lone testimony of the victim can be the basis of conviction if found worthy
and credible.  </span><u>The manner, the
demeanor and the way the complainant testified, lead to the inevitable </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">conclusion that indeed she was raped by the </span>accused</u>.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">She
will not dare come out in the open and stand the rigors and suffer humiliation
during public trial, if her motive is not to obtain justice.  She has no reason to fabricate (People v.
Bravo, 180 SCRA 694) and <u>c</u></span><u>onsidering the age and education of
the complainant, she has no reason to fabricate </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In respect of appraisal of the credibility of witnesses, the firmly
settled rule is that the findings of the trial court are to be accorded great
respect and at times deemed final, that court having been in a position to
observe and assess the behavior and demeanor of the witnesses while on the
witness chair.  Appellate magistrates
will generally not disturb such findings of the trial court, unless the latter
has patently overlooked facts of substance and value which, when considered
will affect the resolution of the case.  Here, the Court finds no reason to depart from the general rule and no
basis for reversing the trial court's finding that complainant Perlita de Leon
had in fact been assaulted and raped on the night of 30 January 1990.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the fact or extent of execution of the rape, it is
sufficient to recall that the slightest degree of penetration of the <u>pudenda</u>
by accused's penis suffices to constitute the crime of rape.  Thus, complete or even substantial
introjection is not necessary, and Perlita did testify that Arce's member did
partially enter her private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Courier New&quot;">parts.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">It is true that no one at the scene of the crime had identified
appellant as the assailant of Perlita de Leon, considering that the assault and
rape had occurred in the dead of night and the place of the rape was unlighted.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">Complainant herself at the time of
commencement of chase </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">did
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">not
see appellant's face because the latter's face was, at least partly, covered
with his T-shirt.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Identification of the doer of a crime is not, however,
exclusively limited to identification by visual or optical perception of the
face and person of the accused.  Under
Section 4, Rule 133 of the Rules of Court, conviction may <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">rest on
indirect or circumstantial evidence when the proven circumstances, taken
together, constitute an unbroken chain of events leading to one fair and
reasonable conclusion that the accused was guilty beyond reasonable doubt of
the charge against him.  </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">In </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">the instant case, at least three (3)
circumstances converged to sustain Arce's guilt.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">First, there was the wet <u>maong</u> pants of appellant Arce.   The prosecution had established that
appellant was wearing <u>maong</u> pants when the latter, in making good his
escape <span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">jumped into the nearby
river and swam or waded away.  When
appellant was arrested at his house, a few hours after the incident at the
ricemill, the arresting officers retrieved from appellant's clothes hamper, and
from among the other soiled dry clothes, a pair of wet <u>maong</u> pants,
which admittedly belonged to appellant.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"> No explanation was given by
appellant regarding the wet condition of his denim pants, except that it,
together with other clothes, was then due for washing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Second, appellant, at the time of his arrest, was found with
bruises and other injuries on his person.  The complainant had testified that in the ensuing assault on her person,
she in the course of defending herself, inflicted bodily injuries, e.g.,
bruises and scratches, upon her assailant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">We turn to Criminal Case No. VIII-637 for illegal possession of

a firearm outside of his residence.  It
is, of course, the constitutional presumption of innocence that lays that
burden upon the prosecution.  The
absence of such license and legal authority constitutes an essential ingredient
of the offense of illegal possession of a firearm, and every ingredient or
essential element of an offense must be shown by the prosecution by proof
beyond reasonable doubt.  In </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">People v. </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Pajenado</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

vs. Ramos, 8 SCRA 758, could be invoked to support the view that it is
incumbent upon a person charged with illegal possession of a firearm to prove
the issuance to him of a license to possess the firearm, but <u>We are of the
considered opinion that under the provisions of Section 2, Rule 131 of the
Revised Rules of Court which provide that in criminal cases the burden of proof
as to the offense charged lies on the prosecution and that a negative fact
alleged by the prosecution must be proven if ‚Äòit is an essential ingredient of
the offense charged‚Äô, the burden of proof was with the prosecution in this case
to prove that the firearm used by appelant in commiting the offense charge was
not properly licensed.</u></blockquote>

<blockquote>It cannot be denied that <u>the lack or absence </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>a license is an essential
ingredient of the offense </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>illegal
</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">possession of </span>a firearm</u>.  The information filed against appellant in
Criminal Case No. 3558 of the lower court (now G.R. No. 27681) specifically
alleged that he had no 'license or permit to possess' the .45 caliber pistol
mentioned therein.  Thus it seems clear
that <u>it was the prosecution's duty not merely to allege that negative fact
but to prove it</u>.  This view is
supported by similar adjudicated cases.  In U.S. vs. Tria, 17 Phil. 303, the accused was charged with having
criminally inscribed himself as a voter knowing that he had none of the
qualifications required to be a voter.  It was there held that the negative fact of lack of qualification to be
a voter was an essential element of the crime charged and should be proved by
the prosecution.  In another case
(People vs. Quebral, 68 Phil. 564) where the accused was charged with illegal
practice of medicine because he had diagnosed, treated and prescribed for
certain diseases suffered by certain patients from whom he received monetary
compensation, without having previously obtained the proper certificate of
registration from the Board of Medical Examiners, as provided in Section 770 of
the Administrative Code, <u>this Court held that if the subject of the negative
averment like</u>, for instance, the act of voting without the qualifications
provided by law, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is </span>an
essential ingredient of the offense charged, the prosecution had the burden of
proving the same, although in view of the difficulty of proving a negative
allegation, the prosecution, under such circumstance, need only establish a <i>prima
facie</i> case from the best evidence obtainable.</u>  In the case before Us, both appellant and the Solicitor General
agree that there was not even a <i>prima facie case</i> upon which to hold
appellant guilty of the illegal possession of a firearm.  Former Chief Justice Moran upholds this
views as follows:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'The mere fact that the adverse party has the control of the better
means of proof of the fact alleged, should not relieve the party making the
averment of the burden of proving it.  This is so, because <u>a party who alleges a fact must be assumed to
have acquired some knowledge thereof, otherwise he could not have alleged it</u>.  Familiar instance of this is the case of a
person prosecuted for doing an act or carrying on a business, such as, the sale
of liquor without a license.  <u>How
could the prosecution aver the want of a license if it had acquired no
knowledge of that fact?</u>  Accordingly, although proof of the existence or non-existence of such
license can, with more facility, be adduced by the defendant, it is nevertheless,
incumbent upon the party alleging the want of the license to prove the

<p class="BODY">Here, the record is bereft of even a <u>prima facie</u> showing
of the essential element of lack or absence of a license or legal authority to
carry the firearm here involved.  In
other words, the prosecution, although it had shown at least <u>prima facie</u>
that the seized firearm had been held or used by appellant Arce, failed to
prove that appellant had no license or authority to possess that firearm and to
carry it outside his residence.  The
very <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;">paucity
of testimony and other evidence on this point is remarkable; it is also
indicative of the casual way in which this charge was handled by the police and
the public prosecutor.  The only
relevant testimony on this point is the following:</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
