				<H3>RURAL BANK OF BAAO, INC., AND ERMELO ALMEDA, PETITIONERS, VS. NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS COMMISSION AND EDUARDO FROYALDE, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>GRINO-AQUINO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In this petition for <i>certiorari</i> the petitioners seek the
annulment of:</p>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the Resolution dated
November 29, 1988 of respondent National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC, for
short) in connection with NLRC-RAB-V-Case No. 0266-86 entitled, "Eduardo
O. Froyalde vs. Rural Bank of Baao, Inc., Ermelo M. Almeda," which
affirmed the Labor Arbiter's decision dated September 25, 1987; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the NLRC's Resolution
dated September 4, 1989 which denied petitioners' motion for reconsideration.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The private respondent, Eduardo Froyalde, was, prior to his discharge,
the manager of the Rural Bank of Baao, Inc. for 13 years or from October 3,
1973 until July 29, 1986 when his services were terminated by the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 15, 1986, he received a memorandum from Ermelo M. Almeda,
president of the bank, together with <span style="">a </span>copy
of an audit report of the bank's External Auditors, Banaria, Banaria and
Company.  Almeda's memorandum informed
private respondent that he was being placed under preventive suspension <span style="">for a </span>period of 15 days and given the
same period to show cause in writing why he should not be dismissed.  Almeda likewise informed private respondent
that criminal and/or civil actions may be filed against him.</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 17, 1986, private respondent submitted a reply to
Almeda's memorandum.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 29, 1986, private respondent was dismissed on the grounds
of loss of confidence, breach of trust, and violation of existing banking laws.</p>

<p class="BODY">Believing that his dismissal was without just cause, private
respondent filed a complaint for illegal dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">On February 25, 1987, the Special Task Force of NLRC Regional
Arbitration Branch No. 5, presided over by Labor Arbiter Potenciano S.
Cañizares, rendered a decision, the dispositive portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, the<span style=""> </span>respondents
are hereby ordered to pay the petitioner two years fixed backwages in the
amount of NINETY ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY FOUR (P91,440.00) (sic) PESOS;
P13,315.00 as separation pay; and P30,000.00 as moral and exemplary damages;
the respondents are further ordered to pay 10% of the awarded amount as attorney's
fee to the petitioner." (p.<span style=""> </span>113,
Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Dissatisfied with the decision of the Labor Arbiter, the bank
elevated the case to the NLRC.</p>

<p class="BODY">On November 29, 1988, the NLRC affirmed the appealed decision.</p>

<p class="BODY">The bank filed a motion for reconsideration but it was denied by
the NLRC in a Resolution dated September 4, 1989.  Hence, this petition for <i>certiorari.</i></p>

<p class="BODY">The lone issue in this case is whether or not Froyalde was
dismissed without due process of law.  The <span style="">answer </span>is yes.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 3, Rule XIV, Book IV, Omnibus Rules Implementing the
Labor Code, provides:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Section <span style="">3.  </span><u>Preventive</u> <u>Suspension</u>.
- The employer may place the worker concerned under preventive suspension if
his continued employment poses a serious and imminent threat to the life or
property of the employer or of his co-workers."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter observed that while the <span style="">implementing rule </span>of the law provides that the employer may place
the worker concerned under preventive suspension if his continued employment
poses a serious and imminent threat to the life and property of the employer or
of his co-worker, in the case of Froyalde, the external auditor did not make
any such pronouncement.  In fact, he
only made the following recommendations:</p>

<blockquote>“(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>immediate liquidation
be undertaken to afford the availability of funds for the bank's operational
needs;</blockquote>

<blockquote>“(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>cash advances not paid
or liquidated be converted into loan subject to regular interest charged by the
bank; and</blockquote>

<blockquote>"(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>strict compliance
should be observed as per bank's policy that cash advances must not be extended
to persons with overdue or unliquidated balances to prevent accumulation."
(p. 26, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Similarly, President Ermelo M. Almeda, <span style="">in </span>his memorandum of July 15, 1986 to Froyalde, did not make any
finding that the continued employment of the latter would pose a serious and
imminent threat to the lives of his co-workers, or to property of the bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sections 2, 5, 6, and 7 of Rule XIV, Book IV of the Implementing
Regulations of the Labor Code require that before an employer may dismiss an
employee, the latter must be given a written <span style="">notice </span>stating the particular acts or omissions constituting the
grounds for his dismissal.  The employee
may answer the allegations within a reasonable period and the employer shall
afford him ample opportunity to be heard and to defend himself with the
assistance of his representative, if he so desires.  It is only then that the employer may dismiss the employee by
notifying him <span style="">of </span>the decision in
writing, stating clearly the reasons therefor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter observed from the records, that the bank failed
to comply with the above procedure (p. 26, Rollo).  Although the bank served a notice of termination to Froyalde, it
did not cite the particular acts of misconduct or dishonesty committed by the
latter.  The notice of termination
reads:</p>

<blockquote>"Anent your preventive suspension as Manager of the Rural Bank
of Baao, Inc. since July 14, 1986, and finding your written explanation dated
July 17, 1986 to be unsatisfactory, please be advised that in adherence to the
decision of its Board of Directors, due to breach of trust, loss of confidence,
and violations of existing banking laws, you are hereby terminated and/or
dismissed permanently from your position as Manager thereto effective this
date.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Consequently, ancillary to this incident, your position as
Director and/or Secretary to the Board is therefore considered vacated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Hoping for your usual understanding in this regard.  I remain." (pp. 93-94, <span style="">Rollo.)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter observed that:  "if the respondents had solid grounds upon which to base their loss
of trust and confidence in the petitioner, the records <span style="">does (sic) not show </span>it (sic).  The record is spattered with allegations, manifestations and comments as
well as documentary evidence without proper identifications or qualifications
or statements of purposes for which they are submitted.  Hence, no valid conclusion can ever be made
from them.  Consequently, the
respondents have failed to prove just cause to dismiss the petitioner" (p.
27, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">On July 20, 1986, or only three days after Froyalde had answered
the notice of suspension dated July 15, 1986, the bank informed him of the
termination of his employment, without giving him a chance to be heard nor even
waiting for the period <span style="">of </span>his
suspension to expire.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 1, Rule XIV, Book IV of the Implementing Regulations of
the Labor Code, provides that "No worker shall be dismissed <span style="">except </span>for a just or authorized cause
provided by law and after due process." The rule <span style="">is </span>explicit.  The
dismissal of an employee must be for just or authorized cause and after due
hearing.</p>

<p class="BODY">In Philippine Movie Pictures Workers' Association vs. Premiere
Productions, Inc., 92 Phil. 843, 848, this Court explained the rationale behind
the right of every worker to due process of law:</p>

<blockquote>"The right to labor is a constitutional as well as statutory
right.  Every man has a natural right to
the fruits of his own industry.  A man
who has been employed to undertake certain labor and has put into it his time
and effort is entitled to be protected.  The right of a person to his labor is deemed to be property within the
meaning of constitutional guarantees.  This is his means of livelihood.  <u>He</u> <u>cannot</u> <u>be</u> <u>deprived</u> <u>of</u> <u>his</u> <u>labor</u>
<u>or</u> <u>work</u> <u>without</u> <u>due</u> <u>process</u> <u>x</u> <u>x</u>
<u>x</u>." (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The guarantee of due process applies to all workers, including
managerial employees.  (Dosch vs.
National Labor Relations Commission, 123 SCRA 296.)</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>,<span style=""> </span>the
petition for <i>certiorari</i> is DISMISSED for lack of merit.  The appealed resolution of respondent NLRC
is hereby affirmed <u>in</u> <u>toto</u>.  This decision is immediately executory.  No pronouncement as to costs.</p>

<b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br>
