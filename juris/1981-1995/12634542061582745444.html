				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is an appeal by <i>certiorari</i> where it is "prayed
that judgment be rendered declaring the aforesaid Resolution No. 542, Series of
1956, of the City of Manila null and void and ordering the Register of Deeds of
the City of Manila to register the petitioner's affidavit of consolidation and
to issue to the latter a new transfer certificate of title." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 11-12.)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Maria <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> owned a piece of land
measuring 108 square meters located in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place><span class="GramE">Manila</span></st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was covered by TCT No. 79798.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears that Barrio <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span> was
acquired by the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
pursuant to its Charter; it was subdivided into lots of 108 sq. m. each for
residential houses; and the sale of the lots was regulated by Resolution No.
168, series of 1922, which was amended several times, the last by Resolution
No. 542, series of 1956.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Paragraph 4 of
Resolution No. 542 stipulates that:</p>

<blockquote>"4.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Only Filipino laborers who are bona fide
residents in Manila whose wages do not exceed P180.00 per month, or P6.00 per
day, according as they receive monthly or daily compensation shall have the
privilege of buying lots in the Barrio." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 18.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1966" day="10" month="10">October 10, 1966</st1:date>,
Maria <span class="SpellE">Barcelon</span> mortgaged the land to Citizens' Surety
and Insurance Co., Inc. to secure a loan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The mortgage was foreclosed extra-judicially when the loan was not
paid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The purchaser was the lender.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the expiration of the period of
redemption, the purchaser sought to consolidate its ownership but the Register
of Deeds of Manila refused to register the consolidation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="4">April
 6, 1971</st1:date>, the <span class="GramE">corporation</span> instituted Civil
Case No. 82820 in the Court of First Instance of Manila against the Register of
Deeds of Manila and the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It prayed that Resolution No. 542 be declared
null and void and that the Register of Deeds be ordered to register the
consolidation of title.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Judge Ricardo C. <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> dismissed the case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In this appeal, the petitioner insists, as it did in the court below,
that Resolution No. 542 is unconstitutional and that it is not applicable to
forced sales.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is devoid of merit and should be dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Put simply, the
petitioner claims that Resolution No. 542 is unconstitutional because it is
unreasonable and violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It argues as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>As may be seen from Sec. 4 of Res. No. 542, only laborers earning
not more than P180.00 a <span class="GramE">month,</span> or P6.00 a day are
qualified to buy lands in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Employees working in offices or
establishments and earning as much but who are not laborers cannot buy lands in
that area.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Also persons who are engaged
in some calling or occupation earning as much are not also qualified.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should not be overlooked that the
intention of the pertinent provisions of the Charter of the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
contained in Sections 97, 98 and 100 of said Charter is to help the poor people
of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city> to acquire residential
lands on easy terms.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Res. No. 542 includes laborers but does not include
low-salaried employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Laborers are not
the only poor people in the City of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There are also others who are the
low-salaried employees and those engaged in some calling or occupation where
their income is limited.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Are these
people to be considered more fortunate and, therefore, should have less in law?</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The classification resorted to in Sec. 4 of the aforesaid
Resolution does not come within the mean­ing of the principle of equal
protection of the laws.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A classification
to come within such principle must fulfill the following requisites:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>the classification must not be capricious or
arbitrary, but must be natural and reasonable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And to be reasonable (1) it must rest on substantial distinction; (2) it
must be germane to the purpose of the law; (3) it must not be limited to
existing conditions only; and (4) must apply equally to all members of the same
class.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Political Law Reviewer, <span class="SpellE">Aruego</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Laguio</span>, 1954 Ed., p.

<blockquote>"An analysis of the provision of Sec. 4 of Reso­lution No. 542
will show that the classification made thereby does not fulfill the above
mentioned requisites.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The classification
of laborer does not have a substantial distinction from low-salaried employees
or persons engaged in some calling with a limited income, because all of them
are under like circumstances in their lives, in their liberty, in their
property, and in the pursuit of happiness." <span class="GramE">(Brief, pp.
12-14.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The lot in question is situated in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"<span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>"
means laborer or manual worker.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is, therefore, a justifiable and reasonable basis to limit the sale of the lots
in the barrio to <span class="SpellE">obreros</span> only - they are birds of the
same feather.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also claims that the resolution is unreasonable
because it bars a non-laborer to buy a lot in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Obrero</span>
even if he does not earn more than P180.00 a month or P6.00 a day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner, which is a corporation and
not a lowly paid worker, is not competent to raise this claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For even if <span class="GramE">We</span>
sustain it no benefit can accrue to the petitioner who will nonetheless be
disqualified to acquire the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, in the absence of manifest abuse of power, We are not prepared
to substitute Our judgment for that of the City of Manila which is tasked by
its Charter "to acquire private lands in the city and to subdivide the
same into home lots for sale on easy terms to residents, giving first priority
to the bona-fide tenants or occupants of said lands, and second priority to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">laborers </span>and </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">low-salaried employees</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">." </span><span class="GramE">(Sec. 100,
R.A. No. 409, as amended.)</span> Obviously, the questioned resolution merely
seeks to implement the Charter pro­vision.</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the claim that the questioned resolution does not apply to
forced sales, Judge <span class="SpellE">Puno</span> said it all as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"There is no merit in the pretension that the questioned
resolution does not apply to forced sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It is implemented in sales upon foreclosure or on execution by limiting
bids to those persons legally qualified to purchase.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The legal intent and purpose of the
resolution would be rendered utterly nugatory if the same be restricted in its
application to voluntary sales." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,
pp. 21-22.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Also, the resolution does not distinguish between voluntary and
forced sales.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is hornbook law
expounded by Professor Gerardo <span class="SpellE">Florendo</span> when he
taught in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>College</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename>Law</st1:placename></st1:place>,
University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Phil­ippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
that when the law does not distinguish we should not distinguish.</p>
