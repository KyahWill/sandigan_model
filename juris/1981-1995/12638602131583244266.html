<p class="BODY">After trial, Judge Rodrigo V. <span class="SpellE">Cosico</span>
found the following facts to have been established:</p>

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> On
the evening of May 28, 1983, which was a fiesta day, while Rosette <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>, a teacher at the San Esteban Elementary School,
was preparing to cook food at her house, she found out that there was no
water.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, Mrs. <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span> instructed her two (2) children, <span class="SpellE">Babette</span> and Nicolas, to get water from the faucet of the
accused <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, also
a public school teacher.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At that time,
Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rey's</span> faucet was allegedly the only one with
water at the neighborhood because of the long drought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nicolas was then a <span class="SpellE">ninteen</span>-year
old fourth year high school student at the <span class="SpellE">Colegio</span> de
la <span class="SpellE">Purisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Concepcion</span>, <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Roxas</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Babette</span> and Nicolas
proceeded towards the house of Mr. <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> to get water. <span class="SpellE">Babette</span> and Nicolas found <span class="SpellE">Roban</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, son of the accused, near the faucet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Roban</span> was sitting
atop the steps of the kitchen stairway talking with Nicolas.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While Nicolas was standing beside the faucet
waiting for his pail to be filled with water, he was shot twice by <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> from the window of
his bedroom which was about four (4) meters away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The shooting was witnessed by <span class="SpellE">Roban</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> and <span class="SpellE">Babette</span>
<span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>, who was about three (3) meters away from
the faucet.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After he was hit, Nicolas
said to <span class="SpellE">Roban</span>: 'I was hit'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Soon after, Nicolas fell front of <span class="SpellE">Roban</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Roban</span> went up their house and told <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span>: 'Daddy you hit Colas'.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Babette</span> went home
and reported the shooting incident to her mother who fainted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span> sisters
and their group went to the place to get the body of Nicolas, who was taken to
the <st1:place><st1:placename>Medicare</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Hospital</st1:placetype></st1:place>
in <span class="SpellE">Pilar</span>, <span class="SpellE">Capiz</span>, where he
was given a first-aid treatment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">The trial court found the defendant-appellant guilty, as charged,
and sentenced him to suffer the penalty of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">From this judgment, the accused <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span> appealed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His counsel assails the trial court for completely believing the
testimony of the prosecution witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Counsel points to certain facts and circumstances of weight and
substance which the trial court allegedly overlooked, misapplied <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">or </span>misinterpreted, and which, if
considered, will materially alter the result, to wit: "1) the fact that it
was summer and the water system <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">connections,
particularly </span>those in the higher level of the town, were not
functioning; 2) the fact that the water faucet at the backyard of the accused-appellant
was not functioning, not merely because the water pressure was too weak for the
faucet to function but also because the water connection had <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">been </span>disconnected (<span class="SpellE">t.s.n</span>.,
p. 283); 3) the fact that the houses of both the deceased and the
accused-appellant and their immediate neighborhood are on the same higher level
of the town; 4) the fact that the household of the accused-appellant were
getting their water supply from Martin <span class="SpellE">Cunada</span>, their
nearest neighbor, because he had a water pump, several water storage tanks, and
a well; 5) the fact that the immediate neighbors of the <span class="SpellE">Pagayunans</span>
had wells, water storage tanks, as well as water system connections and some of
their neighbors were relatives and close friends of the <span class="SpellE">Pagayunans</span>;
6) the fact that the <span class="SpellE">Pagayunans</span> were known and seen
to obtain their water supply from these immediate neighbors; 7) the fact that
the <span class="SpellE">Pagayunans</span> (who were relatively new in the
neighborhood) had never drawn water from the faucet of the accused-appellant;
8) the fact that the house of the accused-appellant was at least 120 meters
away from the house of the deceased; 9) the fact that the only<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>access to the accused-appellant's bedroom
window from the outside was through the shuttered gate of the wire-enclosed
vegetable garden; 10) the fact that the six-foot-high chicken and bar-wire
fence of the vegetable garden was covered with climbing plants, thereby
blocking the view from the window as well as from the outside into the bedroom;
11) the fact that the accused-appellant's house was of the bungalow type and
the sill of the bedroom window was only about 3.5 feet from the ground; 12) the
fact that the deceased was found just below or near the bedroom window and
within the enclosed vegetable garden, not only by members of the
accused-appellant's family but also by Martin <span class="SpellE">Cunada</span>,
a friend and <span class="SpellE">barkada</span> of the deceased, who happened to
be passing by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">just </span>after gunfire
sounded; 13) the fact that Martin <span class="SpellE">Cunada</span>, who stayed
for some five minutes at the scene of the incident right after the shooting,
did not see <span class="SpellE">Babette</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>
or any other member of the deceased's family anywhere in the vicinity; 14) the
fact that after the shooting only <span class="SpellE">Babette</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span> of the <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>
household was seen with the deceased and the <span class="SpellE">Rey</span> children
at the Medicare Hospital in <span class="SpellE">Roxas</span> City; 15) the fact
that none of the four water containers the deceased allegedly brought with him
to the accused-appellant's backyard faucet was ever found or seen before,
during, or after the shooting; 16) the fact that except for Dr. <span class="SpellE">Buenvenida</span>, all the other four (4) witnesses of the
prosecution concocted some material portions of their testimonies; 17) the fact
that in a small rural town in the interior the inhabitants sup and sleep early;
and 18) the act that it was the night of the town fiesta and older folks tend
to be more security-conscious."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appeal is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The circumstances enumerated by the counsel for the appellant are of
little importance because the accused-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, had admitted having fired the shot that killed
the deceased Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His testimony in court reads, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">Having invoked self-defense, it was incumbent upon the
defendant-appellant to prove by clear and convincing evidence the fact that he
acted in self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant
must rely on the strength of his own evidence and not on the weakness of that
of the prosecution, for even if it were weak, it could not be disbelieved after
the accused himself admitted the killing.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
In this regard, defendant-appellant failed to discharge the burden reposed upon
him by law to prove self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The trial
court found that the testimony of the defendant-appellant gave evasive and
ambiguous answers before the court. <a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
We have examined the record of the case and we find no cogent reason to disturb
said findings of the trial court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
witnesses for the prosecution had no evil motive to testify falsely against the
appellant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides, defendant-appellant's testimony, even if true, does not
establish a case of self-defense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There
is no evidence of unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The defendant-appellant merely testified that
he saw a person open the window of his bedroom and when he inquired who the
person was and received no answer, he fired a shot into the air; then, when
said person lifted his right arm chest high,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
he fired the second shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The interval
between the two shots was only about three (3) to five (5) seconds.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
For unlawful aggression to be appreciated in self-defense, there must be an
actual sudden and unexpected attack or imminent danger thereof, and not merely
a threatening or intimidating attitude.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
The raising of the right arm chest high alone by an unarmed person cannot be
considered unlawful aggression.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Absent
unlawful aggression on the part of the deceased, there cannot be self-defense
on the part of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant-appellant also failed to rebut the presumption that
the shooting was done with criminal intention His conduct after the shooting
incident was inconsistent with the conduct of a person who had innocently shot
a person by accident.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It would appear
that he did not do anything to help his victim who was lying down on the
ground, bleeding and moaning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He did not
go down from his house even after finding that the person he had shot was
Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

Then, very early the next morning, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="17">5:30

<p class="BODY">The defendant-appellant also contends that treachery or <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span> was not charged in the information filed
against him, or proven by the evidence presented by the prosecution at the
trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contention is without merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The information <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">filed </span>in
this case specifically stated that the accused, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">armed </span>with
a .45 caliber pistol, <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and
feloniously shot Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span> "in a sudden
and unexpected manner." This is sufficient allegation of treachery because
a sudden and unexpected attack, without the slightest provocation on the person
of the one attacked is the essence of treachery or <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not necessary that the information
should use specifically the word "<span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span>"
or treachery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient if the
information alleges facts in clear and explicit language which would show
treachery or <span class="SpellE"><u>alevosia</u></span> without the use of the
specific word.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Treachery in the shooting of Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>
was established by the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Babette</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span> who declared that the accused-appellant suddenly
and without warning shot the deceased as the latter was waiting for his pail to
be filled with water and while talking to the son of the
accused-appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The attack was
sudden, unexpected, without warning, and without giving the victim an opportunity
to defend himself or repel the aggression.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, the deceased did not sense any danger that he would be shot by
the defendant-appellant as there was no previous grudge or misunderstanding
between them.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim of the defendant-appellant that he had fired a warning
shot into the air appears to be an afterthought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Babette</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span> categorically declared that her brother, Nicolas <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>, was hit on the first shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony, on cross examination, reads as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>“Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
many shots did <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>
the accused, direct to your brother?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
shots were delivered by <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first shot hit my brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I did not know whether the second shot hit my
brother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the first shot my brother

<p class="BODY">Besides, the shots were fired in rapid succession so that the
first shot could not serve as a warning shot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span class="SpellE">Babette</span> <span class="SpellE">Pagayunan</span>
stated:</p>

<p class="BODY">The defendant-appellant, <span class="SpellE">Saturnino</span> <span class="SpellE">Rey</span>, also testified, as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">As the People's counsel observed, if the version of the
defendant-appellant were true, the empty shell would have fallen near the
defendant-appellant's bed; inside his room, and not outside the house where
Pat. <span class="SpellE">Hanzel</span> <span class="SpellE">Villareal</span> found
it; and that the first shot would have hit a part of the house.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, therefore, correctly found the offense committed
