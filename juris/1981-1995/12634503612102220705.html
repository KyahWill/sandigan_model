				<H3>REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES, PETITIONER, VS.
FLORENTINA C. CAPAROSSO AND HON. HONORATO B. MASAKAYAN, IN HIS CAPACITY AS
JUDGE OF THE COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE OF RIZAL, BRANCH V (QUEZON CITY), RESPONDENTS.

				<BR><STRONG>GUERRERO, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The instant petition seeks to review the decision dated August 7,
1969 of the Court of First Instance of Rizal, Branch V, granting the petition
in Special Pro­ceedings No. Q-10968 filed before it and ordering the Civil
Registrar of Marikina, Rizal to make the neces­sary correction in the register
of birth of minor Victor Uy changing the citizenship or nationality of said
minor appearing therein from "Chinese" to "Filipino".</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears from the records of this case that on April 11, 1967,
private respondent Florentina C. Capa­rosso filed a petition for correction of
registration, alleging <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u> that:</p>

<blockquote>"2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That she is the common-law wife of Benito Uy,
a Chinese citizen and with whom she has been living as such since the year 1951;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
among others, one of their children named VICTOR UY, 10 years of age, was born
at Marikina, Rizal, on April 10, 1956;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
in the Register of Births of the Office of the Local Civil Registrar of the
Municipality of Marikina, Province of Rizal, her said son Victor Uy was inad­vertently
and erroneously registered as a Chinese citizen, despite the fact that the
petitioner has not been married to the father of the child, Benito Uy, who is a
Chinese citizen;</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">&nbsp;</span>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
the rest of the children of the petitioner with her said common-law husband,
namely, Edilberto, 14 yrs; Eliza, 12 yrs.; Emma, 7 yrs.; Norma, 5 yrs.; and
Anita, 3 yrs.; all surnamed Uy, have been registered in the corres­ponding
Register of Births as Filipino citizens;"<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As required by law, the Order setting the initial hearing of the
petition was published once a week for three (3) consecutive weeks in the
Manila Daily Bulletin, a newspaper of general circulation.</p>

<p class="BODY">There being no opposition to the petition when it was published
and announced to the public for initial hearing, the Deputy Clerk of Court was
commissioned to receive and examine the evidence for the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence adduced before the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> shows
that petitioner Florentina C. Caparosso is the common-law wife of Benito Uy, a
Chinese citizen and with whom she has been living since 1951 up to the present;
that out of said union, the petitioner begot seven (7) children, the 7th having
been born on August 15, 1967, after the filing of the instant petition; that all
the children of the petitioner with her common-law husband Benito Uy, with the
exception of Victor Uy, a minor of 10 years old, whose nationality is
"Chinese" in the registry of birth, bear the nationality of
"Filipino" in their respective birth certificates as their mother is
not married to their father; that said erroneous entry in the registry of birth
of minor Victor Uy as a "Chinese" was caused by the wrong information
given by the midwife who attended the petitioner when she gave birth to the
minor; and that so far, no contract or transaction has been entered into the
name of the minor, nor any property has been registered in his name.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated August 7, 1968, the respondent court granted
the petition and accordingly directed the correction in the register of birth
of minor Victor Uy by changing his citizenship or nationality from
"Chinese" to "Filipino", from which order petitioner
Republic of the Philippines appealed to the Supremes Court assigning the
following errors:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The respondent court
erred in finding that there was a mistake in registering Victor Uy as a Chinese
citizen in the Local Register of Marikina, Rizal because no evidence has been
adduced that respondent Florentina C. Caparosso and Benito Uy were not actually
married.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The trial court erred in
holding that the entries in the birth certificate of Victor Uy does not affect
his citizenship and civil status in which case it cannot be corrected in a
summary proceeding like the instant case.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Obviously, a mere cursory reading of the petition will readily
reveal that the fatal infirmity of this petition lies in the impropriety of the
remedy availed of by the private respondent as reflected in the second
issue:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"whether the trial court
erred in holding that the entries in the birth certificate of Victor Uy does
not affect his citizenship and civil status."</p>

<p class="BODY">While ostensively, the action of the private res­pondent seeks a
mere correction of an entry in the Civil Registry, pursuant to Article 412<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Civil Code in relation with Rule 108<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Rules of Court, in effect it requests the judicial declaration of
Philippine citizenship, which We have time and again reprobated and dismissed.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this jurisdiction, it is a well-settled doctrine, unswervingly
followed, that the allowable correction in a civil registry cannot go as far as
to afford a basis for a change of nationality.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As early as 1954, this Court in the leading case of <u>Ty Kong Tin vs.
Republic of the Philippines</u><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
held that the allowable correction under Article 412 of the Civil Code are
"mistakes that are clerical in nature and not those which may affect the
civil status or the nationality or citizenship of the persons involved.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the purpose of the petition is merely to
correct a clerical error, then the court may issue an order in order that the
error or mistake may be corrected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If it
refers to a substantial change, which affects the status or citizenship of a
party, the matter should be threshed out in a proper action depend­ing upon the
nature of the issue involved." Thus, in the subsequent leading case of <u>Chua
Wee vs. Republic</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
We have declared in no uncertain terms that changes in the citizenship of a
person "can only be established in an <u>appropriate adversary proceeding</u>
as a remedy for the adjudication of real and justiciable controversies
involving actual conflict of rights." The <u>raison d'etre</u> is basic
and fundamental, that "the books making up the civil register and all
documents relating thereto shall be considered public documents and shall be
prima facie evidence of the facts therein contained (Article 410, New Civil
Code), and if the entries in the civil regis­ter could be corrected or changed
through a mere sum­mary proceeding, and not through an appropriate action
wherein all parties who may be affected by the entries are notified or
represented, We would set wide open the door to fraud or other mischief, the
consequence of which might be detrimental and far reaching."<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The long line of cases<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
upholding the doctrine set forth in <u>Ty Kong Tin</u> decision is formidable
and well-entrenched, and We find no reason to depart there­from.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Two of the latest cases<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
are 1981 decisions which reaffirmed the same doctrine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such adherence to a doctrine deeply
entrenched in our jurisprudence was emphatically pronounced in the case of <u>Lee
vs. Lee Hian Tiu</u><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
by no less than Justice Fernando, now the Chief Justice, thus:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>"It would be to overturn a long list of
cases, impressive for their number and their unanimity, upholding the <u>Ty
Kong Tin</u> decision, for this petition to prosper. <span style="">&nbsp;</span>To abandon such a doctrine which has in its
favor adherence to a sound policy is unthinkable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Necessarily then, reliance on petitions of
this cha­racter for the far-from-commendable purpose of changing one's
nationality should continue to be frowned upon and discouraged."</p>
