				<H3>JUNIE EVANGELISTA CUA, PETITIONER, VS.
COMMISSION ON ELECTIONS AND RICHARD S. PUZON, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>
				</CENTER>
				<BR><STRONG>PER CURIAM:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">In SPC No. 87-454 and SPC No. 87-467, the First Division of the
COMELEC rendered a 2-1 decision on August 10, 1987, favoring the herein
petitioner <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> but nevertheless suspended his
proclamation as winner in the lone congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> due to the lack of the unanimous vote required by
the procedural rules in COMELEC Resolution No. 1669 dated May 2, 1984.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Pursuant to said rules, private respondent <span class="SpellE">Puzon</span> filed on August 14, 1987 a "motion for
reconsideration/appeal" of the said decision with the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>,
where on October 28, 1987, three members voted to sustain the First Division,
with two dissenting and one abstaining (one member having died earlier).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the strength of this 3-2 vote, <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> moved for his proclamation by the board of canvassers,
which reconvened on <st1:date month="11" day="9" year="1987">November 9, 1987</st1:date>,
and granted <span class="GramE">his</span> motion.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cua</span> took his oath
the same day, but the next day <span class="SpellE">Puzon</span> filed with the
COMELEC an urgent motion to suspend <span class="SpellE">Cua's</span>
proclamation or to annul or suspend its effect if already made.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1987" day="11" month="11">November
 11, 1987</st1:date>, the COMELEC set the motion for hearing and three days later
it issued a restraining telegram enjoining <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> from
assuming the office of member of the House of Representatives.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner then came to this Court to
enjoin the COMELEC from acting on the said motion and enforcing its restraining
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 5 of COMELEC Resolution No. 1669 reads as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 5.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Quorum; votes required; substitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- Two members shall constitute a quorum for
the transaction of the official business of the Division.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"A case being heard by it shall be decided with the unanimous
concurrence of all three Commissioners and its decision shall be considered a
decision of the Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If this
required number is not obtained, as when there is a dissenting opinion, the
case may be appealed to the Commission <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>, in which case the
vote of the majority thereof shall be the decision of the Commission.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The position of the petitioner is that the 2-1 decision of the
First Division was a valid decision of the COMELEC itself despite the above
rule because of Article IX-A. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Section 7
of the new Constitution, providing that "each Commission shall decide by a
majority vote of all its members any case or matter brought before it." He
argues that this applies to the <span class="SpellE">votings</span> of the
COMELEC both in division and <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> and that the private
respondent himself recognized this when he filed the motion for
reconsideration/appeal with the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Cua</span> also contends that <span class="SpellE">Puzon's</span> move, treated as a motion for reconsideration, is
deemed denied for lack of the necessary majority to overturn the challenged
decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As an appeal, it should be
considered dismissed, also for the same reason, resulting in the decision being
regarded as affirmed in accordance with Rule 56, Section 11 of the Rules of
Court applied <span class="SpellE">suppletorily</span>, reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"SEC. 11.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Procedure if opinion is equally divided.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- Where the court en banc is equally divided
in opinion, or the necessary majority cannot be had, the case shall be reheard,
and if on re-hearing no decision is reached, the action shall be dismissed if
originally commenced in the court; in appealed cases, the judgment or order
appealed from shall stand affirmed; and on all incidental matters, the petition
or motion shall be denied."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">For their part, the respondents insist that no decision was reached
by the First Division on <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="8">August 10,
 1987</st1:date>, because the required unanimous vote was not obtained and
there was therefore nothing to be affirmed on appeal by the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u>
and nothing to reconsider either.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Additionally, they argue that in any case no valid decision was reached
by the COMELEC <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> because only three votes were cast in
favor of the petitioner and these did not constitute a majority of the body.</p>

<p class="BODY">After considering the issues and the arguments raised by the
parties, the Court holds that the 2-1 decision rendered by the First Division
was a valid decision under Article IX-A, Section 7 of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the three members who voted to
affirm the First Division constituted a majority of the five members who
deliberated and voted thereon <u>en</u> <u>banc</u> and their decision is also
valid under the <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span> constitutional
provision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the proclamation of <span class="SpellE">Cua</span> on the basis of the two <span class="SpellE">aforecited</span>
decisions was a valid act that entitles him now to assume his seat in the House
of Representatives.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is expected that the above categorical rulings will put an end
to the seemingly interminable debates on this matter that have been festering
for quite some time now not only in this case but also in other cases still
pending in the COMELEC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
indecisiveness of the public respondent in the appreciation and application of
its own rules has seriously prejudiced a considerable number of our people who
remain unrepresented to date in the House of Representatives despite the fact
that the congressional elections were held more than seven months ago.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY,</b> the petition is GRANTED and the public
respondent is enjoined from further proceeding with the private respondent's
motion dated <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="11">November 10, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The restraining order issued by the COMELEC
on November 14, 1987, enjoining petitioner from assuming office as member of
the House of Representatives for the lone congressional district of <span class="SpellE">Quirino</span> is LIFTED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This Resolution is IMMEDIATELY EXECUTORY.</p>
