on Elections (COMELEC) may prohibit the posting of decals and stickers on
"mobile" places, public or private, and limit their location or
publication to the authorized posting areas that it fixes.</p>

<p class="BODY">On January 13, 1992, the COMELEC promulgated Resolution No. 2347

<p class="BODY">Petitioner Blo Umpar Adiong, a senatorial candidate in the May
11, 1992 elections now assails the COMELEC's Resolution insofar as it prohibits
the posting of decals <span style="">and stickers in
"mobile" places like cars and other moving vehicles.  According to him such prohibition is
violative of Section 82 of the Omnibus Election Code and Section 11(a) of
Republic Act No. 6646.  In addition, the
petitioner believes that with the ban on radio, television and print political
advertisements, he, being a neophyte in the field of politics stands to suffer
grave and irreparable injury with this prohibition.  The posting of decals and stickers on cars and other moving
vehicles would be his last medium to inform the electorate that he is a
senatorial candidate in the May 11, 1992 elections.  Finally, the petitioner states that as of February 22, 1992 (the
date of the petition) he has not received any notice from any of the Election
Registrars in the entire country as to the location of the supposed
"Comelec Poster Areas."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The petition is impressed with merit.  The COMELEC's prohibition on posting of decals and stickers on
"mobile" places whether public or private except in designated areas
provided for by the COMELEC itself is null and void on constitutional grounds.</p>

<p class="BODY">First -- the prohibition unduly infringes on the citizen's
fundamental right of free speech enshrined in<span style=""> the Constitution (Sec. 4, Article III).  There is no public interest substantial enough to warrant the
kind of restriction involved in this case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are various concepts surrounding the freedom of speech
clause which we have adopted as part and parcel of our own Bill of Rights
provision on this basic freedom.</p>

<p class="BODY">All of the protections expressed in the Bill of Rights are
important but we have accorded to free speech the status of a preferred
freedom.  (Thomas v. Collins, 323 US
516, 89 L. Ed. 430 [1945]; Mutuc v. Commission on Elections, 36 SCRA 228
[1970])</p>

<p class="BODY">This qualitative significance of freedom of expression arises
from the fact that it is the matrix, the indispensable condition of nearly
every other freedom.  (Palko v.
Connecticut 302 U.S. 319 [1937]; Salonga v. PaÃ±o, 134 SCRA 438 [1985]) It is
difficult to imagine how the other provisions of the Bill of Rights and the
right to free elections may be guaranteed if the freedom to speak and to
convince or persuade is denied and taken away.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have adopted the principle that debate on public issues should
be uninhibited, robust, and wide open and that it may well include vehement,
caustic and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public
officials.  (New York Times Co. v.
Sullivan 376 U.S. 254, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686 [1964]; cited in the concurring <span style="">opinion </span>of then Chief Justice Enrique
Fernando in Babst v. National Intelligence Board, 132 SCRA 316 [1984]) Too many
restrictions will deny to people the robust, uninhibited, and wide open debate,
the generating of interest essential if our elections will truly be free,
clean, and honest.</p>

<p class="BODY">We have also ruled that the preferred freedom of expression calls
all the more for the utmost respect when what may be curtailed is the
dissemination of <span style="">information to make
more meaningful the equally vital right of suffrage.  (Mutuc v. Commission on Elections, <u>supra</u>)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The determination of the limits of the Government's power to
regulate the exercise by a citizen of his basic freedoms in order to promote
fundamental public interests or policy objectives is always a difficult and
delicate task.  The so-called balancing
of interests - individual freedom on one hand and substantial public interests
on the other - is made even more difficult in election campaign cases because
the Constitution also gives specific authority to the Commission on Elections
to supervise the conduct of free, honest, and orderly elections.</p>

<p class="BODY">We recognize the fact that under the Constitution, the COMELEC
during the election period is granted regulatory powers vis-a-vis the conduct
and manner of elections, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 4. The Commission may, during the election period
supervise or regulate the enjoyment or utilization of all franchises or permits
for the operation of transportation and other public utilities, media of
communication or information, all grants special privileges, or concessions
granted by the Government or any subdivision, agency, or <span style="">instrumentality thereof, including any
government-owned or controlled corporation or its subsidiary.  Such supervision or regulation shall aim to
ensure equal opportunity, time, and space, and the right to reply, including
reasonable equal rates therefore, for public information campaigns and forms
among candidates in connection with the object of holding free, orderly,
honest, peaceful and credible elections." (Article IX(c) section 4)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The variety of opinions
expressed by the members of this Court in the recent case of <u>National</u> <u>Press</u>
<u>Club</u> <u>v.</u> <u>Commission</u></span><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">on</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Elections</span></u><span style=""> </span>(G.
R. No. 102653, March 5, 1991) and its companion cases underscores how difficult
it is to draw a dividing line between permissible regulation of election
campaign activities and indefensible repression committed in the name of free
and honest elections.  In the <u><span style="">National</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Press</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Club</span></u><span style=""> </span>case,
the Court had occasion to reiterate the preferred status of freedom of
expression even as it validated COMELEC regulation of campaigns through
political advertisements.  The gray area
is rather wide and we have to go on a case to case basis.</p>

<p class="BODY">  There is another problem
involved.  Considering that the period
of legitimate campaign activity is fairly limited and, in the opinion of some,
too short, it becomes obvious that unduly restrictive regulations may prove
unfair to affected parties and the electorate.</p>

<p class="BODY">For persons who have to resort to judicial action to strike down
requirements which they deem inequitable or oppressive, a court case may prove
to be a hollow remedy.  The judicial
process, by its very nature, requires time for rebuttal, analysis and
reflection.  We cannot act instantly on
knee-jerk impulse.  By the time we
revoke an unallowably restrictive regulation or ruling, time which is of the
essence to a candidate may have lapsed and irredeemable opportunities may have
been lost.</p>

<p class="BODY">When faced with border line situations where freedom to speak by
a candidate or party and freedom to know on the part of the electorate are
invoked against actions intended for maintaining clean and free elections, the
police, local officials and COMELEC should lean in favor of freedom.  For in the ultimate analysis, the freedom of
the citizen and the State's power to regulate are not antagonistic.  There can be no free and honest elections if
in the efforts to maintain them, the freedom to speak and the right to know are
unduly curtailed.</p>

<p class="BODY">There were a variety of opinions expressed in the <u>National</u>
<u>Press</u> <u>Club</u> <u>v.</u><span style=""> </span><u>Commission</u>
<u>on</u> <u>Elections</u><span style=""> </span>(<u>supra</u>)
case but all of us were unanimous that regulation of election activity has its
limits.  We examine the limits of
regulation and not the limits of free speech.  The carefully worded opinion of the Court, through Mr. Justice
Feliciano, shows that regulation of election campaign activity may not pass the
test of validity if it is too general in its terms or not limited in time and
scope in its application, if it restricts one's expression of belief in a
candidate or one's opinion of his or her qualifications, if it cuts off the
flow of media reporting, and if the regulatory measure bears no clear and
reasonable nexus with the constitutionally sanctioned objective.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even as the Court sustained the regulation of political
advertisements, with some rather strong dissents, in <u><span style="">National</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Press</u>
<u>Club</u>, we find the regulation in the present case of a different
category.  The promotion of a
substantial Government interest is not clearly shown.</p>

<blockquote>"A government regulation is sufficiently justified if it is
within the constitutional power of the Government, if it furthers an important
or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated
to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on
alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the
furtherance of that interest. (Id., at 377, 20 L Ed 2d 672, 88 S Ct 1673."
(City Council v. Taxpayers For Vincent, 466 US 789, 80 L Ed 2d 772, 104 S Ct
2118 [1984])</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The posting of decals and stickers in mobile places like cars and
other moving vehicles does not endanger any substantial government
interest.  There is no clear public
interest threatened by such activity so as to justify the curtailment of the
cherished citizen's right of free speech and expression.  Under the clear and present danger rule not
only must the danger be patently clear and pressingly present but the evil
sought to be avoided must be so substantive as to justify a clamp over one's
mouth or a writing instrument to be stilled:</p>

<blockquote>"The case confronts us again with the duty our system places
on the Court to say where the individual's freedom ends and the State's power
begins.  Choice on that border, now as
always delicate, is perhaps more so where the usual presumption supporting
legislation is balanced by the preferred place given in our scheme to the great,
the indispensable democratic freedoms secured by the First Amendment x <span style="">x x </span>That priority gives these
liberties a sanctity and a sanction not permitting dubious intrusions and it is
the character of the right, not of the limitation, which determines what
standard governs the choice <span style="">x x x.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><u>For</u> <u>these</u> <u>reasons</u> <u>any</u> <u>attempt</u> <u>to</u>
<u>restrict</u> <u>those</u> <u>liberties</u> <u>must</u> <u>be</u> <u>justified</u>
<u>by</u> <u>clear</u> <u>public</u> <u>interest,</u> <u>threatened</u> <u>not</u>
<u>doubtfully</u> <u>or</u> <u>remotely,</u> <u>but</u> <u>by</u> <u>clear</u> <u>and</u>
<u>present</u> <u>danger</u>.  The rational
connection between the remedy provided and the evil to be curbed, which in
other context might support legislation against attack on due process grounds,
will not suffice.  These rights rest on
firmer foundation.  Accordingly,
whatever occasion would restrain orderly discussion and persuasion, at
appropriate time and place, must have clear support in public danger, actual or
impending.  Only the greatest abuses,
endangering permanent interests, give occasion for permissible limitation.  (Thomas V. Collins, 323 US 516 [1945]."
(Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Significantly, the freedom of expression curtailed by the
questioned prohibition <span style="">is </span>not so
much that of the candidate or the political party.  The regulation strikes at the freedom of an individual to express
his preference and, by displaying it on his car, to convince others to agree
with him.  A sticker may be furnished by
a candidate but once the car owner <span style="">agrees
</span>to have it placed on his private vehicle, the expression becomes <span style="">a </span>statement by the owner, primarily
his own and not of anybody else.  If, <span style="">in </span>the <u><span style="">National</span></u><span style=""> <u>Press</u>
</span><u>Club</u> case, the Court was careful to rule out restrictions on
reporting by newspapers or radio and television stations and commentators or
columnists as long as these <span style="">are </span>not
covertly paid-for advertisements or purchased opinions with <span style="">less </span>reason can we sanction the
prohibition against a sincere <span style="">manifestation
</span>of support and a proclamation of belief by an individual person who
pastes a sticker or decal on his private property.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second -- the questioned prohibition premised on the statute and
as couched in the resolution is void for overbreadth.</p>

<p class="BODY">A statute is considered void for overbreadth when "it
offends the constitutional principle that <span style="">a
</span>governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally
subject to state regulations may not be achieved by means which sweep
unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."
(Zwickler v. Koota, 19 L ed 2d 444 [1967]).</p>

<blockquote>"In a series of decisions this Court has held that, even
though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose
cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties
when the end can be more narrowly achieved.  The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of
less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In Lovell v. Griffin, 303 US 444, 82 L ed 949, 58 S Ct 666, the
Court invalidated an ordinance prohibiting all distribution of literature at
any time or place in Griffin, Georgia, without a license, pointing out that so
broad an interference was unnecessary to accomplish legitimate municipal
aims.  In Schneider v. Irvington, 308 US
147, 84 L ed 155, 60 S Ct 146, the Court dealt with ordinances of four
different municipalities which either banned or imposed prior restraints upon
the distribution of handbills.  In
holding the ordinances invalid, the court noted that where legislative
abridgment of â€˜fundamental personal rights and libertiesâ€™ is asserted, 'the
courts should be astute to examine the effect of the challenged
legislation.  Mere legislative
preferences or beliefs respecting matters of pubic convenience may well support
regulation directed at other personal activities, but be insufficient to
justify such as diminishes the exercise of rights so vital to the maintenance
of democratic institutions.' 308 US, at 161.  In Cantwell v Connecticut, 310 US 296, 84 L ed 1213, 60 S Ct 900, 128
ALR 1352, the Court said that '[c]onduct remains subject to regulation for the
protection of society,' but pointing out that in each case â€˜the power to
regulate must be so exercised as not, in attaining a permissible end, unduly to
infringe the protected freedom." (310 US at 304) (Shelton v. Tucker, 364
US 479 [1960]</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The resolution prohibits the posting of decals and stickers not
more than eight and one-half (8-1/2) inches in width and fourteen (14) inches
in length <u><span style="">in</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>any</u> <u><span style="">place,</span></u><span style=""> <u>including</u>
<u>mobile</u> <u>places</u> </span>whether public or private except in areas
designated by the COMELEC.  Verily, the
restriction as to where the decals and stickers should be posted is so broad
that it encompasses even the citizen's private property, which in this case is
a privately-owned vehicle.  In
consequence of this prohibition, another cardinal rule prescribed by the
Constitution would be violated.  Section
1, Article III of the Bill of Rights provides that no person shall be deprived
of his property without due process of law:</p>

<blockquote>"Property is more than the mere thing which a person owns, it
includes the right to acquire, <u>use</u>, and dispose of it; and the
Constitution, in the 14th Amendment, protects these essential attributes.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Property is more than the mere thing which a person owns.  It is elementary that it includes the right
to acquire, use, and dispose of it.  The
Constitution protects these essential attributes of property.  Holden v. Hardy, 169 U.S. 366, 391, 41 L.
ed. 780, 790, 18 Sup. Ct. Rep. 383.  Property consists of the free use, enjoyment, and disposal of a person's
acquisitions without control or diminution save by the law of the land.  1 Cooley's Bl. Com. 127." (Buchanan v.
Warley 245 <span style="">US </span>60 [1917])</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As earlier stated, we have to consider the fact that in the
posting of decals and stickers on cars and other moving vehicles, the candidate
needs the consent of the owner of the vehicle.  In such a case, the prohibition <span style="">would
not </span>only <span style="">deprive the owner </span>who
consents to such posting of the decals and stickers the use of his property but
more important, in the process, it would deprive the citizen of his right to
free speech and information:</p>

<blockquote>"Freedom to distribute information to every citizen wherever
he desires to receive it is so clearly vital to the preservation of a free
society that, putting aside reasonable police and health regulations of time
and manner of distribution, it must be fully preserved.  The danger of distribution can so easily be
controlled by traditional legal methods leaving to each householder the full
right to decide whether he will receive strangers as visitors, that stringent
prohibition can serve no purpose but that forbidden by the constitution, the
naked restriction of the dissemination of ideas." (Martin v. City of
Struthers, Ohio, 319 U.S. 141; 87 L. ed. 1313 [1943])</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The right to property may be subject to a greater degree of
regulation but when this right is joined by a "liberty" interest, the
burden of justification on the part of the Government must be exceptionally
convincing and irrefutable.  The burden
is not met in this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 11 of Rep. Act 6646 is so encompassing and invasive that
it prohibits the posting or display <span style="">of </span>election
propaganda in any place, whether public or private, except in the common poster
areas sanctioned by COMELEC.  This means
that a private person cannot post his own crudely prepared personal poster on
his own front door or on a post in his yard.  While the COMELEC will certainly never require the absurd, there are no
limits to what overzealous and partisan police officers, armed with a copy of
the statute or regulation, may do.</p>

<p class="BODY">The provisions allowing regulation are so loosely worded that
they include the posting of decals or stickers in the privacy of one's living
room or bedroom.  This is delegation
running riot.  As stated by <span style="">Justice </span>Cardozo in his concurrence in <u><span style="">Panama</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">Refining</span></u><span style=""> <u>Co.</u> <u>v.</u> </span><u><span style="">Ryan</span></u><span style=""> </span>(293 U.S. 388; 79 L. Ed. 446 [1935]), "The delegated power
is unconfined and vagrant . . . This is delegation running riot.  No such plentitude of power is susceptible
of transfer."</p>

<p class="BODY">Third -- the constitutional objective to give a rich candidate
and a poor candidate equal opportunity to inform the electorate as regards
their candidacies, mandated by Article II Section 26 and Article XIII section 1
in relation to Article IX (c) section 4 of the Constitution, is not impaired by
posting decals and stickers on cars and other private vehicles.  Compared to the paramount interest of the
State in guaranteeing freedom of expression, any financial considerations
behind the regulation are of marginal significance.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under section 26 Article II of the Constitution, "The State
shall guarantee <u><span style="">equal</span></u><span style=""> <u>access</u> </span>to opportunities for
public service, x x x while under section 1, Article XIII thereof "The
Congress shall give highest priority to the enactment of measures that protect
and enhance the right of all the people to human dignity, reduce social,
economic, and <u><span style="">political</span></u><span style=""> <u>inequalities</u>, </span>and remove
cultural inequities by equitably diffusing wealth and political power for the
common good." (Emphasis supplied)</p>

<p class="BODY">It is to<span style=""> </span>be
reiterated that the posting of decals and stickers <span style="">on </span>cars, calesas, tricycles, pedicabs and other moving vehicles
needs the <u><span style="">consent</span></u><span style=""> </span>of the owner of the vehicle.  Hence, the preference of the citizen becomes
crucial in this kind of election propaganda not the financial resources of the
candidate.  Whether the candidate is
rich and, therefore, can afford to dole-out more decals and stickers or poor
and without the means to spread out the same number of decals and stickers is
not as important as the right of the owner to freely express his choice and
exercise his right of free speech.  The
owner can even prepare his own decals or stickers for posting on his personal
property.  To strike down this right and
enjoin it is impermissible encroachment of his liberties.</p>

<p class="BODY">In sum, the prohibition on posting of decals and stickers on
"mobile" places whether public or private except in the authorized
areas designated by the COMELEC becomes censorship which cannot be justified by
the Constitution:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x The concept of the<span style="">
</span>Constitution as the fundamental law, setting forth the criterion for the
validity of any public act whether proceeding from the highest official or the
lowest functionary, is a postulate of our system of government.  That is to manifest fealty to the rule of
law, with priority accorded to that which occupies the topmost rung in the
legal hierarchy.  The three departments
of government in the discharge of the functions with which it is entrusted have
no choice but to yield obedience to its commands.  Whatever limits it imposes must be observed.  Congress in the enactment of statutes must
ever be on guard lest the restrictions on its authority, either substantive or
formal, be transcended.  The Presidency
in the execution of the <span style="">laws </span>cannot
ignore or disregard what it ordains.  In
its task of<span style=""> </span>applying the law to
the facts as found in deciding cases, <span style="">the
</span>judiciary is called upon to maintain inviolate what is decreed by the
fundamental law.  Even its power of
judicial review to pass upon the validity of the acts of the coordinate
branches in the course of adjudication is a logical corollary of this basic
principle that the Constitution is paramount.  It overrides any governmental measure that fails to live up to its mandates.  Thereby there is a recognition of its being
the supreme law." (Mutuc v. Commission on Elections, <u>supra</u>)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The unusual circumstances of this yearâ€™s national and local
elections call for a more liberal interpretation of the freedom to speak and
the right to know.  It is not alone the
widest possible dissemination of information on platforms and programs which
concern us.  Nor are we limiting
ourselves to protecting the unfettered interchange of ideas to bring about
political change.  (Cf. New York Times
v. Sullivan, <u>supra</u>) The big number of candidates and elective positions
involved has resulted in the peculiar situation where almost all voters cannot
name half or even two-thirds of the candidates running for Senator.  The public does not know <u>who</u> are
aspiring to be elected to public office.</p>

<p class="BODY">There are many candidates whose names alone evoke qualifications,
platforms, programs and ideologies which the voter may accept or reject.  When a person attaches a sticker with such a
candidate's name on his car bumper, he is expressing more than the name; he is
espousing ideas.  Our review of the
validity of the challenged regulation includes its effects in today's
particular circumstances.  We are
constrained to rule against the COMELEC prohibition.</p>

<p class="BODY">  <b>WHEREFORE</b>, the
petition is hereby GRANTED.  The portion
of Section 15(a) of Resolution No. 2347 of the Commission on Elections
providing that "decals and stickers may be posted only in any of the
authorized posting areas provided in paragraph (f) of Section 21 hereof"
is DECLARED NULL and VOID.</p>

<div class="Section1">

<p class="OTHERHEADING">CONCURRING</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING">CRUZ, <i style="">J</i>.:</p>

<p class="BODY">I join Mr. Justice Gutierrez and reiterate the views expressed in
my dissent in National Press Club v. Commission on Elections. The stand taken
by the Court in the case at bar is a refreshing change from its usual deferential
attitude toward authoritarianism as a persistent vestige of the past regime.
After the disappointing decision in the ad ban case, I hope that the present
decision will guide us to the opposite direction, toward liberty and the full
recognition of freedom of expression. This decision is a small step in
rectifying the errors of the past, but it is a step just the same, and on the
right track this time.</p>

<p class="BODY">Regarding the sticker ban, I think we are being swamped with
regulations that unduly obstruct the free flow of information so vital in an
election campaign. The Commission on Elections seems to be bent on muzzling the
candidates and imposing all manner of silly restraints on their efforts to
reach the electorate. Reaching the electorate is precisely the purpose of an
election campaign, but the Commission on Elections obviously believes that the
candidates should be as quiet as possible. </p>

<p class="BODY">Instead of limiting the dissemination of information on the
election issues and the qualifications of those vying for public office, what
the Commission on Elections should concentrate on is the <u>education</u> of
the voters on the proper exercise of their suffrages. This function is part of
its constitutional duty to supervise and regulate elections and to prevent them
from deteriorating into popularity contests where the victors are chosen on the
basis not of their platforms and competence but on their ability to sing or
dance, or play a musical instrument, or shoot a basketball, or crack a toilet
joke, or exhibit some such dubious talent irrelevant to their ability to
discharge a public office. The public service is threatened with mediocrity and
indeed sheer ignorance if not stupidity. That is the problem the Commission on
Elections should try to correct instead of wasting its time on much
trivialities as where posters shall be allowed and stickers should not be
attached and speeches may be delivered.</p>

<p class="BODY">The real threat in the present election is the influx of the
unqualified professional entertainers whose only asset is the support of their
drooling fans, the demagogues who drumbeat to the clink of coins their
professed present virtues and past innocence, the opportunists for whom
flexibility is a means of political survival and even of financial gain, and,
most dangerous of all, the elements of our electorate who would, with their
mindless ballots, impose these office-seekers upon the nation. These are the
evils the Commission on Elections should try to correct, not the
inconsequential and inane question of where stickers should be stuck. I have
nothing but praise for the zeal of the Commission on Elections in pursuing the
ideal of democratic elections, but I am afraid it is barking up the wrong tree.</p>
