which was Holy Thursday, Soledad <span class="SpellE">Tante</span> Linn Hayashi, together
with her children Sheila Linn Hayashi who was nine (9) years old and Mary Jo
Ann <span class="SpellE">Tante</span> (Jenny), and a companion <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> <span class="SpellE">Ca√±ones</span> went to their <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span> at Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tagalag</span>,
Valenzuela, <span class="GramE">Metro</span> Manila as there was a "<span class="SpellE">pabasa</span>." The caretaker of the <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span>
and their fishpond was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">a </span>certain
Linda <span class="SpellE">Salita</span> who lives in a house nearby.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>,
nicknamed Carding, is the son of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Tinay</span> and <span class="SpellE">Mang</span> <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">Narcing</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">, </span>brother of Linda <span class="SpellE">Salita</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the "<span class="SpellE">pabasa</span>"
was finished on Good Friday, <st1:city><st1:place>Soledad</st1:place></st1:city>
went home to their residence at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and left her children Sheila and Jenny with <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span>
at their rest house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They were entrusted
to the care and custody of Linda.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">afternoon </span>of
that day, Good Friday, while Sheila was in the veranda of their <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span> watching a person catching fish nearby, Carding
approached her and cuddled her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
inserted one of his fingers inside her vagina.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He also kissed her several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After that Linda told them to go to sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carding slept in the <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span>
at the room next to where Sheila and her sister slept.</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, Holy Saturday, between two and three in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>afternoon while Sheila was reading
a comic magazine inside the room in the <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span>,
Carding went inside the room and closed the windows and door.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was also reading another comic magazine
but it did not take long as he put it down and sat beside her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He got the magazine she was reading and threw
it away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then he let her face him and he
pulled down her green <span class="SpellE">bermuda</span> pants to her knees
while he removed his pants, Carding let her face him and he opened her thighs
in front of him which he placed as close to the top of his thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He inserted his penis into her private
part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While his private part was inside
hers he moved her up and down like a horse (<span class="SpellE">niyuyugyog</span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her buttocks and vagina were painful and
Carding repeatedly kissed her.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She cried
in pain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Carding was sitting down while
she was on top of his thighs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Afterwards
he put her down and told her not to tell anybody what had happened or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">else </span>he will kill her and her
mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then she put up her pants,
opened the door and ran away to the place where Jenny was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her buttocks and vagina were painful and
aching and it was difficult for her to urinate.</p>

<p class="BODY">Carding remained in the <span class="SpellE">resthouse</span> and
slept.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the afternoon of the following
day, Sheila and Jenny were fetched so they returned to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Jenny then told their mother that Sheila had
blood stains in her pants and they told her that she was abused by
Carding.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When <st1:city><st1:place>Soledad</st1:place></st1:city>
inspected her vagina and saw blood and puss in it she immediately brought her
to the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Makati</span></st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Medical</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Center</st1:placetype></st1:place>
but she was not treated there.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
advice they proceeded to the CIS where she was examined and investigated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There she gave a sworn statement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sheila identified Carding as the person who
raped her.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In due course a criminal complaint for rape was filed against
Ricardo <span class="SpellE">Salita</span> by Soledad <span class="SpellE">Tante</span>
Linn Hayashi, mother of the victim, in the Regional Trial Court of Valenzuela,
Metro Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon arraignment <span class="SpellE">Salita</span> entered a plea of not guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After trial on the merits a decision was
rendered on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="7">July 23, 1986</st1:date>
finding him guilty of the offense charged and sentencing him to <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">reclusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>perpetua</u></span>, </span>to pay the offended
party Sheila Linn Hayashi damages in the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">of </span>P30<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> and to pay the costs.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, the herein appeal wherein the accused interposed the
following assignment of errors allegedly committed by the trial court:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">"I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> SERIOUSLY ERRED IN GIVING CREDIT TO THE

<p class="NUMROMANS"><span style="font-weight:normal;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">III<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER
  COURT</st1:address></st1:street> SERIOUSLY ERRED AND GRAVELY ABUSED ITS
DISCRETION IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT AND IN NOT ACQUITTING HIM ON
GROUNDS OF REASONABLE DOUBT."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The appellant alleges that the prosecution failed to establish
that the complainant Soledad <span class="SpellE">Tante</span> Linn Hayashi is
the mother of the offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Besides the testimony of <st1:city><st1:place>Soledad</st1:place></st1:city>
herself to the effect that Sheila is her daughter, the prosecution presented
the birth <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">certificate </span>of Sheila
attesting to this fact.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Indeed, the appellant himself acknowledged on the witness stand that the victim
is the daughter of the complainant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Under Section 5, Rule 110 of the Rules of Court when the offended
party who is a minor fails to file the complaint, her parents, grandparents or
guardian may file the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
complaint therefore was appropriately filed in this case by the mother of the
offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">The main thrust of the defense is the matter of credibility of
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellant claims that
considering the height of the appellant and the offended party, the rape could
not have been committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">From <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the </span>evidence
on hand it appears that the appellant placed the offended party on top of his thighs
and after inserting his penis in her vagina caused the offended party to move
up and down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Their difference in height
was of no moment for the rape to be consummated under the circumstances.</p>

<p class="BODY">The testimony of the offended party is clear and spontaneous.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is the revelation of an innocent child
whose chastity was abused by appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It deserves full credence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She is
corroborated by her sister Jenny who got <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">suspicious
</span>when she saw the appellant enter the room where Sheila was.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She ran around the house and saw through a
hole in the window that the appellant was kissing and embracing Sheila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, when the appellant stood up Jenny
ran away.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon the return of Sheila and Jenny to <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
they reported to their mother <st1:city><st1:place>Soledad</st1:place></st1:city>
what happened to Sheila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><st1:city><st1:place>Soledad</st1:place></st1:city>
saw Sheila's pair of pants stained with blood and sensed that her vagina not
only had a foul odor but likewise discharged blood and yellowish matter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She wasted no time <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
17.0pt">in </span>having her medically examined after which she filed the
complaint.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">On </span>the other hand,
the defense of the appellant is alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This defense cannot prevail in the light of his positive identification
as the culprit by the prosecution witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The appellant claimed that on that fateful afternoon he was allegedly
detaching the amplifier and sound system which were used in the "<span class="SpellE">pabasa</span>" and that the victim was playing with his two
nieces.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, it was not
physically impossible for him to have gone to the rest house to commit the rape
and thereafter return to the place where the chairs, tables and sound system
were.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the whole, the Court finds no reason to overturn the findings
of the court <u>a</u> <u>q</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">uo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>as to the credibility of the
witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the conviction of the
appellant for the offense charged is clearly supported by the evidence and the
applicable law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This heinous offense
against a nine-year old child must be vindicated.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the judgment appealed from is AFFIRMED <u>in</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> with costs against appellant.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
