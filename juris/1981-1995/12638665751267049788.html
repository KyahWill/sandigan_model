				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The appellants seek a reversal of the decision of the Regional
Trial Court (RTC) of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>,
4th Judicial Region, Branch <span style="">48, </span>finding
them guilty <span style="">of the crime </span>of rape
with homicide, with the aggravating circumstances of robbery in band, taking
advantage of nighttime, recidivism, abuse of superior <span style="">strength </span>and craft.</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts for the prosecution are summarized by the Solicitor
General, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"On <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="12">December 28,
 1969</st1:date>, the M/L Elsa left <st1:place><st1:placename>Puerto</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Princesa</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>
for <span class="SpellE">Dumaran</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Palawan</span></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On board were <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nadayao</span>, the patron of the vessel; <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> and two other
crew members; and thirteen (13) passengers among whom were <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>, Daisy Gonzales, Josie Gonzales, Yolanda
Argue, <span class="SpellE">Wenifredo</span> <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>,
a certain <span class="SpellE">Bunag</span> and several children ranging from two
(2) to nine (9) years of age.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All in
all, 17 persons were on board M/L Elsa with some cargoes consisting of liquor
like <span class="SpellE">tanduay</span>, beer, coke, etc.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The vessel left Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span>
at 3:00 o'clock in the morning, navigating towards the lighthouse but due to
big waves and strong winds, the launch was forced to seek shelter at <span class="SpellE">Balon</span>, Sta. Lucia, Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span>
City, arriving thereat about 6 to 7:00 o'clock in the morning where they were
stranded because of the bad weather and the damaged rudder of the launch. <span class="GramE">(TSN, 2-18-70, pp. 169-176).</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>While at the aforementioned place, near the site of the Sta. Lucia
Penal Colony, in the afternoon between one and <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">three
 o'clock</st1:time>, two persons went aboard <span style="">the </span>M/L Elsa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
identified by Josie Gonzales as <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span> and Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span>, and
after <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span> <span class="SpellE">Severino</span>
handed to them the liquor they left the launch (TSN, 8-26-70, pp. 437-442).</blockquote>

<blockquote>It was later established that said two accused together with the
other four, namely:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>, Rodolfo Sales, Roberto <span style="">Aguirre </span>and Eduardo Mendoza, all convicts - colonists <span style="">of </span>Sta. Lucia Penal Colony, had <span style="">been </span>drinking liquor (<span class="SpellE">tanduay</span>) since the morning of December 28, 1969 even as
they hatched the plan to escape from the Penal Colony with the use of M/L
Elsa.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buying of the <span class="SpellE">tanduay</span> served also the purpose of acquainting the herein
accused that the crew and passengers of M/L Elsa <span style="">were </span>innocent, peaceful and unarmed (TSN, 11-26-40, pp. 307-312).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Between 7 and <st1:time minute="0" hour="8">8 o'clock</st1:time> in
the evening of the same day, the six <span style="">accused
</span>carried out their agreed plan to escape and, fully armed with pistols
and <span class="SpellE">boloes</span>, they boarded the launch bringing with
them chicken and dried fish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon
boarding the launch, they placed themselves in strategic positions.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> talked to
the patron of the launch who ordered the engine operator, <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>
<span class="SpellE">Severino</span>, to fetch four bottles of <span class="SpellE">tanduay</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in
the act of handing the <span class="SpellE">tanduay</span> to <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>,
the latter suddenly thrust his bolo at <span class="SpellE">Severino's</span>
abdomen, at the same time pointing a pistol at him shouting '<span class="SpellE">walang</span> <span class="SpellE">kikilos</span>' (nobody
moves).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted <span class="SpellE">Severino</span> to jump immediately into the sea, after seeing
also the rest of the accused draw their bolos.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Witnessing all these hostile acts and having evaded a stab by Rodolfo
Sales who nevertheless chased him, <span class="SpellE">Catalino</span> <span class="SpellE">Nadayao</span> was constrained to jump overboard.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some passengers and the rest of the crew who
were frightened by the shouting of <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> and the
ensuing commotion likewise jumped into the sea (TSN 2-20-70, pp. 183-193;
3-17-70, pp. 196-197).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Among the
passengers who jumped overboard were Daisy Gonzales and Yolanda <span class="SpellE">Arque</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Only five persons were left in the launch <span class="GramE">who</span>
did not jump overboard. Josie Gonzales tried to jump overboard but Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>, one of the accused, prevented her by holding both
arms.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
pulled and dragged her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Josie struggled
to free herself but to no avail.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> succeeded in dragging her over the cargoes where
he pinned her down.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While in that lying
position he forcibly raped her for about five to ten minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that time, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
was pointing a gun at Josie's head.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> was through, Rodolfo Sales
approached her, took off his pants and <span class="GramE">laid</span> on top of
her for about 3 to 5 minutes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
time Sales was 'raping Josie, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> was still
holding her and pointing a gun at her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>After Sales, <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span>
approached her and likewise raped her.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Josie tried to evade but she was already weak and only felt <span style="">pain </span>(TSN, 8-26-70, pp. 458-463;
8-27-90, pp. 1-23).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the other hand, <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> likewise attempted to jump but <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
also held her at the back portion <span style="">of </span>her
dress and <span style="">told </span>her to return to
the place where she and the other children were originally hiding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She saw the accused ransacking the cargoes
and taking the contents thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moments
later, Roberto Aguirre then <span style="">with </span>a
pistol held <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> on the shoulders while Eduardo
Mendoza held her legs and wrestled her down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Aguirre had sexual intercourse with her followed by <st1:city><st1:place>Mendoza</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span>
brought her out toward a <span class="SpellE">sawali</span> and right there and
then made her lay down in a slanting position.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span> was having sexual intercourse with
her, nobody was holding her but she could no longer resist as she was already
exhausted and weak (TSN, 11-16-70, pp. 147-167).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, the six accused left the launch and boarded their <span class="SpellE">banca</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
Josie and <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> together with the children jumped
into the water and swam to the <span class="SpellE"><u>bakawan</u></span> to
hide.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were rescued by the â€˜<span class="SpellE">Baracuda</span> Launch.' In the process, the dead bodies of Daisy
Gonzales and Yolanda Argue were found.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Necropsy examination on the cadavers of Daisy and Yolanda showed
that both died of suffocation by drowning as blood was coming out from their
nose, mouth, and opening of both ears due to rapture of <span class="SpellE">tempanic</span>
membrane (TSN, 2-17-70, pp. 109-124).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Dr. <span class="SpellE">DueÃ±as</span>, the examining physician,
likewise found that Josie Gonzales and <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> both had undergone sexual penetration recently.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, both Josie Gonzales and <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> filed separate complaints charging the
herein six accused with the crimes of Rape with Homicide and Robbery in
Band." (Brief for the plaintiff-<span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, pp,
2-8, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 334)</blockquote>

Sales and <span class="SpellE">Manolo</span> <span class="SpellE">Espino</span>
stated briefly hereunder as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="9">9:00 o'clock</st1:time> <span style="">in </span>the morning of <st1:date year="1969" day="28" month="12">December 28, 1969</st1:date>, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
and Roberto Aguirre left their <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut at Santa
Lucia Penal Colony and went to the Prison Brigade of the said colony to get their
dirty clothes.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the brigade they met
three (3) private persons, passengers or crews of Motor<span style=""> </span>Launch 'Elsa'.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were
eating '<span class="SpellE">Camote</span> Cassava' with the <span class="SpellE">Capataz</span>
of the colony on duty, a certain person called Rudy.</blockquote>

<blockquote>From the brigade, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> and Aguirre
proceeded to the hut of <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There they saw <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span>
<span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span>, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span>,
Rodolfo Sales and Eduardo Mendoza drinking <span class="SpellE">tanduay</span>
which were brought to <span class="SpellE">Rebutido's</span> hut by the three (3)
private persons from the Motor Launch 'Elsa'.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="18">6:00 o'clock</st1:time> in
the afternoon of the same date, Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> and
his companions returned to the colony brigade for the usual daily checking and
counting of prisoners.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After the
checking-up, the group returned to the <span class="SpellE">nipa</span> hut of <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span> and there
planned to escape from the Sta. Lucia Penal Colony situated in Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Palawan</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They agreed to hire the Motor Launch 'Elsa'
anchored about ten <span style="">(10) </span>arms
length from the wharf of Sta. Lucia Penal Colony <span style="">in </span><span class="SpellE">Balon</span>, Puerto <span class="SpellE">Princesa</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Palawan</span> with money, chickens and dried fish.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At about 7:00 o'clock in the evening of that date the group,
defendants-appellants herein, went to the Motor Launch 'Elsa' using the <span class="SpellE">banca</span> of the colony and bringing with them money, chickens
and dried fish.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> boarded the launch ahead of the rest, talked to
the patron of the launch to bring them to liberty and offered money, chickens
and dried fish for their fares.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His
companions likewise boarded the motor launch, <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span>
being the last to board the same at the time when the patron <span style="">or </span>the launch was still thinking and
considering the offer of <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But when <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span>
reached the deck of the launch, he stepped on a loose board and fell inside the
engine room.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The impact of his fall was <span style="">so </span>loud that the patron jumped
overboard into the sea shouting to his crews and passengers to likewise jump
into the sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Only two women, a man and
small children remained in the launch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> told the remaining persons on board the launch not
to jump overboard because they did not have bad intentions.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> and his companions then searched
for those <span style="">who </span>jumped into the sea
for anyone who may not know how to swim in order to save him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And they found a small boy about nine (9)
years of age struggling to swim.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They
saved him by using a pole and pulling him towards the launch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When asked why he jumped overboard, the boy
said that he jumped because he heard the Captain of the launch shouting to them
to jump into the sea.</blockquote>

<blockquote>When the herein appellants found no more persons on the sea around
the launch, Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span> and Eduardo Mendoza went
down to the engine room with one male passenger of the launch and tried to
start the engine.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at that moment
when <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> who remained on the deck saw Josie
Gonzales at the prow of the launch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
asked her to accommodate him for a sexual intercourse, but Josie pointed him
instead to <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>
saying that <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> is the one having experience on
the matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When told he (<span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>) did not like <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>,
Josie agreed to a sexual intercourse if <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> will
not harm her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She undressed herself when
told to undress.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> opened the zipper of his pants and let Josie hold
his penis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While Josie <span style="">was </span>holding his penis, <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> made her lie down.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>He inserted his penis inside the vagina of Josie who complained of
pains.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It took <span class="SpellE">Magbanwa</span>
about five (5) minutes to insert only two inches of his penis inside the vagina
of Josie Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At that same moment,
Rodolfo Sales and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span>
pulled <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> up from Josie Gonzales reminding <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> that their agreement was only to escape and what
he was doing to Josie Gonzales was not part of their agreement.</blockquote>

<blockquote>At about the same time that <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span> was
having sexual intercourse with Josie Gonzales, Roberto Aguirre was also having
sexual intercourse with <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Before the intercourse, Aguirre saw <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> about to jump into the sea.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He prevented her from jumping overboard by
holding her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Then he went around the
deck of the launch to see if there were still persons swimming on the water,
leaving <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> at the prow of the launch.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Seeing none, he returned to <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> and asked her to have sexual intercourse with
him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At first <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>

when told to und<span style="">r</span>ess.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Aguirre made her lie down and he inserted his
penis inside the vagina of <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> without any difficulty.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He made <span class="GramE">two successive
sexual <span style="">intercourse</span></span><span style=""> </span>with <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>, after which they both dressed up.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were in that situation when Rodolfo
Sales and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebotido</span>
arrived, pulled Aguirre away and they boarded their <span class="SpellE">banca</span>
because they saw someone <span class="SpellE">flashlighting</span> the premises
at the shore.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>
also called <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span> and Eduardo Mendoza at the engine
room and they likewise boarded their <span class="SpellE">banca</span> and
proceeded to the mangrove swamp to escape.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>On the way, they noticed that <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span> was left
behind." (Appellant's Brief, pp. 3-6)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The two cases were
consolidated and, after hearing, the lower court rendered judgment finding the
accused </span>guilty of<span style=""> the crime of

<p class="BODY">We agree with the trial court that the prosecution <span style="">correctly presented the facts of the case.</span><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants raise the following assignments of <span style="">errors:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUMROMANS" style="margin: 15pt 0in;"><span style="font-weight: normal;">I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT

<blockquote>THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE
DEFENDANTS-APPELLANTS HEREIN CONSPIRED TO COMMIT THE OFFENSES OF RAPE WITH
HOMICIDE AND CONVICTING ALL OF THEM OF THE SAID CRIMES." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 326-327)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds, at the outset, that the trial judge erred in designating
the offense committed by the appellants as rape with homicide aggravated by
robbery in band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, neither in law
nor in jurisprudence is there an aggravating circumstance as robbery in band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>More importantly, the evidence shows that
what <span style="">was </span>committed
is the special complex crime of robbery with homicide aggravated by rape.</p>

<p class="BODY">The records disclose that the appellants took control of the
vessel M/L Elsa by threatening the crew and passengers with their <span class="SpellE">boloes</span> and pistols.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(TSN, pp. 452-459, August 26, 1970; pp. 137-148, November 16, 1970) <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>, a prosecution
witness, testified that after the commotion that ensued when appellants wielded
their weapons, some of the appellants immediately started ransacking the
cargoes and taking the contents thereof. (TSN, p. 148, November 16, 1970) These
acts of the appellants therefore manifest an <span style="">unlawful intent to gain, through violence and intimidation of persons,
by taking the vessel and personal property of the crew a</span>nd <span style="">passengers, which comprises the crime of
robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The overwhelming evidence
reveals that the original design of the malefactors was to commit robbery in
order to facilitate their escape from the penal colony.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their ori</span>g<span style="">inal intent did not comprehend the commission of rape.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the crime of rape cannot be regarded
as the principal offense.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this case,
since it attended the commission </span>of <span style="">robbery with homicide, the rape is deemed to aggravate the crime but
damages or indemnification for the victim may be awarded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(See People v. <span class="SpellE">Bacsa</span>, 104 Phil. 136 [1958]; People v.<span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE">Tapales</span>, 93
SCRA 134 [1979]).</span> Instead </span>of <span style="">ignominy, it is the rape itself that aggravates the crime (People v. <span class="SpellE">Mongado</span>, 28 SCRA 642 [1969]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
deaths of Daisy Gonzales and Yolanda Argue, the appellants are clearly liable <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> since</span>,<span style="">
as held by this Court in </span><u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Mangulabnan</span></u></span><u><span style="">,</span></u><span style=""> (99 Phil. 992 [1956]) it is immaterial that the death of a person
supervened by mere accident, provided that the homicide is produced </span>by
reason or on occasion of the <span style="">robbery.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Since rape and homicide
co-exist in </span>the commission of robbery, the offense committed by the
appellants is the special complex crime of robbery with <span style="">homicide, </span><span style="">aggravated by </span><span style="">rape, punishable under Paragraph 1 of Article
294 of the Revised Penal Code (RPC).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
does not matter if the technical name assigned to the offense is rape with
homicide and with robbery in band, for the real nature of the crime charged is
determined not by the title of the complaint, nor by the specification of the
provision <span style="">of the law alleged </span>to
have been violated, </span>but by the facts recited in the complaint or
information, <span style="">(See People v</span>. <span class="SpellE">Oliviera</span>, 67 Phil. 427 [1939]).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the <span style="">acts </span>constituting robbery with homicide were clearly <span style="">set forth </span>in the complaint and proven<span style=""> during trial, then the appellants may be
held liable for such crime, <span style="">regardless
of </span>the erroneous designation of the offense. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With the foregoing
pronouncements, the Court <span style="">no </span>longer
deems <span style="">it necessary </span>to deal with
the appellantsâ€™ argument <span style="">in their first
</span>assignment of error that, <span style="">assuming
<span class="SpellE">arguendo</span> that they are </span></span>guilty <span style="">of committing rape, the crimes <span style="">of rape and </span>homicide should be viewed
as separate and distinct offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We
have already ruled that <span style="">the crime
committed </span>is the special complex crime of robbery with homicide, the
rape being considered merely as <span style="">an </span>aggravating
circumstance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find <span style="">no merit in the </span>appellants' contention
that the lower court <span style="">erred in </span>considering
recidivism as an aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All the appellants are recidivists.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They <span style="">were serving </span>sentence
at the Sta. Lucia Penal Colony by virtue of a final judgment of </span>conviction
when they committed the above-mentioned offenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Rodolfo <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span>,
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>, Eduardo <span style="">Mendoza and <span class="SpellE">Pacifico</span> <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span>
have previously been convicted of the crimes of frustrated homicide, serious
physical injuries, theft, and murder and trespass to dwelling,
respectively.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Both Rodolfo Sales and
Roberto Aguirre have previously been convicted of robbery in band.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We likewise uphold the
trial court's finding that the crime was aggravated because it was committed by
a band.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the six appellants </span>were
<span style="">armed </span>when <span style="">they boarded the vessel and perpetrated </span>their
<span style="">dastardly acts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There is also abuse of superior strength,
since most of the victims were women and children </span>ranging <span style="">from </span><st1:time minute="0" hour="14"><span style="">2</span></st1:time><span style=""> to 9 years old.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">However, the aggravating
circumstances of <span class="SpellE">nocturnity</span> and craft should not have
been considered </span>by <span style="">the lower
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There was no showing that the
appellants purposely sought the cover of night when they committed the special
complex crime of robbery with homicide.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither did the appellants employ craft, since they had already boarded
the vessel when they pretended to buy <span class="SpellE">Tanduay</span> Rum in
exchange for </span>the <span style="">dried fish and chicken
they were carrying.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Even without such
pretense, they could nonetheless have carried out their unlawful scheme.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">With respect to the
second assignment of error, the appellants' contention that there was no
conspiracy in the commission of rape becomes immaterial in view of the </span>fact
<span style="">that all of them directly participated
in its commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellants <span class="SpellE">Magbanua</span>, Sales and <span class="SpellE">Rebutido</span> took
turns in raping </span><span style="">Josie </span><span style="">Gonzales, while appellants Aguirre, Mendoza
and <span class="SpellE">Aspili</span> ravished <span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span>
<span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
Court accords more weight and credence to the </span>testimonies of
complainants Gonzales and <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>These two girls, 13 and 15 years old
respectively, would not subject themselves to the rigors of a public trial if
they were not motivated by <span style="">an </span>honest
desire to punish their assailants.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Moreover, their narrations were corroborated by the testimony of Dr. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">Duenas</span> who physically
examined Gonzales and <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span> and found that both
indeed had just undergone sexual penetration.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The interlocking
extrajudicial confessions executed </span>by <span style="">the appellants are admissible even if they </span><span style="">were </span><span style="">not informed of their right to counsel.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>These confessions were all taken in January 1970, long before the 1973</span>
<span style="">Constitution took effect.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Article III Section 20 of the 1973
Constitution, for the first time, concretized the present right of persons
under custodial investigation to counsel, how to be informed of </span><span style="">such </span><span style="">right and the effect of non-compliance.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The requirements and restrictions surrounding this constitutional
guarantee, however, have no retroactive effect and do not apply to confessions
taken before </span><st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1"><span style="">January 17, 1973</span></st1:date><span style="">, the date of <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span>
</span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the 1973 Constitution, (See <span class="SpellE">Magtoto</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span>, 63 SCRA 4 [1975])<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">At any rate, even without
considering these extrajudicial confessions, the Court is convinced that the
guilt of appellants has been incontrovertibly established beyond reasonable
doubt by the prosecution.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, however, finds that the trial judge erred in imposing
upon the appellants <span style="">two separate </span>penalties of reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>,
both penalties <span style="">to be </span>served successively.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The basis for this imposition by the lower court is its finding that <span style="">the appellants are </span>guilty
of two crimes of rape with homicide, one for the rape of Josie Gonzales and the
other <span style="">for the
rape of </span><span class="SpellE">Narcisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Batayola</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We have already pronounced, though, <span style="">that the rape committed is merely an
aggravating circumstance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Since the
appellants are found guilty of the special complex crime of </span><span style="">robbery with homicide </span><span style="">aggravated by rape, recidivism, </span><span style="">in band and abuse </span>of superior <span style="">strength, then, applying Article 294,
paragraph 1 of the Revised Penal Code, only one </span><span style="">penalty of </span><span style="">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span> should have been imposed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In passing, it may be
mentioned that the crimes committed by appellants are now denominated as piracy
</span><span style="">in </span><span style="">Philippine waters, punishable under </span><span style="">Presidential Decree </span><span style="">No. 532.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>We find it unnecessary to retroactively apply the provisions thereof in
favor of the appellants </span>because the acts committed by them are likewise punishable
therein by reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the perversity accompanying the crime, the heinous
nature not only of the offense but its manner of commission, and the refusal of
the accused to learn from their earlier convictions, the Court strongly feels
that the sentences herein imposed must <span style="">be </span>fully served.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any official who goes over any applications
for pardon or parole is urged to read the records of the case before acting on
the applications.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision in Criminal Cases Nos. 3
and 4 is AFFIRMED but MODIFIED.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
appellants are found guilty of the special complex crime of robbery with
homicide with the aggravating circumstances of rape, recidivism, in band and
abuse of superior strength and are hereby sentenced to suffer the penalty of
reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The award of actual damages is hereby affirmed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The awards representing indemnity for the
deaths are increased to P50<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for each victim
