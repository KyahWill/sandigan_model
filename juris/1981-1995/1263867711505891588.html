marijuana leaves which is a prohibited drug."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The accused entered a plea of not <span style="">g</span>uilty, and the case proceeded to trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution discloses that on <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="2">2 February 1983</st1:date>, at about <st1:time minute="30" hour="10">10:30 a.m.</st1:time>, a civilian informer came to the
office of S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Ed<span style="">g</span>ardo</span>
<span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> of the Anti-Narcotics Command, Camp Tomas <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span style="">Sto</span></span><span style="">. </span>Domingo,
<st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
<span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and reported on the alleged drug
trafficking activities of appellant Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This report was relayed to the commanding officer of the Anti-Narcotics
Command at Camp Tomas <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>, who thereupon organized
a team of five (5) members to carry out a surveillance and "buy-bust"
operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
C2C Romeo <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>, a Philippine Constabulary trooper
assigned to the Anti-Narcotics Command, was designated as poseur-buyer and was
given two (2) P5.00 marked bills, bearing Serial Nos. YT712225 and XB077345, <span style="">to </span>be used in the entrapment
operation.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
The team <span style="">left </span><span style="">the </span>Camp dressed in civilian clothes on
board a Land Cruiser.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Some 500 meters
away from the store which was the target area, located on <st1:street><st1:address>R.D.
  Reyes St.</st1:address></st1:street> corner <st1:street><st1:address>Jesus
  St.</st1:address></st1:street>, <span class="SpellE">Barangay</span> Lourdes
Northwest, <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>,
the members of the team alighted from their vehicle.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>C2C Romeo <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>
and the civilian informer went ahead; following closely behind were S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> and the other team members.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Upon reaching the store, the civilian
informer casually introduced C2C Romeo <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span> to
appellant Gonzales as a friend from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
who wanted to buy marijuana.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> purchased a bottle of <span class="SpellE">softdrink</span>
from the store, all the while observing appellant Gonzales, the civilian
informer and C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>, from a distance of about 5
meters.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Gonzales asked how
many tea bags of marijuana C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span> wanted; in
reply, the latter inquired about the price per tea bag.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Gonzales named the price of P10.00
per tea bag and then took from within or beneath the sand near his feet one (1)
tea bag which he handed to C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span> who, in turn,
gave him the marked money in payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thereupon, C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span> gave the pre-arranged
signal by scratching his head with his hand.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The rest of the members of the team, who had been quietly observing from
nearby, rushed to the appellant and placed him under arrest.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The marked P5.00 bills were found in
appellant's possession.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The team members assured appellant Gonzales that if he could turn
over to them more tea bags of marijuana, they would help him in his
"predicament".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Apparently
convinced, appellant Gonzales allegedly took from the sand four (4) more
plastic tea bags.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The tea bags were sent
to the PC Crime Laboratory for chemical examination and there, the contents
thereof were positively identified as marijuana leaves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Gonzales was brought to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, <st1:city><st1:place>San
  Fernando</st1:place></st1:city>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, for
investigation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He was detained there,
and on <st1:date year="1983" day="7" month="2">7 February 1983</st1:date>, he
signed a statement regarding the circumstances of his arrest.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, appellant Gonzales denied the accusations made
against him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He contended that in the
morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="2">2 February 1983</st1:date>,
between <st1:time minute="0" hour="11">11:00</st1:time> and <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">12:00 o'clock</st1:time>, he was at the corner store which is about
25 meters away from his family's house to have a P50.00 bill changed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant Gonzales stated that he had
intended to give P20.00 to his mother and that a person named John changed his
P50.00 bill into four (4) P5.00 bills and three (3) P10.00 bills.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thereupon, two (2) persons arrived on the
scene, one of whom appellant recognized as S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Privaldo</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law enforcement officers poked their guns
at appellant, handcuffed him and took him to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant claims that along the way and even
at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, he was physically
maltreated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Appellant was twice
investigated; firstly, on the very day of his arrest on <st1:date year="1982" day="2" month="2">2 February 1982</st1:date>; and secondly, on <st1:date year="1983" day="5" month="2">5 February 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the latter date, he signed an
extrajudicial statement which, he claimed before the trial court, had been
extracted from him involuntarily.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's plea of innocence and his defense did not convince the
trial court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1983" day="1" month="12">1 December 1983</st1:date>, the trial court rendered a
decision with the following <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion:<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, in view of all the foregoing discussion, judgment
is hereby rendered finding accused ERNESTO GONZALES y PAGKEL guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of violation of Section 4, Article II, R.A. No. 6425, as
amended, otherwise known as 'The Dangerous Drugs Act of 1972,' as charged in
the Information, and the Court imposes upon accused Ernesto Gonzales y <span class="SpellE">Pagkel</span> the penalty of life imprisonment and a fine of
twenty thousand pesos (P20,000.00), and to pay the costs.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The Information for violation of Section 8 under the same law,
Criminal Case No. 5619, charging the accused for possession of the four (4) tea
bags of marijuana is to be dismissed, as it is hereby ordered DISMISSED, for
the reason that the essential element of possession necessarily is embraced or
included in the Sale, Administration, Delivery, Distribution and Transportation
of Prohibited Drugs under Section 4 thereof.</blockquote>

<blockquote>So ordered."<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Gonzales is now before this Court, asserting that the
prosecution had failed to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt and that
accordingly, the trial court had erred in convicting him of violation of
Section 4, Article II, Republic Act No. 6425, as amended.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant insists that the extrajudicial statement<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
submitted by the prosecution in evidence had been extracted from him
involuntarily, i.e., that he was maltreated and threatened and intimidated into
si<span style="">g</span>ning the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court notes that this extrajudicial
statement was taken into account by the trial court when it rendered the
questioned judgment of conviction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
trial court said:</p>

<blockquote>"His defense that he was maltreated and threatened into
signing the said extrajudicial statement is belied by many inconsistencies on
his part which destroyed his credibility.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>If indeed he was compelled by violence, threat or intimi­dation into
signing it, why on earth did he not confide the same even secretly to his
relatives especially to his mother or wife [from] whom he can expect comfort
and protection so that something may be done about it by them, as according to
him they visited him often in his detention cell?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All the protestations of innocence by the
accused are considered by the Court, and the same were found to be the result
of an afterthought on his part.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>The
extrajudicial statement, as it were, was found to be an admission of guilt on
the part of the accused, positive in its narration of facts, well-meaning and
natural; it therefore deserves full faith and credit</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>

he was not afforded an effective opportunity to obtain counsel.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His sworn statement itself stated that it was

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Whether the extrajudicial confession had
been in fact extracted from appellant Gonzales by the exercise of physical
violence <span style="">or </span>intimidation upon him
is of secondary relevance; what is critical, legally speaking, is whether or
not the extrajudicial confession had been given and the right to remain silent
had been waived in the presence of <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> counsel.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is now too well-settled to require extensive citation of
authority that the right to remain silent and to refrain from giving an
extrajudicial confession and to have competent and independent counsel, cannot
be waived save in the presence of counsel<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>

We cannot, therefore, take account of the extrajudicial confession of appellant
Gonzales.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The judgment of conviction
must hence stand or fail on the basis or the other evidence of record.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant Gonzales claimed that the "buy-bust"
operation allegedly mounted by the Anti-Narcotics Command, stationed at Camp
Tomas <span class="SpellE">Pepito</span>, had been merely fabricated by the
agents of that Command to pin on him responsibility for the alleged sale and
possession of marijuana leaves.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
prosecution contended otherwise.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> and C2C Romeo <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>,
members of the team dispatched to conduct the surveillance and
"buy-bust" operation, were presented in the witness stand to narrate
to the court the events which transpired on the morning of <st1:date year="1983" day="2" month="2">2 February 1983</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The trial court gave full credence to their testimony:</p>

<blockquote>"After a careful study and analysis of the evidence, both for
the prosecution and the defense, and the testimonies of their witnesses which
were carefully and keenly observed in their conduct and demeanor while
testifying, weighty reasons compels the Court to accept the theory of the

version which took place on when accused Ernesto Gonzales y <span class="SpellE">Pagkel</span>
was apprehended in an entrapment made by the anti-narcotics agents, through a
poseur buyer, selling marijuana contained in one (1) plastic bag with the use
of marked money in the transaction to be credible as the testimonies of the
prosecution witnesses appear to the Court to be natural, positive,
straightforward and convincing including the part given under cross-examination
by the defense.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The trial court, however, overlooked
material inconsistencies in the testimony of the two (2) principal prosecution
witnesses, inconsistencies which, to the mind of the Court, seriously impair
the credibility of both the prosecution witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to S/Sg<span style="">t. </span><span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span>, appellant Gonzales got the first tea bag or
marijuana from where it had been buried in the sand at the very place where the
"deal" was being transacted.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> testified as follows:</p>

further insisted that the four (4) other tea bags which appellant was allegedly

been taken by appellant Gonzales also from where they had been hidden under the

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Thus, according to one principal
prosecution witness (S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span>), the tea bags
of marijuana had been concealed buried in sand immediately adjacent to the
store where the transaction allegedly took place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The other principal prosecution witness (C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>), upon the other hand, had stated that the tea bag
allegedly sold by the appellant Gonzales had been obtained from somewhere away
from the immediate vicinity of the alleged sale transaction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The testimony given by S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> appears to us to be quite implausible in
character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We think it extremely
improbable that a vendor of marijuana, a prohibited drug, would store his cache
of the prohibited drug by burying the same in sand immediately outside a corner
store where people constantly pass by and which is therefore subject to
continuous visual observation both by customers of the corner store and
passers-by.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The corner store did not
belong to appellant Gonzales and it was, of course, constantly accessible to
the general public.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court itself must have found Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan's</span>
testimony improbable:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>for <span style="">it </span>discarded such testimony and
accepted instead the version offered by C2C Romeo <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After summarizing the evidence for the
prosecution and for the defense, the trial court made the following findings:</p>

<blockquote>"The testimony of C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>,
which was corroborated in all its material aspects by that of S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span>, showed that with the marked money in his
possession at the target area near a store at <st1:address><st1:street>Jesus
  St.</st1:street>, <st1:city>Lourdes</st1:city></st1:address> Northwest, <st1:place><st1:placename>Angeles</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>, the accused approached him
and the civilian informer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The civilian
informer introduced him (C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>) to the accused
this way:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'I have a new friend from <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
who wants to buy marijuana.' The accused asked:<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>'How many?' C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span> countered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>'How much is one tea bag?' The accused
answered:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">'P10.00 </span>per tea bag.'</blockquote>

<blockquote><u>The transaction as to the 'hot stuff' having been agreed upon
between the seller and the buyer, the former left, and returning after a while,
he handed over to the latter one tea bagful of marijuana</u>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The buyer, simultaneously thereafter, gave
the seller, the accused herein, the two (2) five-peso bills marked money, who
received them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was at this point of
the transaction that the pre-arranged signal was made--the poseur buyer (C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span> scratching his head with his hand--when, S/<span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>. <span class="SpellE">Privaldo</span> and <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span> swooped down upon the accused, placed him under
arrest and recovered the marked money from his pocket.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span> gave
the tea bag of marijuana to Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Rubencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Privaldo</span>."<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

<p class="BODY">Unlike the trial court, however, we do not believe that we can
simply discard the improbable testimony of S/Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Raquidan</span>
and adopt and rely upon that of C2C <span class="SpellE">Vanzuela</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We believe that the material and unexplained
inconsistency between the testimonies of the two (2) principal prosecution
witnesses relating not to inconsequential details but to the alleged sale
transaction itself, and the inherently improbable character of the testimony
given by one of the two (2) principal prosecution witnesses, had the effect of
vitiating the testimony given by the other principal prosecution witness.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
Why should two (2) police officers give two (2) contradictory descriptions of
the same sale transaction, which allegedly took place before their very eyes,
on the same physical location and on the same occasion?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We must conclude that <span style="">a </span>reasonable doubt was generated as to whether or not the
"buy-bust" operation ever took place.</p>

was simply that he had nothing to do with the alleged sale transaction, was
corroborated by <span class="SpellE">Emelita</span> <span class="SpellE">Cayabyab</span>,
owner of the corner retail store where the transaction allegedly took
place.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Her testimony was summarized by
the trial court in the following manner:</p>
