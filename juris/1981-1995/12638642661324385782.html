and Dennis <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span> were charged with the crime of
murder in the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>,
allegedly committed as follows:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 30th day of March, 1986, in the City of <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span>, Province of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span>,
Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">accused, with intent to kill, with evident
premeditation and treachery, armed with a deadly weapon, conspiring and
confederating together and mutually helping one another, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>, unlawfully and feloniously attack, assault and
stab with said weapon one Nestor Alana <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>, thereby
inflicting upon the latter stab wounds which caused his death.</span><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">"Contrary to law."</span> (At pp. 2-3,
Original Records)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The crime was allegedly perpetrated not only by the two
appellants but together with another person by the name of Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
latter, however, managed to escape and remained at large up to the date of the <span class="GramE">hearing</span> so that trial proceeded only against <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span> who pleaded
‘not guilty’ when arraigned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The lower court findings upon which guilt beyond reasonable doubt
was established <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">are </span>summarized
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time>
in the afternoon of <st1:date year="1986" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1986</st1:date>
a quarrel took place between <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Catamio</span>, father-in-law of the victim Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span> while they were at the <st1:place><st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Alitao</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>River</st1:placetype></st1:place>,

while having a picnic celebrating the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Easter
Sunday.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Catamio</span> was with </span>his daughter Maria <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>, his son-in-law Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>,
and the latter's three children Michael <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>, Myra <span class="SpellE">Burac</span> and Janice <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>, and
spouses Alberto <span class="SpellE">Obado</span> and Marina <span class="SpellE">Obado</span>
and their children.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand,
at the other side of the river were the group of <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mañago</span> and her children, and accused Dennis <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Mitre</span> and Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A quarrel took place between <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Catamio</span> and <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The quarrel is over a land dispute the
tenancy of which is being claimed<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> by <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span> <span class="SpellE">Catamio</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The property is owned by <span class="SpellE">Floro</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>, the father of one of the accused <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the exchange of words the group of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Nena</span> <span class="SpellE">Mañago</span>
was agitated, as <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Mitre</span>
joined in the exchange of words challenging the group of <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Catamio</span> to fight him in the following manner ‘kung <span class="SpellE">sino</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">matapang</span>
<span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">inyo</span> ay <span class="SpellE">lumapit</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tsn</span> May 16, 1986, page
60).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span> accepted the challenge but was prevented to reach the
group of <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>
notwithstanding attempts on his part to free himself from the </span>hold of
his companions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To avoid actual
confrontation, Myrna <span class="SpellE">Obado</span> suggested that her group
will leave the place and go home, they could not however immediately do so, as
the group of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
started crossing the river, and proceeded to the house of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nena</span> which is just on the embankment of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">river.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In going home the group of <span class="SpellE">Catamio</span> have to
pass the house of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span> <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>;
they managed to pass said house and saw the group of <span class="SpellE">Aling</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nena</span> who were looking and staring at them in a very
hostile and unfriendly manner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
managed however to pass thru unmolested and unharmed and reached the National
Highway where they settled in a waiting shed to wait for a passenger vehicle to
bring them home to <span class="SpellE">Lucena</span> City.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While waiting for a ride <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>, Dennis <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span> and
Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span> arrived.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The victim Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>
was holding and carrying his youngest daughter Janice with </span>his left
hand, when Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span> went to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">his back drew a three-edged pointed
instrument and stabbed him on his right side just below the armpit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The sudden attack and the blow temporarily
disabled him as he fell on his knees and his daughter was thrown away from his
hold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>
ran away for dear life towards the other side of the road but tripped himself
and fell down.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He tried to stand up and
was in a squatting position near the fence when <u>Dennis</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Abadilla</u></span> hit him on the head with a big stone; <span class="SpellE"><u>Arnel</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>Mitra</u></span> uttered
the following '<span class="SpellE">sige</span>, <span class="SpellE">sige</span>, <span class="SpellE">iyan</span> <span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">patayin</span>
mo' and while <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Mi</span>tra</span>
was giving this Order Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span> continued
stabbing Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Then Cesar <span class="SpellE">Naynes</span>,
the <span class="SpellE">Purok</span> Leader in <span class="SpellE">Gulang­-gulang</span>
came.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He told him to leave the
victim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>
with the help of Cesar <span class="SpellE">Naynes</span> was boarded in a pick

<p class="BODY">The appellants claimed they were enjoying with a picnic group on
one side of the river at the time they learned about the killing of Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When they
arrived at the place where people wait for rides, things were already
normal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants state that they
do not personally know Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They claim that the killers were Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span> and a certain "Jun." They disclaimed any

<blockquote>THE <st1:street><st1:address>LOWER COURT</st1:address></st1:street>
ERRED IN FAILING TO CONSIDER AND GIVE WEIGHT TO THE FACT THAT THE ACCUSED
STAYED AT HOME AND DID NOT HIDE FROM POLICE AUTHORITIES." (At p. 56,
Original Record)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the 1st assignment of error, the accused-appellants contend
that they had no motive to kill the victim, Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>
because neither of them personally <span class="GramE">know</span> the victim nor
the knife-wielder, Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span> and his companion,
Jun.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They further contend that Victor <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span> and Jun were not among the group picnicking with
them and that Dennis <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span> was merely invited by <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span> to the picnic.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What they are trying to say is that it is
impossible for them to have conspired to commit a crime when they do not know
the victim <span class="GramE">nor</span> the perpetrators.</p>

<p class="BODY">It was, however, established from the records that <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span>, <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span>, and <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span> were among the group of <span class="SpellE">Nena</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mañago</span>, with whom <span class="SpellE">Ildefonso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Catamio</span>, father-in-law of Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span>,
had an altercation regarding <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>land
dispute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the exchange of words, <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span> challenged the group
to a fight and it was the victim, Nestor <span class="SpellE">Burac</span> who
tried to answer the challenge.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
further established that it was <span class="SpellE">Mitra</span> who urged <span class="SpellE">Garganta</span> to stab the victim and that it was Dennis <span class="SpellE">Abadilla</span> who hit the head of the victim with a big stone.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants further contend that consideration should have
been given to the testimonies of <span class="SpellE">Ligaya</span> <span class="SpellE">Padillo</span>, a teacher and Cesar <span class="SpellE">Naynes</span>,
an Assistant <span class="SpellE">Purok</span> Leader, whom they consider as
disinterested witnesses.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution witnesses, being mostly relatives of the victim, are
claimed by the appellants to be interested witnesses whose testimonies should
be given lesser weight.</p>

<p class="BODY">In <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Tunhawa</u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">,</span> G.R. No. 81470, October 27, 1988; <u>People</u>
<u>v</u>. <u>Canada</u>, 144 SCRA 121 [1986]; and <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Radomes</u></span> 141 SCRA 548 [1986], it has been held that
mere relationship of prosecution witnesses to the victim does not make their
testimony biased nor render such testimony unworthy of belief in the absence of
an improper motive making the witness testify against the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We have time and again upheld the
well-established principle that findings of fact of trial courts are accorded
great weight and respect considering that they had the opportunity to observe
the deportment and behavior of witnesses (People v. <span class="SpellE">Panuelos</span>,
136 SCRA 501 [1985]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Magdaraog</span>, 160 SCRA
153 [1988]; People v. <span class="SpellE">Cabanit</span>, 139 SCRA 94
[1985]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No improper motive on the part
of prosecution witnesses to testify falsely was established by the defense in
this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellants’ contention that the witnesses implicated them on
account of their desire to extort money from them appears ridiculous and
far-fetched.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is seen from the records
that the victim's family clearly wanted the perpetrators of the crime
punished.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To use the death of a loved
one to extort money is difficult to believe and contrary to human nature.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the records to sustain
this contention of the appellants.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused-appellants further assail the denial of their defense
of alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Apart from the fact that alibi
is the weakest of all the defenses <span class="GramE">an</span> accused can
invoke (People v. <span class="SpellE">Muñoz</span>, 163 SCRA 730 [1988]), the
appellants were positively identified by the prosecution witnesses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was not physically impossible for the
appellants to be at the scene of the crime.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In fact they were within the vicinity of <span class="SpellE">Raymar</span>
Subdivision where, across from it, the crime was committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellants' defense of alibi, therefore,
cannot prevail over the positive identification made by prosecution witnesses,
aside from the added fact that it was not physically impossible for them to
have been at the <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of the crime at the time it
was committed (People v. <span class="SpellE">Berbal</span> and <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span>, G.R. No. 71527, August 10, 1989; and People v. <span class="SpellE">Nolasco</span>, 163 SCRA 623 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Anent the last assigned error, the fact that the accused stayed
at home and did not hide from the police is not conclusive evidence of absence
of guilt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, not a few criminals
have been arrested in their residences.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The accused-appellants are likewise banking on the absence of derogatory
findings against them in their records.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>We have, however, held in <u>People</u> <u>v</u>. <span class="SpellE"><u>Cerelegia</u></span>,
147 SCRA 528 [1987] that evidence of good character cannot prevail over clear
and convincing evidence of the commission of a crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">A new issue further raised by the appellants is whether or not
the affidavits of retraction of the prosecution witnesses are such newly
discovered evidence contemplated in the rules as basis for a new trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">We do not agree with the appellants on the point raised as the
said affidavits are not the newly-found evidence contemplated by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The prosecution witnesses had been subjected
to <span class="SpellE">gruelling</span> cross examinations in court but they
clung to their version. <span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Thus, whatever
retraction of testimonies they may have made later could only be <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">a mere </span>after thought.</p>

<p class="BODY">As the Solicitor General has commented, such facts <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">were </span>already available at the time of
the trial.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To grant a new trial at every
instance would result in no end to the litigation process.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, PREMISES CONSIDERED, the Motion for New Trial
is hereby DENIED and the judgment appealed from is affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
