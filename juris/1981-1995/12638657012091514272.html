				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Whether or not the office of Vice-Governor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> was rendered vacant by the voluntary
resignation of the person duly elected thereto during the 1988 local elections,
is the principal issue involved in this special civil action of <i>certiorari.</i><span style=""><span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>The
position is now contested by said Vice-Governor, <span class="SpellE">Narciso</span>
<span class="SpellE">Nario</span> -- who withdrew his resignation a few days
after tendering it -- and the petitioner Tomas <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
III, the <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Sangguniang</i></span><i style=""> <span class="SpellE">Panlalawigan</span></i><span style=""> </span>member who obtained the highest
number of votes in the same local <span class="GramE">elections</span> of 1988,
and who, upon <span class="SpellE">Nario's</span> resignation, assumed the
position of Vice-Governor.</p>

<p class="BODY">The controversy originated from the indefinite sick leave that
the incumbent Governor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>,
Eduardo L. <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>, had to take on <st1:date year="1989" day="7" month="12">December 7, 1989</st1:date>, thus creating a temporary
vacancy in his Office.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As Vice-Governor,
<span class="SpellE">Nario</span> took over as Acting Governor pursuant to the

But as fate would have it, <span class="SpellE">Nario</span> himself fell ill
shortly afterwards, and so executed a "waiver" of his
"right" to the office of Governor reading as follows:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Four (4) days later, apparently feeling that his illness had

<p class="BODY">Having in the meantime discovered, after undergoing further
medical examination, that his illness was not as serious as originally feared,
and having thus been convinced of his physical fitness to resume work, <span class="SpellE">Nario</span> wrote to Secretary Santos on January 2, 1990,
withdrawing his "Letters of resignation as Vice Governor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span> and waiver as Acting

after noting the contents of <span class="SpellE">Nario's</span> letter of <st1:date year="1990" day="2" month="1">January 2, 1990</st1:date>, advised him that -</p>

other as may be prescribed by law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The second contained the following

<p class="BODY">On the same day, <st1:date year="1990" day="3" month="1">January

<p class="BODY">It further appears that on the same day, <st1:date year="1990" day="3" month="1">January 3, 1990</st1:date>, Secretary Santos also sent a

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Joson</span> reacted by filing with the Regional
Trial Court at <span class="SpellE">Cabanatuan</span> City, on January 4, 1990, a
petition for "prohibition and injunction, with prayer for restraining

<p class="BODY">In his Decision, His Honor, citing <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Punsalan</i></span><i style=""> v. Mendoza,</i><span style=""> </span>140
SCRA 153, ruled that "(<span class="SpellE">i</span>)n our jurisdiction
acceptance is necessary for resignation of public office to be operative and
effective, otherwise, the officer is subject to penal provisions of Art. 238 of
the Revised Penal Code;" and, invoking <i style="">Rosales
v. Court of Appeals</i><span style="">, </span>165 <span style="">S</span>CRA 344, further declared that
"petitioner (<span class="SpellE">Joson</span>) in instituting the present
action had deviated (from) the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative
remedies, thereby rendered (rendering) this action pre-mature."</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1990" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1990</st1:date>,
<span class="SpellE">Joson</span> filed with this Court a petition for review on <i>certiorari
</i>basically praying for judgment -</p>

<blockquote>1) <span class="GramE">reversing</span> the decision of respondent
Judge dated <st1:date year="1990" day="15" month="1">January 15, 1990</st1:date>;</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3) declaring null and void the designation of <span class="SpellE">Nario</span>
as Acting Governor of <span class="SpellE">Nueva</span> <span class="SpellE">Ecija</span>
made by Secretary Santos on January 3, 1990.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner would have this Court adopt his theory that
"since the Local Government Code does not provide as to when the voluntary
resignations of Vice-Governors shall become effective" <span style="">-? </span>unlike the case of a <span class="SpellE"><i style="">sanggunian</i></span><span style=""> </span><span class="GramE">member</span>
whose resignation takes effect and operates as a vacation of his position only
upon acceptance of the resignation "by the <span class="SpellE"><i style="">sanggunian</i></span><span style=""> </span>concerned" -- ­<span class="SpellE">Nario's</span>
resignation "should be construed to be effective on the date specified in
the resignation, without need of acceptance."<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a>
He adverts to the omission of the Rules and Regulations Implementing the Local
Government Code to "provide the mechanism for the resignation of a
Vice-Governor," attributing this "to the fact that the Code clearly
provides for succession in case of resignation (of a vice-governor),"
i.e., "the member of the <span class="SpellE"><i style="">Sangguniang</i></span><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">Panlalawigan</i></span><span style=""> </span>who obtained the largest number of
votes in the last elections shall <i style="">ipso</i><span style=""> </span><span class="SpellE"><i style="">jure</i></span><span style=""> </span>succeed to the office of the Vice-Governor," a clear
indication, in his view, that acceptance of the latter's resignation "is
no longer necessary." Petitioner further claims that <span class="SpellE">Nario's</span>
acts, coupled with his awareness of the assumption by <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>
of the office of Vice-Governor, clearly establish "his intention to
totally abandon said office," and constitute an "absolute
relinquishment" thereof.<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner also submits that his case falls within one of the
exceptions to the rule on exhaustion of administrative remedies, i.e., it
involves "a purely legal question."</p>

<p class="BODY">The decided weight of authority is that "apart from legal
provision, * * mere presentation of resignation does not work a vacancy, and a
resignation is not complete until accepted by proper authority; <span style="">"</span><a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> "</span> * * and until acceptance by
proper authority, the tender or offer to resign is revocable," unless
otherwise provided by statute."<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
This is not to say that a public officer may not resign.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Mechem</span> says that he
“‘may certainly resign, but without acceptance his resignation is nothing, and
he remains in office.’ He is, therefore, so far as the rights of third persons
are concerned, not only still clothed with authority, but is subject to the
burdens of the office, and he may be compelled to perform the duties, and is
liable for their non-performance, as before."<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The rule rests on "the obvious dictates of public
policy," <span class="SpellE">Mechem</span> states, stressing that -<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>" * * ‘As civil officers are appointed for the purpose of
exercising the functions and carrying on the operations of the government, and
maintaining public order, a political organization would seem to be imperfect
which should allow the depositories of its power to throw off their
responsibilities at their own pleasure.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This certainly was not the doctrine of the common law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <st1:country-region><st1:place>England</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
a person elected to a municipal office was obliged to accept it and perform its
duties, and be subjected himself to a penalty by refusal.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An office was regarded as a burden which the
appointee was bound, in the interest of the community and of good government,
to bear.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And from this it followed of
course that, after an office was conferred and assumed, it could not be laid
down without the consent of the <span style="">appointing
power.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>So it is said by Chief Justice Ruffin of <st1:state><st1:place>North
  Carolina</st1:place></st1:state>, 'It is not true that an office is held at
will of either party.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is held at the
will of both.* * <span class="GramE">The</span> public has a right to the
services of all citizens, and may demand them in all civil departments as well
as <span style="">in the military.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hence, there are on our statute books several
</span>acts to compel men to service in offices.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Every man is obliged, upon a general
principle, after entering his office, to discharge the duties of it while he
continues in office, and he can not lay it down until the public, or those to
whom authority is confided, are <span style="">satisfied
that the office is in a proper state to be left, and the officer discharged.’
"</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"In our jurisprudence," this Court has held,
"acceptance is necessary for resignation of a public officer to be
operative and effective, otherwise the officer is subject to the penal provisions
of Article 238 of the Revised Penal Code which states that:</p>

<blockquote>‘ART. 238. <i><span style="">Abandonment of
office or position</span></i><span style="">. <span style="">- </span></span>Any public officer who,
before the acceptance of his resignation shall abandon his office to the
detriment of the public service shall suffer the penalty of <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">arresto</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">mayor</span></i><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>'If such office shall have been abandoned in order to evade the
discharge of duties of preventing, prosecuting, or punishing any of the crimes
falling within Title One and Chapter One of Title Three of Book Two of this
code, the offender shall be punished by <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">prision</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">correctional</span></i><span style=""> </span>in its
minimum or medium periods, and by <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">arresto</span></i></span><span style=""> </span><i style=""><span style="">mayor</span></i><span style=""> </span>if the
purpose of abandonment is to evade the duty of preventing, prosecuting or
punishing any other crime.'</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">"Clearly, <span style="">a </span>public
officer cannot abandon his office or position before his resignation is
accepted, but the incumbent official would not be in a position to determine
the acceptance of his resignation unless he has been duly <span class="GramE">notified</span>
<span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
must be noted that respondent Court of Appeals underscored the undeniable fact
that while the President's letter of acceptance was dated <st1:date year="1972" day="6" month="10">October 6, 1972</st1:date>, it was completely processed only
on <st1:date year="1972" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1972</st1:date> and
officially received by Judge Ruiz on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1972</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, respondent
Court's holding that even if there were strict interpretation as to when Judge
Ruiz ceased to be a member of the Judiciary although petitioners maintain that
the date of his cessation from office is October 6, 1972, still, his acts
before the official notification of acceptance of his resignation are those of
a <i style=""><span style="">de
facto</span></i><span style=""> </span>officer, and therefore, valid, is correct."<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In another case, this Court affirmed the same doctrine, commented
on by <span class="SpellE">Mechem</span> and others, <i style=""><span style="">supra</span></i><span style="">, </span>that
"without acceptance ** (an officer's) resignation is nothing, and he
remains in office; * * (and that) "as far as the rights of third persons
are concerned, not only (is he) still clothed with authority, but (he) is
subject to the burdens of the office, ** may be compelled to perform the
duties, and is liable for their non-performance * * ." In <span class="SpellE"><i style=""><span style="">Punsalan</span></i></span><i style=""><span style=""> v. Mendoza</span></i><span style="">, </span><i style=""><span style="">supra,</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">the </span>Court held implicitly but no less clearly that the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of a public official's resignation depends not
on such much on its terms, e.g., "effective at the pleasure of <span style="">the </span>President," or at a
particular time or on the happening of a particular contingency, but as a legal
proposition, on acceptance thereof by the proper authority.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For, quite obviously, such appropriate
authority can disregard the terms of the official’s resignation, and as easily
reject it as accept it; and obviously, too, "(a)<span class="SpellE">bandonment</span>
by the incumbent of his office before acceptance of his resignation is

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge was thus correct in refusing to issue the
writ of prohibition sued for by petitioner <span class="SpellE">Joson</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was not within the power of respondent <span class="SpellE">Nario</span> to dictate the time of the effectiveness of his
resignation, or otherwise impose conditions thereon. That was the prerogative
of the Secretary of <span style="">Local Governments, </span>as
the proper authority to act thereon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
was well within the Secretary's power and discretion to accept or reject the
resignation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Nario</span>
therefore continued as Vice-Governor despite his <span style="">tender of resignation and despite his absence </span>from office for a
few days on account of sickness.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Never
having lost the office of Vice-Governor, it was also lawful and logical for him
to assume the position of Acting Governor, temporarily vacant due to the
infirmity of the incumbent, as he eventually did on instructions of the
Secretary of Local Governments.</p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion thus reached makes unnecessary the Court's ruling
on any other point.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the petition for review on <i><span style="">certiorari</span></i><span style=""> </span>is DENIED, and the judgment thereby
challenged is AFFIRMED, with costs against the petitioner.</p>
