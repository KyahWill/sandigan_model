<st1:time minute="0" hour="0">midnight</st1:time>, the spouses had a quarrel 
which lasted for some ten (10) minutes.<span>&nbsp; </span>Raised voices from them 
were clearly heard by a neighbor, <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span>, whose house is about twenty (20) meters away (<span class="SpellE">tsn</span>, <span>pp. </span>29-31, <st1:date year="1981" day="22" month="12">December 22, 1981</st1:date>).</blockquote>

that morning, <span class="SpellE">Quirico</span> <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> 
was awakened by the loud agonizing voice of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> emanating from the latter's house.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Shortly, the appellant appeared at the house of <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> and requested him to fetch her brother, Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Escobia</span>, from the neighboring <span class="SpellE">barangay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Linawan</span>.<span>&nbsp;

fetch Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Escobia</span> <span>and </span>with him, <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> proceeded to the house of the appellant.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Thereat, <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> stayed for about twenty (20) 
minutes during which he saw Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> lying 
on a bed inside his bedroom, with three (3) wounds in his abdomen.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Blood oozed from the wounds and a portion of his intestine was even <span class="SpellE">vicible</span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>While <span class="SpellE">Deloso</span> was at the appellant's house, he witnessed Lorenzo

<blockquote>Meanwhile, at around 6:00 o'clock that morning, the appellant's 
nephew, Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span>, who lived about one-hundred 
(100) meters <span>away, </span>was informed by one <span class="SpellE">Filemon</span> <span class="SpellE">Saldivar</span> that Ernesto 
<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> had been stabbed.<span>&nbsp; </span>At that, 
<span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span> proceeded to the appellant's house where he 
found her and one <span class="SpellE">Felisa</span> <span class="SpellE">Deligerio</span> in the kitchen of the house.<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span> then went to the bedroom where Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> lay, and the following ensued:</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>
<blockquote>Q.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What question did you ask Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> at that time?</blockquote>

<span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>:<span>&nbsp; </span>'Iyo, who wounded you?' 
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> respondent:<span>&nbsp; </span>"<span class="GramE"><span>Y</span>our</span> aunt.'</blockquote>

case?</blockquote>

appellant's house as he had to attend to his work.<span>&nbsp; </span>He returned at 
around <st1:time minute="0" hour="10">10:00 o'clock</st1:time>, after Ernesto

interviewed Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span>, the appellant, and their 
neighbors.<span>&nbsp; </span><span>By </span>that time, preparations were being made 
for the burial of the deceased.<span>&nbsp; </span>Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span> informed <span class="SpellE">Vallecera</span> that he 
(<span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span>) would "tell everything after the 
burial.‚Äù<span>&nbsp; </span>When <span class="SpellE">Vallecera</span> viewed the 
bedroom where the corpse of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> lay, he 
found out that it had been cleaned of the deceased's blood by the appellant, and 
the clothes he wore when he was stabbed were nowhere to be found.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>Upon inquiry, appellant admitted that she had washed them but could not 
remember where they were.<span>&nbsp; </span>The weapon used to stab the deceased was 
not recovered (<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">tsn</span></span><span class="GramE">.,</span> pp. 42-47, February 26, 1982).</blockquote>

C)."</blockquote>
<p class="BODY">On the other hand, appellant's version <span>is </span>presented 
in her brief as follows:</p>
<blockquote>"As observed by the court<em> a quo</em> in its findings, reflected 
in the decision on pages 2 to <span>9, </span>the following facts were admitted: 

<blockquote>
<p class="2Q">(a)<span>&nbsp; </span>The herein accused-appellant and the deceased were 
lawfully wed and resided in the barrio of <span class="SpellE">Badiang</span>, 
<span class="SpellE">Anda</span>, <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Bohol</span></st1:place>; they were childless.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="2Q">(b)<span>&nbsp; </span>That in the evening of February 15, 1981, they 
were heard by their neighbor whose house is 20 meters away from theirs to have 
quarreled, page 9, decision, and that they often quarreled but only verbally 
especially when the deceased was drunk, testimony in affidavit of prosecution 
witness Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span>, marked Exhibits C, C-1, and 
C-2;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="2Q">(c)<span>&nbsp; </span>That in the morning of <st1:date year="1981" day="16" month="2">February 16, 1981</st1:date>, her husband was stabbed and 
died on same day;<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="2Q">(d)<span>&nbsp; </span>That the deceased had killed a man a few years, 2 
in fact, from 1981 and the relatives of the man killed were living in said 
barrio at the time of the incident in question, testimony of station commander 
for <span class="SpellE">Anda</span>, Rafael <span class="SpellE">Vallecera</span>, 
reflected in court decision;<o:p></o:p></p></blockquote>But the following 
material and pertinent facts were disputed or not openly admitted by one or the 
other party to the case: 
<p class="2Q">(a)<span>&nbsp; </span>But in the late evening of February 15, 1981 when 
parties or rather accused-appellant were in bed but still awake, somebody from 
outside their house shouted angrily "Who wants a duel?" in <span>the dialect; to 
which the deceased answered also loudly "Be quiet there you will only disturb 
people who want to sleep".<span>&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">But the 
<span>per</span>son shouting outside <span>still repeated </span>the 
challenge.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>The deceased rose and got his bolo and made 
efforts to </span>go <span>out but the accused prevailed upon him not to go out, 
not to mind the </span>one shouting <span>outside, and to go back to 
</span>sleep instead.<span>&nbsp; </span>The <span>deceased did as bidden; page 7 
<span class="GramE">decision</span>;</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="2Q">(b)<span>&nbsp; </span>This particular testimony of accused-appellant was 
not rebutted by prosecution despite full opportunity for it to dispute it and 
the court appeared to have overlooked this fact in its decision;</p>
<p class="2Q">(c)<span>&nbsp; </span>While prosecution witness Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span> declared that when he want to the house of 
accused-appellant after having learned from other people that Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> was stabbed, in the morning of February 16, 1981, 
he asked the husband as to who stabbed him in the seeing and hearing presence of 
accused-appellant in same room and this allegedly answered "Your <span class="SpellE">Tia</span>", the latter denied this and said <span>that </span>that 
was<em> NOT THE ANSWER</em> <span>her </span>husband gave to <span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span> but that it was "ASK YOUR TIA." (As this court will 
presently see this particular conflict of the parties <span>on </span>this 
precise point deserves concentrated attention because the guilt or <span class="SpellE"><span>innocense</span></span><span> </span>of accused-appellant 
hangs on this line ‚Äî this is the rationale of the court in concluding that the 
guilt of accused <span>was </span>established beyond reasonable 
doubt.)<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="2Q">(d<span class="GramE">)<span>&nbsp; </span>Another</span> un-contradicted 
testimony of the defense is that of witness for the accused Lorenzo <span class="SpellE">Escobia</span> who said while passing by the house of 
accused-appellant at around 4:00 dawn already of February 16, 1981, he saw a 
person hurrying down from the house without recognizing this and as he was 
merely passing by he did not tarry and did not hear any sound coming from the 
house."<span><o:p></o:p></span></p></blockquote>
<p class="BODY"><span>Appellant raises a sole assignment of error to wit:<span>&nbsp; 
</span>That the trial court erred in concluding that </span>the guilt of the 
accused was established beyond reasonable doubt on the meager and unreliable 
evidence of the prosecution.<span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>It is undisputed that there was no eyewitness to the 
crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>Accused was convicted merely on <span class="SpellE">circumstancial</span> evidence namely:<span>&nbsp; </span>(1) that a 
serious altercation between the deceased and accused who were childless preceded 
the stabbing incident, (2) that she (accused) caused her brother to be fetched 
from the neighboring <span class="SpellE">barangay</span> on the pretext that the 
deceased was suffering from a stomach ache indicating her intention to hide the 
crime from the pub</span>lic (3) <span>that accused did not shout for help 
</span>when she <span>allegedly discovered that her husband had been stabbed and 
that she was abnormally unperturbed by the dire condition of Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span> all throughout and (4) that she suppressed 
evidence by hiding the clothes that were worn by the deceased when he was 
stabbed.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court gave great weight to the testimony of the 
witness for the prosecution Alfredo <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Hinayon</span></span><span class="GramE">, that</span> the deceased 
Ernesto <span class="SpellE">Magallanes</span>, pointed to the appellant as his 
assailant.<span>&nbsp; </span>The trial court treated it as a dying declaration and 
thus, admissible as part of the <span class="SpellE"><em>res</em></span> 
</span><span class="SpellE"><em>gestae</em></span>, <span>having been given 
immediately subsequent to his stabbing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="BODY"><span>We do not agree with the conclusion reached by the trial 
court in its appreciation of the evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>Some undisputed facts 
raise questions in <span class="GramE">Our</span> minds which must be resolved 
before We can establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt.<span>&nbsp; 
</span>The testimony of witness Alfredo <span class="SpellE">Hinayon</span> should 
not be given credence because his testimony and extra-judicial statement (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C) <span class="GramE">that</span> the deceased pointed 
to the appellant </span><span>as </span><span>his assailant contradicted his 
(<span class="SpellE">Hinayon's</span>) statement during the preliminary 
examination (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 2) in the Municipal Court of <span class="SpellE">Anda</span>, wherein he stated the following:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<blockquote>"Q.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was Ernesto still alive when you 
arrived?"</blockquote>
<blockquote>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Q.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did you inquire from his (sic) as to who 
stabbed him?<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes.<span><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Q.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What was his answer?</span></blockquote>
<blockquote>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He answered '<em>YOU ASK YOUR TIA</em>', meaning 
Auntie.</blockquote>
<blockquote><span>Q.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whom did he refer to as <span class="SpellE"><em>Tiya</em></span>?</blockquote>
<blockquote>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He was referring to <span class="SpellE">Tiya</span> Cristina (referring to "appellant") (underscoring for 
emphasis)</blockquote>
<p style="text-indent: 0in;" class="BODY">When asked about this inconsistency, 
witness explained that he only gave the above mentioned answer because he was 
prevailed upon by some people who wanted to save his aunt.<span>&nbsp; </span>We are 
not satisfied with the explanation offered by <span>witness.<span>&nbsp; 
</span></span>The variance in the answers of witness is greatly disturbing and 
irreconcilable.<span>&nbsp; </span>While the answer "Your <span class="SpellE"><span>Tia</span></span><span>" </span>appears to convey a 
categorical directness the answer "Ask your <span class="SpellE">Tia</span>" ‚Äî 
contradicts the assertion.<span>&nbsp; </span>The discrepancy in witness' statements 
shows that he was either lying when he executed it or he had simply forgotten 
what was truly spoken by the deceased.<span>&nbsp; </span>Besides, accused-appellant 
(who was acknowledged by witness as inside the room with him <span>and 
</span>the victim when asked who stabbed him) denied that the answer given by 
the deceased <span>was "Your <span class="SpellE">Tia</span>." </span>Furthermore, 
the prosecution failed to prove that the quarrel between the spouses in the 
evening of the commission of the crime was so violent or so heated and 
acrimonious that accused-appel<span>lant was </span>so inflamed to have decided 
to kill her husband.<span>&nbsp; </span>We fail to see any motive on the part of the 
accused why she should desire to kill her husband.<span>&nbsp; </span>There must 
always be a compelling reason for one spouse to want to kill the other as for 
example, 1) repeated beatings by the husband of the wife to have engendered in 
the latter a desire to be rid of the husband; 2) where the wife has a lover to 
whom she is more strongly attached than her <span>husband, or </span>the other 
way around, where the husband has a "kept woman" of whom the wife has developed 
extreme jealousy and 3) where the deceased <span>husband </span>had a large 
insurance to have tempted accused-appellant into thinking of inheriting big 
money.<span>&nbsp; </span>The entire evidence for the prosecution is absolutely 
barren of any evidence that one or the other of the above existed.</p>
<p class="BODY">Nor can <span class="GramE">We</span> consider <span class="SpellE">Hinayon's</span> Affidavit (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. C, C-1 
&amp; C-2 re the supposed reference <span>by the </span><span>dying man 
</span><span>to </span>"Your <span class="SpellE">Tia</span>", <span>as 
</span>part of the <span class="SpellE"><em>res</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>gestae</em></span> or a dying declaration.<span>&nbsp; </span>The 
ambiguous tone of <span class="SpellE">Hinayon's</span> testimony as to the 
precise answer of the deceased to the question <span class="GramE">who</span> 
killed him detracts from any entitlement it would have had as part of the <span class="SpellE"><em>res</em></span> <span class="SpellE"><em>gestae</em></span>.<span>&nbsp; </span>For testimonies to be vested 
with such character, these have to be un-equivocal, clear and precise, not where 
there are ‚Äî as in the case at bar ‚Äî clear vulnerabilities because of <span>a 
</span>recollection tainted already with forgetfulness.<span>&nbsp; </span>We did not 
fail to consider the fact that the evidence for the defense is also weak; 
however, conviction must come from the strength of prosecution‚Äôs evidence and 
not from the weakness of the defense evidence.<span>&nbsp; </span>The rule is that 
before there can be a conviction upon circumstantial evidence, the circumstances 
proved should constitute an <span>unbroken </span>chain which leads to one fair 
and reasonable conclusion pointing to the accused, to the exclusion of all 
others, as the author of the crime.<span>&nbsp; </span>(<em>People vs. </em><span class="SpellE"><em>Pamintuan</em></span>, 127 SCRA 820).<span>&nbsp; </span>We cannot 
be morally convinced, therefore, that the <span class="GramE">accused</span> who 
is a wife in her late sixties with her known loyalty to her husband, would kill 
him without any plausible motive.</p>
