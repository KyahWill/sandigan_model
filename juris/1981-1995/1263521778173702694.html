This is an appeal by <em>certiorari</em>, seeking the review of the 
decision of respondent Employees' Com­pensation Commission in ECC Case. 
No. 1963, dated June 16, 1983, affirming the decision of respondent 
Government Service Insurance System denying the claim of petitioner 
Venusto Panotes for compensation benefits under P.D. 626, as amended, 
for the death of his wife, Agustina Garfin Panotes, on the ground that 
the cause of death, colonic malignancy or cancer of the colon, is not 
compensable.76
<p>
The GSIS, however, paid the petitioner gratuity benefits under C.A. No. 
186, as amended, in the amount of P28,405.22, in lieu of compensation 
benefits.  The GSIS, also, will refund to the petitioner the total 
retirement premiums paid by his deceased wife (with interest) and the 
corresponding government share (without interest) [Comment, p. 20, 
rec.].
</p><p>
For more than 30 years, from 1949 to 1980, the deceased worked as an 
elementary school teacher of the Ministry of Education and Culture, her 
last assignment being With the Francisco Balagtas Elementary School in 
Sta. Cruz, Manila (p. 6, rec.).
</p><p>
On October 25, 1979, she was admitted in the UST Hospital, complaining 
of vomiting and severe abdominal pains.  The attending physician, Dr. 
Rafael Ferrer, diagnosed her ailment as colonic malignancy or cancer of 
the colon.  She underwent two operations.  On May 23, 1980, she died of 
the same ailment at the age of fifty.
</p><p>
Upon her death, the petitioner filed with respondent GSIS a claim for 
compensation benefits under P.D. 626, as amended.  The System denied his
 claim on the ground that colonic malignancy was not work-connected.  
Petitioner asked for reconsideration but the same was denied, with 
respondent GSIS reiterating that "there is no proof that the deceased's 
ailment was the direct result of the nature of employment" (p. 6, rec.).
  On February 12, 1982, petitioner then wrote to President Marcos, which
 letter was considered as an appeal to the Employees' Compensation 
Commission.  The respondent ECC affirmed the GSIS' denial of the claim, 
on the basis, to wit:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Carcinoma of the colon, medical experts say, is one of the most 
common types of cancer.  The disease is slightly more common in females 
than in males.  It is particularly common in colon involved by multiple 
polyposis or by ulcerative colitis.  If cancer is encountered before the
 fourth decade, it usually is associated with one of these diseases.  
Symptoms are quite variable, depending upon the primary location of the 
tumor.  In the right colon, the symptoms consist of flatulence 
distention to cramp-like pains, secondary anemia and change in bowel 
habit.  In the left colon the symptoms are constipation and bleeding 
with bowel movement is common (Christopher's Textbook of Surgery, Davis,
 7th edition, pp. 708-709). </p>
  <p> "From the foregoing medical discussion, <em>it is evident that 
carcinoma of the colon is traceable to factors but rather to multiple 
polyposis or ulcerative colitis.  It is likewise</em> shown that gastric influence is an important predisposing factor.  <em>There­fore,
 we cannot give weight to appellant's arguments that his wife's 
irregular meals in the course of her employment gave rise to her 
ailment.  This supposition lacks medical basis</em>. </p>
  <p> "Moreover, we note that the deceased in her entire career as a 
teacher was never exposed to toxic chemicals and radioactive substances,
 exposure to which has been found by cancer experts to be contributory 
factors in the development of cancer. </p>
  <p> "Much as we desire to help herein appellant, we cannot do so 
because the facts and the evidence on record negate compensability under
 P.D. 626" (pp. 21-22, rec.). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The only issue is whether or not colonic malig­nancy or cancer of the colon is compensable under P.D. No. 626, as amended.
</p><p>
Petitioner contends that the ailment which took the life of his wife is 
not an occupational disease, nevertheless, he asserts that the risk of 
contracting the same was increased by the nature and the working 
conditions of his wife's employment.  He further contends that the 
deceased was in perfect health when the started teaching in 1949.  
Because of the meetings and other school activities, she missed her 
meals occasionally which weakened her and made her susceptible to 
diseases.  He also contends that by the nature of her job and precisely 
because of her employment her disease worsened resulting in her early 
demise.
</p><p>
Respondent ECC, on the other hand, contends that cancer of the colon is 
not listed as an occupational disease and no proof was shown that the 
risk of con­tracting the same was increased by the working conditions.  
Furthermore, ECC contends that the doctrine of compensability and the 
principle of aggravation have been abandoned under the New Labor Code.  
Respondent Commission also submits that "the New Labor Code is an 
entirely new social insurance scheme, vastly different in philosophy and
 approach from the old law where the employer shoulders by himself 
alone, the responsibility of paying liability compensation.  It was and 
still is envisioned to compensate only purely work-connected sickness, 
disability or death, to restore a sensible equilibrium between the 
employer's obligation to pay workmen's compensation and the employees' 
right to receive reparation for work-connected disability or death" (p. 
40, rec.).
</p><p>
WE find for the petitioner.
</p><p>
The disease cancer of the colon, has been described as follows:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "A malignant new growth of the colon.  This type of cancer is made
 up of cells which tend to infiltrate the surrounding tissues and give 
rise to metastasis.  It usually grows to a large size and produces 
constipation and ulceration with bleeding.  This type of cancer is 
believed to have a close relationship between lesions of the large 
intestines such as polyps chronic inflammatory disease of the colon as 
seen in ulcerative colitis.  Familial tendency of the diseases is also 
well documented" (p. 21, rec.). </p>
  <p> "Cancer of the Colon Etiology.  The cause of colon cancer is <em>unknown</em>.
  The greater incidence in Western Society suggests that dietary factors
 may be involved x x x.  As mentioned above, while there is a 
possibility that adenomatous polyps <em>may </em>become malignant, 
villous adenomas are definitely associated with cancer.  It appears that
 a colon bearing a polyp may develop a cancer elsewhere.  Congenital 
multiple polyposis of the colon has an astonishingly high malignant 
potential; ulcerative colitis also seems to potentiate or stimulate the 
development of carcinoma in the diseased bowel.  Other lesions of the 
large intestine <em>seem </em>to bear no causal relations to cancer (pp;
 1563-1564, Harrison, Principles of Internal Medicine, 8th Edition; 
Italics supplied). </p>
  <p> "Carcinoma of the large bowel is fairly common at any age, but 75%
 of the cases are discovered in the sixth, seventh and eighth decades of
 life.  Males and females are affected about equally.  All colonic 
cancers tend to be more aggressive in younger patients, resulting in a 
sharp reduction in the five year survival rate.  The question of a 
familial tendency with respect to these lesions has long been a <em>con­troversial issue</em>.
  While a few reports have cited a higher attack rate in blood relatives
 of a proband, other reports have disagreed.  In any event, if any 
familial tendency exists, it is indeed <em>equivocal</em>. </p>
  <p> "It is well to remember that certain conditions predispose to the 
development of carcinoma of the colon.  These include chronic ulcerative
 colitis, multiple familial polyposis, villous adenomas and previous 
colonic carcinoma.  In about 4% of the cases two carcinomas occur either
 concomitantly or successively.  Stated in another way, the patient with
 a primary colonic carcinoma has a severalfold increased likelihood of 
developing a completely independent second tumor.  x x x It is now 
appreciated that carcinoma of the colon <em>pre-exists for a considerable time before it produces clinical symtoms</em>.
  It begins in all probability as an 'in situ' lesion and then later 
becomes a small mucosal area of asymptomatic cancerous transformation.  <em>In all likelihood it requires years to become an overt tumor</em>.  x x x" (pp. 881-883, <em>Pathology</em> by Robbins, 3rd edition; Italics supplied). </p>
  <p> "Carcinoma of the colon, medical experts say, is one of the most common types of cancer.  <em>The disease is slightly more common in females than in males</em>.
  It is particularly common in colon involved by multiple polyposis or 
by ulcerative colitis.  If cancer is encountered before the fourth 
decade, it usually is associated with one of these diseases.  Symptoms 
consist of flatulence distention to cramplike pains, secondary anemia 
and change in bowel habit.  <em>In the left colon the symptoms are constipation and bleeding with bowel movement</em> is common" (Christopher's <em>Textbook of Surgery</em>, Davis, 7th edition, pp. 708-709, as cited by respondent in its decision, p. 13, rec.; Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Based on the foregoing, it is evident that the cause of colonic 
malignancy is still unknown.  Predisposing factors which may cause the 
fatal disease have been mentioned but all these have been qualified as 
probabilities.  As in other cancer diseases, medical experts are still 
in the process of finding out the exact nature of the disease, what 
causes it and what may cure it.
</p><p>
In its decision, however, respondent ECC was definite in its conclusion 
that the fatal disease is traceable to factors which are not 
attributable to employment but rather to multiple polyposis or 
ulcera­tive colitis.  This indeed, is a sweeping conclusion which is 
devoid of any merit.  Respondent cannot state definite conclusions from 
an unknown or uncertain premise.  It must be pointed out that medical 
authorities have always qualified their discussion of the subject with a
 statement that "the cause of the disease (cancer of the colon) is still
 unknown."
</p><p>
Cancer is still an unanswered question in medical science.  Its nature 
and cause are vague even to the most respected experts in the medical 
field and its characteristic fatality and uncertainty are unfortunately 
the only feature which are certain and definite.  Thus, in the case of 
Acosta vs. ECC (109 SCRA 210), this Court recognized such fact and 
commented:  "x x it is generally accepted that the exact origin of 
practically all types of cancer is not yet determined.  Scientists and 
medical experts are still in the process of discovering the most 
effective cure for that malady.  With this backdrop, one should not 
expect ordinary persons like petitioner to prove the real cause of the 
ailment of the deceased when the experts themselves are still in the 
dark." This pronouncement by the high Court indeed justifies 
petitioner's allegation that the nature and the working conditions of 
his wife's employment increased the risk of contracting the fatal 
disease.
</p><p>
The deceased worked as an elementary school teacher from 1949 until she 
contracted the fatal disease in 1979.  She entered the service in 
perfect health.  As a teacher, she was not simply confined to the four 
corners of her classroom but instead was made to attend meetings and 
other school activities.  She must have been assigned in other places in
 the course of her service, a natural occurrence in the life of an 
elementary public school teacher.  This exposed her to far and dirty 
places where she could have contracted viruses and para­sites.  Her 
constant exposure to chalk and dust, to the vagaries of nature when 
attending school activities, would naturally take its toll on her 
health.
</p><p>
She was constantly under physical, mental and emotional pressure.  She 
does not only teach children but had to take care of them too, thus, 
entailing a very big responsibility on her shoulders.  She must stay in 
the classroom throughout the class hours and must wait until recess time
 or until the class is over before she could relieve herself whenever 
the need for it arises, which was of course very detrimental to the 
health, adding to the sad fact that most comfort rooms in public schools
 are quite unhygienic.
</p><p>
She had loads of work to do which surely made her miss her meals, as 
alleged.  The tension and the pressure which every teacher must go 
through in order to finish the papers and the grades of at least forty 
pupils on time, aside from the fact that they have to attend to other 
school activities, cannot be discounted.  These factors would likely 
weaken her bodily condition and make her susceptible to diseases.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> In the case of Abadiano vs. GSIS (111 SCRA 509) citing the case of
 Meñez vs. ECC (97 SCRA 87), this Court expressed concern for public 
school teachers, thus: </p>
  <p> "<span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx.</p>
  <p> "Finally, Republic Act 4670, other­wise known as the Magna Charta 
for Public School Teachers, recognized the enervating effects of these 
factors (duties and activities of a school teacher certainly involve 
physical, mental and emotional stresses) on the health of school 
teachers when it directed in one of its provisions that 'Teachers shall 
be protected against the consequences of employment injury in accordance
 with existing laws.  The effects of physical and nervous strain on the 
teacher's health shall be recognized as compensable occupa­tional 
diseases in accordance with laws'" (Pantoja vs. Republic, et al., 
L-43317, December 29, 1978). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As correctly alleged by petitioner, the theory of increased risk is 
applicable in this case.  Section 1(b), Rule III of P.D. 626, as 
amended, states:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "For the sickness and the resulting disability or death to be 
compensable, the sickness must be the result of an occupational disease 
listed under Annex 'A' of these Rules with the conditions set therein 
satisfied; otherwise, proof must be shown that the risk of contracting 
the disease is increased by the working conditions."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Construing the above provision in the case of Cristobal vs. ECC (103 SCRA 329), this Court stated the following:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "To establish compensability under the said theory, the claimant 
must show proof of work-connection.  Impliedly, the degree of proof 
required is merely substantial evidence, which means 'such relevant 
evidence to support a decision' (Ang Tibay vs. The Court of Industrial 
Relations and National Labor Union, Inc., 69 Phil. 635) or clear and 
convincing evidence.  In this connection, it must be pointed out that 
the strict rules of evidence are not applicable in claims for 
compensation.  Respondents however insist on evidence which would 
establish direct causal relation between the disease rectal cancer and 
the employment of the deceased.  Such a strict requirement which even 
medical experts cannot support considering the uncertainty of the nature
 of the disease would negate the principle of the liberality in the 
matter of evidence.  Apparently, what the law merely requires is a 
reasonable work-connection and not a direct causal relation.  This kind 
of interpretation gives meaning and substance to the liberal and 
compassionate spirit of the law as embodied in Article 4 of the New 
Labor Code which states that 'all doubts in the implementation of the 
provisions of this Code, including its implementing rules and 
regulations shall be resolved in favor of labor.' </p>
  <p> "x x x As the agents charged by the law to implement the social 
justice guarantee secured by both 1935 and 1973 Constitutions, 
respondents should adopt a more liberal attitude in deciding claims for 
compensation especially when there is some basis in the facts inferring a
 work-connection.  <em>This should not be confused with the presumption 
of compensability and the theory of aggravation under the Workmen's 
Compensation Act.  While these doctrines may have been abandoned under 
the new Labor Code (the constitutionality of such abrogation may still 
be challenged), it is significant that the liberality of the law, in 
general, still subsists</em>.  x x x" (Italics supplied). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Considering the uncertainty of the cause of cancer diseases, the Court has ruled that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "x x x (I)t is possible that the disease must have supervened 
before the Amended Labor Code took effect.  Even if the illness occurred
 after the Amended Labor Code had taken effect, the illness of the 
deceased should be considered as compensable" (Dator vs. ECC, 111 SCRA 
632; Cristobal vs. ECC, 103 SCRA 329). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Finally, it must be reiterated that the deceased died of a disease 
(colonic malignancy) the etiology or cause of which is still unknown.  
Taking this fact into consideration, this Court has enunciated the 
following ruling in the case of Dator vs. ECC, et al. (111 SCRA <em>supra</em>) as cited in the case of De Leon vs. ECC (118 SCRA 544):
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "We have ruled that until now the cause of cancer is still unknown.  Despite this fact, however, <em>the
 ECC has listed some kinds of cancer as com­pensable.  There is no 
reason why cancer of the lungs should not be considered as a compensable
 disease</em>" Italics supplied. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Thus, where the cause of employees' death is unknown, the right to 
compensation subsists, the reason being that the Workmen's Compensation 
Act is a social legislation, designed to give relief to the workingman, 
and therefore, to effectuate its purposes, it must be liberally 
construed (Najera vs. ECC, 122 SCRA 697).  In compensation cases, strict
 rules of evidence are not applicable.  Proof of actual cause of the 
ailment is not necessary.  The test of evidence or the relation of the 
disease with the employment is probability and not certainty (San 
Valentin vs. ECC, 118 SCRA 160).  To be compensable, it is enough that 
the hypothesis on which workmen's claim is based is probable.  Medical 
opinion to the contrary can be disregarded (Delegente vs. ECC, 118 SCRA 
67).
</p><blockquote>
  <p>
    In the case of Cristobal vs. ECC (10 SCRA 329), as cited in the case
 of Abadiano vs. GSIS (111 SCRA 509), this Court had the occasion to 
qualify the compensability of borderline cases in the New Labor Code and
 the social justice guarantee under this new set-up, thus:
  </p>
  <p> "<span class="GramE">xx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="SpellE">xx</span>.</p>
  <p> "In the instant case, it is evident that rectal cancer is one of 
those borderline cases.  Like, it is clear that the purpose of the 
reso­lution is extend the applicability of the provisions of P.D. 626, 
thereby affording a greater number of employees the opportunity to avail
 of the benefits under the law.  This is in consonance with the avowed 
policy of the State, as mandated by the Consti­tution and embodied in 
the New Labor Code, to give maximum aid and protection to labor.  The 
Employees' Compensation Commission, like the defunct Court of Industrial
 Relations and the Workmen's Compensation Commission, is under 
obligation at all times to give meaning and substance to the 
constitutional guarantees in favor of the working man, more specially, 
the social justice guarantee; for otherwise, these guarantees would be 
merely 'a lot of meaningless patter' (Santos vs. WCC, 75 SCRA 37], 
1977). </p>
  <p> "As pointed out by no less than the respondent ECC itself in its Comment dated January 5, 1978 -- </p>
  <p> 'It may not be amiss to mention that the <em>ECC has time and again expanded the list of occupational diseases</em>.  This comes about <em>after continuing studies</em> made by the ECC.  <em>Indeed, cancer has been included a qualified occupational disease </em>in certain cases - x x x.' </p>
  <p> "Worth noting is the fact that the above types of cancer have no 
known etiology.  Yet they are regarded as occupational.  The clear 
implication is that the law merely requires a reasonable work connection
 (pp. 59-60, rec.). </p>
  <p> "From the foregoing statements, it is palpable that the respondent
 ECC recognizes, as it is duty bound to, the policy of the State to 
afford maximum aid and protection to labor.  Therefore, to require the 
petitioner to show the actual causes or factors which led to the 
decedent's rectal malignancy would not be consistent with this liberal 
interpretation.  It is of universal acceptance that practically all 
kinds of cancer belong to the class of clinical diseases whose exact 
etiology, cause or origin, is unknown.  x x x (Id., pp. 479-480)" 
[Italics supplied]. </p>
