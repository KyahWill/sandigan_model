Constancio L. Cauyan was convicted by the then Court of First Instance 
of Quezon of the crime of murder in Criminal Case No. 14735 and of 
frustrated murder in Criminal Case No. 14737.  In the murder case, said 
accused was sentenced "to suffer twenty (20) years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>,
 with the accessory penalties provided by law; to indemnify the heirs of
 the deceased Claudia Amat in the sum of P6,000.00 with subsidiary 
imprisonment in case of insolvency; and to pay the costs." In the 
frustrated murder case, he was sentenced "to suffer an indeterminate 
penalty of from two (2) years and four (4) months of <em>prision correccional</em>, as minimum, to twelve (12) years of <em>prision mayor</em>, with the accessory penalties prescribed by law; and to pay the costs."
<p>
From his conviction in both cases, Constancio L. Cauyan appealed to the 
then Court of Appeals.  In its resolution, dated January 18, 1971, the 
appellate court certified to Us Criminal Case No. 14735 (CA-G.R. No. 
06224-Cr.) for final determination because "eliminating passion and 
obfuscation as a mitigating circumstance, the proper penalty should be <em>reclusion perpetua</em>."
</p><p>
Prosecution evidence shows that about 9:30 in the evening of April 7, 
1961, Claudia Amat, then 58 years old, was heard by her husband, Maximo 
Patron, and her son, Andres Patron, shouting "Huag, pare! tama na, 
pare!." Andres Patron, 21 years old, rushed to the stairs of their house
 where he saw appellant Constancio L. Cauyan stabbing his mother.  When 
appellant saw him he stabbed Andres on the armpit and other parts of his
 body.  Whereupon, Andres went to their yard and took a piece of wood 
with which to defend himself and his mother.  Appellant still holding 
the knife ran after Andres who fell to the ground.  The neighbors 
shouted at him to rise up immediately as Cauyan might catch up with him 
and kill him.  Rising up, he continued to run and shouted for help.  
Roman Natividad responded by firing his gun in the air to scare 
appellant and to alarm the police.  As this juncture, Cauyan stopped 
chasing Andres.
</p><p>
Claudia Amat, who suffered four (4) stab wounds, one in the heart, and 
contusions in the left leg, died few minutes thereafter.  Andres 
suffered several stab wounds also which could have caused his death were
 it not for the timely and able medical assistance given him.
</p><p>
In his defense, appellant testified that it was Andres who first hit him
 on the head and it was only then that he drew his knife and stabbed 
Andres.  During their struggle, Andres jumped back and his mother, 
Claudia, who was holding him (Andres) was exposed and she was hit 
instead by the stab blows.  Thus, appellant contends that the knife 
thrusts at Claudia were accidental; and, with respect to Andres, he 
inflicted the wounds in legitimate self-defense.
</p><p>
The Special First Division of the then Court of Appeals with the then 
Presiding Justice Salvador V. Esguerra, as the ponente, and with 
Justices Ramon Nolasco and Manuel Barcelona, concurring, made the 
following findings on how the stabbing occurred.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "After a careful study of the two versions, we are more inclined 
to believe as true that given by the prosecution.  As motive for the 
stabbing, the prosecution contends that the appellant was actuated by 
hate and resentment against the Patron family because the father of 
Andres had bailed out a certain Rev. Fr. Palilio in connection with a 
criminal case which the appellant had filed against the priest.  But we 
are not persuaded by this alleged motive in arriving at the conclusion 
that Claudia was indeed stabbed in the manner and under the 
circumstances given by the prosecution.  The evidence is clear from the 
testimonies of the witnesses for the prosecution that Claudia was 
stabbed by appellant at the foot of the stairs of her house.  When her 
husband, Maximo Patron, rushed to her side upon hearing her cries, 
Claudia told him 'Ako ay hinarang ni Pareng Asing (referring to 
Constancio Cauyan) sa makapanaog ng hagdanan at ako'y pinagsasaksak." 
When appellant failed to overtake Andres, appellant was heard to have 
shouted 'Kayo pala ay hanggang diyan, mga hayop kayo' (referring to the 
Patrons). </p>
  <p>
  Andres Malanas, a barber, testified, among others, that before the 
stabbing appellant went to his barber shop and sharpened his knife, and 
when asked why he was so doing that, appellant answered that it was 
necessary to keep the same sharp because he had many enemies.
  </p>
  <p>
  The witnesses, most of whom were in the immediate neighborhood of 
appellant and victims, appear not to have been actuated by bias, 
interest, or bad motives, that would impugn the veracity of their 
testimonies.  Moments before the incident, appellant admitted having had
 a drinking spree with a friend at which they drank one bottle of 
whisky.  Appellant's claim that the stabbing of Claudia was accidental 
cannot physically fit into any of the facts and situations duly 
established.  In the first place, Claudia received no less than four 
stab wounds on different parts of her body.  This circumstance alone 
would be sufficient to belie the claim of accidental stabbing.  True 
indeed, appellant was boxed by Andres when the latter saw his mother 
being mercilessly stabbed by appellant.  But the fist blow was no match 
against the pointed and sharp-bladed knife of appellant.  And when 
Andres was stabbed in the armpit and other parts of his body he looked 
around and was able to pick up a piece of wood with which to defend 
himself against appellant.
  </p>
  <p>
  We agree with the trial court that in Criminal Case No. 14735 (CA-G.R.
 No. 06224-CR) treachery had qualified the crime of murder.  But we do 
not accept its finding of passion and obfuscation as a mitigating 
circumstance in favor of appellant.  In sentencing appellant to the 
minimum penalty of 20 years of <em>reclusion temporal</em>, the trial 
court considered in his favor this mitigating circumstance for the 
reason, according to the court, that Maximo Patron, husband of the 
deceased, had bailed out Rev. Fr. Palilio against whom appellant had 
filed a criminal case.  We do not agree that the act of Maximo Patron of
 having bailed out Rev. Fr. Palilio could have by its very nature 
effectively caused passion and obfuscation upon appellant.  An offended 
party who feels sore and is enraged at the bondsman of one he charges 
with a crime is a rare specimen of mankind.  That behavior is not in 
line with the natural tendencies and experience of an ordinary human 
being.  One who so reacts must have been harboring in his heart 
something sinister against the bondsman which drove him to wreak 
vengeance on the latter's wife.  This is not the kind of passion and 
obfuscation contemplated by law as an extenuating circumstance in favor 
of the accused." (pp. 173-176, Rollo). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We fully agree with the appellate court in its rejection of passion and 
obfuscation as a mitigating circumstance in favor of appellant 
Constancio L. Cauyan.  In order that the circumstance of passion and 
obfuscation can be considered, it is necessary to establish the 
existence of an unlawful act sufficient to produce such a condition of 
mind, and it must be shown that the act which produced the passion and 
obfuscation is not far removed from the commission of the crime by a 
considerable length of time, during which the perpetrator might recover 
his normal equanimity (People vs. Gervacio, 24 SCRA 960; People vs. 
Layson, 30 SCRA 92).  In the case at bar, it was not unlawful on the 
part of Maximo Patron, husband of the deceased Claudia, when he acted as
 bondsman for Rev. Father Palilio whom appellant had criminally charged 
in court.  And, it has not been shown that the act of having bailed Fr. 
Palilio was so proximate in point of time to the commission of the crime
 as to preclude a sober realization of the wrongfulness of the course of
 action taken by appellant.
</p><p>
ACCORDINGLY, appellant Constancio L. Cauyan, in Criminal Case No. 14735 
(CA-G.R. No. 06224-CR), is guilty of the crime of murder and is hereby 
sentenced to suffer the penalty of <em>reclusion perpetua</em>, to indemnify the heirs of Claudia Amat in the sum of P30,000.00 and to pay the costs.
