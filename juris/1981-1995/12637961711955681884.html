of public funds/property before respondent <span class="SpellE">Sandiganbayan</span>,
which as earlier stated, found him guilty thereof.</p>

<p class="BODY">In assailing his conviction petitioner raises the following
issues:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
evidence submitted by the prosecution has satisfactorily established that the
shortage was due to misappropriation or embezzlement or conversion of the
accused as alleged in the information for his own benefit or use, and</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
guilt of the accused was proven beyond reasonable doubt.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Article 217 of the Revised Penal Code provides that it shall be <u>prima</u>
<u>facie</u> evidence for <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> when a public
officer fails to have duly forthcoming any public funds or property for which
he is chargeable on demand by any duly authorized officer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That presumption of guilt is founded on human
experience and is valid.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Albores</span> vs. Court of Appeals, 132 SCRA 604)</p>

<blockquote>"In <span class="SpellE">malversation</span>, all that is
necessary to prove is that the defendant received in his possession public
funds, that he could not account for them and did not have them in his
possession and that he could not give a reasonable excuse for the <span class="SpellE">disapperance</span> of the same.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>An <span class="GramE">accountable</span> public officer may be convicted
of <span class="SpellE">malversation</span> even if there is no direct evidence
of misappro­priation and the only evidence is that there is shortage in his
accounts which he has not been able to explain satisfactorily." (De Guzman
vs. People 119 SCRA, 337)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, petitioner admits there was a shortage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But he claims that the same was mainly due to
infestation by weevils and rodents, usual shrinkage, spillage and poor
conditions of the various warehouses where the stocks were piled.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The evidence on record however shows that to
verify the alleged infestation, the NFA ma­nagement directed a study of tolerable
allowance for uncontrolled infestation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The result of the study still left petitioner with an accountability of
P3<span class="GramE">,539,940.67</span> plus an additional accountability for
empty sacks valued at P361,020.72.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Therefore, even on the assumption that the warehouses under his control
and supervision were inadequate for storage, or were exposed to the elements,
or the stocks were subject to uncontrolled infestation, at the very least, the
petitioner should not have incurred such an extraordi­nary shortage of empty
sacks, since such materials cannot be totally eaten up by insects, and even if
damaged by the elements, parts thereof would still exist or be salvage­able.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For such quantity of empty sacks to be
totally in­existent, the answer would be they were either stolen or
misappropriated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It simply boggles the
mind to accept the proposition advanced by the petitioner that stocks of corn
grains, <span class="SpellE">palay</span> and rice <span class="SpellE">totalling</span>
1,428,879.86 kilos and P361<span class="GramE">,020.72</span> worth of empty
sacks would disappear without human intervention, gross inexcusable negligence
or willful misappropriation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even
granting that the stocks and empty sacks under the custody and responsibility
of petitioner were exposed to the elements, or stored in inadequate warehousing
facilities or subjected to uncontroll­able infestation such quantities of
accountable properties affected thereby would, at the very least, leave some
rem­nants in their storage places.</p>

<p class="BODY">Citing the case of <span class="SpellE">Albores</span> vs. Court of
Appeals (132 SCRA 604) wherein it was held that "even granting that the
shortage is too great to be attributable to shrinkage, that consideration is
neither sufficient to convict." Petitioner now claims that like <span class="SpellE">Albores</span> (who was found short of 4,658 <span class="SpellE">cavans</span>
and 38 kilos of corn valued at P75<span class="GramE">,­656.94</span>), he is
also entitled to acquittal on reasonable doubt.</p>

<p class="BODY">The aforesaid case of <span class="SpellE">Albores</span> is not
applicable in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
said case, the Court found that:</p>

<blockquote>"The accused was the one who requested that his accountability
be liquidated because he wanted to transfer to another office.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Mr. <span class="SpellE">Arsenio</span> Guer­ra,
then the RCA Agency Manager and his immediate supervisor, testified that there
was no report of any anomaly having been committed by the ac­cused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused himself voluntarily submitted the
records with which the auditors established the shortage.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When informed of the shortage by the
auditors, the accused consulted the Branch Manager, Vicente Caballero, <span class="GramE">the</span> Chief of the Agency Manager, who informed him that he
was found short because he was not given any shrinkage allowance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This conduct of the accused we find
consistent with good faith." (p. 610, supra)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner in the case at bar cannot be said to have acted in
good faith.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the contrary, he has not
contradic­ted or rebutted the evidence of the prosecution showing numerous
irregularities in his records, operations and transactions as Grains Stock
Control Officer of <span class="SpellE">Bukidnon</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Notable among such irregularities found by the audit team are the
following:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) duplicate copies of
warehouse stock receipts (WSR) were cancelled to make it appear that the stocks
covered were not received by him; (2) <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> were not
reflected in his accountabilities in the stock report; (3) duplicate copies of <span class="SpellE">WSRs</span> were altered to increase their moisture contents; (4)
1,443 bags of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> categorized as damaged stocks
were <span class="SpellE">rebagged</span> and intentionally mixed with soil, sand
and gravel and other foreign matters (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
"M-1"); (5) poor warehouse keeping and negligence, compounded by
non-performance by the classifier of his assigned tasks; (6) excessive losses
due to abnor­mal drying operations; (7) rampant alterations in warehouse
documentation on empty sacks transactions; and (8) non-issuance of official
receipts for sales of stocks.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Exhs</span>.</span> "M",

<p class="BODY">These documents submitted as evidence were received from
petitioner himself (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. "D").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is apparent in these altered and
cancelled documents is a scheme to conceal irregularities and justify losses
incurred.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Not only that, actual stock
inventory revealed some bags of <span class="SpellE">palay</span> to have been <span class="SpellE">rebagged</span> and filled with gravel, sand and foreign matters,
an obnoxious attempt to cover-up losses by showing that appellant had 1,443
bags purportedly filled with <span class="SpellE">palay</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">If there had been no timely audit and inventory, petitioner could
have gone scot-free in his attempt to cover-up his losses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under the circumstances, his conten­tion that
he has led a non-luxurious life and is not wealthy is an obvious <u>non</u>-<u>sequitur</u>.</p>
