				<BR><STRONG>PLANA, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify">This is an appeal from a judgment of the then Court of First Instance of Manila, Branch VIII, convicting the accused Nelia Nicandro y Velarma&nbsp; of violation of Section 4, Article II, in relation to Section 2(e), (f), (l), (m), and (o), Article I, of Republic Act 6425, as amended (Dangerous Drugs Act), upon an information which reads:<br><blockquote>"That on or about November 6, 1981, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said accused, not having been authorized by law to sell, deliver, give away to another or distribute any prohibited drug, did then and there willfully, unlawfully, and knowingly sell or offer for sale four (4) sticks of marijuana cigarettes, marijuana flowering tops wrapped in a piece of newspaper, one (1) roach marijuana cigarette and marijuana seeds and ashes contained in a white plastic bag, which are prohibited drugs."</blockquote>The People's version of the facts is as follows:<br><blockquote>"Not long before November 6, 1981, the Drug Enforcement Unit of Police Station. No. 5, Western Police District, Metropolitan Police Force, Manila, received complaints from concerned citizens regarding the illegal sale of prohibited drugs by one alias 'Nel' in the Commo­dore Pension House at Arquiza Street, Ermita, Manila (p. 4, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981).&nbsp; It was also informed that the use of prohibited drugs in said place was rampant (pp. 3, 18-19, tsn, <i>ibid.</i>).<br><br>"Responding to said complaints and reports, Cpl. Salvador Guitan and Pfc. Romeo Joves of the Drug Enforcement Unit of said Police Station No. 5 placed the Commodore Pension House and its surroundings under surveillance for about a week (pp. 4-5, tsn,<i> ibid.</i>).&nbsp; After the complaints and reports were verified to be true, an entrapment with the confidential informant acting as the buyer of marijuana was organized (pp. 5-6, 29-30, 38, tsn, <i>ibid.</i>).<br><br>"At about 9:00 p.m. on November 6, 1981, the police team formed to carry out the entrapment plan was alerted of the presence of the drug pusher, alias 'Nel', at room 301 of the Commodore Pension House, selling marijuana to drug users (pp. 6, 32-33, tsn, ibid.).&nbsp; Imme­diately, Cpl. Salvador Guitan, Pat. Proceso Federes, Pat. Aurora Gomez and Pfc. Romeo Joves proceeded to the said Commodore Pension House and met the female confidential informant at the corner of Arquiza Street and M.H. del Pilar Street, Ermita, Manila (pp. 6, 23, 33, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981; pp. 15-16, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981). Pfc. Joves gave the informant two (2) P5.00 bills, marked Exhibits "D" and "E", with his initial thereon, marked Exhibits "D-1" and "E-1" (Exhs. "D", "D-1", "E" and "E-1", pp. 3-4, Folio of Exhs.; pp. 6, 8, 35, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981; p. 16, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981).&nbsp; They instructed her to follow them to the Commodore Pension House (p. 33, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981).<br><br>"Following later, the informant went to room 301 of the Commodore Pension House (p. 6, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981; p. 17, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981).&nbsp; Upon a given signal, she knocked on the door of the room.&nbsp; Appellant Nelia Nicandro y Velarma, alias 'Nel', opened the door (p. 6, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981).&nbsp; The informant asked to buy some marijuana cigarette and gave appellant the two (2) marked P5.00 bills (p. 6, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981; p. 17, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981).&nbsp; Thereupon, the appellant delivered to informant four (4) sticks of marijuana cigarette (pp. 7, 25, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981; p. 8, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981).<br><br>"Immediately the police team closed in and nabbed appellant (p. 7, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981; p. 17, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981).&nbsp; Pat. Gomez frisked appellant and got from the right front pocket of her pants the two (2) marked P5.00 bills (Exhs. "D" &amp; "E") and from the left pocket of her pants marijuana flowering tops wrapped in a piece of newspaper (pp. 8-9, 12, 34, tsn,&nbsp; Dec. 8, 1981; pp. 9-10, 17-19, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981).&nbsp; Appellant tried to escape by entering her rented room 301 but was immediately collared (pp. 8-9, tsn, Dec. 9, 1981).<br><br><div style="text-align: center;">x x x<br></div><br>"Upon being investigated and after having been duly apprised of her constitutional rights, appellant orally admitted having sold the four (4) sticks of marijuana cigarette and the ownership of the marijuana flowering tops taken from her pocket, but refused to reduce her confession to writing (pp. 12-13, tsn, Dec. 8, 1981.&nbsp; xxx" (People's Brief, pp. 3-6, 8.)</blockquote>To support the charges, the prosecution relied principally on Pat. Joves, who testified that he saw the accused sell marijuana cigarettes to the unnamed police informant, which allegedly the accused verbally admitted when she was under custodial investigation.&nbsp; Pat. Joves declared:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="8%"><div align="justify">"Q </div></td> <td width="92%"><div align="justify">Where were you when the informant handed the two P5.00 bills to the accused?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">We were hidden within the vicinity of Room 301 sir.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q <br></div></td> <td> <div align="justify">After your confidential informant have handed the two P5.00 bills to the accused, what happened next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">"A</div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The accused in turn handed one small plastic bag containing suspected marijuana leaves.

Neither did Cpl. Guitan or Pat. Federis.<br><br>After trial, the trial court convicted the accused as aforesaid and imposed the penalty of <i>reclusion perpetua</i> and a fine of P20,000.00.<br><br>In the instant appeal, defendant-appellant has assigned the following errors:<br><blockquote><center>I</center><br>THE COURT A QUO GRAVELY ERRED IN CONVICTING THE ACCUSED FOR VIOLATION OF SECTION 4 OF ARTICLE II IN RELATION TO SECTION 2(e), (l), (f) and (o).

Joves was not certain as to what he saw.&nbsp; At first, he said that after the police informant had paid appellant, the latter handed to the former "one small plastic bag containing suspected marijuana leaves." Then he corrected himself by saying: "I think it was four sticks of marijuana cigarettes, sir.&nbsp; It is not a plastic bag sir."<br><br>It is probable that Pat. Joves really did not see either the alleged delivery of the marijuana cigarettes or the supposed payment therefor.&nbsp; After all, according to him, the transaction was effected "secretly".&nbsp; On the other hand, if the sale was made within the view of Pat. Joves and his companions, there would have been no need for them to wait for a signal from the police informant to indicate that the transaction had been completed, before closing in and arresting appellant.<br><br>With the testimony of Pat. Joves seriously placed in doubt, there is not much left of the prosecution evidence.&nbsp; Note that the police informant was not presented as a witness, prompting the accused to invoke with reason the presumption that evidence willfully suppressed would be adverse if produced.&nbsp; [Rules of Court, Rule 131, Sec. 5(e).]<br><br>In convicting the appellant, the trial court relied partly on her alleged oral admission during custodial investigation, as testified to by Pat. Joves.&nbsp; This reliance is assailed as violative of Section 20 of Article IV of the Constitution which reads:<br><blockquote>"No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself.&nbsp; Any person under investigation for the commission of an offense shall have the right to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right.&nbsp; No force, violence, threat, intimidation, or any other means which vitiates the free will shall be used against him.&nbsp; Any confession obtained in violation of this section shall be inadmissible in evidence."</blockquote>The above provision is an expanded version of the guarantee against self-incrimination, formally incorporating the doctrine in the landmark American case of <i>Miranda vs. Arizona</i> -<br><blockquote>"x x x Our holding will be spelled out with some specificity in the pages which follow, but briefly stated, it is this:&nbsp; the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.&nbsp; By custodial interrogation, we mean questioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.&nbsp; As for the procedural safeguards to be employed, unless other fully effective means are devised to inform accused persons of their right of silence and to assure a continuous opportunity to exercise it, the following measures are required.&nbsp; Prior to any questioning, the person must be warned that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed.&nbsp; The defendant may waive effectuation of those rights, provided the waiver is made voluntarily, knowingly and intelligently.&nbsp; If, however, he indicates in any manner and at any stage of the process that he wishes to consult with an attorney before speaking, there can be no questioning.&nbsp; Likewise, if the individual is alone and indicates in any manner that he does not wish to be interrogated, the police may not question him.&nbsp; The mere fact that he may have answered some questions or volunteered some statements on his own does not deprive him of the right to refrain from answering any further inquiries until he has consulted with an attorney and thereafter consents to be questioned." [384 U.S. 436, 444-445.&nbsp; Incidentally, the Miranda doctrine rests on just one broad guarantee in the U.S. Constitution, i.e., that no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.&nbsp; (Fifth Amendment.)]</blockquote>When the Constitution requires a person under investigation "to be informed" of his right to remain silent and to counsel, it must be presumed to contemplate the transmission of meaningful information rather than just the ceremonial and perfunctory recitation of an abstract constitutional principle.&nbsp; As a rule, therefore, it would not be sufficient for a police officer just to repeat to the person under investigation the provisions of Section 20, Article IV of the Constitution.&nbsp; He is not only duty-bound to tell the person the rights to which the latter is entitled; he must also explain their effects in practical terms, e.g., what the person under interrogation may or may not do, and in a language the subject fairly understands.&nbsp; (See People vs. Ramos, 122 SCRA 312; People vs. Caguioa, 95 SCRA 2.) In other words, the right of a person under interrogation "to be informed" implies a correlative obligation on the part of the police investigator to explain, and contemplates an effective communication that results in understanding what is conveyed.&nbsp; Short of this, there is a denial of the right, as it cannot truly be said that the person has been "informed" of his rights.&nbsp; Now, since the right "to be informed" implies comprehension, the degree of explanation required will necessary vary, depending upon the education, intelligence and other relevant personal circumstances of the person under investigation.&nbsp; Suffice it to say that a simpler and more lucid explanation is needed where the subject is unlettered.<br><br>Thus, in the cited case of <i>People vs. Ramos,</i> this Court said:<br><blockquote>"In the case at bar, appellant has only finished Grade VI, which means that he is not adequately educated to understand fairly and fully the significance of his constitutional rights to silence and to counsel.&nbsp; As mandated, it is not enough that the police investigator merely informs him of his constitutional rights to silence and to counsel, and then taking his statements down, the interrogating officer must have patience in explaining these rights to him.&nbsp; The records do not reveal that these requirements have been fully complied with, nor was there any showing that appellant has been represented by counsel during custodial investigation.&nbsp; In consonance with Section 20 of the Bill of Rights which states that 'any confession&nbsp; obtained in violation of this section shall be inadmissible in evidence,' We hold that the verbal admissions of appellant during custodial investigation may not be taken in evidence against him." (pp. 321-322.)</blockquote>Like other constitutional rights, the right against self-incrimination, including the right of a person under investigation to remain silent and to counsel, and to be informed of such right, may be waived.&nbsp; To be valid, however, a waiver of the right must not only be voluntary; it must be made knowingly and intelligently&nbsp; (<i>People vs. Caguioa,</i> supra), which presupposes an awareness or understanding of what is being waived.&nbsp; It stands to reason that where the right has not been adequately explained and there are serious doubts as to whether the person interrogated knew and understood his relevant constitutional rights when he answered the questions, it is idle to talk of waiver of rights.<br><br>Going to the instant case, Pat. Joves testified that he conducted the custodial investigation of appellant.&nbsp; As to the manner of investigation, he tersely testified:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="6%"><div align="justify">"Q </div></td> <td width="94%"> <div align="justify">How did you conduct the investigation?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">The first thing I did was I informed the accused of her constitutional rights.<br><br></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> <td><div align="justify"></div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td> <div align="justify">What next?</div></td> </tr> <tr valign="top"> <td><div align="justify">A </div></td> <td><div align="justify">Then I questioned her about the marijuana cigarettes and leaves that were confiscated and also the marked money and she verbally admitted that she sold the four sticks of suspected marijuana cigarettes and possession and ownership of the other marijuana leaves which was confiscated from her possession." (TSN, December 8, 1981, pp. 12-13.)</div></td> </tr> </tbody></table><br>According to Pat. Joves, he informed appellant of her constitutional rights when she was under custodial investigation.&nbsp; What specific rights he mentioned to appellant, he did not say.&nbsp; Neither did he state the manner in which the appellant was advised of her constitutional rights so as to make her understand them.&nbsp; This is particularly significant in the instant case because appellant is illiterate and cannot be expected to be able to grasp the significance of her right to silence and to counsel upon merely hearing an abstract statement thereof.<br><br>As it is the obligation of the investigating officer to inform a person under investigation of his right to remain silent and to counsel, so it is the duty of the prosecution to affirmatively establish compliance by the investigating officer with his said obligation.&nbsp; Absent such affirmative showing, the admission or confession made by a person under investi­gation cannot be admitted in evidence.&nbsp; As broadly stated in the Miranda case and quoted with approval by the then Chief Justice Enrique M. Fernando in <span style="font-style: italic;">People vs. Caguioa,</span> supra, -<br><blockquote>"x x x the prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial investigation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination." (95 SCRA 2, 9.&nbsp; Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>The reason is not difficult to see.&nbsp; A constitutional guarantee should be liberally-construed with a view to promoting its object.<br><blockquote>"x x x Where rights secured by the Constitution are involved, there can be no rule making or legislation which would abrogate them.<br><br><center>x x x</center><br>"In dealing with custodial interrogation, we will not presume that a defendant has been effectively apprised of his rights and that his privilege against self- incrimination has been adequately safe guarded on a record that does not show that any warnings have been given or that any effective alternative has been employed.&nbsp; Nor can a knowing and intelligent waiver of these rights be assumed on a silent record.x x x" (Miranda case, 384 U.S. 436, 491, 498-499.)</blockquote>Thus, in <i>People vs. Ramos, supra,</i> the Court ruled that the verbal admission of the accused during custodial investigation was inadmissible, although he had been apprised of his constitutional rights to silence and to counsel, for the reason that the prosecution failed to show that those rights were explained to him, such that it could not be said that "the apprisal was sufficiently manifested and intelligently understood" by the accused.<br><br>Similarly, in <i>People vs. Caguioa,</i> the Court sustained the rejection by the trial court of the extrajudicial admission made by the accused during custodial investigation, there being no showing by the prosecution that there was sufficient compliance with the constitutional duty to inform the accused of his rights to silence and to counsel, without which there could be no intelligent waiver of said rights.&nbsp; In said case, the accused - a native of Samar - was interrogated in Tagalog.&nbsp; The prosecution did not show that the accused's.&nbsp; acquiantance with Tagalog was such that he could fully understand the questions posed to him.<br><br>All considered, we hold that the guilt of appellant has not been established beyond reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the appealed decision is reversed and set aside, and the appellant is hereby acquitted on the basis of reasonable doubt.<br><br><b>SO ORDERED.</b><br><br><i>Teehankee, (Chairman), Melencio-Herrera, Gutierrez, Jr., De la Fuente,</i> and <i>Patajo, JJ., </i>concur.</div>
