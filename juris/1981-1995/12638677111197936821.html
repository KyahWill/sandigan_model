dismissed was <u>RTJ-88-213</u> in a Resolution dated <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="7">July 18, 1989</st1:date>.) Complainant did not heed this

<p class="BODY">In a memorandum dated <st1:date year="1990" day="13" month="7">July
 13, 1990</st1:date>, the OCA, after enumerating some of the charges, noted
that complainant's persistent filing of administrative cases against respondent
"<span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">signif</span></span><span class="GramE">(</span><span class="SpellE">ies</span>) a desire to unjustifiably
bring respondent to public disdain and ridicule." Also brought to the
attention of the Court was complainant's letter dated June 7, 1990, which
contains accusations that respondent has a "conspirator" in the
Office of the Clerk of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>The conspirator allegedly inserted
inconsistent a<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>words in a final
Court resolution, and supplied lies in respondent's comment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>From the foregoing, the OCA recommended that
complainant be strongly reprimanded, if not suspended from the practice of law
for three (3) months.</p>

<p class="BODY">A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>careful study <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>the charges in these complaints,

can be dismissed outright because:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1)
the complainant failed to establish <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">prima</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <u>facie</u> </span>cases; (2) the
complainant filed administrative cases as substitute for the appropriate remedy
in rulings adverse to him; and (3) the complaints involve the appropriate
exercise of respondent's discretionary authority.</p>

<p class="BODY">First, no <u>prima</u> <u>facie</u> cases have been established
in:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the Seventh Cause of Action in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">RTJ-89-331</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">, </span>since the same grounds have already been found to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">be </span>without merit by the Court in <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Prudencio</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> <span class="SpellE"><u>Penticostes</u></span>,
</span><u>Sr.</u> <u>v.</u> <u>DBP</u>, et al. G.R. No. 89620, July 13, 1990];
(2) <u>RTJ-89-361</u>, which charges respondent with falsification of three
separate orders in three different cases, since no indication of such
falsification can be gleaned from the record; and (3) <u>RTJ-89-438</u>, which
takes issue with the order to archive Civil Case No. 280, "pending
resolution of the matters raised by complainant in the Supreme Court,"
there being nothing irregular <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>such
order.</p>

<p class="BODY">Second, in the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">First, </span>Second
and Fifth Causes of Action in <u>RTJ-89-331</u> (which arose from respondent's
dismissal of Civil Case Nos. 198, 234, and 205, respectively), the complainant
resorted to the filing of administrative complaints against respondent judge
instead of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">availing </span>of the
appropriate legal remedies from the adverse rulings, i.e., by motion for
reconsideration, app<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">eal </span>or
petition for review or for <i>certiorari</i>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Third, the complainant challenges the due <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
4.0pt">exercise </span>by respondent judge of his discretion in the following
instances:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) <u>RTJ-89-331</u>, the Third
Cause of Action, the order denying a motion to declare defendants in contempt,
and the order deferring action on a motion for an accounting of harvests; the
Fourth Cause of Action, the denial <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">of </span>a
motion to dismiss; the Sixth Cause of Action, the denial of a motion for
inhibition and two motions for reconsideration; the Eighth Cause of Action, the
order setting aside an order of dismissal; the Ninth Cause of Action, the order
granting a motion for reconsideration; the Tenth Cause of Action, the denial of
a motion for inhibition; (2) <u>RTJ-89-362</u>, separate orders setting aside
the amended complaints in Civil Case Nos. 228, 253, 255, which complaints were
amended to <span class="SpellE">implead</span> respondent as co-defendant for his
alleged use of his judicial powers to prejudice complainant during the
proceedings of the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span> cases; (3) <u>RTJ-89-355</u>,
direct contempt orders; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and (4) <u>RTJ-89-439</u>,
</span>the failure of respondent judge to strike out the answer in two civil
cases.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Considering the nature, frequency and indiscriminate filing of
groundless charges and despite the admonition previously given by resolution of
the Court dated June 20, 1989, which the complainant willfully ignored and
disobeyed by manifesting the intent to file more of the same, the complainant
imposed upon the time, resources and forbearance of the Court and diverted the
energies of the respondent judge <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">who </span>has
been called upon to comment and defend his every action.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is not to say that a judge may not be
answerable for violation of the law and the Code of Judicial Conduct, but not
every order or ruling adverse to a party can be made the basis for an
administrative charge.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a member of the bar, the complainant has responsibilities to
the judiciary.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Code of Professional
Responsibility and the rules <span class="SpellE">thereunder</span> impose
obligations on the lawyer in relation to the court:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Canon 10 states that a lawyer owes candor,
fairness and good faith to the court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Canon 11 provides that a lawyer shall observe and maintain the respect
due to the court and to judicial officers, while Canon 12 mandates that a
lawyer shall exert every effort and consider it his duty to assist in the
speedy and efficient administration of justice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Through his imprudent filing of administrative cases against respondent
judge, complainant has transgressed the provisions of the Code of Professional
Responsibility and miserably failed to observe conduct expected of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">a </span>member of the bar under the Code and
in accordance with his lawyer's oath.</p>
