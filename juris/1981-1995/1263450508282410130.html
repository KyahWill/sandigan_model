 7, 1968</span></st1:date><span style="">,
petitioner-spouses Inocencio H. Gonzales and Rosario Esquivel Gonzales obtained
a housing loan of P80,000.00 from the respondent GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was to be repayable within fifteen years
at 6% interest per annum for the first P30,000.00 and 9% for the balance.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>GSIS accepted as collaterals two (2)
residential lots located in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Quezon City</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, and two (2) agricultural lands located in </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="">Jaen</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="">, Nueva Ecija.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Of the latter two, one is 15.7880 hectares in
area, while the other is 9.4602 hectares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Petitioners were able to
pay several monthly installments of P814.38 until both of them retired
compulsorily from government service in 1973, leaving an unpaid obligation of
over P73,000.00, which, as of </span><st1:date year="1978" day="31" month="5"><span style="">May 31, 1978</span></st1:date><span style="">, amounted to P135,884.87 because of
accumulated interests or arrearages.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">By virtue of Presidential Decree No. 27, other­wise known as the
Tenants' Emancipation Act, effective October 21, 1972, the <i><span style="">agricultural</span></i><span style=""> </span>lands of petitioners were subdivided
and awarded by the then Department of Agrarian Reform to the tenant-farmers
therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was only in May of 1979,
however, that payment by the Land Bank became remittable covering, in particular,
the 15-hectare land of petitioners in <st1:city><st1:place>Jaen</st1:place></st1:city>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The land, having been appraised at P117,005.00, that sum was
tendered by the Land Bank to the <span style="">GSIS </span>broken
down as follows: 20% in cash, or P23,505.00 (recomputed at P23,401.00), and 80%
in bonds or P93,500.00 (re-computed at P93,604.00).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span style="">GSIS
</span>refused acceptance unless the payment in bonds was to be credited thus:
P16,400.00 at par (the loan value of the property), and P77,100.00 in Land Bank
<span style="">bonds discounted at 18% interest per
annum to maturity,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> actuarially computed at P25,375.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, the bonds were given a creditable
value of only P41,775.00 (P16,400.00, at par, plus P25,375.00, the discounted
value) compared to its face value of P93,500.00.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners, on <st1:date year="1979" day="30" month="7">July 30,
 1979</st1:date>, accepted under protest the condition of the <span style="">GSIS.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>This,
however, did not stop them from seeking reconsideration of the decision of the <span style="">GSIS </span>to the extent of appealing to the
Office of the President on September 24, 1979 and offering to pay the balance
of their obligation in cash provided <span style="">GSIS
</span>would accept at par value the Land Bank bonds without awaiting payment
corresponding to their other 9-hectare agricultural land in Jaen.</p>

<p class="BODY">Without reconsidering its previous position, the GSIS resolved:</p>

<blockquote>"X x x.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In accordance
with GSIS policy on the matter, the proposed remittance of Land Bank bonds of
P93,604.00 will be accepted at par only for P16,400 (the loan value of the
property), and the <span style="">balance of
P77,200.00 at the dis­counted rate to yield the System 18% per annum to
maturity.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The total amount creditable,
therefore, is only P65,176.00 (P23,401.00 in cash, and P93,604.00 in Land Bank
bonds with a creditable value of P41,775.00)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Subsequently, the instant Petition for <i>Mandamus</i> was filed
on <st1:date year="1979" day="28" month="11">November 28, 1979</st1:date>, with
petitioners praying that the GSIS be directed to accept the pay­ment of Land
Bank bonds at par value, without any discount whatsoever, so that all of
petitioners' collaterals could be released.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>They also ask for actual, moral and exemplary damages, aside from
attorney's fees and costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issue is whether or not under the provisions of section 80,
Republic Act No. 3844, as amended, the GSIS may be compelled to accept Land
Bank bonds at face value in payment of outstanding loans secured partially by
lands taken by the Land Bank under Operation Land Transfer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 80 of Republic Act No. 3844, otherwise known as "The
Code of Agrarian Reforms of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,"
as amended by Presidential Decree No. 251, provides for the various modes of
settlement by the Land Bank:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 80.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><i>Modes of
Payment</i>. -? The Bank shall finance the acquisition of farm lots under
any of the following modes of settlement:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="">"1. Cash payment of 10% and balance in
25-year tax-free 6% Land Bank bonds:<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the event there is an existing lien or encumbrance on the
land in favor of any Government lending institution at the time of acquisition
by the Bank, the landowner shall be paid the net value of the land (i.e., the
value of the land determined under Proclamation <span style="">(<i>sic</i>) </span>No. 27 minus the outstanding balance/s of the
obligation/<span style="">s secured by the lien/s or
encumbrance/s), and </span><i>the outstanding balance/s of the obligations to
the lending institution/s </i><i><span style="">shall </span>be
paid by the Land Bank in Land Bank bonds or other securities; existing charters
of those institutions to the contrary notwithstanding</i>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">A
similar </span>settlement may be negotiated by the Land Bank in the case of
obligations secured by liens or encumbrances in <span style="">favor of private parties or institutions." (Italics ours)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Clearly, when lands with existing encumbrances are acquired under
the land reform program, the land owner is paid the net value of the land as
determined under Presidential Decree No. 27, minus the outstanding balance of
his obligation to a government lending institution, which is to be paid
directly to the latter by the Land Bank in Land Bank bonds, existing charters
of those government lending institutions to the contrary notwithstanding.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The insistence of the GSIS to dis­count those
bonds (notwithstanding the alleged "reason­ableness" of the 18%
discount rate) is to defeat that very provision aimed not only to cushion the
impact of dispossession on the land owner but also to benefit the tenant so
that the latter may obtain title to the land free from any lien or encumbrance.</p>

<p class="BODY">True, the statute does not explicitly provide that Land Bank
bonds shall be accepted at their face value.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>There can be no question, however, that such is the intendment of the
law particularly in the absence of any provision expressly permitting discounting,
as differentiated from Republic Act No. 304, or the Backpay <span style="">Law, </span>as amended by Republic Acts Nos.
800 and 897, which expressly allows it.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Land Bank bonds are
certificates of indebtedness, approved by the Monetary Board of the Central
Bank, fully tax-exempt both as to principal and income, and bear interest at
the rate of 6% per annum redeem­able at the option of the Land Bank at or
before maturity, which in no case shall exceed 25 years.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are fully negotiable and unconditionally
guaranteed by the Government of the Republic of the Philippines.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">These bonds are deemed contracts and the obligations resulting
therefrom fall within the purview of the non-impairment clause of the
Constitution, and any impairment thereof may take any encroachment in any respect
upon the obligation and cannot be permitted.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, <span style="">the value of these bonds cannot
be diminished </span><span style="">by </span><span style="">any direct or indirect act, particularly,
since said bonds are fully guaranteed by the Government of the Republic of the
Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are issued not in the
open market nor for the primary purpose of raising funds or pooling financial
resources but in the captive market of landowners and to facilitate the speedy
transfer of lands to the tenant-farmers in support of the land reform program
of the Government.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They are not ordinary
commercial paper in that sense subject to discounting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The GSIS fears disastrous
consequences on its actuarial </span>solvency <span style="">and capacity to pay retirement, insurance and other claims of its
members if it were to accept the bonds at par or face value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Whatever unfavorable results the acceptance
may have on its finances, the effects must be deemed to have </span>been <span style="">intended</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> by Presidential Decree No. 251, parti­cularly,
when it provided for the payment in bonds to government lending institutions
their "existing charters to the contrary notwithstanding." If
iniquitous to said institutions, it remains now with the legislative branch to
make the necessary revisions if desired.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The traditional role assigned to the Judiciary is to implement and not
to thwart fundamental policy goals.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

apropos to mention here is Opinion No. 141, series of 1976, of then Secretary <span style="">of </span>Justice Vicente Abad Santos on substantially

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It should also be borne in

24 hectares and less than 24 hectares.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> These </span><span style="">landowners constitute part of the economic middle class which the

<p class="BODY"><span style="">In support of its stand,
the GSIS further ad­vances the ratiocination that since the agricultural land
of 15 hectares subjected to land reform is only one of the securities for
petitioners' out­standing obligation with the GSIS, the Land Bank bond-payments
should be applied at par value only to that portion of the loan secured by the
land covered by Operation Land Transfer.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Stated otherwise, the GSIS is not compelled to accept Land Bank bonds
for the discharge of existing liens or encumbrances on lands given as security
to the GSIS but not acquired by the Land Bank under Operation Land Transfer.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The obligation of the GSIS, it is claimed, is
"limited to acceptance of Land Bank bonds to pay the loan corresponding to
the <i>l</i></span><i><span style="">oan value</span></i><span style=""> </span><span style="">of
the acquired land, and nothing </span><span style="">more."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We find the </span>foregoing
asseverations self-serving and in contravention of Presidential Decree No. 251,
which ordains that "the <i><span style="">outstanding</span></i><span style=""> <i>balance</i> </span>of the obligations to
the lending institution/s shall be paid by the Land Bank in Land Bank bonds or
other securities".<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Italics
supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is clear then that it is
not only the <i>loan value</i> but the outstanding balance of the obligation
that has to be settled with Land Bank bonds, and as discussed above, at their
par or face value.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The fact that only one
agricultural land of the four securities was placed under land reform should </span><span style="">make </span><span style="">no difference.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Although it may
be conceded that the obligation of the petitioners is, in a sense, divisible
because it can be settled partially accord</span>ing to current practice, it
does not render the mortgage of four (4) parcels of land also divisible.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Generally, the divisibility of the principal
obligation is not affected by the indivisibility of the mortgage.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
The mortgage obligation is indivisible; that is, it cannot be divided among the
different lots.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
A real estate mortgage voluntarily constituted by the debtor on two or more
parcels of land is one and indivisible.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>

Being indivisible, the full value of the one parcel being <span style="">paid </span>for by the Land Bank should be
applied in full to the outstanding loan obligation without any discounting.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case at bar does not fall under the exception in Article 2089
of the Civil Code where each of the several things given in mortgage guarantees
only a determinate portion of the credit.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This exception contemplates separate debts secured by separate proper­ties,
which is not the factual set-up herein.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Neither can it be said that the Land Bank, by operation of law, has
rendered the mortgage of the four parcels divisible by taking only one of them
solely to obtain its release.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>basic indivisibility of the
mortgage obligation still remains unimpaired despite that fact.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To hold that the acceptance of the bonds at
par value should be limited only to the loan value of properties acquired by the
Land Bank but should be discounted as to other lands not so acquired, would not
only run counter to the principle of indivisibility of a mortgage and
contravene the clear mandate of PD No. 251, but would also reduce the bond
payment to the dispossessed land-owner by approximately one-half, to his
complete detriment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is a
consequence that neither law, equity, nor justice would countenance.</p>

According to the Opinion: "x x x.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>True, the provision under consideration does not ex­pressly provide that
Land Bank bonds shall be accepted by government lending institutions at their
face or par value.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But I think this
necessarily flows from the very language of the above-quoted provision.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For one, the first mode of payment provided
for is 'cash payment of 10% and <i><span style="">balance</span></i><span style=""> (i.e., </span>90%) in 25-year tax-free 6% <i><span style="">Land Bank bonds</span></i><span style="">.' </span>For another, where there is a lien
or encumbrance in favor of a govern<span style="">ment
lending institution, </span><span style="">'<i>the
outstanding balance/s</i> </span>of the obligations to the lending
institution/s shall be paid by the Land Bank in Land Bank bonds or other
securities.' That an implementation of the GSIS view would operate to defeat
these provisions may easily be seen from an application thereof to the
Villarosa case.</p>

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left: 0.25in; text-indent: 17.55pt;"><span style="">Upon inquiries with the Land Bank, this
Office has been informed that Dr. Villarosa is to be paid by the Land Bank for
her farm lot P28,335 in cash and P178,130 in bonds, and that the outstanding balance
of her obligation to the GSIS is P76,900.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>And upon similar inquiries from the GSIS, it has informed this Office
that acceptance by it of the bonds 'at a discounted value to yield the System
an effective rate of interest at 18% per annum to maturity' means that the
System should be paid in bonds about three times the amount of the existing
balance in its favor, because, according to its actuarial computations, payment
of P1,000 in bonds to the GSIS will extinguish only about P329.12 of the outstanding
balance of the landowner's obli­gation to it.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Thus, if the outstanding balance of </span><span style="">the </span><span style="">obligation to it is,
say, P1,000, the GSIS should be paid approximately P3,000 in bonds if the
obligation is to be totally extinguished.) Now, applying this to the Villarosa
case, the out­standing balance with the GSIS of P76,900 would add up to about
P230,700 in bonds -- in other words, more than the actual outstanding balance
by P153,800.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This would practically wipe
out Dr. Villa­rosa's share in bonds because she would receive only P24,300 in
bonds as compensation for her land, thus nullifying the above-cited provision
requiring pay­ment in bonds of the balance -- or </span><i><span style="">90%</span></i><span style=""> -- </span><span style="">of the amount
payable to the landowner: let alone that the GSIS would be receiving more than
the </span><span style="">'<i>outstanding balance</i>'
</span><span style="">of the loan, contrary to the
above-quoted </span>provision that it is the <i><span style="">outstanding balance</span></i><span style=""> </span>of
the <span style="">loan which should be paid the
government lending institution."</span></p>
