Simsiman of Barangay Marguez in the Municipality of Esperanza, Province of
Sultan Kudarat, Marcelino Aquino, who was then shelling corn under his house
with his mother, Lilia Aquino, was suddenly shot at and hit by a bullet on his
abdomen.  He could only shout the word
"<i>Nay,</i>" before he fell dead.  Three (3) more gunshots from different directions followed.  Then came the shattering explosion of a hand
grenade which had been lobbed into the house causing injuries to Lilia Aquino,
Ailleen (or Aileen) Aquino and Argie Aquino.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the basis of the claim of Ailleen Aquino and her husband,
Salustiano Aquino, that one of the perpetrators of the heinous acts was Nonong
Aguilar, the Station Commander of Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat filed two (2)
separate criminal complaints for Murder<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>

against Nonong Aguilar and two (2) unidentified persons designated as John Doe
and Peter Doe with the 4th Municipal Circuit Trial Court (MCTC) of
Bagumbayan-Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat on 9 August and 24 August 1989,
respectively.  Aguilar was arrested on
16 August 1989 on the strength of a warrant of arrest issued in the first case.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
In the meantime, Aguilar filed a motion to fix bail bond,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

However, on the basis of an agreement between Aguilar's counsel and the
prosecution, the MCTC issued on 6 September 1989 an order allowing the
withdrawal of the motion without prejudice to its refiling in the Regional
Trial Court and ordering the transmittal of the cases to the Office of the
Provincial Prosecutor of Sultan Kudarat.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the prosecution upon which the judgment of
conviction is based is summarized in the Appellee's Brief<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
in this wise:</p>

<p class="2Q">"On August 1, 1989, at around 8:30 p.m. in sitio simsiman, Marquez
(sic), Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat, Marcelino Aquino and his mother Lilia Aquino,
were under their house shelling corn, when suddenly the dogs barked.</p>

<p class="2Q">Sensing that there may be somebody around, Marcelino went out
flashing his flashlight presumably to look for someone who may be the object of
the barking of the dogs.  When Marcelino
found nobody outside, he went back inside the house, sat beside his mother, and
continued shelling corn.</p>

<p class="2Q">On the other hand, Salustiano Aquino, brother of Marcelino, was upstairs
preparing to go to sleep while his wife, Aileen Aquino, was breastfeeding their
child, Argie Aquino.</p>

<p class="2Q">The stillness of the night, however, was<i> </i>broken by a
gunshot.  Marcelino was hit in the
abdomen and he was only able to say 'Nay', after which he died.</p>

<p class="2Q">The first gunshot was followed by three more coming from different
directions and then, there was a shattering explosion of a handgrenade (sic)
causing shrapnel injuries to Aileen, Argie and Lilia.</p>

<p class="2Q">After the grenade explosion, Salustiano, together with his wife and
child slowly and quietly went downstairs and proceeded to the kitchen.  Thereupon, Aileen saw appellant Nonong
Aguilar standing about a meter away from the kitchen and holding a long
firearm.  (TSN, July 13, 1990, pp. 5-6).</p>

<p class="2Q">Noting the presence of appellant near the kitchen of their house,
Aileen whispered to Salustiano that appellant was there.  Salustiano looked towards the man and he
himself recognized him to be Nonong Aguilar.  Salustiano was able to recognize appellant because he was very near to
him, only about a meter away, and the light coming from the kerosene lamp was
reflecting on him (appellant).  (TSN,
Jan. 9, 1990, pp. 13-15).</p>

<p class="2Q">In their escape to the rice paddies nearby, Lilia, the mother of
Salustiano, was able to catch up with them in the ricefield and together they
were able to reach the house of Dionisio Castor.  From there, they went to the Esperanza Police Station where they
reported the incident.</p>

<p class="2Q">For the death of Marcelino, a death certificate marked as Exh.
"E" was issued and for the injuries sustained by Argie, Aileen and
Lilia Aquino, medical certificates, marked as Exhs. "A" "B"
and "D," respectively, were issued by Dra. Ramos, the physician
who  treated them.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the accused puts up the defense of alibi and
advances the following factual version:</p>

<p class="BODY">At 7:00 o'clock on that fateful evening of 1 August 1989, he was
already asleep in his house in Simsiman, Marguez, Esperanza, Sultan
Kudarat.  At 9:30 o'clock that same
evening, however, he was awakened by his father because the latter had heard
"gun reports," followed by an explosion.  The two of them went outside.  Then, the group of Crescencio Dolero, the team leader of the CAFGU in
the barangay, arrived; they wanted to know where the gun reports came from and
he told them that they came from the direction of the house of the
Aquinos.  Dolero's group then proceeded
to the house of the Aquinos.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused denies the testimony of Salustiano Aquino that he was
seen by Ailleen Aquino in the kitchen of the latter's house immediately after
the incident in question and that Salustiano saw and recognized him, as he
pointed a gun and fired at the victim Marcelino Aquino; he insists that he was
then asleep in his house all the time during the occurrence of the incident.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In giving full faith and credit to the version of the
prosecution, the trial court made the following findings:</p>

<p class="2Q">"From the foregoing summary of the testimonies of witnesses
for both the prosecution and the defense, it can thus be seen that the
prosecution would want the court to believe that its witnesses had duly
identified and pointed to the accused, Reynaldo Aguilar, alias Nonong, as the
person who shot and killed the deceased victim, Marcelino Aquino, in Criminal
Case No. 1856, and the person responsible for the grenade explosion which
caused and inflicted the shrapnel wounds to the victims in Criminal Case No.
1857, who were identified as Lilia Aquino, Ailleen Aquino and Argie Aquino,
which incidents happened in the evening of August 1, 1989; while on the other
hand, the accused would like the court to consider his defense of denial and
alibi.</p>

<p class="2Q">Under the aforesaid factual backdrops (sic), had the prosecution
successfully discharged the burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond
reasonable doubt?</p>

<p class="2Q">There is no dispute, as the prosecution and the defense had openly
admitted in court, that the accused, Reynaldo Aguilar alias Nonong, knows
personally the deceased victim, Marcelino Aquino, the latter's brother,
Salustiano Aquino and his wife, Ailleen, and that the accused is, likewise,
known personally to them, since the Aquino family and Aguilar family are
friends and neighbors at Simsiman, Marguez, Esperanza, Sultan Kudarat.</p>

<p class="2Q">Evidently, the prosecution relied heavily on the testimonies of
Salustiano Aquino and Ailleen Aquino who claimed to be eyewitnesses to the
commission of the crimes, and had accordingly identified the accused, Reynaldo
Aguilar alias Nonong, as the person who shot and killed their brother,
Marcelino Aquino, in their house at Simsiman, Marguez, Esperanza, Sultan
Kudarat, in the evening of August 1, 1989, and caused the shrapnel injuries
suffered by Ailleen Aquino, Argie Aquino and Lilia Aquino, as a result of a
grenade explosion to which the said accused was pointed to as responsible.</p>

<p class="2Q">While it is admitted that it was only a kerosene lamp that
allegedly provided the light inside the house of Demetrio Aquino, in the
evening of August 1, 1989, and which allegedly made possible the identification
of the accused, Reynaldo Aguilar alias Nonong, by the prosecution witnesses,
Salustiano Aquino and Ailleen Aquino, who were only a meter away from the
accused, the testimonies of the said prosecution witnesses on the
identification of the accused would be credible.  Thus, the Supreme Court in People vs. Aboga, et al., No. L-70255,
January 29, 1987, held that the testimony of a prosecution witness, who was
only two arms length away and although there was no electricity but there was<b>
</b>a wick lamp inside the house, is credible.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">It then proceeded to cite several cases where this Court had
reiterated the settled rule that alibi cannot prevail over the positive
identification of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">From this judgment, Reynaldo Aguilar interposed an appeal<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>

he raises the following assignment, of errors:</p>

<blockquote>"I.  THE HONORABLE COURT <i>A QUO</i> ERRED IN

<p class="BODY">The appeal is meritorious.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no evidentiary support to the conclusion of the trial
court that the accused was personally responsible for the death of Marcelino
Aquino and that he threw the hand grenade that exploded and caused injuries to
Lilia Aquino, Ailleen Aquino and Argie Aquino.  Nobody saw the person who fired the first gunshot that hit Marcelino on
his abdomen and killed him.  The first
gunshot was followed by three (3) more coming from different directions.  This could only mean that there were three
(3) different persons firing from different directions one of who fired the
first shot, or that just one (1) person fired those three (3) shots while
moving swiftly from one position to another, there being no proof that they
were fired simultaneously.  The three
(3) gunshots were followed by the hand grenade explosion.  On the assumption that there were at least
three (3) assailants, the culpability of the accused would be dependent upon
proof that either he was among the assailants and that he fired the first shot
and threw the hand grenade toward the house of the victims, or that any of the
assailants did either or both.  In the
latter case, proof of conspiracy among the assailants is a condition <i>sine
qua non</i> to the culpability of the accused.  Despite Our painstaking review and evaluation of the evidence, We find
no credible and adequate proof that the accused either fired the first shot and
threw the hand grenade or that there was a conspiracy among the assailants.</p>

<p class="BODY">It appears clear to Us that the judgment of conviction of the
accused for the death of Marcelino Aquino is anchored on the testimony in chief
of Salustiano Aquino that minutes after the explosion which followed the three
(3) gunshots, while he, his wife and son were proceeding towards the kitchen,
he saw the accused pointing a gun at Marcelino Aquino.  The portion of his testimony on this point is
quoted by the trial court, thus:</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the foregoing declarations of
Salustiano and Ailleen are true, the trial court forgot the fact that even before
the explosion which preceded the last shot had occurred, Marcelino Aquino was
already dead.  As earlier stated,
Marcelino was hit by the first shot and died as a consequence thereof.  This fact was admitted by the Appellee in
the summary of the facts in its Brief.  Consequently, unless the accused could be held equally culpable for the
first shot, he cannot be held liable for murder for the so-called second
gunshot allegedly fired at Marcelino in the presence of Salustiano and Ailleen
because Marcelino had been dead minutes before.  But was there in fact a second gunshot fired at Marcelino?  Elsewise stated, is the testimony of
Salustiano that he saw the accused pointing a gun at Marcelino and shooting the
latter credible?  If it is, then
Marcelino should have sustained two (2) gunshot wounds.  The trial court so believed for in its
decision, it stated:</p>

<blockquote>"Evidently, the deceased, Marcelino Aquino, was shot
twice.  The first gunshot that hit him
was fired outside the house during the straffing (sic).  The second gunshot was fired inside the
house, after the grenade explosion, by the accused, Reynaldo Aguilar alias
Nonong, who was apparently seen and positively identified by prosecution
witnesses Salustiano Aquino and Ailleen Aquino."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">So did the prosecutor who filed the
information in Criminal Case No. 1856 and alleged therein that "gunshot
wounds" were inflicted on the victim.  The death certificate,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a>
however, belies all of these.  As to the
<u>cause</u> <u>of</u> <u>death</u>, the said certificate simply states:  "Internal Hemorrhage 2d <u>Gunshot</u> <u>wound</u>,
abdomen about 7 cm below the umbilicus.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
This is clear enough to mean <u>only</u> <u>ONE</u> <u>(1)</u> gunshot wound --
not TWO (2).  This wound could only have
been caused by the first gunshot because Marcelino immediately died as a
consequence thereof.  If he sustained
any other wound, only the doctor who examined the cadaver and issued the
certificate of death could have testified thereon.  Unfortunately, for reasons only known to itself, the prosecution
did not present Dr. Rhodora T. Antenor, the Municipal Health Officer, who
issued the certificate of death.</p>

<p class="BODY">As stated earlier, absent any showing that the accused fired the
fatal shot at Marcelino Aquino or threw the hand grenade that caused injuries
to Lilia Aquino, Ailleen Aquino and Argie Aquino, his culpability could only be
sustained on the ground of conspiracy.  All told, the only thing the prosecution has on this point is the
alleged presence of the accused in the house of the Aquinos at the time the alleged
crimes were committed.  The trial court
did not hesitate to rule that the accused was positively identified by
Salustiano Aquino.  Accused
disagrees.  Thus, in his first assigned
error he vehemently insists that the trial court erred in giving full credence
to Salustiano's incredible testimony relative to the latter's positive
identification of the accused.  As early
as 1910, in <i>United States vs. Ambrosio,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court laid down the rule that It will not interfere with the judgment of
the trial court in passing on the credibility of the opposing witnesses, unless
there appears in the record some fact or circumstance of weight and influence,
which has been overlooked or the significance of which has been
misinterpreted.  Our adherence to this
rule has been unswerving and tenacious as evidenced by its application in a
plenitude of cases.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn28" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a>
The reason for this is that the issue of the credibility of witnesses is best
resolved by the trial court since it is in a better position to decide the
question, having heard the witnesses and observed their deportment and manner
of testifying during the trial.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, however, there is more to the exception than
to the rule.  Our own evaluation of the
evidence and the challenged decision points out the failure of the trial court
to consider, appreciate or apply one very significant fact which, if properly
considered, appreciated and applied, could lead it to no other objective and
logical conclusion than that neither Salustiano nor his wife Ailleen could have
identified the accused.  That fact was
the extinguishment of the light of the kerosene lamp, the only source of light
in the house, upon the explosion of the hand grenade.  This was categorically admitted by Ailleen Aquino to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When that big explosion occurred, the light
of your house was put off?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir. "<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn30" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">This was obvious because the lamp was
only about one and one-half (1½) meters from where the hand grenade explosion
took place as testified to by Salustiano:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About how far was that kerosene lamp from
the place where the explosion occured (sic)?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About 1 &amp; ½  meter sir.  (TSN, Jan. 9,
1990, p. 39).”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">It was allegedly the light of the
kerosene lamp which aided Salustiano in seeing and recognizing the
accused.  More specifically, Salustiano
declared:</p>

<blockquote>"Q<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How were you able to recognize Nono Aguilar
when you saw him while you were in the kitchen when it was nighttime?</blockquote>

<blockquote>A<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>-<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Because he is (sic) near to me and the light
coming from the kerosine (sic) lamp was reflecting on him so I was able to
recognize him, sir. (Tsn., p 15, Jan. 9, 1990; Underlinings supplied for
emphasis)."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This testimony is obviously untrue because by then, as
aforestated, the light of the lamp had already been extinguished as a result of
the hand grenade explosion.  This leaves
only Salustiano's "nearness" to the accused as a basis for the
identification.  The former asserts that
he was only a meter away from the latter and it was his wife Ailleen who
whispered to him that the accused was there.  Both assertions only strengthen the conclusion that the so-called
positive identification is, in fact, concocted.  Since Salustiano and Ailleen were together, it was not necessary
for him to learn of the presence of the accused from the whispered information
of Ailleen, unless he was looking toward a different direction.  Proof of the latter is wanting.  If Ailleen had to do it and Salustiano then
"noticed" the presence of the accused, it was precisely because of
the darkness inside the house.  Otherwise, if the light was not extinguished, Salustiano could have
seen, and would have perforce testified that he saw the accused on his own
accord without the prompting of the whisper.  Taken with Our earlier finding that Salustiano's testimony that the
accused pointed a gun at and then shot Marcelino cannot be believed because the
latter sustained only one (1) wound which could only have been caused by the
first gunshot, then <u>reasonable</u> <u>doubt</u> inexorably surrounds the
alleged culpability of the accused in both cases.  In fine, this Court is not satisfied with moral certainty as to
his guilt.  True it is, as correctly
held by the trial court, that his defense of denial and alibi cannot prevail
over his positive identification.  That
rule, however, presupposes that no doubt exists as to the positive
identification of the accused and that, above all, the latter is shown to have
committed the crime beyond reasonable doubt.  Unless the prosecution proves the latter thereby discharging its burden
to negate the presumption of innocence which the Constitution guarantees an
accused, the latter need not even offer evidence in his behalf; he would be
entitled to an acquittal.  As this Court
stated in <i>People vs. Dramayo:</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn33" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Accusation is not, according to the fundamental law,
synonymous with guilt.  It is incumbent
on the prosecution to demonstrate that culpability lies.  Appellants were not even called upon then to
offer evidence on their behalf.  Their
freedom is forfeit only if the requisite quantum of proof necessary for
conviction be in existence.  Their guilt
must be shown beyond reasonable doubt.  To such a standard, this Court has always been committed.  There is need, therefore, for the most
careful scrutiny of the testimony of the state, both oral and documentary,
independently of whatever defense is offered by the accused.  Only if the judge below and the appellate
tribunal could arrive at a conclusion that the crime had been committed
precisely by the person on trial under such an exacting test should the
sentence be one of conviction.  It is
thus required that every circumstance favoring his innocence be duly taken into
account.  The proof against him must
survive the test of reason; the strongest suspicion must not be permitted to
sway judgment.  The conscience must be
satisfied that on the defendant could be laid the responsibility for the
offense charged; that not only did he perpetrate the act but that it amounted
to a crime.  What is required then is
moral certainty."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This reasonable doubt standard has constitutional stature for the
due process clause in the Constitution protects the accused from conviction
except upon proof beyond reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute
the crime with which he is charged.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn34" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a></p>
