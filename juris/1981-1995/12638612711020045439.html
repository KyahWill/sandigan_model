				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This is a petition for review of the Court of Appeals' decision
dated <st1:date year="1975" day="5" month="6">June 5, 1975</st1:date>,
affirming (except the awards for damages and attorney's fees) a summary
judgment for specific performance promulgated by the Court of First Instance of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in </span>favor
of the private respondents.</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 14 and 26, 1969, CMS Stock Brokerage, Inc. (or CMS)
sold to Lopez, <span class="SpellE">Locsin</span>, <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>
&amp; Co., Inc. (or LLL) on the floor of the <span class="SpellE">Makati</span>
Stock Exchange (or MSE) 2,650 shares of <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span>
Consolidated Corporation for P297,650 on a delayed delivery basis of 10 to 20
days, evidenced by Exchange Contracts Nos. B­-11807 and B-11814 both dated <st1:date year="1969" day="14" month="8">August 14, 1969</st1:date> and B-13084 dated <st1:date year="1969" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1969</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>LLL bought the shares for the account of its
clients, the third-party defendants, Rene <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span>,
Jose Maria Lopez, Cesar A. Lopez, Jr. and Alfredo Ramos.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>CMS failed to deliver the shares of stocks
within the agreed period, but LLL did not demand delivery.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="6" month="1">January 6, 1970</st1:date>,
CMS informed LLL that it would deliver the shares the next day.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>LLL wrote CMS that it would not accept the
shares because its principals had cancelled their orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In its reply, CMS insisted that LLL take
delivery of the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> shares.</p>

<p class="BODY">In CMS's Clearing House Report of <st1:date year="1970" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1970</st1:date>, the disposition of the shares in favor of
LLL appeared, but the latter refused to acknowledge receipt of the covering
disposal letter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>CMS then deposited the
letter in the Office of the Exchange Executive Secretary with the notation
"Refused acceptance pending <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">decision
</span>of the Exchange" (p. 7, Record on Appeal).</p>

<p class="BODY">When the controversy was submitted to the Board of Governors of
the Exchange for determination, the Board issued Resolution No. 523 on <st1:date year="1970" day="10" month="8">August 10, 1970</st1:date> advising the parties
to litigate the matter in court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, CMS filed in the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> a complaint to compel LLL to accept the <span class="SpellE">Benguet</span> shares, to pay the price of P297<span class="GramE">,650</span>,
as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">well as P25,000 as attorney's fees
and costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">LLL's</span>
motion to dismiss the complaint was denied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">On </span><st1:date year="1971" day="17" month="6"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">June 17,
 1971</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, LLL filed an
answer alleging that CMS was <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>pari</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>delicto</u></span> for failing </span>to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">deliver the shares within the stipulated
period; that CMS was in <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span> for submitting the
dispute to the Board of Governors of the Exchange; and that LLL did not violate
the contracts nor the rules and regulations of the Exchange.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>LLL filed a counterclaim for P25<span class="GramE">,000</span> as attorney's fees.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1971</st1:date>,
LLL <span class="SpellE">impleaded</span> its four principals:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Alfredo Ramos, Jose Ma. <span class="GramE">Lopez,
Rene <span class="SpellE">Ledesma</span> and Cesar Lopez, Jr. as third-party
defendants.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to
Ramos, LLL alleged that as a result of CMS's failure to deliver the shares
within the agreed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">time frame, Ramos
cancelled his order, <span class="SpellE">disauthorized</span> LLL from accepting
</span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">subsequent delivery by CMS,
and agreed to hold LLL free from any liability for his non­-acceptance of the
shares.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Answering <span class="SpellE">LLL's</span> third-party complaint,
Ramos averred that he was justified in <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> his
order because both CMS and LLL defaulted in delivering the shares to him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He also alleged that the rules and
regulations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of </span>the Exchange did
not apply to him for he is not a member of the Exchange; that as CMS had no
cause of action against LLL, neither did LLL have a cause of action against
him; and that CMS and LLL were <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">in</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt"> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">pari</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

recourse against each other, hence, LLL also has no right of action against <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Finally, Ramos alleged that the shares were ordered by the <span class="SpellE">Alakor</span> Corporation of which he is only the Vice-President
and Treasurer, so he is not personally liable on the transaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
