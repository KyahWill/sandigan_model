				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Appellant seeks the reversal of the decision of the Regional
Trial Court, Branch 115, Pasay City, Metro Manila,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
finding him guilty beyond reasonable doubt of violating Section 15, Article III
of Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, otherwise known as the Dangerous Drugs
Act of 1972, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of life imprisonment and
to pay a fine of P20,000.00, without subsidiary imprisonment in case of
insolvency and the costs.<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In an information dated July 18, 1988, appellant Angeles was
charged with the aforestated violation for having wilfully, unlawfully and
feloniously sold and delivered 0.13 grams of methyl amphetamine hydrochloride,
"shabu" in common parlance, which is a regulated drug.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
At the arraignment, Angeles pleaded not guilty to the charge against him and
trial on the merits thereafter proceeded.</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the trial court reveal that on July 16, 1988, Lt.
Reuben Theodore Sindac of the Narcotics Intelligence Operation Group based in
Camp Crame, Quezon City received an intelligence report from a confidential
informant that a certain Rolando Angeles was engaged in drug pushing in Pasay
City.  A brief surveillance was
conducted to confirm the report, after which a team was formed to conduct the
buy-bust operation.  The team was
composed of said Lt. Sindac, team leader; Sgt. Flordeliz Nocom, as the
poseur-buyer; Sgt. Cesar Dalonos and Sgt. Jaime Sapon, the last two as support
team members.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">At 2:00 P.M. of the same day, the team proceeded to San Juan
Street in Pasay City, the place where the alleged drug pushing was taking
place.  The confidential informant
introduced Sgt. Nocom to appellant Angeles.  After a brief conversation, Sgt. Nocom asked Angeles if she can buy
"shabu" worth P200.00.  Angeles then left for a while and entered a compound.  After ten minutes, he returned and showed
Sgt. Nocom something wrapped in an aluminum foil.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Angeles handed the foil to Sgt. Nocom who examined it.  When she found that the foil contained
crystalline granules, which she reasonably suspected to be "shabu,"
Sgt. Nocom gave the agreed signal by scratching her head; whereupon her
companions, who were deployed in an area not far from where the transaction was
taking place, immediately rushed forward.  They took hold of Angeles, placed him under arrest, and subsequently
brought him to their office at Camp Crame for investigation.<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On July 19, 1988, the arresting officers, Lt. Sindac and Sgts.
Dalonos and Sapon, executed a "Joint Affidavit of Arrest" which was
formally offered in evidence as Exhibit "F"<a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a> while
Sgt. Nocom executed an "Affidavit of Poseur-Buyer" on the same date,
which document was marked and presented as Exhibit "A".<a style="" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The suspected "shabu" was taken to the PC/INP Crime
Laboratory Service for examination and was found positive for methamphetamine
hydrochloride, a regulated drug.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a> The
prosecution submitted Chemistry Report No. D-665-88, dated July 18, 1988,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
confirming said laboratory findings.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the defense, on the other hand, avers that
Angeles was 41 years old, married, an employee, and residing at 124 San Juan
Street, Pasay City.  His version is that
on July 16, 1988, at around 10:00 A.M., he was at home with his child and was
washing the dishes when four NARCOM agents barged into their horse and
handcuffed him.  These NARCOM agents,
who were then in civilian clothes, were looking for a certain person and they
tried to force Angeles to tell them where they can find that person.  When the NARCOM agents failed to extract
information from him, Angeles was forced into a car, driven around the place,
and was later brought to Camp Crame.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">During the investigation in Camp Crame, Angeles was allegedly
mauled by the arresting officers.  The
investigation conducted there was reduced to writing and he signed the same the
document being thereafter marked and admitted as Exhibit "2" for the
defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant's version on the matter of his arrest at their residence was
corroborated by the testimony of his sister who was supposedly there when he
was arrested by the NARCOM agents.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">After trial, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> rendered a judgment of
conviction as aforestated.  In this
appeal, appellant contends that the trial court erred in finding that methyl
amphetamine hydrochloride is a regulated drug, and in considering him guilty of
a violation of Section 15, Article III, Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, on
the basis of the evidence submitted in the instant case.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that the trial court was without jurisdiction
because he was "not charged of a valid offense," since methyl
amphetamine hydrochloride is allegedly not listed as a regulated drug under
Board Regulation No. 6, Series of 1972, issued by the Dangerous Drugs Board on
December 11, 1972.</p>

<p class="BODY">We reject appellants submission and hereby rule that methyl
amphetamine hydrochloride, commonly known as "shabu" or ‘poor man's
cocaine,” is a regulated drug.  This is
evident from the definition thereof in Section 2, paragraph (e)(2), Article I
of the law, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>"(2)  ‘Regulated drug,’ which includes
self-inducing sedatives, such as secobarbital, phenobarbital, pentobarbital,
barbital, amobarbital and any other drug which contains a salt or a derivative
of a salt of barbituric acid; and salt, isomer or salt of an isomer, <u>of</u> <u>amphetamine</u>,
such as benzedrine or dexedrine, or <u>any</u> <u>drug</u> <u>which</u> <u>produces</u>
<u>a</u> <u>physiological</u> <u>action</u> <u>similar</u> <u>to</u> <u>amphetamine</u>;
<u>and</u> <u>hypnotic</u> <u>drugs,</u> <u>such</u> <u>as</u> <u>methaqualone,</u>
<u>netrazepam</u> <u>or</u> <u>any</u> <u>other</u> <u>compound</u> <u>producing</u>
<u>similar</u> <u>physiological</u> <u>effects</u>."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
(Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant is only partly correct in stating that the term methyl
amphetamine hydrochloride has not been specifically mentioned in the law.  It is, however, not only deemed included in
the aforequoted provision because the same is a derivative of the generic drug
known as amphetamines, but is in fact listed in the implementing regulation as
a regulated drug, as hereinbelow explained.  Actually, only the word "hydrochloride" is not mentioned since
it merely denotes that the drug contains a compound of hydrochloric acid used
with the names of organic bases for convenience in naming salts, and to
distinguish it from chloride which is a compound of chlorine with another
element or radical.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The term amphetamine is not to be understood in its limited
ordinary sense.  Obviously, of course,
only those who are fortunate enough to have been exposed to the study of the
preparation, composition, and nature of this drug in the wider fields of
medicine, pharmacology and forensic chemistry have a clear grasp of its effects
and what it consists of.  For this
reason, we feel it worthwhile to briefly expound on the matter, for the
satisfaction of appellant and those who would question the expertise of the
Dangerous Drugs Board.</p>

<p class="BODY">Amphetamines are synthetic amines which act with a pronounced
stimulant effect on the central nervous system.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a> They
are the first and last drugs which cause a subjective feeling of improved mood
- true euphoria, in fact - and it is for this reason that they cause states of
psychic dependence.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">There are about fifty amphetamines or amphetamine-like
preparations available.  They include,
among others, methyl amphetamine (methedrine),<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
under which preparation the drug involved in this case is classified.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, it is not true that methyl amphetamine hydrochloride
is not contemplated by the Dangerous Drugs Board in its aforesaid Drugs Board
Regulation No. 6.  Said regulation,
which lists down the regulated drugs under the law, specifically contains this
item:  "Methyl-amphetamine (e) -
Methamphetamine, A," the classification "A" meaning that it is
an amphetamine, as distinguished from other classifications, such as
barbiturates, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and so forth.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue of jurisdiction, we agree with appellant that where
the information does not charge an offense, such objection may be raised or
considered <u>motu</u> <u>proprio</u> by the court at any stage of the
proceedings or on appeal.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> This
argument invoked by appellant is, however, of no consequence in the case at bar
since, from the foregoing disquisition, the information validly charges an
offense within the jurisdiction of the court below.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the alleged non-consummation of the transaction
between appellant and the poseur-buyer for lack of payment to the former, we
reiterate our ruling in <u>People</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>De</u> <u>la</u> <u>Cruz</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>
that the crime is consummated by the mere delivery of the prohibited drug.  What the law prescribes is not only the act
of selling but also, albeit not limited to, the act of delivering.  In the aforecited case, the act of knowingly
passing a dangerous drug to another, personally or otherwise, and by any means,
with or without consideration, consummates the offense.  This is precisely the reason why the
non-presentation of the marked money used in a buy-bust operation is not fatal
to the case and is not indispensable for the conviction of the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, appellant Angeles is charged with a violation of
Section 15, Article III, Republic Act No. 6425, as amended, which provides:</p>

<blockquote>"SEC. 15.  <u>Sale,
Administration, Dispensation, Delivery, Transportation and Distribution of
Regulated Drugs</u>. - The penalty of life imprisonment to death and a fine
ranging from twenty thousand to thirty thousand pesos shall be imposed upon any
person who, unless authorized by law, shall sell, dispose, deliver, transport
or distribute any regulated drug.  If
the victim is a minor or should a regulated drug involved in any offense under
this section be the proximate cause of the death of a victim thereof, the
maximum penalty herein shall be imposed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Therefore, since the information under which appellant was
charged included the acts of sale or delivery, proof beyond reasonable doubt of
the commission of any of said acts is sufficient for conviction under this
provision of law.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">On the matter of credibility, we are inclined to give more
credence to the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses as against those of
the defense witnesses.  The prosecution
witnesses are law enforcers who performed the buy-bust operation in the
performance of their official duty and pursuant to lawful orders of their
superiors.  As a rule and in the absence
of proof to the contrary, these law enforcers are presumed to have regularly
performed their duty.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> It
is on this premise that once again we accord more belief and credit to the
narration of the incident by these witnesses, as the trial court itself has
done, especially considering its vantage position in gauging the credibility of
the witnesses by personal observation during the trial.</p>

<p class="BODY">Further bolstering the cause of the prosecution, appellant merely
anchored his defense on alibi.  It is
trite but necessary to again stress that, in accordance with existing
jurisprudence, such defense is inherently weak because it can easily be manufactured
and fabricated.<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
For alibi to be given credence, we have interminably reiterated that it must
not only appear that the accused interposing the same was at some other place
but that it was physically impossible for him to be at the scene of the crime
at the time of its commission.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Applying such doctrinal rules in the instant case, it is clear
that appellant failed to meet these requirements of place and time.  He was precisely at the place where the
alleged buy-bust operation took place and at almost the same time as alleged by
the prosecution witnesses.  The
testimony of another defense witness corroborating that of the accused cannot
be given weight as the same is tainted with demonstrable bias and
prejudice.  Moreover, in <u>People</u> <u>vs</u>.
<u>Cabanit</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
we ruled that the defense of alibi is necessarily weak where it is established
mainly by the accused himself and his immediate relatives, and not by impartial
and credible persons.</p>

<p class="BODY">Well entrenched is the rule that the conviction of an accused
person must rest not on the weakness of the defense but on the strength of the
evidence presented by the prosecution.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a> That
rule has been clearly satisfied and duly complied with in the present case, the
prosecution having amply proved the guilt of appellant beyond reasonable
doubt.  The documentary and testimonial
evidence which it has presented engenders moral certainty and constitutes that
degree of proof which produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a></p>
