</span>On the other hand, petitioner on <st1:date year="1985" day="21" month="11">November 21, 1985</st1:date> filed its formal comment to the RIU

computation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner argued
that:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) the salary base for the
computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> refers to the basic salary
only, excluding the ECOLA and 13th month pay; (2) the period for <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">computation </span>of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">should be reckoned with from July 1,
1983 up to November 30, 1984 only, the day its plant burned down </span>resulting
in the temporary lay-off of several employees; (3) the computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> be based on actual working days instead of
calendar-working days, and on the basic daily wages then prevailing at the
time; (4) fifty-five (55) of the union members listed in the RIU report who
were reinstated voluntarily by petitioner within the first six months after the
shut-down were not entitled to the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>;
(5) seventeen (17) union members should be excluded from the RIU report because
they were no longer connected with the company, or were transferred, or were
under indefinite suspension long before the January 3, 1983 shut-down; and, (6)
the computed <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">six </span>(6) other union members should be reduced.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Based on the RIU report,
and the parties’ comments thereto, the Labor Arbiter issued an order dated </span><st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="11">November 27, 1985</st1:date>, directing the
petitioner to pay <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to one hundred twenty

work, and one hundred (115) union members who had been reinstated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Labor Arbiter found merit in the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>'S
request for the inclusion of three (3) union members who were left out <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of</span> the RIU report and for the <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
awarded to two (2) listed members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With
respect to the claims made by petitioner in its comment, the Labor Arbiter <span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">ruled </span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">inter</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <span class="SpellE"><b>alia</b></span></span>
that: (1) the base for computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
should consist of the basic salary and 13th month pay, exclusive of the ECOLA;
(2) the period for computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> should
commence from January 3, 1983 the date of the illegal shut-down; and, (3) the
computation of the basic salary should be computed on a daily basis and on
actual working days in accordance with the rate prevailing at such time.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On this last point, the Labor Arbiter
reasoned that for the period of time the affected union members were deprived
of work due to the illegal shut-down, they should not be awarded more than what
the unaffected employees earned during the same period.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the Labor Arbiter rejected
petitioner’s contention for the exclusion of fifty-five (55) union members from
the list, but granted its request for the exclusion of seventeen (17) other
members, finding merit thereto.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
Labor Arbiter also found basis in petitioner's claim that its plant burned down
in November 30, 1984, and accordingly ruled that for the five (5) union members
who had not yet been recalled by petitioner [<u>See</u> Footnote *], the period
for computation of their <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">backwages</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> should
be limited from January 3, 1983 up to November 30, 1984.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">No timely appeal having been taken from the above <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">order by either party, the Labor Arbiter

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">However, on January 2,
1986, the UNION, through its president Felix <span class="SpellE">Emen</span>,
filed an "Urgent Motion and Manifestation for Clarification and <span class="SpellE">Recomputation</span> of <span class="SpellE">Backwages</span>",

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Thereafter, the Labor
Arbiter issued an order dated April 16, 1986, noting therein that the <span class="SpellE">UNION's</span> motion was filed long after the November 27, 1985

a Sheriff's report dated January 22, 1986).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The Labor Arbiter reiterated as well the basis for the reduction of the
computed award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> contained </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the RIU report, explaining that the report

</span>This time, the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place> claimed that fifty (50)

that the Labor Arbiter's order of <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="11">November

who were forced to resign and the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
less whatever separation benefits were received by them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The <st1:place>UNION</st1:place> also argued
that the inexplicable failure of its original counsel of record to make a

Chief, Research and Information Unit of the National Capital Region, and the amount
of P589,021.00 as eventually arrived at by the Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This computation must necessarily be looked
into and carefully determined in the light of the final decision in this case
considering that any order or writ should not vary the terms of the decision
being executed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, all parties
concerned or involved in the execution of the final decision should be duly
informed or amply notified of all proceedings pertaining to the execution of
aforesaid judgment so that the end of justice may thus be <span class="SpellE">subserved</span>
as in this case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the charge
that the Labor Arbiter omitted the fifty (50) complainants who were forced to
resign after <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="1">3 January 1983</st1:date>
from his final computation of P589<span class="GramE">,201.00</span> merits sound
reexamination in the light of the disquisition embodied in the final decision
of the Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And thirdly, the
manner of the execution of the final decision of the Labor Arbiter, as
implemented in the impugned orders and writ of execution, which may be a

reconsideration, was filed more than 30 days thereafter, or on January 2,

<p class="BODY">Respondents, however, take the position that the case at bar is
an exception to the general rule on the finality of decisions, awards and
orders.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They contend that the Labor
Arbiter's orders dated November 27, 1985 and April 16, 1986, respectively,
varied the tenor of, and failed to substantially conform to that decreed in,
the judgment rendered against petitioner on September 23, 1983.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondents conclude that the NLRC had
appellate jurisdiction to set aside these void orders and to require a
comprehensive review of the union members entitled to reinstatement and <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, and a <span class="SpellE">recomputation</span> of
the amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due them.</p>

<p class="BODY">In support of their position, respondents challenge three
principal features of the Labor Arbiter's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>First of all, respondents charge that the
order failed to direct petitioner to reinstate and pay <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
to fifty (50) union members claimed by petitioner to have resigned </span>and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">executed quitclaims or releases in favor </span>of
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the company.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They argue that the order thereby contravened
the final judgment against the company which ordered the reinstatement of those
union members who were forced to resign.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(This charge, incidentally, was the sole basis of the </span><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">UNION</span></span></st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">'s</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> appeal before the NLRC.) The Solicitor
General further argues that the Labor Arbiter failed to rule </span>on <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">the matter of whether these individuals were
forced, or voluntarily, resigned from their employment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the respondents assail the ruling
of the Labor Arbiter which limited the </span>period <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">for the computation of </span><span class="SpellE">backwages</span> until
November 30, 1984 for five (5) union <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">members
[<u>See</u> Footnote*.] They dispute the veracity of petitioner's claim that
its plant burned down on said date and resulted in the temporary lay-off of
employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thirdly, respondents claim
error in the salary base used by the Labor Arbiter in his computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>. </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:3.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The first and second
points raised by respondents are addressed to the factual findings of the Labor
Arbiter in the proceedings below.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Based
on a review of the records of the execution proceedings before the Labor </span>Arbiter,
the Court finds substantial basis for these findings.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">After the submission of
the <span class="SpellE">UNION's</span> "Urgent Motion and
Manifestation" dated April 28, 1985 containing the list of over two hundred
(200) union members claimed to be </span>entitled to reinstatement and/or <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, and the petitioner's comment thereto claiming,
on the other hand, that fifty (50) of the individuals listed in the <span class="SpellE">UNION's</span> list had resigned and executed quitclaims or
waivers, the Research and Information Unit of the DOLE submitted its own list
of affected union members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>The</u> <u>RIU</u>
<u>list</u> <u>did</u> <u>not</u> <u>contain</u> <u>the</u> <u>names</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>fifty</u> <u>(50)</u> <u>members</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is noteworthy that the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>
raised no objection to the RIU report except for its request that three (3)
other union members be included in the list.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Working initially from the official RIU list of union members, the Labor
Arbiter rendered his order of <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="11">November
 27, 1985</st1:date>, incorporating the points raised by both parties in their
respective comments to the RIU report which he found to be meritorious.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Again, no timely opposition was raised by the
<st1:place>UNION</st1:place> before the Labor Arbiter regarding the exclusion
of the fifty (50) union members from the Labor Arbiter's order.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, in the <span class="SpellE">UNION's</span>
"Urgent Motion and Manifestation for Clarification and <span class="SpellE">Recomputation</span>
of <span class="SpellE">Backwages</span>" belatedly filed by the <span class="SpellE">UNION's</span> president, Felix <span class="SpellE">Emen</span>, on
January 2, 1986, the UNION did not dispute the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">non-inclusion of the fifty (50) union members, but, instead, insisted that
the Labor Arbiter adopt the RIU list.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Neither does it appear
that the UNION was deprived of the opportunity to assert and substantiate
before the Labor Arbiter its claim that the fifty (50) union members had been
forced </span>or <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">coerced to resign and
execute quitclaims in favor of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It simply failed to do so.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">The same could be said
with respect to the fixing of the period of the computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> until </span><st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">November 30, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> for five (5) union members who had not yet
been recalled by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span><st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">November
 30, 1984</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> was
allegedly the date petitioner's plant burned down, </span>resulting in the
temporary lay-off of employees.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It
appears that this particular claim was not disputed by the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>
during the proceedings before the Labor Arbiter or the NLRC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is in its comment filed before the Court
that the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place> attacks for the first time the veracity
of petitioner's claim.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Considering the
foregoing, the Court finds no legal infirmity tainting the Labor Arbiter's
order of </span><st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="11"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">November 27, 1985</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> which excluded the names of the fifty (50)
union members from the list of employees entitled to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and reinstatement, and which limited the period for computing the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due to the five (5) union </span>members.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It bears emphasizing that the execution
proceedings below were undertaken precisely to facilitate the identification of
each union member entitled under the decision, to <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and reinstatement, the computation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of
the exact amount due to these members, </span>and the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">consideration of supervening events which affect the manner and extent
of the execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And inasmuch as the </span><st1:place>UNION</st1:place>
failed to interpose a timely opposition to, or appeal from, the Labor Arbiter's
order, re-examination of the correctness of the Labor Arbiter's findings of
fact is accordingly foreclosed.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">But there is merit in the
third point raised by respondents herein.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The determination of the salary base </span>for the computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> requires simply an application of judicial
precedents defining the term <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">"<span class="SpellE">backwages</span>".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Unfortunately, the Labor Arbiter erred in this regard.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An unqualified award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
means that the employee is paid at the wage rate at the time of his dismissal [</span><st1:city><st1:place><span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Davao</span></span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Free Worker Front v. Court of Industrial

Company v. NLRC, G.R. No. 76746, July 27, 1987, 152 SCRA 328.] And the Court
has declared that the base figure to be used in the computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> due to the employee should include not just the
basic salary, but also the regular allowances that he had been receiving, such
as the emergency living allowances and the 13th month pay mandated </span>under
the law [<u>See</u> Pan-Philippine Life Insurance Corporation v. NLRC, G.R. No.

In his computation of the amount of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, the
Labor Arbiter without legal basis excluded the ECOLA.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is on this score alone that the Labor
Arbiter's order dated <st1:date year="1985" day="27" month="11">November 27,
 1985</st1:date> should be set aside.<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>The Court holds that notwithstanding the
belated appeal by the <st1:place>UNION</st1:place>, the assailed order should
be modified <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">with respect to the
incorrect salary base used by the Labor Arbiter in his computation of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Where
there is a patently improper application and interpretation of the law on the
part of administrative officers who are tasked to perform quasi-judicial
