				<H3>GRANGER ASSOCIATES, PETITIONER, VS. MICROWAVE SYSTEMS, INC., LORETO F. STEWARD, MENARDO R. JIMENEZ AND JOHN PALMER, RESPONDENTS. <br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><STRONG>CRUZ, J.:</STRONG>
				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The Court is once again asked to interpret the phrase "doing
business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>"
as applied to an unlicensed foreign corporation that has filed a complaint
against a domestic corporation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foreign corporation is Granger Associates, the herein petitioner,
which was organized in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
<span style="">and </span>has no license to do business
in this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The domestic
corporation is Microwave Systems, Inc., one of the herein private respondents,
which has been sued for recovery of a sum equivalent to US$900,633.30 allegedly
due from it to the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The claim arose from a series of agreements concluded between the
two parties, principally the contract dated March 28. 1977, under which Granger
licensed MSI to manufacture and sell its products in the Philippines and
extended to the latter certain loans, equipment and parts; the contract dated
May 17, 1979, for the sale by Granger of its Model 7100/7200 Multiplex
Equipment to MSI; and the <span style="">S</span>upplemental
and Amendatory Agreement concluded in December 1979.</p>

<p class="BODY">Payment on these contracts not having been made as agreed
upon.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Granger filed a complaint against
MSI and the other private respondents on <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1984</st1:date>, in the <st1:place><st1:placename>Regional</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename>Trial</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>Court</st1:placetype> <st1:placename>of</st1:placename>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pasay</span></st1:placename> <st1:placetype>City</st1:placetype></st1:place>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was docketed <span style="">as </span>Civil Case No. 1982-P.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In its answer, MSI alleged the affirmative defense that the plaintiff
had no capacity to sue, being an unlicensed foreign corporation, and moved to
dismiss.</p>

<p class="BODY">The law invoked by the defendants was Section 133 of the
Corporation Code reading as follows:</p>

<blockquote>No foreign corporation transacting business in the Philippines
without a license, or its successors or assigns, shall be permitted to maintain
or intervene in any action, suit or proceeding in any court or administrative
agency of the Philippines; <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, after considering the evidence of parties in
light of their respective memoranda, sustained the defendants and granted the
motion to dismiss.<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
<span style="">On </span>appeal, the order of dismissal
was affirmed by <span style="">the respondent court,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> prompting the present petition</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">under
Rule 45 of the Rules of Court.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, Granger seeks the reversal of the respondent
court on the ground that MSI has failed to prove its af<span style="">f</span>irmative allegation that Granger was transacting business <span style="">in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It
insists that it has dealt only with MSI and not the general public and contends
that dealing with the public itself is an indispensable ingredient of
transacting business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It also argues
that its agreements with MSI covered only one isolated transaction for which it
did not have to secure a license to be able to file its complaint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">According to Section 1 of Rep. Act No. 5455 -</p>

<blockquote><span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>the phrase "doing
business" shall include soliciting orders, purchases, service contracts,
opening offices whether called "liaison" offices or branches;
appointing representatives or distributors domiciled in the Philippines or who
in any calendar year stay in the Philippines for a period or periods totaling
one hundred eighty days or more; participating in the management, supervision
or control of any domestic business firm, entity or corporation in the Philippines;
any other act or acts that imply a continuity of commercial dealings or
arrangements and contemplates to that extent the performance of acts or works,
or the exercise of some of these functions normally incident to, and in
progressive prosecution of, commercial gain or of the purpose and object of the
business organization.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This Court interpreted the same phrase in the old case of <span class="SpellE">Mentholatum</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Mangaliman</span><a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>The true test, however, seems to be whether the foreign corporation
is continuing the body or substance of the business or enterprise for which it
was organized or whether it has substantially retired from it and turned it
over to another.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(Traction
Cos. v. Collectors of Int. <span class="SpellE">Revene</span> [C.C.A. Ohio], 223

arrangements, and contemplates, to that extent, the performance of acts or
works or the exercise of some of the functions normally incident to, and in

Co. v. American Standard Metal Products Corp., 158 N.E. 698, 703, 327, 111,

<p class="BODY">We have amplified on that discussion in subsequent cases, among
them Top-Weld Manufacturing, Inc. v. <st1:place><st1:city>ECED</st1:city>, <st1:country-region>S.A.</st1:country-region></st1:place>,<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>
where we said:</p>

<blockquote>There is no general rule or governing principle laid down as to
what constitutes "doing" or "engaging in" or
"transacting" business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Each case must be judged in the light of its
peculiar circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, a foreign
corporation with a settling agent in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
which issued twelve marine policies covering different shipments to the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and a foreign corporation which had been collecting premiums on outstanding
policies were regarded as doing business here.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The acts of these corporations should be distinguished from <span style="">a </span>single or isolated business
transaction or occasional, incidental and casual transactions which do not come
within the meaning of the law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Where a
single act or transaction, however, is not merely incidental or casual but
indicates the foreign corporation's intention to do other business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
said single act or transaction constitutes "doing" or "engaging
in" or "transacting" business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner contends that its various transactions with the
private respondent were mere facets of the basic agreement licensing MSI to
manufacture and sell Granger's products in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All subsequent agreements were merely
auxiliary to that first contract and should not be considered separate
transactions coming within the concept of "doing business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."</p>

<p class="BODY">The Supplemental and Amendatory Agreement concluded by Granger
and MSI in December 1979 enumerates the various agreements between them thus:</p>

<blockquote>1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agreement dated March 28, 1977, under which
MSI acquired from GRANGER the right to manufacture, assemble, test, rent and
sell, or otherwise deal in certain electronic communications equipment designed
and manufactured by GRANGER;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agreement to Purchase Shares dated <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1977</st1:date> under which GRANGER
was granted the option to purchase thirty (30%) percent equity of MSI;</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Amendatory Agreement dated <st1:date year="1978" day="12" month="5">May 12, 1978</st1:date>, adopting certain
amendments to the Agreement dated <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="3">March
 28, 1977</st1:date> for the purpose of complying with the requirements imposed
by the Board of Investments and the Central Bank of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>4.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Exclusive Distributorship and Marketing
Agreement dated <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1978</st1:date>,
appointing MSI to handle sale, distribution and promotion of products of
GRANGER outside of the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</blockquote>

<blockquote>5.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sales Agency Agreement, dated <st1:date year="1978" day="16" month="5">May 16, 1978</st1:date>, under which MSI was
appointed by GRANGER as the latter's exclusive sales representative outside the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region> to
market GRANGER products;</blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Agreement for Purchase of Shares dated May
17, 1978, manifesting the intention of GRANGER to exercise its option to
purchase thirty (30%) percent of the issued and outstanding shares of stock of
MSI equivalent to a total of 9,000 issued shares of MSI;</blockquote>

<blockquote>7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Model 7100/7200 Multiplex Agreement dated <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1979</st1:date>, prescribing the terms
and conditions for the sale by GRANGER of Model 7100/7200 Multiplex Equipment
to MSI;</blockquote>

<blockquote>8.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Technology Transfer Agreement dated May 17,
1979, transferring to and/or providing MSI, by virtue of the Model 7100/7200
Multiplex Agreement, the necessary technical services, assistance, manuals,
catalogues, sales, literature, etc. for the operation of the Model 7100/7200
Multiplex Equipment;</blockquote>

<blockquote>9.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Deed of Assignment of Receivables dated <st1:date year="1979" day="20" month="10">October 20, 1979</st1:date>, under which MSI
assigned to GRANGER a certain percentage of its receivables from the Philippine
Electronics, Inc. in favor of GRANGER to secure payment and performance of <span class="SpellE">MSI's</span> obligations to GRANGER under previous agreements.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the Model 7100/7200 <span class="SpellE">Mutliplex</span>
Equipment Agreement entered into on <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May
 17, 1979</st1:date>, the following stipulations<span style=""> </span>appear:</p>

<blockquote>4. GRANGER shall
assign in favor of MSI all orders for the Model 7100/7200 Multiplex Equipment,
which have not been filled by GRANGER at the date of the ratification of this
Agreement as per paragraph 9 hereof, as<span style=""> </span>described
in a list hereto attached and made a part hereof as Annex "C." All
proceeds under said orders shall be assigned to and received by MSI and MSI
shall take over and assume all obligations which GRANGER may have pursuant to
the orders of equipment within a reasonable time following receipt of the shipment
of the Products by MSI but not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days from
date of said receipt.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any orders GRANGER
may receive following the date on which this Agreement becomes effective as
provided herein <span style="">will </span>be forwarded
to MSI by GRANGER.</blockquote>

<blockquote>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>x<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As an additional consideration for the
purchase of the products, MSI binds itself to render all equipment support
service and maintain reasonable amount of spares inventory for the equipment in
the field previously having been sold by GRANGER or by RCA Corporation to their
customers for a period of ten (10) years from the date the last sale of GRANGER
is recorded.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Any amount earned in
providing such equipment support shall be billed and received by MSI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Additionally, MSI binds itself to assume the
warranty obligations and advance the necessary funds to perform such
obligations associated with Model 7100/7200 Multiplex Equipment already sold by
GRANGER.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, GRANGER shall
reimburse MSI the out-of-pocket cost for the services rendered by MSI in
connection with the warranty for the equipment assumed from GRANGER but only to
the extent authorized in advance by GRANGER.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">A study of the enumeration does support the contention that many
of the agreements concluded by the petitioner and the private respondent were
intended merely to supplement the basic contract dated <st1:date year="1977" day="28" month="3">March 28, 1977</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, this is not true of the Multiplex agreement dated <st1:date year="1979" day="17" month="5">May 17, 1979</st1:date>, which dealt with a
different subject matter and had a different consideration to be paid under a
different method from that specified in the first agreement of the parties in
1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is also noted that <span style="">in </span>the Supplemental and Amendatory
Agreement, Granger sold to MSI certain materials/parts for 80 radios and
granted it the right to exploit the designs of Model 6015, Series of radio
equipment (1.5 <span class="SpellE">Ghz</span>.) and the Plug-In Order Wire, and
the 6002 Series and Power Amplifiers.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The subject matter of this transaction is also different from those
covered by the previous agreements.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if it be assumed for the sake of argument that the subject
matter of the first contract is of the same kind as that of the subsequent
agreements, that fact alone would not necessarily signify that all such
agreements are merely auxiliary to the first.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>As long as it can be shown that the parties entered into a series of
agreements, as in successive sales of the foreign company's regular products, <span style="">that company shall be deemed as doing
business in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The quoted stipulations show that Granger had extended its
personality in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and would receive orders for its products and discharge its warranty
obligations through the agency of MSI.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It would even appear that Granger intended to transact business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
through the instrumentality of MSI, not only for the sale and warranty of its
products in this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">The </span>agency was expected to extend also
in mainland <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and other ASEAN countries, where MSI was to act as its representative in the
development of possible markets for Granger products.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus it was provided in the Agreement:</p>

manufacturer for off-shore manufacture, assembly, fabrication and testing of
equipment, sub-assemblies, printed circuit boards and related or allied
activities, subject to <span class="SpellE">MSI's</span> demonstrated technical
capability and its capacity to comply with normal quality and delivery
requirement for such components and as long as such off-shore manufacturing
would be to <span class="SpellE">GRANGER's</span> economic advantage.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Toward maximizing exploitation of export opportunities for the sale
of MSI manufactured equipment under license from GRANGER, MSI undertakes to do
or perform the following:</blockquote>

<blockquote>a)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MSI, independently or in concert with GRANGER
shall develop a marketing strategy towards Mainland <st1:country-region><st1:place>China</st1:place></st1:country-region>
market at its cost or on the basis of shared expense arrangement with GRANGER,
agreed between both parties in advance, and shall pursue sales opportunities in
that market as it deems warranted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
includes establishing local sales office to manage and monitor direct sales
effort as well as appointments of non-exclusive manufacturer's Sales
Representatives or non-exclusive Distributors as the case <span style="">ma</span>y<span style=""> </span>be;</blockquote>

<blockquote>b)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>MSI, always in close cooperation with
GRANGER, shall develop and pursue direct sales opportunities in the ASEAN

on a case-to-case basis as to the extent of reimbursing GRANGER for its direct
or indirect expenses that it might be incurring while acting as an Exclusive
Distributor or a Manufacturer's Representative for the licensed equipment in
the ASEAN market.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We also note that in the Supplemental and Amendatory Agreemen<span style="">t</span> of December 1979, Granger saw to it
that it <span style="">was </span>assured of at least
one seat in the board of directors of MSI, "without prejudice to the right
of Granger to request additional seats as its interest may require."
Granger actuall<span style="">y</span> purchased 9,000
shares of <span class="GramE">MSI,</span> representing 30% of the latter's issued
and outstanding shares of stock.<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
The fact that it was directly involved in the business of MSI was also
manifested in another stipulation where Granger "acknowledged and
confirmed" the transfer of a block of stocks from one shareholder to
another group of investors.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such
approval is not normally given except by a stockholder <span style="">e</span><span style="">njoying substantial </span><span style="">p</span><span style="">articipation
in the management of the business of the company.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The said stipulations read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>Pursuant to the provision embodied in the said Deed of Sale,
GRANGER hereby acknowledges and confirms this transaction.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner cites the regulations of the Board of Investments

It cannot be denied, <span style="">however, </span>that
the investment of Granger in MSI is quite substantial, enabling it to
participate <span style="">in </span>the actual
management and control of MSI.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact,
it appointed a representative <span style="">in </span>the board of directors to protect its i<span style="">n</span><span style="">t</span><span style="">erests, </span>and this director was so influential
that, at his<span style=""> </span>request, the regular
board meeting <span style="">was </span>converted
into <span style="">an annual stockholder's meeting to
take advantage of his presence.</span><a style="" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">At any rate, the administrative regulation, which is intended
only to supplement the law, cannot prevail against law itself as the Court has
interpreted it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is axiomatic that the
delegate, in exercising the power to promulgate implementing regulations,
cannot contradict the law from which the regulations derive their very <span style="">existence.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The courts, for their part, interpret the administrative regulations in
harmony with the law that authorized them in the first place and avoid as much
as possible any construction that would annul them as an invalid exercise of
legislative power.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of whether the foreign corporation must be shown
to have dealt with the public in general to be considered as transacting
business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the following observations are instructive:</p>

<blockquote>On the other hand, if a corporation performs acts for which it was
created or exercises some of the functions for which it was organized, the
amount or volume of the business is immaterial and a single act of that
character may constitute doing business.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thus, an engineering consulting firm that had entered into a single
contract with a Philippine government agency for the purpose of rendering
services for a period of three years as a technical consultant in engineering
will be required to obtain a license to do business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Similarly, a foreign company invited to bid

<p class="BODY">Finally, this case must be distinguished from <span class="SpellE">Antam</span>
Consolidated, Inc. v. Court of Appeals,<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a>
where this Court declared:</p>

<blockquote>In the case at bar, the transactions entered into by the respondent
with the petitioners are not <span style="">a </span>series of commercial dealings which signify an intent on the
part of the respondent to do business in the Philippines but constitute an
isolated one which does not fall under the category of "doing
business." The records show that the only reason why the respondent’
entered into the second and third transactions with the petitioners was because
it wanted to recover the loss it sustained from the failure of the petitioners
to deliver the crude coconut oil under the first transaction and in order to
give the latter <span style="">a
</span>chance to make good on their obligation.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Instead of making an outright demand on the petitioners, the respondent
opted to try to push through with the transactions to recover the amount of
US$103,600.00 it lost.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This explains why
in the second transaction, the petitioners were supposed to buy back the crude
coconut oil they should have delivered to the respondent in an amount which
will earn the latter <span style="">a </span>profit of US$103,600.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>When this failed the third transaction was entered into by the parties
whereby the petitioners were supposed to sell crude coconut oil to the
respondent at <span style="">a
</span>discounted rate, the total amount of such discount being
US$103,600.00.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the
petitioners failed to deliver again, prompting the respondent to file the suit
below.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>From these facts alone, it can be deduced that in reality, there
was only one agreement between the petitioners and the respondent and that was
the delivery by the former of 500 long tons of crude coconut oil to the latter,
who in turn, must pay the corresponding price for the same.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The three seemingly different transactions
were entered into by the parties only in an effort to fulfill the basic
agreement and in no <span style="">way </span>indicate <span class="GramE">an intent</span> on the part of
the respondent to engage in a continuity of transactions with petitioners which
will categorize it as <span style="">a </span>foreign
corporation doing business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We are convinced from an examination of the terms and conditions
of the contracts and agreements entered into between petitioner and private
respondents indicate that they established within our country <span style="">a </span>continuous
business, and not merely one of <span style="">a </span>temporary character.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such <span style="">agreements
did not constitute only </span><span style="">one </span><span style="">isolated transaction, as the petitioner
contends, but a succession of acts signifying the intent of Granger to</span><span style=""> </span><span style="">extend
its operations in the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="">.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, it is now settled that even one single transaction
may be construed as transacting business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
under certain circumstances, as <span style="">we </span>observed in Far East International Import
and Export Corporation v. <span class="SpellE">Nankai</span> Kogyo Co., Ltd.,<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
thus:</p>

<blockquote>The rule stated in the preceding section that the doing of a single
act does not constitute business within the meaning of statutes prescribing the
conditions to be complied with by foreign corporations must be qualified to
this extent, that <span style="">a </span>sing<span style="">le</span> <span style="">act </span>may bring the corporation within the
purview of the statute where it is an act of the ordinary business of the
corporation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, the single
act or transaction is not merely incidental or casual, but is of such character
<span style="">as </span>distinctly
to indicate a purpose on the part of the foreign corporation to do other
business in the state, and to make the state a base of operations for the
conduct of a part of the corporation's ordinary business.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(17 Fletchers <span class="SpellE">Cyc</span>.
of Corporations, sec. 8470, pp. 572, 573, and authorities cited therein.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner stresses that whoever makes affirmative averments
has the obligation to prove such averments and points out that the private
respondent has not <span style="">established its
allegation that the petitioner is doing </span>business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, it is also the rule that
the factual findings of the lower court are binding on this Court in the
absence of any of those exceptional circumstances we have enumerated in many
cases that warrant a different conclusion.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Having assailed the finding of the respondent court that the petitioner
is doing business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the petitioner had the burden of showing that such finding fell under the
exception rather than the rule and so should be reviewed and reversed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The petitioner has not done this.</p>

<p class="BODY">The purpose of the rule requiring foreign corporations to secure
a license to do business in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is to enable us to exercise jurisdiction over them for the regulation of their
activities in this country.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If a foreign
corporation operates in the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
without submitting to our laws, it is only just that it not be allowed to
invoke them in our courts when it should need them later for its own
protection.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>While foreign investors are
always welcome in this land to collaborate with us for our mutual benefit, they
must be <span style="">p</span><span style="">re</span>pared as an indispensable condition
to respect and be <span style="">b</span><span style="">ound </span>by
Philippine law in proper cases, as in the one at <span style="">bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
