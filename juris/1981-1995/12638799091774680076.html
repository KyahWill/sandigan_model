				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This petition seeks to set aside the decision of the Commission on
Audit which denied the appeal of the petitioner from the Notice of Audit
Disallowance No. FA-001 issued by the Corporate Auditor of the Metropolitan
Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS) in connection with the petitioner's
Contract for Pump Lift Station and Rehabilitation:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> Pump Station
(Contract No. <span class="GramE">PS-1) with the MWSS.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Corporate Auditor ruled that the
petitioner had received a price escalation overpayment in the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,900,605.45</span> and demanded reimbursement from the petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">In March 1981, the MWSS advertised in metropolitan newspapers on
several dates an invitation for the public bidding of the contract known as
"Contract for Pump/Lift Stations and Rehabilitation:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> Pump
Station" or "Contract No. <span class="GramE">PS-1."</span> The
project was partly financed through a loan from the Asian Development Bank.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1981" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1981</st1:date>,
the international competitive bidding for the contract was held.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bidders were A.L. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>,
Erectors, Inc., and petitioner D.M. <span class="SpellE">Consunji</span>,
Inc.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The bids were evaluated in accordance
with the Implementing Rules and Regulations of Presidential Decree No.
1594.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lowest bid was submitted by
A.L. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>After some clarifications on the bid price; however, MWSS found that
A.L. <span class="SpellE">Sarmiento</span> had not complied with the conditions
of the call for bid and was not entitled to the award of the contract.</p>

<p class="BODY">The contract was then awarded to Erectors, Inc., the second
lowest bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contract was
finalized and submitted to the Office of the President for approval.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, while the contract was awaiting
Presidential approval, Erectors, Inc. withdrew <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In a letter dated <st1:date year="1982" day="9" month="8">August
 9, 1982</st1:date>, Oscar I. <span class="SpellE">Ilustre</span>, the then
General Manager of the MWSS offered the contract to the petitioner, to wit:</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1982</st1:date>,
the MWSS Board of Trustees adopted Resolution No. 132-82 awarding the contract
to the petitioner, the pertinent portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"RESOLVED, that the award of a negotiated contract to D.M.
CONSUNJI for the construction of Contract No. PS-1, is hereby approved in the
amount of P71<span class="GramE">,943,000.00</span> only in lieu of P73,945,000.00

days from date of issuance of Notice to Proceed, but without prejudice however
to the application of the bonus provision for early completion, as provided for

or extension during the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the
contract." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 57; Annex "F")</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1982</st1:date>,
MWSS and the petitioner entered into a letter-agreement (Annex "G",
Petition) awarding the contract to the latter.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="14" month="12">December 14, 1982</st1:date>,
the parties executed the Contract for Pump/Lift Stations Rehabilitation:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> Pump Station
(Contract <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">No. </span>PS-1).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the same date the contract was submitted
for Presidential approval.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1983</st1:date>,
after Presidential approval of the contract, the petitioner commenced work on
the project.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1985" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1985</st1:date>,
37 days ahead of <st1:date year="1985" day="2" month="10">October 2, 1985</st1:date>,
the contract expiry date, the petitioner completed the project.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>MWSS fielded its personnel as of <st1:date year="1985" day="7" month="9">September 7, 1985</st1:date> to assist in the
operation of the station, took over the power costs and has since then been
using the said facility.</p>

<p class="BODY">As a result of the early completion of the project, the
petitioner claimed from MWSS an "incentive bonus" pursuant to Article
V (Completion Time:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Liquidated Damages
[Incentive Bonus]) of Contract No. <span class="GramE">PS-1 which was paid by the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">MWSS.</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant to the escalation clause of the contract, the MWSS also
paid the petitioner a price escalation of P24<span class="GramE">,883,439.71</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon review of the payments of the price escalation, however, the
Corporate Auditor of MWSS, State Auditor IV Lucite C. Sanchez, disallowed the
amount of P3<span class="GramE">,900,605.45</span> representing alleged
overpayment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, in her <st1:date year="1988" day="7" month="3">March 7, 1988</st1:date> Notice of Audit
Disallowance No. FA-001 (Annex C, Petition), Sanchez informed Administrator
Luis <span class="SpellE">Sison</span> of the disallowance based on the following
findings:</p>

<blockquote>"As based on the attached computations prepared by the
undersigned, it appeared that the allowable escalation as of August, 1985 for
work accomplished by the contractor is only P20<span class="GramE">,982,834.25</span>
and not P24,883,439.71 which was paid to the contractor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The discrepancy between the price <span class="GramE">escalation</span>
computed is fundamentally in the reckoning date for the Allowable Escalation
Rate.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Reckoning date for price
escalation should be <st1:date year="1982" day="1" month="10">October 1, 1982</st1:date>
as stated in the contract and not May, 1981 which was used in the computation
of price escalation that was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">paid to
the contractor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Letter of the then
General Manager of MWSS to the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt">former
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">President of the Philippines
also shows that the original contract amount of P71,943,000.00 already includes
escalation from the date of bidding to September 30, 1982 and therefore
escalation shall begin at October 1, 1982.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">In view hereof, the
contractor is overpaid by P3<span class="GramE">,900,605.45</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Attached are all the computations prepared by
the undersigned." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 37; Annex
"C")<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">MWSS then advised the petitioner of the Notice of Audit
Disallowance and demanded reimbursement of the P3<span class="GramE">,900,605.45</span>
alleged overpayment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioner, however, in its reply-letter opined that there
was no escalation overpayment on the ground that:</p>

Allowable Escalation Rate (AER) should be reckoned from the month of bidding,
which is May 1981 as provided for in the COA Circular 267 as amended.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The MWSS Corporate Auditor insisted that there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">was </span>overpayment of price
escalation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the MWSS reiterated
its demand upon the petitioner for reimbursement of the amount of P3<span class="GramE">,900,605.45</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1988" day="12" month="10">October 12, 1988</st1:date>,
the petitioner filed an appeal with the Commission on Audit (COA) reiterating

<blockquote>"1<span class="GramE">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The</span> 'AER' should be

<blockquote>2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 'actual price, escalation' itself should
be and was in fact reckoned from October 1982 because the escalation from May
1981 to September 1982 was incorporated in the base contract price.</blockquote>

<blockquote>3.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By using May 1981 as the reckoning date for
the AER, the actual price escalation paid falls within the 30% limit and there
is no need for Presidential approval." (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1989" day="18" month="8">August 18, 1989</st1:date>,

note that the contract price finally agreed upon after negotiation is not the <u>bid</u>
