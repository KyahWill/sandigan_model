Petitioner seeks therein a declaration that respondent University of the

and regulate the cutting and removal of timber and other forest products, to
scale, measure and seal the timber cut and/or to collect forest charges,
reforestation fees and royalties from petitioner and/or impose any other duty

Agreement No. 27-A issued on 1 February 1963, ceded in full ownership to the UP
by Republic Act No. 3990; asks that respondents be enjoined from committing the
acts complained of; and prays that respondents be required to pay petitioner
the sum of P100,000.00 as damages and costs of the suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Its motion to dismiss on the ground of improper venue having been

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: -0.45pt;">Dear Sir:</p>

<p class="2Q">Under Republic Act 3990 approved in June, 1964 a parcel of forest
land approximately 3,500 hectares in area was ceded in full ownership by the
government to the University of the Philippines.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This area is known as <span class="SpellE">Paete</span>
Land Grant, the title to which is presently issued in the name of the
University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The law transferring the ownership to the
University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
gives the University full rights of dominion and ownership, subject to the
existing concession of International Hardwood and Veneer Company of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under the terms of this law all forest
charges due from the concessionaire should now be paid to the University of the
<st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The purpose of giving this land grant to the
University is to enable us to generate income out of the land grant and
establish a research and experimental station for the Colleges of Agriculture,
Forestry, Arts and Sciences and Veterinary Medicine.</p>

<p class="2Q">I would like, therefore, to inform you and to secure your approval
of the following matters:</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All forest charges paid by <span class="SpellE">Interwood</span> to the District Forester of Laguna from June,
1964 up to the present should be remitted in favor of the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>;</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All forest charges presently due from <span class="SpellE">Interwood</span> shall hereafter be paid to the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and lastly</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">3.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Hereafter the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall receive all forest charges and royalties due from any logging concession
at the land grant.</p>

<p class="2Q">May we request that proper instructions be issued by the District
Forester of Laguna about this matter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Thank you.</p>

<p class="2Q">In reply thereto, I have the honor to inform you as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q">In accordance with Section 266 of the Tax Code as amplified by
Section 15(a) of Revenue Regulations No. 85, the Forest Products Regulations,
forest products, cut, gathered and removed from registered private woodlands are
not subject to forest charges, but they must be invoiced when removed to
another municipality or for commercial purposes in the manner prescribed by the
regulations.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As the <span class="SpellE">Paete</span>
Land Grant was ceded by law to the U.P. in full private ownership and as the
grant is manifestly to be considered registered, no forest charges are actually
due and payable on the timber cut and removed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The forest charges purportedly to be paid by
any concessionaire under any licensing agreement entered or to be entered into
by the U.P. are, therefore, to be considered not as the charges contemplated by
the National Internal Revenue Code but as part of the royalties payable by the
concessionaires for the exploitation of the timber resources of the land grant.</p>

<p class="2Q">Accordingly, your queries are answered <span class="SpellE">viz</span>:</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The University may directly collect the
supposed forest charges payable by concessionaires of the land grant.</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -16.2pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The forest charges paid by International
Hardwood and Veneer Company of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may be refunded provided that a formal claim for the refund thereof is made
within two years from the date of payment.<span style="">&nbsp;

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: -0.45pt;">Dear Sir:</p>

<p class="2Q">Enclosed is a copy of a letter to the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue concerning the right of the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to collect forest charges from the existing logging concessionaire at the
Laguna Land Grant (formerly <span class="SpellE">Paete</span> Land Grant).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This tract of forest land containing some
3,500 hectares was ceded to the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
in full ownership by Republic Act No. 3990, approved in June, 1964.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In view thereof, the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
requested that its authority over said land be recognized and that the existing
concessionaire, InternaÂ­tional Hardwood and Veneer Company of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
in turn pay its forest charges directly to the University instead of to the
national government.</p>

<p class="2Q">Please take note of page '2' of the enclosed letter of the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue on the official ruling of the Bureau of
Internal Revenue to the following points raised by the University:</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -15.75pt;">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
may now directly collect forest charges from INTERWOOD, the existing logging
concessionaire.</p>

<p class="3Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -15.75pt;">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That forest charges paid by INTERWOOD to the
Bureau of Forestry from June, 1964 up to April, 1966 shall be refunded to the
University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In this manner, INTERWOOD is requested to
file a claim for the refund in the amount heretofore paid by it to be remitted
to the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="2Q">On the basis of this letter to the Commissioner of Internal
Revenue, it is understood that forest charges on timber cut from the Laguna
Land Grant as scaled by <span class="SpellE">scalers</span> of the University of
the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
shall now be paid directly to the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In another ruling by the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue, the University, particularly the Laguna Land Grant, is
exempted from all kinds of Internal Revenue taxes.</p>

<p class="2Q" style="text-indent: 0.45pt;">Sir:</p>

<p class="2Q">This concerns your inquiry contained in the 3rd paragraph of your
letter dated <st1:date year="1966" day="26" month="4">April 26, 1966</st1:date>,
designated as above, as to whether or not you shall turn over the scaling work

of the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class="2Q">In view of the ruling of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue that
the <span class="SpellE">Paete</span> Land Grant, which embraces the area of the
International Hardwood &amp; Veneer Company of the Philippines, is considered a
registered private woodland of the University of the Philippines and therefore
no forest charges are actually due and payable on the timber cut and removed <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>, and in view further of the ruling of said
Commissioner that the forest charges purportedly to be paid by any
concessionaire under any licensing agreement entered or to be entered into by
the U.P. are to be considered not as the charges contemplated by the National
Internal Revenue Code but as part of the royalties payable by the
concessionaires for the exploitation of the timber resources of the land grant,
you may turn over the scaling work therein to the <span class="SpellE">scalers</span>
of the U.P.</p>

<p class="2Q">However, you should guard against the use of such licensing
agreements entered or to be entered into by the U.P. as a means of smuggling
forest products from the neighboring public forests.</p>

in favor of the petitioner, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion

<blockquote>"x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span><span style=""> </span>the court finds that the respondents' demand on
the petitioner has no legal basis.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
the first place, the cession in full ownership of the tract of land referred to
in the Act was expressly made â€˜subject to any existing concessions.â€™ Inasmuch
as at the time of the enactment of the Act, the petitioner's timber concession
over the tract of land was existing and would continue to exist until February
1, 1985, the University of the Philippines will acquire â€˜full ownershipâ€™ and
exclusive jurisdiction to control and administer the property only after
February 1, 1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The cession of the
property to the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is akin to the donation of a parcel of land, subject to usufruct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">donee</span> acquires
full ownership thereof only upon the termination of the usufruct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the time of the donation, all what the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> acquires is the â€˜nakedâ€™ ownership of the property
donated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the second place, the
respondents' demand cannot be valid unless the provisions of <span class="SpellE">Secs</span>. 262 to 276 of the National Internal Revenue Code
regarding the measuring of timber cut from the forest and the collection of the
prescribed forest charges by the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of
Forestry are first amended.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In their
arguments, the respondents tried to stretch the scope of the provisions of
Republic Act No. 3990 in order to include therein such amendment of the
provisions of the National Internal Revenue Code and Revised Administrative
Code, but they failed to convince the Court, not only because of the first
reason above stated, but also because it clearly appears that such amendment is
not intended in Republic Act No. 3990, which does not contain even a remote
allusion thereto in its title or a general amendatory provision at the end.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the third place, under Republic Act No.
3990, the University of the Philippines cannot legally use the tract of land
ceded to it for purposes other than those therein expressly provided, namely,
â€˜for the use of the University of the Philippines in connection with its
research and extension functions, particularly by the College of Agriculture,
College of Veterinary Medicine and College of Arts and Sciences.â€™ Hence, upon
the expiration of the petitioner's timber concession, the University of the
Philippines cannot even legally renew it or grant timber concession over the
whole tract of land or over portions thereof to other private individuals and
exercise the functions of the Bureau of Internal Revenue and Bureau of Forestry
by scaling and measuring the timber cut within the area and collecting from
them the forest charges prescribed by the National Internal Revenue Code."</blockquote>

<p class="NUM">2. On the second assigned error, respondents assert that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) Under R.A. No. 3990, the Republic of the
Philippines may effect collection of forest charges through the University of
the Philippines because the License Agreement does not expressly provide that
the forest charges shall be paid to the Bureau of Internal Revenue; in the
absence of a specific contractual provision limiting it to a particular agency
in collecting forest charges owing to it, the Republic may effect such
collection through another agency.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(b)
Having been vested with administrative jurisdiction over and being the owner of
the tract of land in question, the UP acquired full control and benefit of the
timber and other resources within the area.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Timber areas within the ceded property but outside the concession of
petitioner can be fully exploited by UP.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>However, in respect to timber areas within the ceded property but
covered by the concession of petitioner, only forest charges (or more
appropriately, royalties) may be enjoyed by UP until the expiration of
petitioner's license.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To deny it such
charges would render its "full ownership" empty and futile.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(c) The UP is clearly entitled to the income
derived from the tract of land ceded to it, for Section 3 of R.A. No. 3990
expressly provides:</p>

<blockquote>"All <u>operations</u> <u>and</u> <u>activities</u> carried on
in the central experiment station shall be exempt from taxation, local or
general, any provision of law to the contrary notwithstanding, and any <u>incidental</u>
receipts or income <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> shall pertain to the
general fund of the University of the Philippines." (underscoring supplied
for emphasis).</blockquote>

<p class="NUM" style="margin-left: 40.5pt; text-indent: -18.9pt;">(d)<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As provided by R.A. No. 3990, the UP is duty
bound to operate and maintain a central experiment station; since this law does
not provide for appropriations for such purpose, it is clearly the legislative
intention that the establishment and maintenance thereof must be financed by
the earnings or income from the area, which can only come from the timber and
the royalties or charges payable <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is in accordance with the general principle
that a grant of authority or jurisdiction extends to all incidents that may
arise in connection with the matter over which jurisdiction is exercised.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(e) Supervision of the License Agreement in
favor of petitioner by UP was intended by R.A. No. 3990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(f) Finally, the two government agencies
affected by R.A. No. 3990 have issued specific rulings recognizing the
authority of UP to collect royalties or charges and to supervise petitioner's
logging operations.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner refutes the foregoing arguments of respondents by
asserting that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) The UP has not been
granted by R.A. No. 3990 the authority to collect forest charges or the
authority to supervise the operation by the petitioner of the timber concession
affected by said Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">The rule is well-settled that legislative grants must be
construed strictly in favor of the public and most strongly against the
grantee, and nothing will be included in the grant except that which is granted
expressly or by clear implication.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Under
Section 262 of the Tax Code, as amended, the duties incident to the measuring
of forest products and the collection of the charges thereon shall be
discharged by the Bureau of Internal Revenue under the regulations of the

R.A. No. 3990 does not expressly, or even impliedly, grant the UP any authority
to collect from the holders of timber concessions on the area ceded to it
forest charges due and payable to the Government under the Tax Code, or to
enforce its provisions relating to charges on forest products or to supervise the
operations of the concessions by the holders thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(b) The cession in full ownership of the land
in question was expressly made "subject to any concession, if any",
and that petitioner's concession would continue until <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="2">1 February 1985</st1:date>; the UP then would acquire full
ownership and exclusive jurisdiction to control and administer the property
only after <st1:date year="1985" day="1" month="2">1 February 1985</st1:date>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The position of UP is akin to that of a <span class="SpellE">donee</span> of a parcel of land subject to usufruct.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(c) The rulings of the Commissioner of
Internal Revenue and the Acting Director of the Bureau of Forestry are patently
incorrect; moreover, said agencies do not have the power to interpret the law,
which is primarily a function of the judiciary.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(d) Finally, it has acquired a vested right to operate the timber
concession under the supervision and control of the Bureau of Forestry.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is merit in the second assigned error.</p>

<p class="BODY">Under Proclamation No. 791, dated 25 September 1961, a parcel of
land of the public domain described therein, with an area of 3,500 hectares,
which is the very parcel of land subject of R.A. No. 3990, was withdrawn from
sale or settlement and was reserved for the College of Agriculture of the UP as
experiment station for the proposed Dairy Research and Training Institute and
for research and production studies of said college, subject however to private
rights, if any, and to the condition that the disposition of timber and other
forest products found thereon shall be subject to forestry laws and
regulations.</p>

<p class="BODY">The above reservation is within the area covered by petitioner's
timber license.</p>

<p class="BODY">Pursuant, however, to R.A. No. 3990 which establishes a central
experiment station for the use of the UP in connection with its research and
extension functions, particularly by the College of Agriculture, College of
Veterinary Medicine and College of Arts and Sciences, the above
"reserved" area was "<u>ceded</u> <u>and</u> <u>transferred</u> <u>in</u>

<u>if</u> <u>any</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">When it <u>ceded</u> <u>and</u> <u>transferred</u> the property
to UP, the Republic of the Philippines completely removed it from the public
domain and, more specifically, in respect to the areas covered by the timber
license of petitioner, removed and segregated it from a public forest; it
divested itself of its rights and title thereto and relinquished and conveyed
the same to the UP; and made the latter the absolute owner thereof, subject
only to the existing concession.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That
the law intended a transfer of the <u>absolute</u> ownership is unequivocally
evidenced by its use of the word "full" to describe it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Full</u> means entire, complete, or
possessing all particulars, or not wanting in any essential quality.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
The proviso regarding existing concessions refers to the timber license of
petitioner.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>All that it means, however,
is that the right of petitioner as a timber licensee must not be affected,
impaired or diminished; it must be respected.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>But, insofar as the Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
is concerned, all its rights as grantor of the license were effectively assigned,
ceded and conveyed to UP as a consequence of the above transfer of <u>full</u>
ownership.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is further borne out by
Section 3 of R.A. No. 3990 which provides, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>,
that "any incidental receipts or income <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>
shall pertain to the general fund of the University of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>."
Having been effectively segregated and removed from the public domain or from a
public forest and, in effect, converted into a registered private woodland, the
authority and jurisdiction of the Bureau of Forestry over it were likewise
terminated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This is obvious from the
fact that the condition in Proclamation No. 971 to the effect that the
disposition of timber shall be subject to forestry laws and regulations is not
reproduced in R.A. No. 3990.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The latter
does not likewise provide that it is subject to the conditions set forth in the
proclamation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>An owner has the right to
enjoy and dispose of a thing without other limitations than those established
by law.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a>
The right to enjoy includes the <u>jus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>utendi</u></span>
or the right to receive from the thing what it produces, and the <u>jus</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>abutendi</u></span>, or the right to consume the thing by its
use.<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
As provided for in Article 441 of the Civil Code, to the owner belongs the
natural fruits, the industrial fruits and the civil fruits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>There are, however, exceptions to this rule,
as where the property is subject to a usufruct, in which case the <span class="SpellE">usufructuary</span> gets the fruits.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In the instant case, that exception is made for the petitioner as licensee or
grantee of the concession, which has been given the license to cut, collect,
and remove timber from the area ceded and transferred to UP until 1 February
1985.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, it has the correlative
duty and obligation to pay the forest charges, or royalties, to the new owner,
the UP, at the same rate as provided for in the Agreement.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The charges should not be paid anymore to the
Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>
through the Bureau of Internal Revenue because of the very nature of the
transfer as <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, even the Bureau of Internal
Revenue automatically lost its authority and jurisdiction to measure the timber
cut from the subject area and to collect forestry charges and other fees due
thereon.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing disposes of the contention of petitioner that R.A.
No. 3990 does not grant the UP the authority to collect forest charges and to
supervise the operations of its concession insofar as the property of the UP
within it is concerned.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Its argument
that it has acquired vested rights to operate its concession under the
supervision and control of the Bureau of Forestry is preposterous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The grantor, Republic of the <st1:country-region><st1:place>Philippines</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
was by no means bound under the License to perpetuate the Bureau as its
agent.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Neither is there force to its
contention that legislative grants must be construed strictly in favor of the
public and most strongly against the grantee.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The grant under R.A. No. 3990 is transfer of absolute, full and entire
ownership which leaves no room for a strict interpretation against the grantee,
the UP.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The reservation therein made is
in favor of the private party pursuant to the license, which is nevertheless
protected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is the concession in favor
of the petitioner which should, on the contrary, be bound by the rule.</p>

<p class="BODY">It follows then that respondent UP is entitled to supervise, through
its duly appointed personnel, the logging, felling, and removal of timber
within the area covered by R.A. No. 3990.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>IN THE LIGHT OF ALL THE FOREGOING</b>, judgment is hereby
rendered REVERSING the decision of the trial court in Civil Case No. C-650,
rendered on 3 June 1968; DECLARING that forest charges due from and payable by
petitioner for timber cut pursuant to its License Agreement No. 27-A
(Amendment) within the area ceded and transferred to the University of the
Philippines pursuant to R.A. No. 3990 shall be paid to the University of the
Philippines; DECLARING that the University of the Philippines is entitled to
supervise, through its duly appointed personnel, the logging, felling, and
removal of timber within the aforesaid area covered by R.A. No. 3990.</p>
