				<BR><BR><div align="justify">The charge in this case was piracy in violation of P.D. 532.&nbsp; The sentence imposed, on the basis of guilty pleas, was death.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> The issue is whether or not the guilty pleas were valid and had been validly accepted.<br><br>According to the information, Eduardo Bandojo and Mamerto Artuz, in conspiracy with each other, while on board a pumpboat on the seawaters of Bantayan, Cebu, on June 15, 1983, fatally shot Consolacion Alfar and then took her money in the sum of P5,000.00.&nbsp; Thereafter, they threw the dead body into the sea and forced the other passengers to jump overboard (although they were fortunately saved by another pumpboat).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br>The accused-appellants admitted the above charge in extra-judicial confessions taken from them without observance of their rights under Article IV, Section 20, of the Constitution on June 17, 1983.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> We flatly and at the outset reject these documents.&nbsp; Later, however, at their formal arraignment, they entered separate pleas of guilty.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>The trial judge, upon the pleas being made, did not immediately impose sentence.&nbsp; On the contrary, he asked both of the accused many searching questions to satisfy himself that they understood the nature and consequences of their confessions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> Not content with his first examination on February 3, 1984, he questioned them again at still another hearing on February 10, 1984.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> Only after he had assured himself that the accused-appellants knew what they were doing did he finally pronounce his judgment of death.<br><br>The defense now asks us to annul that judgment.&nbsp; It is claimed that the trial judge should have received independent testimony to determine the liability of the accused-appellants, considering that, first, they were charged with a capital offense, and, second, their testi­mony belied and in effect nullified their pleas of guilty.<br><br>We note that, on questioning by the trial court, Bandojo denied the allegation of conspiracy between him and Artuz and put the blame on the latter for killing the victim.&nbsp; He said he could not control Artuz.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> He claimed he was only a companion of Artuz and that it was Artuz who did the killing and stole the money.&nbsp; He explained that he entered the plea of guilty "so that the case will not be dragged."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup><br><br>For his part, Artuz, while affirming his plea of guilty, maintained that he was forced by Bandojo to go with him "because he had a long weapon" and "I cannot do anything."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> Inconsistently, he said the gun he was holding exploded because it was windy<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup> and then again that it was pointed at the victim and it exploded upon his (Bandojo's) order.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> He affirmed he would not have killed her "if it was not for his order."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> He also said the money was received by Bandojo.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup><br><br>Recalled to the stand after he had asked for a recesss because he was nervous, Bandojo denied having ordered Artuz to shoot the victim and said the latter had fired because he was "rattled."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> He also said his purpose in going to Bantayan was merely to sell the firearm he was carrying.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup><br><br>In <i>People v. Balisacan,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> this Court, after observing that "the accused had first entered a plea of guilty" but later "testified, in the course of being allowed to prove mitigating circumstances, that he acted in complete self-defense,” declared through Justice Bengzon:<br><blockquote>"Said testimony therefore - as the court a quo recognized in its decision - had the effect of vacating his plea of guilty and the court <i>a quo</i> should have required him to plead anew on the charge or at least direct that a new plea of not guilty be entered for him."<br></blockquote>It is also settled that -<br><blockquote>"Where a plea of guilty is entered by the defendant, in cases where the capital penalty may be imposed, the court should make 'certain that defendant fully understands the nature of the charge preferred against him and the character of the punishment provided by law before it is imposed.&nbsp; The trial court should therefore call witnesses for the purposes of establishing the guilt and degree of culpability of the defendant, not only to satisfy the trial judge, but also to aid the Supreme Court in determining whether the accused really and truly understood and comprehended the meaning, full significance and consequences of his plea."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup><br></blockquote>Conformably to the above doctrines, we should remand this case to the lower court and direct it to conduct a regular trial at which more evidence should be received, both from the prosecution and the defense, to determine the nature and extent of the involvement, if any, of the accused-appellants in the offense charged.&nbsp; That is the rule.<br><br>We shall deviate from this rule, however, because the guilt of the herein accused-appellants has not only been acknowledged by them but also adequately verified by the trial judge.&nbsp; Indeed, his painstaking efforts in this regard are evident in the records of this case and demonstrate his anxiety to insure against a precipitate conviction.&nbsp; It is manifest that he tried his best not only to get to the truth of what actually happened but also to see to it that the defendants understood what they were facing by their pleas of guilty.<br><br>The exception to the rule was recently applied by this Court in <i>People v. Samiano,</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> where it was reit­erated that:<br><blockquote>"It is not always de rigueur or mandatory upon the trial court to receive evidence when a plea of guilty is entered in capital cases.&nbsp; The court has discretion to dispense with the reception of evidence (<i>People v. Duaban,</i> L-31912, August 24, 1979, 92 SCRA 743)."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup><br></blockquote>Probing without badgering, the trial judge was as thorough as he was considerate, even giving defendant Bandojo a chance to relax before resuming his testimony.&nbsp; With the other accused, the younger Artuz, who was only 25 years old at that time, he was also fair but search­ing.&nbsp; And not only that.&nbsp; What is especially noteworthy is that after interrogating them at the time of their arraignment, he questioned them again at another hearing he found it necessary to schedule, to be doubly sure that the accused-appellants understood the consequences of their confessions.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup><br><br>It is significant that although the accused-appellants disagreed on the details of the offense and in fact blamed each other therefor, both of them insisted on pleading guilty.&nbsp; They were consistent in this stance while at the same time trying to minimize their responsibility.&nbsp; Obviously, they had been advised that such a plea would mitigate their penalty, and perhaps they were also hoping it was possible to avoid it altogether.&nbsp; We are satisfied, though, that the trial judge made it clear to them that they could not eat their cake and have it too.<br><br>Their denials would normally have invalidated their guilty pleas under the Balisacan rule, but this would not apply here because both of them later retracted these denials.&nbsp; Thus, on the allegation of conspiracy, Bandojo had the following to say at the second hearing:<br><br><table  ="" width="75%" align="center" border="0"> <tbody><tr valign="top"> <td width="10%"><div align="justify">Q </div></td> <td width="90%"><div align="justify">Then on page 7 of the transcript of stenographic notes, you were asked by the court whether you and your co-accused Mamerto Artuz had a plan to commit that crime of Piracy and you said, "We did not plan it, Your Honor, it happened so suddenly."
