				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">The issues, <u>albeit</u> not completely novel, are:  <span style="">(a) </span>whether
or not a claim for damage sustained on a shipment of goods can be a solidary,
or joint and several, liability of the common carrier, the arrastre operator
and the customs broker; (b) whether the payment of legal interest on an award
for loss or damage is to be computed from the time the complaint is filed or
from the date the decision appealed from is rendered; and (c) whether the
applicable rate of interest, referred to above, is twelve percent (12%) or six
percent (6%).</p>

<p class="BODY">The findings of the court <u>a quo</u>, adopted by the Court of
Appeals, on the antecedent <span style="">and </span>undisputed
facts that have led to the controversy are hereunder reproduced:</p>

<blockquote>“This is an action against defendants shipping company, arrastre
operator and broker-forwarder for damages sustained by a shipment while in
defendants’ custody, filed by the insurer-subrogee who paid the consignee the
value of such losses/damages.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On December 4, 1981, two fiber drums of riboflavin were shipped
from Yokohama, Japan<i><span style=""> </span></i>for
delivery vessel ‘SS EASTERN COMET’ owned by defendant Eastern Shipping Lines
under Bill of Lading No. YMA-8 (Exh. B).  The shipment was insured under plaintiff’s Marine Insurance Policy No.
81/01177 for P36,382,466.38.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Upon arrival of the shipment in Manila on December 12, 1981, it
was discharged unto the custody of defendant Metro Port Service, Inc.  The latter excepted to one drum, said to be
in bad order, which damage was unknown to plaintiff.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On January 7, 1982 defendant Allied Brokerage Corporation received
the shipment from defendant Metro Port Service, Inc., one drum opened and
without seal (per ‘Request for Bad Order Survey.’ (Exh. D).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“On January 8 and 14, 1982, defendant Allied Brokerage Corporation
made deliveries of the shipment to the consignee’s warehouse.  The latter excepted to one drum which
contained spillages, while the rest of the contents was adulterated/fake (per
‘Bad Order Waybill’ No. 10649, Exh. E).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“Plaintiff contended that due to the losses/damage sustained by
said drum, the consignee suffered losses totaling P19,032.95, due to the fault
and negligence of defendants.  Claims
were presented <span style="">against<i> </i></span>defendants
who failed and refused to pay the same (Exhs. H, I, J, K, L).</blockquote>

<blockquote>“As a consequence of the losses sustained, plaintiff was compelled
to pay the consignee P19,032.95 under the aforestated marine insurance policy,
so that it became subrogated to all the rights of action of said consignee
against defendants (per ‘Form of Subrogation,’ ‘Release’ and Philbanking check,
Exhs. M, N, and O).” (pp. 85-86, Rollo.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">There were, to be sure, other factual issues that confronted both
courts.  Here, the appellate court said:</p>

<blockquote>“Defendants filed their respective answers, traversing the material
allegations of the complaint contending that:  As for defendant Eastern Shipping it alleged that the shipment was
discharged in good order from the vessel unto the custody of Metro Port Service
so that any damage/losses incurred after the shipment was incurred after the
shipment was turned over to the latter, is no longer its liability (p. 17,
Record); Metroport averred that although subject shipment was discharged unto
its custody, portion of the same was already in bad order (p. 11, Record);
Allied Brokerage alleged that plaintiff has no cause of action against it, not
having negligent or at fault for the shipment was already in damage and bad
order condition when received by it, but nonetheless, it still exercised extra
ordinary care and diligence in the handling/delivery of the cargo to consignee
in the same condition shipment was received by it.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“From the evidence the court found the following:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“‘The issues are:</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">‘1.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the shipment sustained
losses/damages;</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">‘2.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not these losses/damages were
sustained while in the custody of defendants (in whose respective custody, if
determinable);</p>

<p class="2Q" style="margin-left: 81pt; text-indent: -0.25in;">‘3.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not defendant(s) should be held
liable for the losses/damages (see plaintiff’s pre-Trial Brief, Records, p. 34;
Allied’s pre-Trial Brief, adopting plaintiff’s Records, p. 38).’</p>

<p class="2Q">‘As to the first issue, there can be no doubt that the shipment sustained
losses/damages.  The two drums were
shipped in good order and condition, as clearly shown by the Bill of Lading and
Commercial Invoice which do not indicate any damages drum that was shipped
(Exhs. B and C).  But when on December
12, 1981 the shipment was delivered to defendant Metro Port Service, Inc., it
excepted to one drum in bad order.</p>

<p class="2Q">‘Correspondingly, <u>as to the second issue</u>, it follows that
the losses/damages were sustained while in the respective and/or successive
custody and possession of defendants carrier (Eastern), arrastre operator
(Metro Port) and broker (Allied Brokerage).  This becomes evident when the Marine Cargo Survey Report (Exh. G), with
its ‘Additional Survey Notes,’ are considered.  In the latter notes, it is stated that when the shipment was ‘landed on
vessel’ to dock of Pier # 15, South Harbor, Manila on December 12, 1981,’ it
was observed that ‘<u>one (1) fiber drum (was) in damaged condition, covered by
the vessel’s Agent’s Bad Order Tally Sheet No. 86427</u>.’ The report further
states that when defendant Allied Brokerage withdrew the shipment from
defendant arrastre operator’s custody on January 7, 1982, one drum was found
opened without seal, cello bag partly torn but contents intact.  Net unrecovered spillages was 15 kgs.  The report went on to state that when the
drums reached the consignee, one drum was found with adulterated/faked
contents.  It is obvious, therefore,
that these losses/damages occurred before the shipment reached the consignee
while under the successive custodies of defendants.  Under Art. 1737 of the New Civil Code, the common carrier’s duty
to observe extraordinary diligence in the vigilance of goods remains in full
force and effect even if the goods are temporarily unloaded and stored in
transit in the warehouse of the carrier at the place of destination, until the
consignee has been advised and has had reasonable opportunity to remove or
dispose of the goods (Art. 1738, NCC).  Defendant Eastern Shipping’s own exhibit, the ‘Turn-Over Survey of Bad
Order Cargoes’ (Exhs. 3-Eastern) states that on December 12, 1981 one drum was
found ‘open.’</p>

<p class="BODY">In this petition, Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc., the common
carrier, attributes error and grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
appellate court when -</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>IT HELD PETITIONER CARRIER JOINTLY AND

COMPLAINT AT THE RATE OF TWELVE PERCENT PER ANNUM INSTEAD OF FROM THE DATE OF
THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT AND ONLY AT THE RATE OF SIX PERCENT PER ANNUM,
PRIVATE RESPONDENT’S CLAIM BEING INDISPUTABLY UNLIQUIDATED.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The petition is, in part, granted.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this decision, we have begun by saying that the questions
raised by petitioner carrier are not all that novel.  Indeed, we do have a fairly good number of previous decisions
this Court can merely tack to.</p>

<p class="BODY">The common carrier’s duty to observe the requisite diligence in
the shipment of goods lasts from the time the articles are surrendered to or
unconditionally placed in the possession of, and received by, the carrier for
transportation until delivered to, or until the lapse of a reasonable time for
their acceptance by, the person entitled to receive them (Arts. 1736-1738,
Civil Code; Ganzon vs. Court of Appeals, 161 SCRA 646; Kui Bai vs. Dollar
Steamship Lines, 52 Phil. 863).  When
the goods shipped either are lost or arrive in damaged condition, a presumption
arises against the carrier of its failure to observe that diligence, and there
need not be an express finding of negligence to hold it liable (Art. 1735,
Civil Code; Philippine National Railways vs. Court of Appeals, 139 SCRA 87;
Metro Port Service vs. Court of Appeals, 131 SCRA 365).  There are, of course, exceptional cases when
such presumption of fault is not observed but these cases, enumerated in
Article 1734<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
of the Civil Code, are exclusive, not one of which can be applied to this case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of charging both the carrier and the arrastre
operator with the obligation of properly delivering the goods to the consignee
has, too, been passed upon by the Court.  In Fireman’s Fund Insurance vs. Metro Port Services (182 SCRA 455), we
have explained, in holding the carrier and the arrastre operator liable in <u>solidum</u>,
thus:</p>

<blockquote>“The legal relationship between the consignee and the arrastre
operator is akin to that of a depositor and warehouseman (Lua Kian v. Manila
Railroad Co., 19 SCRA 5 [1967].  The
relationship between the consignee and the common carrier is similar to that of
the consignee and the arrastre operator (Northern Motors, Inc. v. Prince Line,
et al., 107 Phil 253 [1960]).  Since it
is the duty of the ARRASTRE to take good care of the goods that are in its
custody and to deliver them in good condition to the consignee, such
responsibility also devolves upon the CARRIER.  Both the ARRASTRE and the CARRIER are therefore charged with the
obligation to deliver the goods in good condition to the consignee.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">We do not, of course, imply by the above pronouncement that the
arrastre operator and the customs broker are themselves always and necessarily
liable solidarily with the carrier, or <u>vice-versa</u>, nor that attendant
facts in a given case may not vary the rule.  The instant petition has been brought solely by Eastern Shipping Lines
which, being the carrier and not having been able to rebut the presumption of
fault, is, in any event, to be held liable in this particular case.  A factual finding of both the court <u><span style="">a</span></u><span style=""> <u>q</u></span><u>uo</u> and the appellate court, we take note, is
that “there is sufficient evidence that the shipment sustained damage while in
the successive possession of appellants” (the herein petitioner among
them).  Accordingly, the liability
imposed on Eastern Shipping Lines, Inc., the sole petitioner in this case, is
inevitable regardless of whether there are others solidarily liable with it.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is over the issue of legal interest adjudged by the appellate
court that deserves more than just a passing remark.</p>

<p class="BODY">Let us first see a chronological recitation of the major rulings
of this Court:</p>

<p class="BODY">The early case of <b>Malayan Insurance Co., Inc., vs. Manila Port
Service</b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>

on 15 May 1969, involved a suit for <u>recovery</u> <u>of</u> <u>money</u> <u>arising</u>
<u>out</u> <u>of</u> <u>short</u><span style=""> <u>deliveries</u>
</span><u><span style="">and</span></u><span style=""> </span><u><span style="">p</span>ilferage</u> <u>o</u><u><span style="">f</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>g</u><u><span style="">oods</span></u><span style="">.  In</span> this case, appellee Malayan
Insurance (the plaintiff in the lower court) averred in its complaint that the
total amount of its claim for the value of the undelivered goods amounted to
P3,947.20.  This demand, however, was
neither established in its totality nor definitely ascertained.  In the stipulation of facts later entered
into by the parties, in lieu of proof, the amount of P1,447.51 was agreed
upon.  The trial court rendered judgment
ordering the appellants (defendants) Manila Port Service and Manila Railroad
Company to pay appellee Malayan Insurance the sum of P1,447.51 with <u>legal</u>
<u>interest</u> <u>thereon</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>date</u> <u>the</u> <u>complaint</u>
<u>was</u> <u>filed</u> <u>on</u> <u>28</u> <u>December</u> <u>1962</u> <u>until</u>
<u>full</u> <u>payment</u> <u>thereof</u>.  The appellants then assailed, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, the award of
legal interest.  In sustaining the
appellants, this Court ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“Interest upon an obligation which calls for the payment of money,
absent a stipulation, is the legal rate.  Such interest normally is allowable from the date of demand, judicial or
extrajudicial.  The trial court opted
for judicial demand as the starting point.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“But then upon the provisions of Article 2213 of the Civil Code,
interest ‘cannot be recovered upon unliquidated claims or damages, except when
the demand can be established with reasonable certainty.’ And as was held by
this Court in Rivera vs. Perez<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a>,
L-6998, February 29, 1956, <u>if the suit were for damages, ‘unliquidated and
not known until definitely ascertained, assessed and determined by the courts
after proof (Montilla c. Corporacion de P. P. Agustinos, 25 Phil. 447; Lichauco
v. Guzman, 38 Phil.  302),’ then,
interest ‘should be from the date of the decision</u>.’” (Underscoring

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, the

adjudging <u>legal</u> <u>interest</u> <u>from</u> <u>the</u> <u>filing</u> <u>of</u>
<u>the</u> <u>complaint</u> <u>until</u> <u>fully</u> <u>paid</u>.  When the appellate court’s decision became
final, the case was remanded to the lower court for execution, and this was
when the trial court issued its assailed resolution which applied the 6%
interest per annum prescribed in Article 2209 of the Civil Code.  In their petition for review on <i><u>certiorari</u></i>,
the petitioners contended that Central Bank Circular No. 416, providing thus -</p>

<blockquote>“By virtue of the authority granted to it under Section 1 of Act
2655, as amended, Monetary Board in its Resolution No. 1622 dated July 29,
1974, has prescribed that the rate of interest for the loan, or forbearance of
any money, goods, or credits and the rate allowed in judgments, in the absence
of express contract as to such rate of interest, shall be twelve (12%) percent
per annum.  This Circular shall take
effect immediately.” (Italics found in the text) -</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">should have, instead, been applied.  This Court<a style="" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
ruled:</p>

<blockquote>“The judgments spoken of and referred to are judgments in
litigations involving loans or forbearance of any money, goods or credits.  Any other kind of monetary judgment which
has nothing to do with, nor involving loans or forbearance of any money, goods
or credits does not fall within the coverage of the said law for it is not
within the ambit of the authority granted to the Central Bank.</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Art. 2209. - If the obligation consists in the payment of a sum of

promulgated on 28 July 1986.  The case
was for damages occasioned by an injury to person and loss of property.  The trial court awarded private respondent
Pedro Manabat actual and compensatory damages in the amount of P72,500.00 with <u>legal

the trial court, in an action for the recovery of damages arising from the
collapse of a building, ordered, <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u>, the “defendant
United Construction Co., Inc. (one of the petitioners) x x x to pay the plaintiff,
x x x, the sum of P989,335.68 with <u>interest at the legal rate from November

amount granted by the lower court, the Court of Appeals sustained the trial
court’s decision.  When taken to this
Court for review, the case, on 03 October 1986, was decided, thus:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, the decision appealed from is hereby MODIFIED and
considering the special and environmental circumstances of this case, we deem

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">A motion for reconsideration was filed by
United Construction, contending that “the interest of twelve (12%) per cent per

law.” The Court<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
ruled out the applicability of the Reformina and Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines
cases and, in its resolution of 15 April 1988, it explained:</p>

<blockquote>“There should be no dispute that the imposition of 12% interest
pursuant to Central Bank Circular No. 416 x x x is applicable only in the

<p class="BODY">The subsequent case of <b><span style="">American

1985, of the then Intermediate Appellate Court reducing the amount of moral and
exemplary damages awarded by the trial court, to P240,000.00 and P100,000.00,
respectively, and its resolution, dated 29 April 1985, restoring the amount of
damages awarded by the trial court, i.e., P2,000,000.00 as moral damages and
P400,000.00 as exemplary damages with <u>interest thereon at 12% per annum from
notice of judgment</u>, plus costs of suit.  In a decision of 09 November 1988, this Court, while recognizing the
right of the private respondent to recover damages, held the award, however,
for moral damages by the trial court, later sustained by the IAC, to be
inconceivably large.  The Court<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> thus set aside the decision of the appellate
court and rendered a new one, “ordering the petitioner to pay private
respondent the sum of One Hundred Thousand (P100,000.00) Pesos as moral
damages, with <u>six (6%) percent interest thereon computed from the finality
of this decision until paid</u>.” (Underscoring supplied)</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Reformina came into fore again in the 21 February 1989 case of
Florendo v. Ruiz<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a><b>
</b>which arose from a breach of employment contract.  For having been illegally dismissed, the petitioner was awarded
by the trial court moral and exemplary damages without, however, providing any
legal interest thereon.  When the
decision was appealed to the Court of Appeals, the latter held:</p>

<blockquote>“WHEREFORE, except as modified hereinabove the decision of the CFI
of Negros Oriental dated October 31, 1972 is affirmed in all respects, with the
modification that defendants-appellants, except defendant-appellant Merton
Munn, are ordered to pay, jointly and severally, the amounts stated in the
dispositive portion of the decision, including the sum of P1,400.00 in concept
of compensatory damages, <u><span style="">with
interest at </span>the </u><u><span style="">legal
rate from the date of </span>the filing of the </u><u><span style="">complaint </span>until fully paid</u>.” (Underscoring supplied.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The petition for review to this Court was
denied.  The records were thereupon
transmitted to the trial court, and <span style="">an </span>entry
of judgment was made.  The writ of
execution issued by the trial court directed that only compensatory damages
should earn interest at 6% per annum from the date of the filing of the
complaint.  Ascribing grave abuse of
discretion on the part of the trial judge, a petition for <i><u>certiorari</u></i>
assailed the said order.  This Court
said:<b><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></b></p>

<blockquote>“x x x, it is to be noted that the Court of Appeals ordered the
payment of interest ‘at the legal rate’ <u>from the time of the </u><u><span style="">filing </span>of the complaint</u>.  x <span style="">x </span>x.  Said circular [Central Bank Circular No.
416] does not apply to actions based on a breach of employment contract like
the case at bar.” (Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">The Court reiterated that the 6% interest
per annum on the damages should be computed from the time the complaint was
filed until the amount is fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">Quite recently, the Court had another occasion to rule on the
matter. <b>  National Power Corporation
vs. Angas</b>,<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
decided on 08 May 1992, involved the expropriation of certain parcels of
land.  After conducting a hearing on the
complaints for <u><span style="">eminent</span></u><span style=""> <u>domain</u>, </span>the trial court
ordered the petitioner to pay the private respondents certain sums of money as just
compensation for their lands so expropriated “<u>with legal interest thereon x
x x until fully paid</u>.” Again, in applying the 6% legal interest per annum
under the Civil Code, the Court<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a>
declared:</p>

<blockquote>“x x x, (T)he transaction involved is clearly not a loan or
forbearance of money, goods or credits but expropriation of certain parcels of
land for a public purpose, the payment of which is without stipulation
regarding interest, and the interest adjudged by the trial court is in the
nature of indemnity for damages.  The
legal interest required to be paid on the amount of just compensation for the
properties expropriated is manifestly in the form of indemnity for damages for
the delay in the payment thereof.  Therefore, since the kind of interest involved in the joint judgment of
the lower court sought to be enforced in this case is interest by way of
damages, and not by way of earnings from loans, etc.  Art. 2209 of the Civil Code shall apply.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Concededly, there have been seeming variances in the above
holdings.  The cases can perhaps be
classified into two groups according to the similarity of the issues involved
and the corresponding rulings rendered by the court.  The “first group” would consist of the cases of Reformina v.
Tomol (1985), Philippine Rabbit Bus Lines v. Cruz (1986), Florendo v. Ruiz
(1989) and National Power Corporation v. Angas (1992).  In the “second group” would be Malayan
Insurance Company v. Manila Port Service (1969), Nakpil and Sons v. Court of
Appeals (1988), and American Express International v. Intermediate Appellate
Court (1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the “first group,” the basic issue focuses on the application
of either the 6% (under the Civil Code) or 12% (under the Central Bank
Circular) interest per annum.  It is
easily discernible in these cases that there has been a consistent holding that
the Central Bank Circular imposing the 12% interest per annum applies only to
loans or forbearance<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a> of
money, goods or credits, as well as to judgments involving such loan or
forbearance of money, goods or credits, and that the 6% interest under the
Civil Code governs when the transaction involves the payment of indemnities in
the concept of damage arising from the breach or a delay in the performance of
obligations in general.  Observe, too,
that in these cases, a common time frame in the computation of the 6% interest
per annum has been applied, i.e., from the time the complaint is filed until
the adjudged amount is fully paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The “second group,” did not alter the pronounced rule on the
application of the 6% or 12% interest per annum,<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
depending on whether or not the amount involved is a loan or forbearance, on
the one hand, or one of indemnity for damage, on the other hand.  Unlike, however, the “first group” which
remained consistent in holding that the running of the legal interest should be
from the time of the filing of the complaint until fully paid, the “second
group” varied on the commencement of the running of the legal interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">Malayan held that the amount awarded should <u>bear legal
interest from the date of the decision of the court a quo</u>, explaining that
“if the suit were for damages, ‘unliquidated and not known until definitely
ascertained, assessed and determined by the courts after proof,’ then, interest
‘should be from the date of the decision.’” American Express International v.
IAC, introduced a different time frame for reckoning the 6% interest by
ordering it to be “<u>computed from the finality of (the) decision until paid</u>.”
The Nakpil and Sons case ruled that 12% interest per annum should be imposed
from the finality of the decision until the judgment amount is paid.</p>

<p class="BODY">The ostensible discord is not difficult to explain.  The factual circumstances may have called
for different applications, guided by the rule that the courts are vested with
discretion, depending on the equities of each case, on the award of
interest.  Nonetheless, it may not be
unwise, by way of clarification and reconciliation, to suggest the following
rules of thumb for future guidance.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="NUM">I.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When an obligation,
regardless of its source, i.e., law, contracts, quasi-contracts, delicts or

<p class="NUM">II.<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With regard
particularly to an award of interest in the concept of actual and compensatory
damages, the rate of interest, as well as the accrual thereof, is imposed, as
follows:</p>

<p class="NUM">1.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the obligation is
breached, and it consists in the payment of a sum of money, i.e., a loan or
forbearance of money, the interest due should be that which may have been
stipulated in writing.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a>

is judicially demanded.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> In
the absence of stipulation, the rate of interest shall be 12% per annum to be
computed from default, i.e., from judicial or extrajudicial demand under and
subject to the provisions of Article 1169<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a> of
the Civil Code.</p>

<p class="NUM">2.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When an obligation, not
constituting <span style="">a </span>loan or
forbearance of money, is breached, an interest on the amount of damages awarded
may be imposed at the <u>discretion</u> <u>of</u> <u><span style="">the</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>court</u><a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>

Accordingly, where the demand is established with reasonable certainty, the
interest shall begin to run from the time the claim is made judicially or
extrajudicially (Art. 1169, Civil Code) but when such certainty cannot be so
reasonably established at the time the demand is made, the interest shall begin
to run only from the date the judgment of the court is made (at which time the
quantification of damages may be deemed to have been reasonably
ascertained).  The actual base for the
computation of legal interest shall, in any case, be on the amount finally
adjudged.</p>

court awarding a sum of money becomes final and executory, the rate of legal
interest, whether the case falls under paragraph 1 or paragraph 2, above, shall

being deemed to be by then an equivalent to a forbearance of credit.</p>
