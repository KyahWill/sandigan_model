				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">For a resolution of the issues raised in the instant petition
involving the amount required to redeem the subject foreclosed property, the
Court must first determine what law to apply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Is it Section 30, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of Court in relation to
Act No. 3135 as amended, or Section 78 of Rep. Act No. 337 (General Banking
Act) as amended by P.D. No. 1828?</p>

<p class="BODY">The facts of the case are as follows:</p>

<p class="BODY">On March 2, 1979, Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco</span>
executed in favor of private respondent State Investment House, Inc. (hereinafter
referred to as SIHI) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>real estate mortgage over a 952 square-meter parcel of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">land </span>in San Juan, Metro-Manila,
together with all the improvements thereon, covered by TCT No. 2782 issued in
his name, as security for the payment of a loan in the amount of
P1,000,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For failure of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco</span> to pay his outstanding balance of P1,126,220.56
computed as of October 19, 1982, [Record, p. 217-E] the mortgaged property was <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span> foreclosed by SIHI and was sold at public
auction on February 10, 1983 for P760,000.00 to SIHI as the only bidder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The certificate of sale in favor of SIHI was
registered with the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Pasig</span> on <st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="2">February 28, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1983" day="22" month="5">May 22, 1983</st1:date>,
SIHI filed before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) of <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
an action against Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco</span> for the collection
of the sum of P612,031.84, representing the deficiency of his indebtedness as
of <st1:date year="1983" day="10" month="2">February 10, 1983</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, petitioner acquired by virtue of a deed of
assignment Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco's</span> right of redemption for and
in consideration of P500,000.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Before
the expiration of the one-year redemption period, petitioner offered to redeem
the foreclosed property from SIHI by tendering to the latter two (2) manager's
checks issued by SOLIDBANK, one for P760,000.00 representing the purchase
price, and another for P91,200.00 representing interest at the rate of 1% per
month for 12 months, totaling P851,200.00.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>SIHI rejected this offer.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, on February 20, 1984, petitioner filed an action for
consignation of the aforesaid amount with the RTC, docketed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>Civil
Case No. 84-22839, to compel SIHI to accept the P851,200.00 as payment of the
redemption price for the foreclosed property, to order SIHI to surrender the
title over the property and to issue a certificate of redemption in favor of
petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="27" month="2">February 27, 1984</st1:date>,
a day before the expiration of the redemption period, petitioner decided to
redeem the foreclosed property directly from the Ex-Officio Regional Sheriff of
<span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, who accepted from him the amount of P851,200.00
as redemption price and P4,269.00 as percentage fee of collection, and issued
to him the corresponding certificate of redemption.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="30" month="3">March 30, 1984</st1:date>,
SIHI filed a motion to dismiss Civil Case No. 84-22839 on the ground of lack of
cause of action, alleging that the amount sought to be consigned was
insufficient for purposes of redemption pursuant to Section 78 of Rep. Act No.
337, otherwise known as the General Banking Act.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an order dated <st1:date year="1984" day="24" month="4">April
 24, 1984</st1:date>, the RTC dismissed petitioner's action on the ground,
among others, that there being no valid tender of payment, there was no valid
consignation.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>No appeal was interposed
by petitioner from this order.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">After the dismissal of the aforementioned action, SIHI
consolidated its ownership over the foreclosed property, and caused the
cancellation of TCT No. 2782 and the issuance of TCT No. 44775 covering the
same property in its name.</p>

<p class="BODY">After learning of this development, petitioner instituted another
action in the Regional Trial Court on <st1:date year="1984" day="11" month="6">June
 11, 1984</st1:date>, this time a complaint for annulment and cancellation of
title, with damages, against SIHI and the Register of Deeds for the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Province</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
docketed as Civil Case No. 51169.</p>

<p class="BODY">During the <span class="SpellE">pendency</span> of the action, SIHI
sold the subject property to spouses Domingo Lim and Lim <span class="SpellE">Siu</span>
<span class="SpellE">Keng</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Defendant Register of Deeds, thereafter, cancelled TCT No. 44775 and
issued TCT No. 46409 in the name of the spouses.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1986" day="7" month="7">July 7, 1986</st1:date>,
the court <u>a</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">quo</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span>dismissed petitioner's complaint
holding that it stated no cause of action because petitioner failed to effect a
valid redemption as required under Section 78 of the General Banking Act, as
amended by P.D. No. 1828.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court
accordingly ordered petitioner to pay SIHI the following sums of money: P10,000.00
as temperate damages; P20,000.00 as exemplary damages on the finding that
petitioner had instituted the case in violation of the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">res</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <span class="SpellE"><u>j</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">udicata</span></u></span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>rule; and P20,000.00 as attorney's
fees [CA Decision, p. 4; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 32.] Petitioner's
motion for reconsideration was subsequently denied.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner then appealed to respondent appellate court, raising as
errors: (1) the application of Section 78 of the General Banking Act, as
amended, instead of Act No. 3135, in relation to Section 30, Rule 39 of the
Revised Rules of Court; (2) the holding that the dismissal of Civil Case No.
84-22839 (consignation case) from which petitioner failed to appeal and wherein
the court made a finding that petitioner made no valid tender of payment of the
redemption price, had the effect of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">res</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> </span><span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">judicata</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>on the case at hand; (3) the finding
that SIHI committed no actionable wrong in conveying the subject property to
spouses Domingo Lim and Lim <span class="SpellE">Siu</span> <span class="SpellE">Keng</span>;
and, (4) the award of damages assessed against petitioner [CA Decision, p. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">5; </span><span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p.
33.]</p>

<p class="BODY">In its decision promulgated on <st1:date year="1988" day="28" month="4">April 28, 1988</st1:date>, respondent appellate court affirmed the
trial court's judgment with the modification that the award for temperate and
exemplary damages assessed against petitioner was set aside for lack of legal
basis [CA Decision, p. 11; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 39.]</p>

<p class="BODY">Not satisfied with the above decision, petitioner filed the
instant petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, raising basically the same
errors he had raised in the appellate court.</p>

<p class="BODY">The issues raised in this petition may be reduced into four, to
wit:</p>

<blockquote>I.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether Act No.
3135, as amended, in relation to Section 30, Rule 39 of the Revised Rules of
Court, or Section 78 of Rep. Act No. 337 (General Banking Act), as amended by
P.D. No. 1828, is the applicable law in determining the redemption price;</blockquote>

<blockquote>II.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
dismissal of Civil Case No. 84-22839 (consignation case) had the effect of <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">res</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"> <span class="SpellE"><u>judicata</u></span> </span>with

Register of Deeds for the province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> may be
held liable for damages for <span class="SpellE">cancelling</span> TCT No. 2782
and issuing TCT No. 44775 in favor of SIHI; and,</blockquote>

<blockquote>IV.<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether or not the
award of attorney's fees and expenses of litigation assessed against petitioner
is proper.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As regards the first issue, petitioner insists that the present case
is governed by Act No. 3135, as amended, in relation to Section 30, Rule 39 of
the Revised Rules of Court which provides in part:</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, petitioner contends that a valid redemption was made by him
as assignee of the mortgagor's right of redemption when he tendered and paid to
the Sheriff of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> the amount of P851,000.00
representing the purchase price plus interest computed at the rate of 1% per
month for a period of twelve months.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This was the same amount allegedly tendered to, and refused acceptance
by, SIHI.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In support of his contention,

<u>Rehabilitation</u> <u>Finance</u> <u>Corporation</u> G.R. No. L-24571,
December 18, 1970, 36 SCRA 289], applied Section 78 of the General Banking Act,
as amended by P.D. No. 1828, and consequently held that no valid redemption was
effected by petitioner because the amount tendered to SIHI and thereafter paid
to the sheriff was <span class="SpellE">insufficent</span>, it being less than
the amount due under the real estate mortgage contract of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco</span>, or the latter's outstanding balance, with
interest as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt;mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">specified
in </span>the mortgage contract plus expenses incurred by SIHI by reason of the
foreclosure and sale of the subject property.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court finds that respondent appellate court committed no
reversible error, having acted in accordance with the law and jurisprudence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Section 78 of the General Banking Act, as amended by P.D. No.
1828, states that:</p>

Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco's</span> right of redemption must be deemed
subrogated to the rights and obligations of his assignor, and bound by exactly

bound the latter as debtor and mortgagor [<span class="SpellE">Gorospe</span> v.

" pursuant to Section 78 of the General Banking Act in order to effect a
valid redemption.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since petitioner
merely stepped into the shoes of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco</span>, his

3135 insofar <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as
</span>the redemption price is concerned, when the mortgagee is a bank or
banking or credit institution, Section 6 of Act No. 3135 being, in this
respect, inconsistent with Section 78 of the General Banking Act.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although the foreclosure and sale of the
subject property was done by SIHI pursuant to Act No. 3135, as amended (whereby
entities like SIHI are authorized to <span class="SpellE">extrajudicially</span>

power inserted in or annexed to the real estate mortgage contract, and
interested parties, like petitioner herein, are given one year from the date of
sale within which to redeem the foreclosed properties), Section 78 of the
General Banking Act, as amended, provides the amount at which the subject
property is redeemable from SIHI, which is, in this case, the amount due under
the mortgage deed, or the outstanding obligation of Carlos <span class="SpellE">Coquinco</span>,
plus interest and expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY">The decision in the 1985 case of <u>Philippine</u> <u>National</u>
<u>Bank</u> <u>v</u>. <u>The</u> <u>Honorable</u> <u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>,
<u>supra</u>, invoked by petitioner is not determinative of the issues in the
instant petition because that case is applicable only to extrajudicial
foreclosures by the PNB effected pursuant to a mortgage contract entered into
prior to the enactment in 1975 of the Revised Charter of the PNB, P.D. No. 694
(which contained provisions on redemption), and deals specifically with the
amount of interest to be included in the computation of the redemption price.</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, inasmuch as petitioner failed to tender and pay the
required amount for thee redemption of the subject property pursuant to Section
78 of the General Banking Act, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>amended, no valid redemption was effected
by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, there was no legal
obstacle to the consolidation of title by SIHI.</p>

<p class="BODY">Considering that the Court has made the foregoing categorical
finding that petitioner failed to effect a valid redemption of the subject
property, it is deemed unnecessary to pass upon the merits of the second issue
presented in the instant petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">As regards the third issue, suffice it to say that the respondent
Register of Deeds incurred no liability when he cancelled TCT No. 2782 and
issued in lieu thereof TCT No. 44775 in the name of SIHI, the former having
acted in fulfillment of his official functions and in accordance with law.</p>

<p class="BODY">With regard to the fourth issue, petitioner contends that since
respondent appellate court had set aside the award of temperate and exemplary
damages on the finding that petitioner had acted in good faith in filing the
present action, it should have also deleted the award of attorney's fees and
expenses of litigation assessed against him for lack of legal basis.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This contention is
meritorious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">A perusal of Article 2208 of the New Civil Code will reveal that
the award of attorney's fees as a form of damages is the exception rather than
the general rule for it is predicated upon the existence of exceptional
circumstances, such as a "clearly unfounded civil action or
proceeding" or evident bad faith on the plaintiff's part in instituting
his action [Tan Ti v. <span class="SpellE">Alvear</span>, 26 Phil. 566 (1914); <span class="SpellE">Buan</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Camaganacan</span>, G.R. No.

<p class="BODY">It cannot be said that the present action instituted by
petitioner was clearly unfounded.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Although the theory upon which petitioner's complaint <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">was </span>based
is untenable, he had raised legitimate issues on the application of Section 78
of the General Banking Act to credit institutions like SIHI, and the import of
the decisions in the cases of <st1:city><st1:place><u>Ponce</u></st1:place></st1:city>
<u>de</u> <u>Leon</u> <u>v</u>. <u>Rehabilitation</u> <u>Finance</u> <u>Corporation</u>
and <u>Philippine</u> <u>National</u> <u>Bank</u> <u>v</u>. <u>The</u> <u>Honorable</u>
<u>Court</u> <u>of</u> <u>Appeals</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Neither was it established that petitioner had acted in bad faith in the
filing of his action against SIHI notwithstanding the dismissal of his
complaint in Civil Case No. 84-22839 (consignation case).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court agrees with the holding of the
respondent appellate court that the filing of the present action by petitioner
was merely</p>

<blockquote>. . . a misapprehension of a legal remedy as
would normally be taken within the ambit of permissible legal procedure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is a scene happening daily in our courts
where the opposing parties would avail of every conceivable rule in the statute
books to ventilate their claim or defenses.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>[Petitioner's] persistence to pay the redemption price is an act which
the court does not consider condemnable as to make [him] liable for temperate
and exemplary damages.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We are inclined
to presume that [he] acted in good faith [CA Decision, p. 10; <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, P. 38.]<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>
