Pursuant to Act No. 4041 of the Philippine Legislature approved January 
21, 1933, the Fisheries situated in the locality known as Mangabul, 
Bayambang, Pangasinan, and fall­ing within Plan No. Ipd.  Ninety-two of 
the Bureau of Lands and recently declared by the courts as public land 
was reserved and the usufruct thereof ceded to the municipality of 
Bayambang, Province of Pangasinan, to be used or disposed of in 
accordance with the general municipal law relative to the letting of 
fisheries in municipal waters:  Provided, That the timber and other 
forest products therein shall be placed under the administration and 
control of the forest service; Provided further, that the cession shall 
not be interpreted as limiting the power of the Secretary of Agriculture
 and Natural Resources to prescribe rules and regulations for the 
protection of game birds, mammals or fish within the area ceded to the 
municipality of Bayambang.  (Section 1, Act 4041.  This Act was declared
 enforced by Proclamation No. 545 (1933).
<p>
On May 15, 1974, the Sanggunian Bayan of Bayambang, Pangasinan passed 
Resolution No. 35 enacting Ordinance No. 8, series of 1974, establishing
 the Bayambang Fishery and Hunting Park and Municipal Water Shed 
embracing all the vast area of the Mangabul Fisheries consisting of 
about 2,061 hectares with 19 fishponds and not less than 1,500 hectares 
of watershed area.  In the said ordinance, the municipality designated, 
appointed and constituted pri­vate respondent Geruncio Lacuesta as 
Manager-Administrator for a period of 25 years, renewable for another 25
 years, under the condition that said respondent shall pay the 
muni­cipality a sum equivalent to 10% of the annual gross income that 
may be derived from the sale of forest products, wild game and fish, 
which amount shall not be less than P200,000.00 annually.  He was 
further required to post a bond in the amount of P200,000.00 to guaranty
 payment of the 10% due the municipality.
</p><p>
Municipal Ordinance No. 8 was approved by the Provincial Board of 
Pangasinan on October 11, 1974 and thereafter was forwarded to the then 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources for approval pursuant to 
the provisions of the Fisheries Act, Act No. 4003.
</p><p>
On April 4, 1975, the Secretary disapproved the Ordi­nance because it 
grants fishery privileges to respondent Lacuesta without the benefit of 
competitive public hearing in contravention of the provisions of Act 
4003 as amended.
</p><p>
Respondent Lacuesta interposed an appeal from the dis­approval by the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources to the Office of the 
President but the appeal was withdrawn by said respondent in his letter 
dated July 14, 1977.
</p><p>
The Municipality then informed respondent Lacuesta of the disapproval of
 the Ordinance by the Secretary of Agri­culture &amp; Natural Resources 
and directed him to refrain and desist from acting as 
Administrator-Manager under the con­tract but the latter refused and 
insisted in maintaining possession of the fisheries.  Inspite of such 
refusal, the Sanggunian Bayan of Bayambang, Pangasinan passed Resolution
 No. 31, series of 1977, resolving to advertise for public bidding all 
fisheries at the Mangabul area for four years and to direct the 
Municipal Treasurer to prepare the neces­sary notices of public bidding,
 and accordingly, the Muni­cipal Mayor and the Municipal Treasurer 
caused to issue a Notice of Public Bidding scheduled July 5, 6, and 7, 
1977.  Among the winning bidders were the petitioners herein, the 
spouses Lydia Terrado and Martin Rosario and Domingo Fer­nandez who were
 immediately placed in possession of the Mangabul fisheries as of July 
6, 1977.
</p><p>
Private respondent Geruncio Lacuesta immediately filed on July 8, 1977 a petition for prohibition and <em>mandamus </em>with
 damages with the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch IX in 
San Carlos City, presided by Judge Augusto Saroca against the Municipal 
Mayor, the Municipal Treasurer, the Sanggunian Bayan and the members 
thereof, praying that the respondent municipal officials named therein 
be prohibited from executing any contract of lease with the winning 
bidders and from enforcing Resolution No. 31, series of 1977, and 
further asked that a temporary restraining order be issued against said 
respondent officials from performing the acts enjoined.
</p><p>
Pursuant to the prayer in the petition for prohibition in Civil Case No.
 516, Judge Saroca issued a restraining order enjoining and prohibiting 
all the respondents, their agents, representatives and/or anybody acting
 for and on their own behalf, from executing any contract of lease with 
the winning bidders in the biddings conducted on July 5, 6, and 7, 1977 
and from enforcing Resolution No. 31, series of 1977 until further 
orders from the court.  Respondents in this Civil Case No. 516 filed a 
motion to dissolve the tem­porary restraining order but was denied on 
August 17, 1977.
</p><p>
Upon ex-parte motion by Lacuesta asking that the Sheriff of the court be
 authorized to enforce the restraining order of July 11, 1977 and to 
arrest and keep in his custody all persons violating the same, Judge 
Saroca issued on October 7, 1977 an order directing Deputy Sheriff 
Alberto V. Soriano to proceed to the Mangabul fisheries and enforce the 
res­training order of July 11, 1977 against the respondent municipal 
officials, their agents and representatives and to arrest and keep in 
custody any and all persons found to be violating said order.  
Thereafter, the Deputy Sheriff informed the court on October 26, 1977 
that he served copies of the restraining order dated July 11, 1977 on 
all parties concerned and that they peacefully vacated and gave the 
possession of the fisheries without interposing any formal objection, to
 the plaintiffs, Geruncio Lacuesta, et al.
</p><p>
Still in Civil Case No. 516, Lacuesta filed a petition dated September 
16, 1977 asking that the defendants named in said petition including the
 spouses Lydia Terrado Rosario and Martin Rosario and others be ordered 
to explain why they should not be punished for contempt and that they be
 arrested immediately and kept in custody until they stop violating the 
restraining order of July 11, 1977, further alleging that said spouses 
employing misrepresentation, stra­tegies, deceit, threat and force took 
over the Mayor fishery and illegally fished therein and are continuing 
to fish the same including the Manansan, Alangigan, Tubor and Banawang 
na Dueg Fisheries which they had previously took over from the movant 
Lacuesta.
</p><p>
The situation became serious as on October 10, 1977 the Sanggunian Bayan
 passed Resolution No. 34, series of 1977 "requesting the assistance 
from the Department of Natural Resources, the Philippine Constabulary, 
Department of Justice, the Provincial Fiscal, the Provincial Governor 
and other agencies, for them to enjoin respondent from disturbing and 
interfering with the administration by the Municipality of Mangabul 
Fisheries and other areas."
</p><p>
In the meantime that these incidents were pending before Judge Saroca, 
the members of the Sanggunian Bayan as petitioners filed on November 15,
 1977 a petition for <em>certiorari</em> with the defunct Court of 
Appeals against Judge Saroca, the INP Station Commander, Deputy Sheriff 
Soriano, and Geruncio Lacuesta and others assailing the order issued on 
July 11, 1977 as well as the order issued October 7, 1977 as null and 
void, the same having been issued without juris­diction and with grave 
abuse of discretion, the case docketed as CA-G.R. No. SP-07252-R.  The 
appellate court denied the petition for <em>certiorari</em> and held 
that Judge Saroca did not act without or in excess of jurisdiction or 
with grave abuse of discretion in issuing the restraining order of July 
11, 1977.  The Sanggunian Bayan members elevated the case on a petition 
for review on <em>certiorari</em>, G.R. No. 49064 but was denied for lack of merit per Our resolution dated October 16, 1978.
</p><p>
While the <em>certiorari</em> proceeding was pending before the Court of
 Appeals, the resolution on the motion for contempt before Judge Saroca 
was held in abeyance but upon final decision by the court, Lacuesta 
moved the court on July 15, 1979 to resolve the contempt motion as well 
as for the order of their arrest.  After hearing, Judge Saroca issued 
the order dated August 30, 1979 holding that the continued possession of
 the spouses Lydia Terrado Rosario and Martin Rosario as winning bidders
 constituted disobedience to and unlawful interference with the 
temporary restraining order of July 11, 1977 and directed Deputy Sheriff
 Soriano to enforce the July 11 and October 7, 1977 orders, to cause the
 arrest of said Rosario spouses including their agents and 
representatives and any and all person representing them­selves as 
winning bidders in the public bidding held on July 6, 1977 and to hold 
them in custody until further orders of the court, unless said spouses 
and their agents and the winning bidders voluntarily refrain from 
disobeying and interfering with the process of the court, in which case 
they may be discharged from custody.  In the same order, Judge Saroca 
set a pre-trial conference and hearing on the merits on September 25, 
26, and 27, 1979.
</p><p>
Having been adjudged in contempt of court and their immediate arrest 
ordered by Judge Saroca in the order men­tioned above dated August 30, 
1979, the spouses Lydia Terrado Rosario and Martin Rosario filed the 
petition for prohibition with the prayer for a writ of preliminary 
mandatory injunction assailing the questioned order as null and void, 
having been issued in grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack of 
jurisdiction and praying that respondent Judge Saroca be restrained from
 implementing the same, the petition docketed as CA-G.R. No. SP-09724.
</p><p>
Resolving the petition (CA-G.R. No. SP-09724), the Court of Appeals, 
acting through the Former Eleventh Division with Justices Victoriano, 
J., ponente, and Reyes and Nocon, JJ., concurring, ruled and set aside 
the assailed order of August 30, 1979, holding that the Rosario spouses 
were not parties to the case, hence, they could not be bound by the 
restraining order of July 11, 1977 which enjoined and prohibited the 
parties:  "(1) from executing any contract of lease with the winning 
bidders in the bidding conducted on July 5, 6, and 7, 1977; and/or (2) 
from enforcing resolution No. 31, series of 1977 of the Sangguniang 
Bayan of Bayambang, Pangasinan, until further orders from this court." 
The order of Judge Saroca dated August 30, 1979 was, therefore, ordered 
set aside as having been issued in excess of jurisdiction and with grave
 abuse of discretion.  The decision of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. 
No. SP-09724 was promulgated January 24, 1980 thereby upholding the 
possession of the spouses Lydia Terrado and Martin Rosario.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, the Municipality of Bayambang, represented by Mayor Jaime P. 
Junio and the Sangguniang Bayan of Bayam­bang represented by the members
 thereof, filed on September 5, 1979 Civil Case No. SCC-648 in the Court
 of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch X, San Carlos City against 
Geruncio Lacuesta for annulment of the contract entered into between the
 Municipality and Lacuesta under Ordinance No. 8 hereinbefore mentioned,
 injunction and damages with prayer for the issuance of a writ of 
preliminary injunction.  After the hearing of the incident for the 
issuance of the writ of preliminary injunction, Judge Saroca issued an 
order dated November 15, 1979 granted the writ as prayed for and ordered
 the defendant Lacuesta, his agents, lawyers, representatives, laborers 
and other person or persons under his employ to re­frain and desist from
 interfering with and molesting the plaintiffs in the use of and in the 
exercise of plaintiffs' usufructury rights until further orders from the
 court.  On November 16, 1979, the day Judge Saroca retired from the 
service, he issued another order to the sheriff to cause defendant 
Lacuesta to refrain from and desist from enforcing and implementing 
Resolution No. 35 enacting Ordinance No. 8, series of 1974 and the 
contract of management and adminis­tration, restraining them further 
from interfering with and molesting the plaintiffs in the use of and in 
the exercise of the latters' usufructury rights until further orders 
from the court.
</p><p>
On November 23, 1979, Lacuesta elevated to the Supreme Court the November 15 And 16 orders of Judge Saroca in a petition for <em>certiorari</em> with prayer for preliminary injunction docketed as G.R. No. 51984.  In Our resolution of January 14, 1980, the petition for <em>certiorari</em> was denied for lack of merit.  His motion for reconsideration was also denied in Our resolution of February 18, 1980.
</p><p>
With the retirement of Judge Saroca, the case was transferred to Branch 
III, Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Dagupan City, presided over 
by Judge Felicidad Carandang-Villalon, the case now docketed and 
numbered as D-5118.  Lacuesta then filed a Motion to Dissolve the 
Injunction and to Order Plaintiffs to Vacate and Turn All the Fisheries 
to Defendants (the injunction previously issued by Judge Saroca dated 
November 15, 1979).  The Motion was granted by Judge Carandang-Villalon 
on the ground that "after the plaintiffs have recognized and confirmed 
the validity of the resolution and the contract, and after the defendant
 had started to perform his duties and obligations under the contract, 
the legal and factual ground which led the court to issue the writ has 
ceased to exist, and consequently, the dissolution of the writ of 
preliminary mandatory injunction dated November 15, 1979 appears 
warranted by prevailing circumstances." Plaintiff Municipality moved for
 reconsideration which was denied in the court's order of March 9, 1981 
which also ordered the issuance of the writ of execution after the 
approval of defendant Lacuesta's bond of P200,000.00.
</p><p>
The plaintiff Municipality thereafter assailed the above orders of Judge
 Carandang-Villalon dated November 8, 1981 and March 9, 1981 in the 
former's petition for <em>certiorari</em> with prayer for writ of 
preliminary injunction, the petition filed in the Court of Appeals and 
docketed as CA-G.R. 12586, dated June 16, 1981.
</p><p>
In the decision of the Court of Appeals, Seventh Division, promulgated 
September 29, 1981, the court held that "being bereft of merit, as shown
 above, the instant petition is hereby denied due course and outrightly 
dismissed.  Accordingly, the temporary restraining order heretofore 
issued is hereby lifted and the urgent motion to lift restraining order 
filed on August 19, 1981 and on August 27, 1981 are hereby left 
uncon­sidered for having been rendered moot and academic by the 
resolution." The motion for reconsideration of the decision was denied 
by resolution of the appellate court on November 11, 1981.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, when the Court of First Instance of Pangasinan, Branch III, 
Judge Carandang-Villalon presiding, received copy of the decision in 
SP-12586 promulgated September 29, 1981, the court issued an order on 
October 5, 1981 for the execution of its previous order to dissolve the 
preliminary injunction and place Lacuesta in possession of the contested
 fisheries and accordingly, a writ of execution was issued on October 7,
 1981.
</p><p>
Another petition for <em>certiorari</em> was filed by the spouses Lydia 
Terrado and Martin Rosario and Domingo Fernandez docketed as CA-G.R. No.
 SP-13175, assailing the issuance of the order and writ dated October 5,
 and 7, 1981 respectively for allegedly violating due process as they 
were issued before the lapse of the 15-day reglementary period.  In this
 petition, SP-13175, the court required respondent Judge and Lacuesta to
 comment, the same time issuing a temporary restraining order against 
the assailed order and writ of October 5 and 7, 1981 of the respondent 
court.
</p><p>
On November 7, 1981, the appellate court (through the Seventh Division and <em>ponente </em>who
 handled both SP-12586 and SP-13175), rendered its resolution in 
SP-13175 dismissing the petition for lack of merit and setting aside the
 order of October 14, 1981 to include the lifting of the restraining 
order of even date.  The appellate court ruled that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Our decision in said CA-G.R. No. SP-12586 held in effect that the
 impugned orders (like the order of January 8, 1981), were pro­perly 
issued by the respondent court.  Hence, those interlocutory orders, the 
effectivity of which were suspended by the <em>certiorari</em> 
pro­ceedings in CA-G.R. No. SP-12586, presumed to be immediately 
executory upon the lifting of the restraining order as done in the 
decision of September 29, 1981.  This must be so, notwithstanding the 
filing on October 21, 1981 of an 'Urgent Ex-Parte Motion For Extension" 
to file motion for reconsideration of said deci­sion because an 
injunction, once dissolved, cannot be revived except by a new exercise 
of judicial power, and no appeal by a disatisfied party can of itself 
revive it.  (Watcon vs. Enriquez, 1 Phil. 480; Sitia Teco vs. Ventura, 9
 Phil. 497; II Martin, Rules of Court, 1969 Ed., p. 84). </p>
  <p> Thus, when respondent court issued its herein impugned order of 
October 5, 1981 and the Writ of Execution pursuant thereto on October 7,
 1981, it was merely putting into effect the immediately operative 
interlocutory order dissolving the injunction.  There was therefore, no 
abuse of discretion."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
When the resolution in SP-13175 was received in the lower court, Judge 
Villalon issued on November 6, 1981 an "Alias Writ of Execution and 
Possession" which reiterated its writ of October 7, 1981.  The alias 
writ was received by the Muni­cipality, through counsel, on November 12,
 1981.
</p><p>
On November 16, 1981, the Municipality of Bayambang, represented by its Mayor, filed another <em>certiorari</em>
 petition to annul the alias writ of November 6, 1981, in CA-G.R. No. 
13353 against Judge Carandang-Villalon and Geruncio Lacuesta, the 
petition being signed by Atty. Oliver O. Lozano.
</p><p>
Since CA-G.R. No. SP-12586 and CA-G.R. No. SP-13353 involve the same 
subject matter, the Special Sixth Division of the Court of Appeals to 
which CA-G.R. No. SP-13353 was assigned or raffled, resolved in its 
Resolution of November 27, 1981 to consolidate the case with CA-G.R. No.
 SP-12586 then pending with the Seventh Division of the Court of Appeals
 as to the plaintiff Municipality's motion for reconsideration.
</p><p>
The two <em>certiorari</em> petitions, CA-G.R. No. 12586 and CA-G.R. No.
 SP-13353, now consolidated in the Seventh Division, were resolved in 
the Resolution dated December 4, 1981, thus:  "WHEREFORE, the foregoing 
considered, the petition in 13353 is hereby dismissed for being a scrap 
of paper, the temporary restraining order heretofore issued is hereby 
lifted, and the scheduled hearing on December 10, 1981 hereby 
dis­continued.  The motion for reconsideration in SP-12586 is hereby 
denied for lack of merit."
</p><p>
Since the Court of Appeals, Seventh Division, dismissed the petition in 
CA-G.R. No. SP-13353 as a mere scrap of paper because Atty. Oliver O. 
Lozano was not authorized to repre­sent the petitioner Municipality, 
Atty. Lozano submitted the required authority in his Motion for 
Reconsideration of the resolution dismissing the petition, further 
praying that the resolution of the Sixth Division giving due course to 
the petition as well as the temporary restraining order issued therein 
be reinstated or restored.
</p><p>
Acting on the motion of the Municipality entitled "Ex-Parte Reiteration 
of Motion for Restoration of Temporary Restraining Order" filed on 
December 22, 1981 and the "Urgent Ex-Parte Motion to Stop Arrest of 
Petitioner's Laborers" filed on December 23, 1981, the court in its 
Reso­lution of December 24, 1981 set the hearing of the first motion on 
January 15, 1982 and as to the second motion, the court deemed "it wise 
and proper in the spirit of love and compassion this Christmastime, to 
order that no arrests be ordered by the respondent court against persons
 involved in 'those fisheries in areas covered by existing lease 
contracts executed by plaintiff Municipality in favor of entities and/or
 persons before November 15, 1979' until after the results of the 
November 15 hearing are received.  x x x In effect, therefore, we are 
ordering, as it is hereby ordered that a partial temporary restraining 
order be issued only as involved the areas with existing lease contract 
entered into by the Municipality prior to November 15, 1979."
</p><p>
After the hearing on January 15, 1982 as alluded to above, the court 
promulgated its Resolution dated January 28, 1982, holding that the 
pleadings signed by Atty. Oliver O. Lozano are deemed valid for purposes
 of considering the incidents therein and that the impugned alias writ 
of execution issued by respondent court on November 6, 1981 is hereby 
declared void only insofar as it has deleted the exception involving 
"those fisheries and areas covered by existing lease contract executed 
by the plaintiff Municipality in favor of entities and/or persons before
 November 15, 1979.  Further, the respondent court was directed to 
conduct a factual determination of (a) who are the persons or what are 
the entities involved, and (b) the clearly specified areas co­vered by 
their contracts, and that prior to the holding of such factual 
determination however, the respondent court was ordered to settle the 
nature of those "lease contracts" - i.e., whether ordinary lease 
contract over a fishery area or contract of lease of services.  Finally,
 the Court of Appeals ordered that "in case the respondent court finds, 
after putting to rest the nature of those lease contracts referred to in
 the original order of dissolution and after making the factual 
determination herein ordered, that such contracts no longer exist, then 
the Partial Temporary Res­training Order above mentioned shall be deemed
 ineffective for having then become moot and academic." The Motion for 
Contempt of Court filed by Lacuesta on January 13, 1982 was also denied 
by the court.
</p><p>
Pursuant to the resolution of the Court of Appeals dated January 28, 
1982 and in compliance therewith in conducting a factual determination 
of who are the persons or what are the entities involved and the clearly
 specified areas covered by their contracts, Judge Villalon, after 
conducting hearings, submitted to the appellate court in her 1st 
Indorsement dated April 30, 1982, stating that "it is definite that 
there are admittedly no areas covered by any existing lease contract 
executed by the plaintiff Municipality in favor of entities and/or 
persons before November 15, 1979 within the contem­plation of the Order 
dated January 8, 1981 which order has ordered the dissolution of the 
writ of preliminary mandatory injunction dated November 15, 1979 issued 
by then retired Hon. Judge Augusto Saroca for reasons set forth in the 
Order."
</p><p>
Acting upon the above report of Judge Villalon, the Court of Appeals 
promulgated its Resolution dated July 7, 1982, resolving that "in view 
of the above, the partial tem­porary restraining order has become 
ineffective for having then become moot and academic.  WHEREFORE, the 
motion filed by private respondent is hereby granted (Motion Ex-Parte 
for Total Lifting of Partial Restraining Order).  The Partial Temporary 
Restraining Order issued on December 24, 1981 is hereby lifted and set 
aside.
</p><p>
Two other petitions for <em>certiorari</em> were also filed with the 
Court of Appeals assailing the October 8, 1982 Order of Judge Villalon 
which ordered the issuance of a writ of execu­tion and implementation of
 the Order of January 8, 1981, the first being CA-G.R. No. 15033 
entitled "Spouses Lydia Terrado and Martin Rosario, et al. vs. Hon. 
Felicidad Carandang­-Villalon, et al.," filed October 18, 1982 and the 
second, CA-G.R. No. 13175, "Spouses Lydia Terrado, et al. vs. Hon. 
Felicidad Carandang-Villalon, et al." dated October 9, 1981.  CA-G.R. 
No. 15033 was dismissed on March 22, 1983, while CA-G.R. No. 13175 on 
November 5, 1981.
</p><p>
The five (5) cases relating to the same subject matter, which are 
CA-G.R. No. 15033-SP, CA-G.R. 14501-SP, CA-G.R. 13353-SP, CA-G.R. No. 
13175-SP and CA-G.R. No. 12586-SP, were then consolidated in the 
decision of the Court of Appeals promulgated March 22, 1983.
</p><p>
The dismissal of the petition in CA-G.R. No. 13175 and the issuance of 
the alias writ of execution and possession issued by respondent Judge 
Villalon in Civil Case No. D-5118 is now elevated to Us in G.R. No. 
58794.
</p><p>
Likewise, the decision of the appellate court dismissing the petition in
 CA-G.R. No. 15033-SP and the Order issued by the trial court dated 
January 8, 1981 have been raised to Us in G.R. No. 64489.  Both 
petitions at bar, G.R. No. 58794 and G.R. No. 64489, have been 
consolidated per Our Resolution of August 24, 1983.
</p><p>
The records of the petition before Us in G.R. No. 64489 disclose that 
upon written request of Judge Felicidad Carandang-Villalon that she be 
relieved from taking further cognizance of Civil Case No. SCC-648 
(D-5118) entitled "Geruncio Lacuesta, et al. vs. The Municipality of 
Bayambang, the Supreme Court in its Resolution en banc dated June 7, 
1983 granted the request of the Judge and directed the Clerk of Court of
 the Regional Trial Court of Dagupan to transfer the records of the case
 to the Clerk of the Regional Trial Court of San Carlos City for 
raffling among the two branches thereat.  Accordingly, Judge 
Carandang-Villalon issued an Order dated June 17, 1983 directing the 
Stenographer who took the pro­ceedings 30 days to make complete 
transcript of the same and the Officer-in-Charge of the court to prepare
 the voluminous exhibits and thereafter effect the transmittal of the 
full records of the case.  Notwithstanding her relief, the same Judge 
issued a further order dated September 2, 1983 command­ing the Sheriff 
and the Commanding Officer of the 153rd PC Company to restore defendant 
Lacuesta and his men to posses­sion of all the fisheries and areas 
covered by his contract pursuant to the Order of the court dated October
 8, 1982.  This Order was implemented according to the Sheriff's Return 
dated September 20, 1983.
</p><p>
Through the maze and muddle of this protracted legal controversy, it is 
plain and clear that the complaints and petitions including all legal 
incidents and motions filed in the trial court, the appellate court and 
before this Tribunal are traceable in origin to the enactment and 
imple­mentation of Municipal Ordinance No. 8, series of 1974, of the 
Municipality of Bayambang, Pangasinan, establishing the Bayambang 
Fishery &amp; Hunting Park and Municipal Watershed covering the 
so-called Mangabul Fisheries.  As stated in Section 3 of the Ordinance, 
the purposes of the Park are:  1.  To attract tourists to Bayambang and 
thus increase the income of the municipality and create new employment 
and new sources of income for the people; 2.  To restore and conserve 
the natural environment of the area by means of reforestation of the 
forest or timberland reserved, thru engineering works, and other means 
within the Ipd-92 area; 3.  To restore or improve, conserve and develop 
the fisheries, zones, and exploit the fish resources of all the 
fisheries therein; 4.  To supply agro-industrial enterprises that may be
 estab­lished in Bayambang with raw materials from the area; and 5.  To 
provide sports and recreation facilities and wholesome sports and 
recreational activities for the people.
</p><p>
Further, under the Ordinance, the Municipality desig­nated, appointed 
and constituted private respondent Lacuesta as Manager-Administrator for
 a period of twenty-five (25) years, renewable for another twenty-five 
(25) years upon mutual agreement (Section 4).  Among the powers, duties 
and obligations of the Manager-Administrator are:  1.  To reforest with 
woods or economic value all the timberland portions in­dicated in Plan 
Ipd-92 and those that need to be reforested for ecological purposes; 2. 
 To stock the forest with wild­life or economic value, protect the 
forest products and wildlife and regulate their multiplication in 
accordance with existing laws; 3.  To deepen the fisheries, swamps and 
tributary streams by dredging, employing modern scientific and 
technological methods to restore or improve and develop the fisheries to
 increase the fees yield; 4.  To conduct and regulate sports fishing and
 hunting in the park and collect fees therefrom; 5.  To use or dispose 
of the fisheries portion in accordance with the general law on municipal
 waters; 6.  To establish in a suitable site within the park a fishing 
and hunting camp to be called "Camp Imelda".  In Section 7 of the 
Ordinance, the Manager-Administrator shall pay to the municipal 
government the sum equivalent to ten (10%) percent of the annual gross 
income derived from all fees charged for fishing and hunting in the park
 and entry into Camp Imelda, from the sale of forest products, wild 
games and fish from the area, but not less than P200,000.00.
</p><p>
In accordance with the Ordinance, a Contract of Manage­ment and 
Administration was executed by the Municipality, represented by its 
Municipal Mayor as the Usufructuary and Atty. Geruncio Lacuesta as the 
Manager-Administrator, setting forth therein the terms and conditions 
laid down in the Or­dinance as well as the mode and manner of the 
payment of the sum of P200,000.00 annually due to the Municipality 
including the posting of a surety bond and other details of the 
manage­ment and administration of the fisheries by the 
Manager-Administrator, which contract was executed on January 28, 1975 
at Bayambang, Pangasinan.
</p><p>
Thus, the validity or legality of the Municipal Ordinance in question is
 the crucial and vital issue that must be re­solved once and for all to 
put an end to this raging liti­gation that has become the tug-of-war 
between the Municipality and Lacuesta, together with other interested 
parties, over the vast and rich fishing grounds.  In resolving said 
issue and ultimately the very root of the conflict, the following 
undisputed facts are controlling and decisive:  1.  That Municipal 
Ordinance No. 8 has been disapproved by the Secretary of Agriculture and
 Natural Resources; and 2.  That pri­vate respondent has since died as 
shown in the Return of the Postmaster of Bayambang as noted in Our 
Resolution of July 2, 1984.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 1. Ordinance No. 8, having been submitted to the Pro­vincial Board
 of Pangasinan and approved by it by virtue of Resolution No. 171 dated 
October 11, 1974, the same was sub­mitted to the Secretary of 
Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources as required by Section 4 of Act No. 
4003, The Fisheries Act, as amended by Commonwealth Act No. 471 passed 
June 16, 1939, and further amended by RA No. 659 approved June 16, 1951,
 thus: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p> "Sec. 4.  Instructions, orders, rules and regulations. - The 
Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce shall from time to time issue 
instructions, orders, rules and regulations consistent with this Act, as
 may be neces­sary and proper to carry into effect the provisions 
thereof and for the conduct of proceedings arising under such 
provisions; and all licenses, permits, leases and contracts issued, 
granted or made herein shall be subject to the same. </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
All ordinances, rules or regulations pertain­ing to fishing or fisheries
 promulgated or enacted by provincial boards, municipal boards or 
councils, or municipal district councils shall be submitted to the 
Secretary of Agriculture and Commerce for approval and shall have full 
force and effect unless notice in writing of their disapproval is 
com­municated by the secretary to the board or council concerned within 
thirty days after submission of the ordinance, rule, or regulation."
</p><p>
From the evidence on record, it appears that a Master Plan for the 
Bayambang Fishing and Hunting Park and Municipal Watershed (Mangabul 
Fisheries Reservation) of Atty. Geruncio Lacuesta, Manager-Administrator
 of the said park, was sub­mitted to the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
 Resources.  In the Indorsement of the Director of Fisheries &amp; 
Aquatic Resources to the Secretary, Department of Natural Resources, the
 Comments, among others, state:  "2.  Records of this bureau show that 
Resolution No. 171, s. 174 of the Provin­cial Board of Pangasinan, 
embodying Resolution No. 35, s. 1974, enacting Ordinance No. 8, s. 1974 
of the Municipal Council of Bayambang, Pangasinan and Resolution No. 24,
 s. 1975 of the same council requesting reconsideration and 
rec­tification of the 5th Indorsement of that department dated April 4, 
1975, were returned DISAPPROVED and denied, respec­tively, by the 
Secretary of Natural Resources to the Munici­pal Council of Bayambang, 
Pangasinan."
</p><p>
Upon the recommendation of the Director of Fisheries and Aquatic 
Resources that "In the light, therefore, of the foregoing, the Master 
Plan for the Bayambang Fishing and Hunting Park and Municipal Watershed 
(Mangabul Fisheries Reservation), insofar as fishing and fisheries 
thereat are concerned should not be given due course and should be 
DISAPPROVED in the absence of adequate provisions thereon to the effect 
that the grant of the exclusive fishery privileges within its municipal 
waters shall be granted by the municipal council (now sangguniang bayan)
 to the highest bidder confor­mable with a fishery ordinance duly 
approved by the Secretary of Natural Resources, pursuant to Sections 4, 
67 and 69 of Act No. 4003, as amended (now sections 4, 29 and 30 of 
Presidential Decree No. 704)," the Secretary of the Depart­ment of 
Natural Resources disapproved the Master Plan.
</p><p>
The legal basis for the disapproval of the Ordinance No. 8 and the 
Master Plan mentioned above is clear and expli­cit in Sections 4, 67 and
 69 of Act No. 4003 as amended by PD 704, Revising and Consolidating All
 Laws and Decrees Affecting Fishing and Fisheries.  These Sections 
provide:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Sec. 4.  Jurisdiction of the Bureau. - The Bureau shall have 
jurisdiction and responsibility in the management, conserva­tion, 
development, protection, utilization and disposition of all fishery and 
aquatic resources of the country except municipal waters which shall be 
under the municipal or city government concerned:  Provided, That fish 
pens and seaweed culture in municipal centers shall be under the 
jurisdiction of the Bureau:  Provided, further, That all municipal or 
city ordinances and resolutions affecting fishing and fisheries and any 
disposition thereunder shall be submitted to the Secretary for 
appropriate action and shall have full force and effect only upon his 
approval.  The Bureau shall also have the authority to regu­late and 
supervise the production, capture and gathering of fish and 
fishery/aquatic products. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The Bureau shall prepare and implement, upon approval of the Fishery 
Industry Development Council, a Fishery Industry Develop­ment Program."
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Section 29.  Grant of Fishery Privileges. - A municipal or city 
council, conformably with an ordinance duly approved by the Secretary 
pursuant to section 4 hereof, may:  (a) grant to the highest qualified 
bidder the exclusive privilege of construction and operating fish 
corrals, oyster culture beds, or of gathering "bangus" fry, or the fry 
of other species in municipal waters for a period not exceeding five (5)
 years:  x x x"
  </p>
  <p> "Section 30.  Municipal concessions and leases concerning 
fisheries. - No lease or concession granted by a municipal or city 
council under authority of an ordinance approved pursuant to section 4 
hereof, concerning fishing or fisheries in streams, lakes, rivers, 
inland and/or municipal waters, shall be valid and enforceable unless 
the Secretary, upon recommendation of the Director, approves the same."
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, the Ordinance is clearly against the provisions of the law for 
it granted exclusive fishery privileges to the private respondent 
without benefit of public bidding.  Under the Fisheries Act, the 
Municipality may not delegate to a private individual as 
Manager-Administrator to "use or dispose of the fisheries portion in 
accordance with the general law on municipal waters" nor to charge fees 
for fishing and hunting in the park, much less sell forest pro­ducts, 
wild games and fish from the area.
</p><p>
Neither can the Municipality grant the exclusive pri­vilege of fishing 
for a period more than five (5) years, whereas in the instant case, the 
period granted the Manager-Administrator was for twenty-five (25) years,
 renewable for another twenty-five years.
</p><p>
Moreover, under the specific provision of Act No. 4041, there is the 
proviso that the timber and other forest pro­ducts therein shall be 
placed under the administration and control of the forest service so 
that insofar as the ordinance relates to the timber and other forest 
products and the re­forestation of the timberland portions indicated in 
Plan Ipd-92 including the powers, duties and responsibilities of the 
Manager-Administrator affecting the forestry portions are violative of 
Act No. 4041.
</p><p>
It is of no moment that at the pre-trial hearing of Civil Case No. 
SCC-648 (which was transferred to Branch III, CFI Dagupan and docketed 
as D-5118) the parties had admitted the legality of Ordinance No. 8.  
The issue as to the lega­lity of Ordinance No. 8 is not a question of 
fact that the parties may stipulate and agree at the pre-trial hearing 
of the case which is for annulment of the contract under Ordi­nance No. 
8.  Such is a question of law for if the Ordinance is illegal and 
contrary to law, the contract executed in pursuance thereto is 
consequently illegal.  Acts executed against the provisions of mandatory
 or prohibitory laws shall be void, except when the law itself 
authorizes their validity.  (Art. 5, New Civil Code).
</p><p>
From Our jurisprudence, We cite a number of cases ruling that a public 
bidding is essential to the validity of the grant of exclusive privilege
 of fishery to a private party, thus:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "The law (Sec. 2323 of the Revised Administrative Code) requires 
that when the exclusive privilege of fishery or the right to conduct a 
fish-breeding ground is granted to a private party, the same shall be 
let to the highest bidder in the same manner as is being done in 
exploiting a ferry, a market or a slaughterhouse belonging to the 
municipality (See Municipality of San Luis vs. Ventura, et al., 56 Phil.
 329).  The requirement of compe­titive bidding is for the purpose of 
inviting competition and to guard against favoritism, fraud and 
corruption in letting of fishery pri­vileges (See 3 McQuillin, Municipal
 Corporations, 2nd Ed., p. 1170; Harles Gaslight Co. vs. New York, 83 
N.Y. 309; and 2 Dillon, Municipal Cor­porations, p. 1219)" (San Diego 
vs. The Municipality of Naujan, Province of Mindoro, 107 Phil. 118). </p>
  <p> "It may thus be restated that the law that governs the award of 
fishery privileges in municipal waters is the provisions of Section 67 
and 69 of Act No. 4003, as amended by Commonwealth Acts Nos. 115 and 
471.  The provisions of Sections 2321, 2323 and 2319 of the Revised 
Administrative Code of 1917 have thereby been modified by Act 4003, as 
amended.  Under the applicable law the Municipal Council may lease 
fishery privileges for a period not exceeding five years to the highest 
bidder in a public bidding held, where the call for bid had specified 
the period for the lease." (San Buenaventura vs. Municipality of San 
Jose, Camarines Sur, et al., 121 Phil. 101, 114). </p>
  <p> "The Municipal Council cannot extend the period of lease once it 
had been fixed on the basis of the period provided in the call for bids.
  In the lease of fishery privileges for a period not exceeding five 
years the previous approval of the provincial Board is not neces­sary.  
If the lease is for a period of more than five years, but not exceeding 
ten years, the previous approval of the Provincial Board is necessary.  
If the lease is for a period exceeding ten years, but not more than 
twenty years, the prior approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and 
Natural Resources is necessary.  In all cases the lease must be based on
 a com­petitive public bidding." (San Buenaventura vs. Municipality of 
San Jose, Camarines Sur, et al., <em>supra</em>, p. 115). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
While the respondent appellate court in CA-G.R. No. 12586-SP made the pronouncement that:
</p><blockquote>
  <p> "Besides, Sec. 4, Act No. 4003 (which was then the law in force 
before being superseded by PD 704 on May 16, 1975) provides that an 
ordinance affecting fishing and fisheries 'shall have full force and 
effect unless notice in wri­ting of (its) disapproval is communicated by
 the Secretary to the Board of council concerned, within thirty days 
after submission of the ordinance.' The ordinance was submitted for 
approval on January 2, 1975 and the disapproval came only 102 days after
 such submission, on April 14, 1975.  Paragraph (a) of the pre-trial 
stipulation (Annex "6" of Respondent's Comment) states that 'the said 
ordinance was submitted to the then Secretary of Natural Resources who 
disapproved the ordinance, insofar as fishing and fisheries are 
concerned after 30 days from submission,'"
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
We cannot sustain the above holding in view of Our holding in the case of Nepomuceno, et al. vs. Ocampo, et al., <em>supra</em>,
 wherein We held that the only purpose in the enactment of Republic Act 
659 which required the Secretary of Agriculture and Natural Resources to
 approve municipal ordinances pertain­ing to fishing or fisheries within
 30 days after submission of the ordinance, rule or regulation is simply
 to expedite prompt action by the Department Chief concerned.  Since 
Ordi­nance No. 8 granted fishery privileges exclusively to the private 
respondent without benefit of public bidding and for a period exceeding 
five (5) years, the said ordinance and the contract of management 
executed in accordance therewith were null and void ab initio, such that
 the failure of the Secretary of Agriculture &amp; Natural Resources to 
disapprove the same within 30 days from its submission does not render 
validity to the illegal legislation of the municipal council nor to the 
contract executed under the same.
</p><p>
From the foregoing conclusion that the ordinance is illegal and void, 
per force the contract of management and administration between the 
Municipality and Lacuesta is likewise null and void.  It also follows 
that the complaint filed by Lacuesta for prohibition in Civil Case No. 
516 to enjoin the Municipal Council of Bayambang from leasing the 
Mangabul Fisheries upon public bidding as authorized in its Resolution 
No. 31, series of 1977 is without legal basis and merit for Lacuesta has
 no right or interest under the void ordinance and contract.  The suit 
must be dismissed and We hereby order its immediate dismissal.
</p><blockquote>
  <p> 2. We have noted earlier the death of Lacuesta in Our Resolution 
of July 2, 1984.  His death is an irreversible fact that throws an 
entirely new bearing on the legal con­troversy at hand.  For 
essentially, the contract of manage­ment and administration between the 
Municipality and Lacuesta is one of agency whereby a person binds 
himself to render some service or to do something in representation or 
on behalf of another, with the consent or authority of the latter.  
(Article 1868, New Civil Code).  Here in the case at bar, Lacuesta bound
 himself as Manager-Administrator of the Bayam­bang Fishing &amp; 
Hunting Park and Municipal Watershed to render service or perform duties
 and responsibilities in representation or on behalf of the Municipality
 of Bayambang, with the consent or authority of the latter pursuant to 
Ordinance No. 8.  Under Article 1919, New Civil Code, agency is 
extin­guished by the death of the agent.  His rights and obligations 
arising from the contract are not transmittable to his heirs.  (Art. 
1311, New Civil Code). </p>
  <p> 3. Petitioners in both cases before Us, G.R. No. 58794 and G.R. 
No. 64489, anchor their claims to certain portions of the Mangabul 
Fisheries which they allege to have won in public bidding under the 
authority of Resolution No. 31, se­ries of 1977 of the Municipal Council
 of Bayambang which leased the fisheries for a four-year period.  The 
period has already lapsed, hence their fishing privilege is no longer 
effective as of June 30, 1981.  To restore and place peti­tioners in 
possession of the fisheries would be an extension of their four-year 
period lease which is not authorized under the ordinance cited above. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nonetheless, the assailed order of Judge Villalon dated September 3, 
1983 restoring possession of the fishe­ries to Lacuesta and his men 
which was issued after her relief from the case upon her own request is 
clearly irre­gular and without authority.  There should be and there 
ought to be full obedience and compliance by a subordinate court of the 
orders and resolutions of this Court.  There cannot be any iota of 
discipline much less efficiency in the administration of justice if the 
lower echelons in the judicial heirarchy can freely act as they wish 
inspite of their relief.  This should be a stern warning to all judges 
and personnel in all the courts.
</p><p>
We brush aside the procedural aspects raised in the petitions before Us 
and in the interest of public welfare and speedy administration of 
justice, avoiding further multiplicity of suits, We consider the 
intrinsic merits of the controversy which as We pointed out previously, 
rest on the validity of the Municipal Ordinance in question.  Thus, in 
sum and substance, We hereby pronounce the nullity of Ordinance No. 8, 
series of 1974 of the Municipal Council of Bayambang, Pangasinan and the
 contract of management and supervision executed between the 
Municipality of Bayambang and Geruncio Lacuesta as Manager-Administrator
 of the Ba­yambang Fishery &amp; Hunting Park and Municipal Watershed.
</p><p>
Since Ordinance No. 8 and the contract of management and supervision are
 both null and void, the Alias Writ of Execution and Possession dated 
November 6, 1981 and the Order of October 8, 1982 for the issuance of 
writ of execu­tion and possession to place and restore possession of the
 Mangabul Fisheries, of portions thereof or fisheries therein to 
Geruncio Lacuesta, his agents, men and/or representatives under the said
 contract and by virtue of the ordinance are, including the writ also 
issued on October 8, 1982, without legal force and effect.
</p><p>
WHEREFORE, IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the Alias Writ of Execution and
 Possession issued November 6, 1981 and assailed in G.R. No. 58794, as 
well as the Order and Writ dated October 8, 1982 raised in G.R. No. 
64489, are hereby NULLIFIED and SET ASIDE.  No costs.
