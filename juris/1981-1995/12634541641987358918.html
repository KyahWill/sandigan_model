				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Complainant imputed gross malpractice to respondent Salvador P.
de Guzman, Jr., a member of the Philippine Bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was accused of taking advantage of the "innocence and trusting
nature of the complainant after grossly violating the warranty aspect of a
sales contract which he entered into with the complainant * * * even [going] to
the extent of harassing her, attaching and levying her properties [purportedly]
to enforce no less than thirty six thousand pesos claim allegedly by reason of
the complainant's violation of a lease agreement with him * * * but which
respondent very well knew to be entirely worthless by reason of the sales
agreement which he him­self has caused to be executed in favor of the herein
complainant as evidenced by Annex A ? thus performing acts which should
not be tolerated and does not speak well of a member of the Philippine Bar and
[demonstrating that] he is unfit to be a member thereof."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Respondent was required to answer by this Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He alleged in such pleading that his
participation in the transaction wherein his wife, Mrs. Esperanza de Guzman,
subleased the premises in question to the complainant was limited to preparing
the contract of sublease; that he was not a party to the transaction wherein
his wife executed an absolute deed of sale of the restaurant business, located
in the same premises, in favor of the complainant; that the levy on
complainant's properties was valid in all aspects, being in accordance with a
writ of execution pursuant to a judgment by default issued by the City Court of
Manila in Civil Case No. 229743 thereof which ordered the defendant
(herein-complainant) to vacate and surrender the premises and to pay certain
obligations including the P1,000.00 balance of the sale of the goodwill and
equipment of the restaurant business in accordance with the <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>
deed of sale, P600 rental for August 1973 and P100 daily rental starting
September 5, 1973 until such time as the property was vacated; that
complainant's petition for <i>certiorari</i> with the Manila Court of First
Instance under Civil Case No. 93714 assailing the default judgment was denied;
that this denial was appealed to the Court of Appeals with the prayer for the
issuance of a writ of preliminary injunction but that said writ was likewise
denied by the Court which properly noted that the remedy availed of by herein complainant
should have been an appeal from the decision of the lower court and not a
petition for <i>certiorari</i>; and that, therefore, the present complaint was
devoid of any basis in fact or in law.</p>

<p class="BODY">The matter was then referred by this Court to the Office of the
Solicitor General for investigation, report and recommendation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
Both complainant and respondent testified and submitted evidence in support of
their respective contentions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
findings of fact on the whole sustained the claim of respondent about the absence
of any gross malpractice on his part.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the question of whether or not respondent was a party to any
of the contracts executed by the complainant and the wife of the respondent,
the Report reads: "In the contract of sale of the restaurant business (<span class="SpellE">Exh.'B</span>'), the warranty of which was adverted to by the
complainant to have been allegedly violated by the respondent, it needs be
established at the outset if, indeed, the respondent was a party thereto or had
any participation in it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The questioned
document glaringly negates respondent's alleged execution thereof.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was not a party to it and his only
participation therein was the affixing of his signature to indicate his marital
consent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The subjects treated in the
sales contract are matters purely between the parties thereto, of whom the
respondent was not one.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under these
facts, the determination of any violation of whatever warranty there was,
becomes futile.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And even granting <span class="SpellE"><u>arguendo</u></span> that the respondent was a party to the
contract, complainant had not substantiated, nay, proven her insistence that
the respondent violated the warranty thereof."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
Neither was complainant sustained in her assertion that in the levy on her
properties arising from the writ of execution there was either fraud or harassment
exercised upon her by complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>So it
was pointed out in this portion of the Report: "It bears restating that
the levy on the properties of the complainant and the auction thereof was made
pursuant to the writ of execution issued upon a judgment of default.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such writ was duly enforced only after the
complainant had unsuccessfully resorted to the numerous legal remedies she
availed of.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>These were the motion to
lift the order of default, motion for reconsideration of the order denying the
first motion before the city court, the petition for <i>certio­rari</i> in the
court of first instance attacking the judgment by default and the appeal to the
Court of Appeals of the judgment dismissing the petition for <i>certiorari</i>,
all of which were consistently found against the complainant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no denying the conclusion,
therefore, that the levy was valid and legal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such levy, by whatever valuation given to it, cannot amount to a fraud
of the complainant or a harassment upon her, as she had unduly claimed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The contention of the complainant in support
of her allegation of fraud, namely that the respondent caused the execution of
the sublease agreement which he knew to have been rendered worthless by the
subsequent execution of the sales contract, must fail."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The conclusion in such Report is to this effect: "It having
been shown that the respondent had not violated the warranty of the sales
contract as in fact he was not a party thereto, and further that the levy on
and auction of complainant's properties legally proceeded from a writ of
execution pursuant to a final judgment thereby obliterating any claim of fraud
or harassment upon the complainant, there remains only the conclusion that the
respondent had not committed gross malpractice in the incidents complained of."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The recommendation is for the dismissal of the complaint for lack
of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of the fore­going,
that was to be expected.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An excerpt from
In re <span class="SpellE">Tionko</span>,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
sets forth the authoritative doctrine.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus: "The serious consequences of disbarment or suspension should
follow only when there is a clear preponderance of evidence against the
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The presumption is that the
attorney is innocent of the charges preferred and has performed his duty as an
officer of the court in accordance with his oath."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a>
It cannot be said that there was such clear preponderance of evidence against
respondent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the evidence
militated against the claim of petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Nonetheless, it can be said that respondent ought to have shown greater
awareness of the fact that his wife having been a party to the contract, the
utmost prudence on his part is required.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>That would have obviated any suspicion that he took advantage of his
membership in the bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What removes the
sting from this accusation is, as pointed out in the Report and Recommendation,
"that complainant's cause had been continuously handled by a succession of
six lawyers."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a>
Any assertion, therefore, to the effect that he took advantage of his knowledge
as a lawyer is rendered implausible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also, as pointed out in the Report: "Moreover, no evidence had been
adduced by the complainant to substantiate her claim."<a style="mso-footnote-id:
