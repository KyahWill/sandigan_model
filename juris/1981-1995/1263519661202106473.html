				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">This case is about the alleged right of a landowner, whose
expropriated land had ceased to be devoted to public use, to repurchase it at a
negotiated sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Simeon <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span> in 1941 sold to the
National Power Corporation for P<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">1</span><span class="GramE">,470</span> his land, with an area of 1,129 square meters, located
at <span class="SpellE">Alabang</span>, <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, to be used for the construction of its <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">transmission lines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">On December<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt"> </span>6, 1979
(when the land was allegedly <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">no longer </span>being
used for a public purpose), <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span> filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a complaint in the Court of First </span>Instance
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> to
compel the NPC to resell the land to him in a negotiated sale, instead of
through public bidding, as contemplated in its board resolution No. 142, series
of 1979.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The NPC filed a motion to dismiss the case for lack of cause of
action. The lower court dismissed it because there was no showing that the NPC
had violated any right of <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>. He appealed to
this Court. He contends that his action is based on equitable principles.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Commission on Audit in a letter dated June 4, 1980 invited
the attention of the NPC to section 79 of the Government Auditing Code,
Presidential Decree No. 1445, which provides that unserviceable government
property should be disposed of by public bidding and may be sold at a private
sale only when public bidding fails (p. 73, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the NPC President apprised the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">National Power Board </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">in his letter of November 17, 1980 that <span class="SpellE">Nobleza's</span> land was being utilized as right-of-way of the
then existing 115 KV <span class="SpellE">Caliraya-Sucat</span> line which was
scheduled to be replaced with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">double circuit 230 KV <span class="SpellE">Bi√±an-Sucat</span>
line (p. 76, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, the NPC in Resolution No. 199, series of 1980, revoked
its Resolution No. 79 dated <st1:date year="1980" day="12" month="5">May 12,
 1980</st1:date>, authorizing the resale of the land to <span class="SpellE">Nobleza</span>
(p. 77, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Nobleza's</span> counsel was asked to comment
on the opinion of the auditor and on the said revocation in this Court's
resolution of <st1:date year="1982" day="25" month="10">October 25, 1982</st1:date>.
Up to this time, he has not submitted his comment.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE,</b> the lower court's order of dismissal is
affirmed. No costs.</p>

<p class="SOORDERED"><span class="GramE">SO ORDERED.</span></p>
