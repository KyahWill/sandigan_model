JULIAN B. POGOY, MUNICIPAL/CITY TRIAL COURT OF CEBU CITY, AND ATTY. RICARDO
REYES, RESPONDENTS.
<br /><br />D E C I S I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner herein seeks to stop respondent Judge Julian B. Pogoy
of the Municipal Trial Court of Cebu City from taking cognizance of an ejectment
suit for failure of the plaintiff to refer the dispute to the Barangay Lupon <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">for </span>conciliation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The intestate estate of the late Vito Borromeo is the owner of a
building bearing the deceased's name, located at F. Ramos St., Cebu City.  Said building has been leased and occupied
by petitioner Petra Vda. de Borromeo at a monthly rental of P500.00 payable in
advance within the first five days of the month. </p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On August 28, 1982,
private respondent Atty. Ricardo Reyes, administrator of the estate and a resident
of Cebu City, served upon petitioner a letter demanding that she pay the over­due
rentals corresponding to the period from March to September 1982, and
thereafter to vacate the premises.  As
petitioner failed to do so, Atty. Reyes instituted on September 16, 1982 an
ejectment case against the former in the Munici­pal Trial Court of Cebu
City.  The complaint was docketed as </span>Civil
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Case No. R-23915 and assigned to the
sala of respondent judge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">On November 12, 1982,
petitioner moved to dismiss the case, advancing, among others, the want of
jurisdiction of the trial court.  Pointing out that the parties are residents of the same city, as alleged
in the complaint, petitioner con­tended that the court could not exercise
jurisdic­tion over the case for failure of respondent Atty. Reyes to refer the
dispute to the Barangay Court, as required by PD No. </span>1508, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">otherwise known as Katarungang Pambarangay
Law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Respondent judge denied
the motion to dismiss.  He justified the
order in this wise:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"The Clerk of Court when this case was filed accepted for
filing same.  That from the acceptance
from (sic) filing, with the plaintiff having paid the docket fee to show that
the case was docketed in the civil division of this court could be considered
as meeting the requirement or pre­condition for were it not so, the Clerk of
Court would not have accepted the filing of the case especially that there is a
standing circular from the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court without even
mentioning the Letter of Instruction of the President of the Philippines that
civil cases and criminal cases with certain exceptions must not be filed
without passing the barangay court." (Order dated Decem­ber 14, 1982,
Annex "c", P. 13, Rollo).</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Unable to secure a reconsideration of said order, petitioner came
to this Court through <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">this </span>petition
for <i>certiorari</i>.  In both his
comment and memorandum, private respondent admitted not having availed himself
of the barangay conciliation pro­cess, but justified such omission by citing
para­graph 4, section 6 of PD 1508 which allows the direct filing of an action
in court where the same may otherwise be barred by the Statute of Limitations,
as applying to the case at bar.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The excuse advanced by
private respondent is unsatisfactory.  Under Article 1147 of the Civil Code, the period for filing actions for
forcible entry and detainer is one year,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> and this period is counted from demand to
vacate the premises.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn2" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In the case at bar, the
letter-demand was dated August 28, 1982, while the complaint for ejectment was
filed in court on September 16, 1982.  Between these two dates, less than a month had elapsed, thereby leaving
at least eleven (11) full months of the prescriptive period provided for in
Article 1147 of the Civil Code.  Under
the pro­cedure outlined in Section 4 </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">PD 1508,</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn3" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> the time needed for the conciliation
proceeding before the Barangay Chairman and the Pangkat should take no</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> m</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">ore
than 60 days.  Giving private respondent
nine (9) months - ample time indeed - within which to bring his case before the
proper court should conciliation efforts fail.  Thus, it cannot be truthfully asserted, as private res­pondent would
want Us to believe, that his case would be barred by the Statute of Limitations
if he had to course his action to the Barangay Lupon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">With certain exceptions,
PD 1508 makes the conciliation process at the Barangay level a con­dition
precedent for filing of actions in those instances where said law applies.  For this reason, Circular No. 22 addressed
to "ALL JUDGES OF THE COURTS OF FIRST INSTANCE, CIRCUIT CRIMINAL COURTS,
JUVENILE AND DOMESTIC RELATIONS COURT, COURTS OF AGRARIAN RELATIONS, CITY
COURTS, MUNICIPAL COURTS AND THEIR CLERKS OF COURT" was issued by Chief
Justice Enrique M. Fernando on November 9, 1979.  Said Circular reads:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Effective upon your receipt<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>of
the certification by the Minister of Local Government and Community Development
that all the barangays within your respective jurisdictions have organized
their <u>Lupons</u> provided for in Presidential Decree No. 1508, otherwise known
as the <u>Katarungang Pambarangay</u> Law, in implementation of the barangay
system of settlement of disputes, you are hereby directed to desist from
receiving complaints, petitions, actions or proceedings in cases falling within
the authority of said <u>Lupons</u>."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">While respondent
acknowledged said Circular in his order of December 14, 1982, he nevertheless
chose to overlook the failure of the complaint in Civil Case No. R-23915 to
allege compliance with the requirement of PD 1508.  Neither did he cite any circumstance as would place the suit
outside the operation of said law.  Instead, he insisted on relying upon the <u>pro</u> <u>tanto</u>
presumption of regu­larity </span>in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the
performance by the clerk of court of his official duty, which to Our mind has
been su­</span>ficiently <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">overcome by
the disclosure by the Clerk of Court that there was no certification to file
action from the Lupon or Pangkat secretary attached to the complaint.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn4" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Be that as it may, the
instant petition should be dismissed.  Under Section 4(a) of PD No. 1508, referral of a dispute to the Barangay
Lupon is required only where the parties thereto are
"individuals".  An
"individual" means "a single human being as contrasted with a
social group or institution."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn5" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> Obviously, the law applies only to cases
involving natural persons, and not where any of the parties is a juridical
person such as </span>a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">corporation,
partnership, cor­poration sole, testate or intestate, estate, etc.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">In </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Civil Case No. R-23915, plaintiff Ricardo
Reyes </span>is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">a mere nominal party

the Rules of Court allows the adminis­trator of an estate to sue or be sued
without joining the party for whose benefit the action is presented or
defended, it is indisputable that the real party in interest in Civil Case No.
R-23915 is the intestate estate under administration.  Since the said estate is a juridical person</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
