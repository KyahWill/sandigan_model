this Court rendered judgment in this case, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, THE WRIT OF <i>CERTIORARI</i> IS HEREBY GRANTED,

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date month="8" day="6" year="1981">August 6, 1981</st1:date>,
the <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">D.
</span><span class="SpellE">Menzon</span> Law Office, petitioner's counsel, filed
a notice of attorney's lien which was noted by this Court in the resolution of <st1:date month="8" day="24" year="1983">August 24, 1983</st1:date> (pp. 209-212, rec.).
Subsequently, the said law office filed a motion to declare in contempt the <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> Pilipino Philippine <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Apparel </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Workers Union
(BPPAWU, for short) and its officers and counsel, Atty. Luis D. Flores,
alleging that said union and its counsel, who are not parties in interest in
this <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">case, </span>have caused to be
circulated a "<span class="SpellE">Kapahintulutan</span>", authorizing
BPPAWU </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">and </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Atty. Flores to "have a hand in the
'negotiation' for the payment of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> to members
of the union" under the decision of this Court on July 31, 1981; that
contrary to public policy, and illegally, the BPPAWU agreed with respondent
company to have the first </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">year's
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">wage increase under the
collective bargaining agreement in the amount of P2.00 fully</span> credited
against the P2.00 living allowance under Wage Order No. 1; and that considering
the conduct of the BPPAWU, it is not remote that the P0.80 daily wage increase
ordered by this Court to be paid by respondent company (PAI) to the workers
will be negotiated away or greatly reduced (p. 213, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In the meanwhile, a
motion for reconsideration </span>of the decision of this Court on <st1:date month="7" day="31" year="1981">July 31, 1981</st1:date> was filed by private
respondent (p. 218, rec.). Petitioner, through the <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span>
D. <span class="SpellE">Menzon</span> Law Office, filed a comment thereon (p.
229, rec.). This Court, on <st1:date month="10" day="21" year="1981">October
 21, 1981</st1:date> denied the aforesaid motion for reconsideration and the
denial was declared final. Entry of judgment was made <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

</span>and Employment, in an order dated December 12, 1980, as the sole and
exclusive bargaining agent of all the regular rank and file workers of the

on December 6, 1980; that members of petitioner applied for membership with the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">BPPAWU; </span>that as members, they
authorized the BPPAWU to represent them and execute the deci<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">s</span>ion of this Court; that the

Court to be paid by respondent company will be negotiated away by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">BPPAWU </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

untenable; that the authority </span>granted <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

record in this case and the fact that the workers are now members of the

collective bargaining agreement concluded by the BPPAWU with respondent company
that the amount of P2.00 wage increase for the first year be fully credited
against the P2.00 emergency living allowance under Wage Order No. 1 is against
public policy is a gross misrepresentation because at the time when the collective
bargaining negotiations were going on which resulted in the signing of </span>the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">new collective bargaining agreement on
June 25, 1981, the </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">decision </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">of this Court has not yet been </span>promulgated

(p. 245, rec.).</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Petitioner, in its reply
dated January 6, 1982 to the foregoing comment, claims that the <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Menzon</span> Law Office has
always been the counsel of petitioner union from the time the instant case was </span>filed
in the Ministry of Labor and Employment up to the present, so that it follows
that execution of the decision should be handled by it; and that the services
of petitioner's counsel have not been terminated (p. 257, rec.).<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Notably, in addition to the foregoing, petitioner alleges that
the officers and board members of BPPAWU have caused the printing of a special
check-off authorization which purportedly allows the paymaster of the
Philippine Apparel, Inc. and/or the deputy sheriff of the National Labor
Relations Commission to check off from the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
of the employees in the instant case "the amount of P____ as special
assessment for legal expenses and to remit the same to the Treasurer of the <span class="SpellE">Bagong</span> Pilipino Philippine Apparel Workers Union or its
duly authorized representative to receive said amount." Petitioner prays
that a temporary restraining order be issued in this case enjoining the
officers and counsel of the BPPAWU and the NLRC from collecting and/or
deducting any special assessment for legal expenses.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Petitioner also filed an
urgent manifestation and motion dated January 10, 1983 claiming that despite
the filing by petitioner of a motion for execution dated November 12, 1981,
manifestation and motion dated February 10, 1982 and another manifesta</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">tion </span>and motion dated February 26,
1982 and an urgent motion for issuance of a writ of execution dated January 27,
1983, the execution arm of public respondent has still failed to implement the
decision of this Court; and that meanwhile, the President of the BPPAWU had
been spreading rumors <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">that </span>members
of petitioner cannot get the P0.80 daily wage increase awarded by this Court
and encouraging members to receive a mere P<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

represents a full settlement of their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>, etc.
in contravention <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">of </span>the final
decision of this Court. Petitioner prays that public respondent be ordered to

prayer that Rafael <span class="SpellE">Damicog</span>, the President of the
BPPAWU, and its lawyer, Atty. Luis <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> Flores, be
declared in contempt on the alleged ground that during a general meeting of the
employees on January 28, 1982, <span class="SpellE">Damicog</span> and Flores
told the employees involved in the decision that they could be paid the amount
of P300.00 the following day if they will just agree that the same shall be

company by virtue of their withdrawal <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span> and
subsequent membership with the BPPAWU; the special assessment for legal
expenses was in accordance with the Union's Constitution and By-Laws; that at

respondent company took issue with the validity of the findings herein

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">The judgment in this case
has already become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> and as such
the prevailing party as a matter of right is entitled to a writ of execution.
What seems to be the problem in this case is that execution of the judgment
cannot be had at the earliest possible time, since a computation of the amount
due the members of petitioner must first be undertaken. The Report of the </span>Examiner
indicating the amount due them was submitted only after one and a half years,
so that in the meantime, negotiations on how the judgment maybe executed were
made. It is the posture of the <span class="SpellE">Paterno</span> D. <span class="SpellE">Menzon</span> Law Office that the judgment cannot be <span class="GramE">negotiated,</span> hence any act to subvert it is contemptuous.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">We agree. The attempts of
the BPPAWU and its counsel and respondent company to render the decision of
this Court meaningless by paying the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> of the
affected employees in a lesser amount clearly manifest a willful disregard on
their part, of the </span>authority of this Court as the final arbiter of cases
brought to <span class="GramE">It</span>. The series of acts by the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">BPPAWU </span>from the outset, where they
caused the "<span class="SpellE">Kapahintulutan</span>" to be
circulated and signed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>workers
declaring <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as </span>invalid any acts of
petitioner union and its counsel to the time they campaigned for the workers to
receive the amount of P300.00 or P500.00 but with the concomitant obligation to
release the company from any further liability showed disrespect for the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt"> administration of justice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The BPPAWU and its counsel cannot pretend that they are just
being more protective to the employees when they encouraged them to receive the
amount of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">P300.00 or P500.00. They know
too well that said amount is much less than that to be received </span>by <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the employees after computing all the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> if the decision is executed. It would have been
laudable had not the company pressed the workers to <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">sign </span>the quitclaims and release of which the BPPAWU cannot
pretend to be unaware, for the payment could be taken as</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">initial compliance with the judgment with the
balance to be paid by the company when the final computation of the <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> has been finished and submitted by the Research
and Informa</span>tion Division of the National Labor Relations <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Commission. Indeed, their questionable acts
do not sit well with a desire to implement the decision of </span>this Court.
If the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">BPPAWU </span>is really after
the welfare of the employees, they will not leave any stone unturned to<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"> </span>get the best for them <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">by </span>giving effect to the decision of
this Court.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">In Our decision, we have
ordered the company to pay the negotiated wage increase of P0.80 daily

gleaned from the urgent motion for issuance of a restraining order dated March
11, 1982, on <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> alone, not counting
adjustments in overtime pay and other benefits, each employee </span>is
entitled to receive at the very least P1<span class="GramE">,248.00</span> (P0.80
x 26 working days x 12 months x 5 years from <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the same will definitely be higher than P1<span class="GramE">,248.00</span>.
Clearly, the offer by the company, supported by the BPPAWU to pay the employees
in the amount of P300.00 or P500.00 as full and final payment is unjust to
them, especially if </span><span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">We</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">shall consider that some employees did not
have the alternative but to accept the payment because they were in a tight
financial condition. Such move cannot </span>be sanctioned by this Court, for
otherwise giving effect to the award of <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
would be left to the whim of the losing company taking advantage of the
financial condition of the workers. Following the rationale behind the decision
in Mercury Drug Co. v. CIR (L-23357, promulgated April 30, 1974, 56 SCRA 695),
the quitclaims and releases signed by the employees are considered null and
void. The employees are therefore still entitled to the difference between what
is due them and the amount <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">they
received. Another important consideration is that if <span class="GramE">We</span>
countenance such act, the sanctity of the contract validly entered into by the
parties which as in this case was interpreted by this Court, will be violated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">As regards the question

lies in the fact that there can be no valid substitution of counsel unless the
required procedure prescribed by Rule 138, Section 26 of the Revised Rules of
Court has been complied with. As underlined in the case of <span class="SpellE">Aban</span>
v. <span class="SpellE">Enage</span>, L-30666, promulgated on February 25, 1983,
"no substitution of attorney will be allowed unless the following
requisites concur: (1) there must be filed a written application for
substitution; (2) there must be filed the written consent of the client to the
substitution; (3) there must be filed the written consent of the attorney to be
substituted, if such consent can be obtained; and (4) in case such written
consent cannot be procured, there must be filed with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the application for substitution, proof of
the service of notice of such motion in the manner required </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">by </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
