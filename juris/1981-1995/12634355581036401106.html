<p class="BODY">In G.R. No. 90643, the accused appeals from the decision of

Leovegildo Garra and Celso Gardon, the Barangay Captain of Naburacan, Matnog,
Sorsogon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 25 January 1989, the trial court promulgated its decision

court.  The following day, 26 January
1989, the trial court gave due course to the appeal<a style="mso-footnote-id:

but did not resolve the request to fix the amount of bail.  Thus, on 11 April 1989, the accused filed an
"Application for Bail on Appeal"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a>
reiterating his earlier request that the bail bond for his provisional liberty
pending appeal be set.  This was
subsequently denied by the trial court in its Order of 19 June 1989 on the
ground that "x x x the accused has already been found guilty beyond
reasonable doubt of the offense of rape and sentenced to Reclusion Perpetua and
his appeal from the decision already approved by the Court x x x.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="OTHERHEADING"><u>G.R.</u> <u>No.</u> <u>91155</u></p>

<p class="BODY">We shall first resolve G.R. No. 91155.  Accused assails the trial court's refusal to grant his
application for bail pending appeal on the ground that the same amounted to an
undue denial of his constitutional right to bail.  He contends that before his conviction by final judgment, he
enjoys the constitutional presumption of innocence, and is therefore entitled
to bail as a matter of right.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit in the said petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from Section 13, Article III of the 1987 Constitution<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn23" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
and Section 3, Rule 114 of the Revised Rules of Court, as amended,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn24" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"x </span>x x before
conviction bail is either a matter of right or of discretion.  It is a matter of right when the offense
charged is punishable by any penalty lower than <i>reclusion </i><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">perpetua</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<blockquote>x  x  x</blockquote>

<blockquote>Upon the other hand, if the offense charged is punishable by <i>reclusion
perpetua</i> bail becomes a matter of discretion.  It shall be denied if the evidence of guilt is strong.  The court's discretion is limited to
determining whether or not evidence of guilt is strong.  But once it is determined that the evidence
of guilt is not strong, bail also becomes a matter of right.  x x x”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn25" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The clear implication, therefore, is that if an accused who is
charged with a crime punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> is convicted by
the trial court and sentenced to suffer such a penalty, bail is neither a
matter of right on the part of the accused nor of discretion on the part of the
court.  In such a situation, the court
would not have only determined that the evidence of guilt is strong -- which
would have been sufficient to deny bail even before conviction -- it would have
likewise ruled that the accused's guilt has been proven beyond reasonable
doubt.  Bail must not then be granted to
the accused during the pendency of his appeal from the judgment of
conviction.  Construing Section 3, Rule
114 of the 1985 Rules on Criminal Procedure, as amended, this Court, in the <i>en
banc</i> Resolution of 15 October 1991 in <i>People vs. Ricardo Cortez,</i><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn26" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a>
ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>"Pursuant to the aforecited provision, an accused who is
charged with a capital offense or an offense punishable by <i>reclusion
perpetua,</i> shall no longer be entitled to bail as a matter of right even if
he appeals the case to this Court since his conviction clearly imports that the
evidence of his guilt of the offense charged is strong."<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the rape for which the accused was indicted
is punishable by <i>reclusion perpetua</i> pursuant to Article 335 of the
Revised Penal Code; he was convicted therefor and subsequently sentenced to serve
that penalty.  It is thus evident that
the trial court correctly denied his application for bail during the pendency
of the appeal.</p>

<p class="BODY">The inculpatory facts, proven by the prosecution and upon which
the trial court based its judgment of conviction, are summarized by the trial

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">"(3)   </span>The evidence for the prosecution shows that in the morning
of 26 November 1983, Merelyn Gine accompanied her father Agripino Gine to
Barangay Naburacan, Matnog, Sorsogon, where he was going to work in the farm of
Patrolman Nonito Galeria.  Her father
left her in the nipa hut of one Leovegildo Garra so she can cook his meal for
lunch.  She was alone in the hut.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(4)  While she was preparing to cook the meal,
accused appeared from nowhere and inserted his T-shirt inside her mouth.  Accused also held her hands and tore her
pedal pant (sic).  She tried to kick him
but to no avail.  After he was able to
remove her pedal, she <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">was </span>threatened
with a bolo and was warned that he will kill her if she shouted.  The bolo which was presented in evidence as
Exhbit C <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">(sic) </span>was 23½ inches
long including the handle.  The sharp
end of the bolo was pointed by the accused to her throat.  Accused laid her down and it was in this
position when (sic) the accused had sexually abused her by inserting his penis
through her <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt">(sic) </span>panty she was
wearing which was torn and stained with her blood (Exhibits B, B1 and B2).  She suffered extreme pain and her vagina
started bleeding.  She cried and wished
that her father were around so that she could ask him to kill the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(5)  Just as the accused consummated the rape,
her father returned from the farm to inquire whether his meal was cooked
already.  He called for his daughter but
she did not answer during the first call and on the second call he heard her
answer 'po' (meaning yes).  Suddenly,
the accused jumped out of the window with his short pants on but leaving behind
in his hurry to escape, the T-shirt which he inserted inside the mouth of the
victim and the bolo he used to threaten her.  Her father gave chase but was not able to catch up with the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(6)  When her father went inside the hut, he
found her in a state of shock and (sic) was trying to get up but was swaying
for she could hardly stand.  It was at
this instance when his daughter narrated to him the dastardly act perpetrated
upon her by the accused.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(7)  On the same day, she and her father reported
the incident to the police authorities in Matnog, Sorsogon, and an
investigation was made.  On that same
day, the accused was apprehended.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(8)  From the police, she went to the Irosin
District Hospital for medical examination.  Thereat, she was subjected to a medical examination by a certain Dr.
Tito Garrido but he did not issue her a medical certificate.  So she had another medical examination by
Dr. Eddie Dorotan of the same hospital who issued her a medical certificate
which was introduced in evidence as Exhibit E and E1.</blockquote>

<blockquote>(9)  At the time she was sexually abused,
Merelyn Gine was only 13 years old (Exhibit D).  She demonstrated to the Court the position in which she was raped
by the accused.  She felt so ashamed
after the rape and underwent so much suffering and pain like her father, which
could not be compensated with money alone and wants justice done.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn27" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Fortes on his way to the Nipa Hut which he used as a rest house met Agripino

Matnog,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> </span>Sorsogon where they both
work and cultivate their respective ricelands.  In that meeting Agripino asked permission from accused if her (sic)

dialect), owned by the grandfather of accused Leovegeldo (sic) Garra.  Accused who is a neighbor and family friend
of Agripino (sic) in Bgy. Camachilis where they both reside gave his
permission.  Accused proceeded to the
Nipa Hut owned by his grandfather for the purpose of preparing his own
lunch.  When accused arrived in the Nipa
Hut, he saw Merelyn preparing their lunch.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Accused waited for his turn while Merelyn was preparing their
lunch.  Accused spent his waiting time
in repairing the plow (araro) which he used in the cultivation of the
riceland.  At this point in time his
grandfather Leovegeldo (sic) Garra arrived.  Merelyn Gine and accused who are known to each other being neighbors and
family friends exchanged pleasanties (sic) and jokes.  In the process, accused accidentally dropped the fish which he was
about to cook for lunch outside the window.  Accused passed through the window which is about half (½) meter from the
ground to pick-up the fish.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">To bolster his defense, the accused presented two (2) other
witnesses, namely Leovegildo Garra, his grandfather, and Celso Gardon, the
Barangay Captain of Naburacan, Matnog.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court accorded full faith and credit to the
prosecution's version; it was convinced beyond reasonable doubt that Merelyn
fell victim to a sexual assault on the morning of 26 November 1983 which was
perpetrated through force and intimidation.  On that same day, both she and her father immediately reported the
incident to the police authorities.  She
then submitted to a medical examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">There seems to be no logical reason for her or her father to
concoct the charge of rape against the accused.  During her testimony, Merelyn "showed an unmistakable
determination to exact justice, from the man who had forcibly violated her and
caused her early loss of virginity." She "has no motive other than to
bring to justice the culprit who had grievously wronged her."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn29" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">In his Brief, the accused, hereinafter referred to as the
Appellant, urges this Court to reverse his conviction and acquit him on the
ground that the trial court erred in:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">"I</span>  x x x GIVING UNDUE WEIGHT TO THE UNCORROBORATED TESTIMONY OF

<p class="BODY">For his first assigned error, the appellant contends that the
rape for which he was charged and subsequently convicted was not established by
clear, positive and convincing evidence.  He claims that the complainant's statement that she had her panty on
while she was being raped is incredible, as "[E]xperience will show that
it is physically [I]mpossible to perform and execute the act of sexual intercourse
to a woman with her panty on."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In support of the second assigned error, he asserts that the
medical examination conducted by Dr. Eddie Dorotan, a government physician
assigned to the Irosin District Hospital, which revealed that "there was
no bleeding" and "no spermatozoa"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
present, conclusively proved that the accused did not commit the crime of
rape.  The latter further contends that
the trial court erred in believing the complainant's declaration that her panty
was stained with her blood because, as he points out, there was no
"coroborated (sic) evidence to prove that indeed the alleged blood stain
is indeed the blood coming from the vagina of complainant.”<a style="mso-footnote-id:

12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As to his third ascribed error, the appellant faults the trial
court for not giving due weight to the testimony of the Barangay Captain of the
locality wherein the rape was committed.  He further contends that since Barangay Captain Celso Gardon testified
that he (Gardon) passed by the nipa hut and saw the complainant and her father
Agripino together with other persons at around lunch time -- the time of the
commission of the alleged rape -- Agripino should have immediately reported the
sexual assault to him as he is the barangay captain.</p>

<p class="BODY">The appellant additionally assails the credibility of Agripino
Gine, claiming that the latter failed to corroborate his daughter's story that
there was blood on the spot where she was purportedly raped and that her panty
and pants were torn by the appellant.  Moreover, it is averred that Agripino did not even describe to the court
his daughter's attire when he found her in the nipa hut.  Appellant then faults the trial court for
concluding that he had presented the defense of alibi when the records reveal
that no such defense was offered by him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's last assigned error is but a summation of the
previous three (3) errors; he concludes that the totality of the prosecution's
evidence creates sufficient doubt as to his guilt.  Hence, he concludes that he is entitled to an acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">Our careful review of the records and painstaking evaluation of
the evidence adduced by the parties yield nothing to support the assigned
errors, and lead Us to the inevitable conclusion that the culpability of the
appellant has been proven beyond reasonable doubt.  This appeal must therefore be dismissed for palpable lack of
merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">The victim narrated her ordeal in a simple, yet candid and
straightforward manner as evidenced by the transcripts of her testimony, the

thus decided to report the incident to the police authorities immediately.  Thus, both he and Merelyn proceeded to the

<p class="BODY">From Merelyn's testimony, it is evident that the appellant had
carnal knowledge of her through force and intimidation.  He gagged her first with a t-shirt and then
forced her into the sexual act by threatening to kill her with his bolo.  Her testimony on this point was even further
strengthened and enhanced when, during cross-examination, counsel for the
appellant gambled on the fate of the latter by asking Merelyn to show how the
rape was committed.  Merelyn then
demonstrated how the appellant gripped her hands and pointed the bolo to her
neck.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">As to the alleged impossibility of the commission of the sexual
act because of the fact that Merelyn's panty was not actually removed, the
appellant seems to have forgotten that it was he, through the cross-examination
of his lawyer, who elicited from Merelyn the declaration that his penis was
inserted through a hole in the said panty.  Thus:<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither may the medical certificate (Exhibit "E")
issued by Dr. Eddie Dorotan be of any help to the appellant.  The said certificate does not, contrary to
the latter's claim, prove that Merelyn did not have sexual intercourse because
of the findings therein reported that there was no bleeding, the vagina
admitted two (2) fingers and the vaginal fluid contained no spermatozoa.  Again, the appellant conveniently forgot
that Dr. Dorotan examined Merelyn only on 28 November 1983 at 9:45 o'clock in
the morning,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn40" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a>
or two (2) days after the incident.  By
that time, the bleeding, which had taken place earlier, may no longer have been
noticeable and the spermatozoa may no longer have been present.  It is settled that the absence of
spermatozoa does not disprove the consummation of rape.  The important consideration is not the
emission of semen, but the penetration by the male organ.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn41" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
It must likewise be emphasized that Dr. Tito Garrido of the District Hospital
of Irosin, the physician who examined Merelyn in the afternoon of 26 November
1983, did not issue a medical certificate, although he promised to deliver one
to Matnog.  It has been shown that Dr.
Garrido reneged on this pledge.  Furthermore, during trial, complainant's father claimed that he had
later learned that Dr. Garrido is related to the appellant.<a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn42" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
This assertion was not even rebutted by the defense.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moving on, this Court is not persuaded by the appellant's
contention that if Merelyn had in fact been raped, then either she or her
father should have first informed the barangay captain about the incident.  Suffice it to say, reporting the commission
of a crime to a barangay captain is not a prerequisite for the formal
institution of criminal charges.  Even
under P.D. No. 1508, the governing law then, rape was not among the crimes
which required referral to the Barangay Lupon for the purpose of seeking an
amicable settlement.  As a matter of
fact, it was among those excepted from such a referral considering that the
penalty imposable is more than thirty (30) days imprisonment.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn43" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
If the complainant and her father seemed to have "by-passed" the
barangay captain and instead reported the incident directly to the police, it
is quite obvious that they wanted immediate action to ensure the appellant's arrest
and forestall any possible escape on his part.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, the appellant's contention that the trial court
erroneously characterized his defense as one of alibi, is without any
basis.  The trial court actually
characterized the appellant's defense as one of "alibi and absolute
denial."<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn44" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, the "alibi" aspect thereof is not entirely inaccurate for in
fact, as shown by his own story, the appellant went back to the ricefield to
retrieve his bottle of drinking water before returning to the nipa hut at around
12:00 o'clock noon.  In effect, he
suggested that he was not at the scene of the crime at the time the sexual
assault was committed.</p>

<p class="BODY">All told, We have in this case a 13-year old barrio lass
who:  immediately revealed the
commission of the heinous crime to her father just as the appellant consummated
the act and jumped out of the window to escape; forthwith reported it to the
police authorities who, after having heard her story, apprehended the
appellant; thereafter, in the afternoon of the same day, voluntarily submitted
to a medical examination of her private parts; submitted again to a second
medical examination of her private parts on 28 November 1983; underwent the
ordeal of a public trial; and, upon demand by the appellant's counsel, even
demonstrated -- as part of the cross-examination -- how she was raped.  We need no further evidence to convince Us
that indeed, the complainant was raped by the appellant.  We have repeatedly held that when a woman
admits that she has been raped, she says in effect all that is necessary to
show that rape had been committed.  A
complainant would not make public the offense, undergo the troubles and
humiliation of public trial and endure the ordeal of testifying to all the gory
details if she had not in fact been raped, for no decent Filipina would
publicly admit that she has been raped unless it is the truth.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn45" href="#_ftn45" name="_ftnref45" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the appellant has not shown that the complainant and
her father were actuated by any ulterior motives which could have induced them
to falsely implicate him in the commission of the crime.  It is settled that when there is no evidence
to show any improper motive on the part of the prosecution witnesses to testify
falsely against an accused, the logical conclusion is that no such improper
motive existed, and their testimonies are worthy of full faith and credit.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn46" href="#_ftn46" name="_ftnref46" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Indeed, if accused had really nothing to do with the crime, it is against the
natural order of events and of human nature and against the presumption of good
faith that the prosecution witness would falsely testify against the former.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn47" href="#_ftn47" name="_ftnref47" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
