<p class="BODY">On motion of Senior State Prosecutor Aurelio C. Trampe, the said
criminal cases were consolidated in Branch 12 of the RTC of Antique, presided
over by respondent Judge.</p>

<p class="BODY">Of the nineteen (19) accused, only six (6) had been apprehended
and/or surrendered, namely:  John Paloy,
Vicente Vegafria, Rolando Bernardino, Jesus Garcia y Amorsolo alias "Nono
Picoy", Jose Delumen alias "Winfield" and Romeo Nagales alias

Hence, trial proceeded only as against the said six (6) accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 9 May 1989, the prosecution moved to discharge the accused
Jose Delumen and Romeo <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:

necessary against accused Rolando Bernardino as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

private respondent who was then at-large.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 11 May 1989, the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>granted the motion to discharge Romeo
Nagales but denied it as regards Jose Delumen, the latter having admitted a
prior conviction for the crime of robbery.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, despite the discharge of Romeo Nagales, the prosecution
rested its case without presenting him as state witness and reserved its right
to present him as a witness against the other accused who were then at-large.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 12 May 1989, private respondent was arrested by the
Constabulary Security Group (CSG) in Paranaque, Metro Manila.  On 15 May 1989, the Integrated Bar of the
Philippines (IBP), Iloilo Chapter, through its President, Atty. J. T. Barrera,
entered its appearance as counsel for private respondent with a motion that the
IBP, Iloilo Chapter be allowed to assume custody of the private respondent as
his jailer and/or, in the alternative, to confine him at the Military Stockade
at Camp Delgado and/or at the Iloilo Provincial Jail.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

<p class="BODY">When private respondent was brought before the trial court on 7
June 1989, Atty. J. T. Barrera manifested and moved that his motion of 15 May
1989 be heard.  During the hearing,
Assistant Provincial Prosecutor John Turalba opposed the motion.  The issue was heatedly argued by the
prosecution and the defense.  Whereupon,
private respondent pleaded that he be allowed to approach the bench together
with all the counsel, which respondent Judge reluctantly granted.  Private respondent informed the court that
there exists <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a real </span>and grave
danger to his life if he were to be confined in the Antique Provincial
Jail.  He then narrated an incident when
he, as the then counsel for John Paloy and Vicente Vegafria, prior to his
inclusion as one of the respondents, was refused the right to visit and confer
with his clients by a drunk jail guard at the Antique Provincial Jail; that the
said guard was toying with his armalite rifle while standing at the gate of the
provincial jail and did not allow him to enter; that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">said </span>guard aimed and pointed his armalite rifle twice at him; and
that because of his complaint, the guard was suspended but has long been back
on duty at the provincial jail.   After
hearing the narration, Assistant Provincial Prosecutor John Turalba withdrew
his objection.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn9" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">Hence, on the same date, 7 June 1989, respondent Judge issued an

objection on the part of Prosecutor John Turalba, accused Javellana is hereby
ordered confined at PC, Stockade, Bugante Point San Jose, Antique in the

<p class="BODY">On 2 August 1989, the Provincial Commander, Col. Teodulo Abayata,
wrote respondent Judge:</p>

<blockquote>"I am in receipt of instruction from CPC to turn over Atty.
Avelino Javellana to the Provincial Jail effective immediately and for me to
give feedback NLT today 2 August 1989.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Since his custody under the Provincial Commander was through
the order of that Honorable Court, request that another order be issued for me

<p class="BODY">On the same date, 2 August 1989, respondent Judge issued an order<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

granting the request of Col. Abayata, and ordered the private respondent to be
confined as a detention prisoner at the Binirayan Rehabilitation Center, San
Jose, Antique, subject to the conditions set forth therein.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the order on the same day, private respondent
filed an urgent ex-parte motion for reconsideration,<a style="mso-footnote-id:

alleging that the Binirayan Rehabilitation Center, aside from being a little
bit far and unsafe, has conditions which may not work well for his health; that
he underwent retrogade operation less than a year ago and up to the present he
is still taking medication for maintenance; that he has <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>history of heart treatment and very often he takes maintenance
pills and he is confronted by his unstable blood pressure; that the location of
the rehabilitation center and the absence of facilities there may cause adverse
effects on his health condition; and praying that he be confined in the
Provincial Jail of Iloilo where he can be nearer to better hospital facilities.</p>

<p class="BODY">When the aforesaid motion of private respondent was called for
hearing in the afternoon of 2 August 1989, respon­dent Judge required the
presence of Assistant Provincial Prosecutor John Turalba.  The latter appeared and reiterated the
earlier objection of the Senior State Prosecutor to the confinement of private respondent
in any place other than the Provincial Jail of Antique.</p>

<p class="BODY">After the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>hearing,
respondent Judge issued an order,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>

the Angel Salazar Memorial Hospital and subjected to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the accused Javellana.  The head of the

such custody until further orders from the court.  x x x."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On 3 August 1989, the head of the hospital issued <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>certification on the result of the
physical check-up conducted on private respondent, thus:</p>

<blockquote>"As per order of your Honor, dated August 2, 1989, Atty.
Avelino T. Javellana was examined by Dr. Felipe Rosendo Muzones and his ECG
exami­nation showed that everything is within normal limits.  However, Dr. Muzones contends that the same
is not the only determinant factor as far <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">as
</span>the condition of the heart <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">is </span>concerned.  Hence, he recommends that blood chemistry examination

that he be allowed further medical examination at the Iloilo Mission Hospital
in Iloilo City under at least two (2) police escorts.  When the motion was called in open court in the afternoon, the
private respondent and the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor appeared, and both
argued for and against the motion. Thereafter, the respondent Judge issued an
order,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn17" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

the pertinent part of which reads, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"It is the considered view of the Court that whether the blood
chemistry examination is necessary or not, the fact still remains that the
examination conducted on the heart of movant is incomplete and the court will
not leave to chance the condition of the heart of movant who stands charged of
a serious crime in these cases.  The
Court believes that the best interest of justice maybe served should the
accused be given time to be subjected to a more complete and exhaustive
physical examination <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">particularly his
heart condition, especially considering the information given in open court by

Probation Officer of Antique to take custody of private respondent and to
escort him to Iloilo City for medical check-up and bring him back to court not

<p class="BODY">When the cases were called in the morning of 7 August 1989,
Attys. Amelia K. del Rosario, Arturo Alinio and J. T. Barrera entered their

T. Barrera. However, Senior State Prosecutor Aurelio C. Trampe moved that the
resolution of the incident be held in abeyance until the hearing in the
afternoon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Atty. Jose A. Alegario entered his appearance
as counsel for the then recently arrested accused Oscar Tianzon, who manifested
that his client was ready for arraignment.  Accordingly, the said accused was arraigned.  He pleaded "not guilty."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thereafter, the respondent Judge issued an order,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn19" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

Provincial Jail Warden and setting the continuation of the hearing to 8 August
1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 26 June 1989, private respondent was arraigned, and
thereafter, private respondent's petition for bail was set for hearing on 7, 11

against all the accused; that there is no other direct evidence available for
the proper prosecution of the offenses except the testimony of said accused,
which can be substantially corroborated in its material points by other
evidence; that the accused Tianzon does not appear to be the most guilty among
the accused, as he acted merely as <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;

the prosecution moved that the presentation of its evidence in opposition to
private respondent's petition for bail which was set for hearing on 28 August
1989 and 1 September 1989, be likewise deferred on the ground that accused
Oscar Tianzon is a material witness against private respondent and that his
testimony is necessary for the purpose of determining private respondent's
qualification for bail, i.e., whether the evidence of guilt is strong.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 28 August 1989, petitioner filed the instant petition for <i>CERTIORARI</i>,
to annul and set aside the orders dated 3, 7 and 8 August 1989, claiming that
said orders were issued with grave abuse of discretion and PROHIBITION to
enjoin the respondent Judge from hearing private respondent's petition for bail

praying that a writ of preliminary injunction and/or temporary restraining

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">As </span>prayed for, the

dated 1 September 1989, denying the prosecution's motion to discharge accused
Oscar Tianzon to be utilized as a state witness.  He ruled, among others, as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"The court searched the records for evidence to corroborate
the material points in the aforesaid testimony of Tianzon against Javellana but
found none to corroborate his statement pointing to Javellana as the gun
supplier and the plotter.  Neither has
the prosecution presented evidence during the hearing to determine Tianzon's
qualification tending to corroborate the implication of Javellana nor did the
prosecution indicate to the court where such corroboration can be found by the
court.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the contrary, the court notes a clash of the statements of
Tianzon in the question and answer No. 45 of his affidavit with the testi­monies
of the previous witnesses for the prose­cution because question and answer No.
45 speci­fies the names of the passengers of the two (2) nissan jeeps but the
same does not mention either accused John Paloy or Vicente Vegafria as one of
the passengers of the same jeeps while the testimonies of previous witnesses
for the prosecution proclaim that they (Paloy and Vegafria) were among the
passengers of the such jeeps who alighted therefrom at the Plaza where the late
Governor Evelio Javier was killed.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Not only that.  The
court finds no absolute necessity to date of Tianzon's testimony because the
court earlier on May 11, 1989 discharged accused Romeo Nagales on motion of the
Prosecutor to be utilized as a state witness.  But, instead of utilizing Nagales as a state witness, as promised by the
Prosecutor, the prosecution did not present him up to this writing but
proceeded to formally offer its evidence and thereafter rested its case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"What is more, when the prosecution asked for the discharge of
state witness Nagales, it assured the court that:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'That in the instant cases, there is an absolute necessity for the
testimonies of accused Jose Delumen and Romeo Nagales as against accused Arturo
Pacificador, Rodolfo Pacifi­cador, Avelino Javellana, Eduardo Iran, Ramon
Hortillano, Henry Salaver, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Arlene
Limoso, Rolando Bernardino, Oscar Tianzon, Eleazar Edemne alias

12.0pt">shown in their sworn statements, copies hereto attached as Annexes 'A'
and 'B' and form part hereof;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">'That there is no other direct evidence available for the proper
prosecution of the offenses committed by the accused named in the next
preceding paragraph except the testi­monies of said Delumen and Nagales which
can be substantially corrobo­rated in its material points by other evidence.'</p>

<blockquote>"But neither did the prosecutor use state witness Nagales
against accused Rolando Bernardino nor did the prosecution use his testimony <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">against </span>Jose Delumen and Jesus <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Garcia.  Consequently, there being no evidence against accused Delumen and
Garcia, on motion of their respective counsel, the cases against these two (2)
accused were dismissed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"This situation disturbs, let alone alarms, the court in the
conduct of the prosecution in these cases.  The failure of the prosecution to adduce any evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">against </span>Delumen and Garcia appears to
lend credence to the charge of accused Javellana that the prosecution in these
cases has adopted a ‘scandalous dual theory of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Upon receipt of the resolution, the prosecution, through Senior
State Prosecutor Aurelio C. Trampe, imme­diately filed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

the respondent Judge, dated 24 August 1989, on the ground of manifest
partiality to private respondent, and set it for hearing on 16 October
1989.  Thereupon, the prosecution moved
to defer the presen­tation of its evidence in opposition to private respondent’s
petition for bail.  Despite the
opposition of the prose­cution, the respondent Judge reset the hearing on 14,
15 September 1989 to 4, 5, and 6 October 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">Afterwards, the<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>prosecution

discharge accused Oscar Tianzon.</p>

<p class="BODY">On 4 September 1989, the Senior State Prosecutor also filed a
motion<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn31" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

to reset the hearings on 14, 15 September 1989 and 4, 5, 6 October 1989 on the
petition for bail, on the grounds that the motion to inhibit should first be
resolved and also because of the pendency of the motion for reconsideration of
the order of 1 September 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">At the hearing on 14 September 1989, only Assistant Provincial
Prosecutor John Turalba appeared for the prosecution.  He manifested that he was appearing only to reiterate the Senior
State Prosecutor's motion for deferment of the scheduled hearings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">on </span>private
respondent's petition for bail.  Private
respondent opposed the motion.  The
respondent Judge denied the motion, and directed the prosecution to present its
evidence in opposition to the private respondent's petition for bail.  The Assistant Provincial Prosecutor moved
for reconsideration, claiming that his position is subservient to that of the
Senior State Prosecutor who is the duly designated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">principal prosecutor </span>and as a matter of conviction, he cannot
proceed with the trial as well as with the subsequent trials which were covered
by the motion of 4 September 1989, and that, more­over, to proceed would render
moot and academic the petition for <i>certiorari</i> before this Court.  Respondent Judge denied the motion for
reconsideration, and, again, directed the prosecution to present its evidence.  At this juncture, the Assistant Provincial
Prosecutor manifested that he was not participating in the proceedings and
begged to be allowed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>leave
the courtroom, which the respondent Judge refused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Nevertheless, Assistant Provincial Prosecutor John Turalba walked
out and, while walking towards the door, respondent Judge ordered the Sheriff
to arrest him.  Thereafter, respondent
Judge issued an order finding Assistant Provincial Prosecutor John Turalba in
contempt of court; declaring the prosecution to have waived its right to
present evidence in opposition to private respondent's petition for bail; and
considering the said petition for bail submitted for resolution.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn32" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Hence, the petitioner filed with this Court a Supple­mental
Petition to annul and set aside the orders of 1 September 1989 as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the
order of 14 September 1989; and to inhibit respondent Judge from further taking
cognizance of Criminal Cases Nos. 3350 to 3355; and praying that a writ of
preliminary mandatory injunction be issued directing respondent Judge to
promptly order the release of Assistant Provincial Prosecutor John Turalba from
custody on the cognizance of the Provincial Prosecutor.</p>

<p class="BODY">As prayed for, the Court issued on 22 September 1989 a writ of

However, when the respondent Judge received it on 26 September 1989, Assistant
Provincial Prosecutor John Turalba had already been released on 25 September
1989 having served his sentence.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner contends that the respondent Judge committed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>grave

insisted on continuously hearing private respondent's petition for bail and in

<p class="BODY">It has been repeatedly held that there is grave abuse <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">of </span>discretion justifying the issuance
of a writ of <i>certiorari</i> where there is a capricious and whimsical

is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion,
prejudice, or personal hostility amounting to an evasion of positive duty or to

<p class="BODY">In claiming that respondent Judge committed grave abuse of
discretion in issuing the orders of 3 August 1989, 7 August 1989 and 8 August
1989, petitioner argues that there was no compelling reason for the respondent
Judge to order, with undue haste, the medical "check up" of private
respondent at the Iloilo Mission Center notwithstanding the absence of any
police escort or other law enforcer to ensure that private respondent would not
take flight as he had previously done; that while all the other accused were confined
in the Provincial Jail of Antique, the respondent Judge merely
"entrusted" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">the </span>custody
of private respondent to his lawyers, and then to the Clerk of Court of the RTC
of Antique, who is the son of one of private respondent's lawyers; and that
respondent Judge has not advanced a valid and legal rationale for the
"accommodations" afforded private respondent who, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">in law,</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt"> </span>occupies no better position <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">and no </span>preferential rights <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">over
those </span>of his co-accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">The respondent Judge, however, has, to our mind, sufficiently
explained in the order of 7 August 1989 the<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt"> </span>reasons behind the issuance of the aforesaid orders.  He said:</p>

<blockquote>"The Court is aware of certain reasons why accused Javellana
should not be placed in the Provincial Jail.  This was the subject of a discussion in open court before the Presiding
Judge of this court between the lawyers of Javellana and Javellana, himself and
Asst. Provincial Prosecutor John I-C. Turalba who, after hearing the particular
reason given by Javellana withdrew his opposition to the placing of Javellana
other than in the Provincial Jail of Antique and acceded that custody of
Javellana be placed at the hands of the Provincial Commander of Antique.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Recently, particularly on August 2, 1989 as well as on August
3, 1989, the court had difficult securing the safety of accused <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">Javellana.  The court was left with no other choice but to entrust his custody to
the Provincial Probation Officer to escort him to Iloilo City for a medical
check-up.  It is the perception of the
court that there are movements </span>going around, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">by </span>whom is unknown yet to the court, to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">compel </span>the incarceration of accused Javellana in the Provincial
Jail.  The court abhors this situation
and the court will not be intimidated by anyone.  It is the perception of this court that even its lawful orders
have somehow been subverted.  The
court's perception <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">of </span>the
circumstances presently obtaining on the custody and place of detention of
Javellana is a hot agenda and of grave importance, particularly his safety and
well being during detention in order that the court can try him on the charges
against him.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"After serious deliberation, it is the considered view of the
court that his detention be placed somewhere else.  The court hereby appoints Attys. Del Rosario, Barrera and Alinio
as deputies of the court and as such to take <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">custody of accused Javellana meantime that the motion to fix bail is
going on and for them to bring the accused to court whenever his presence is
needed.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"As earlier noted, the court perceives a movement to compel
detention of the accused in the Provincial Jail of Antique.  This disturbs <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">the court.  This even lends
credence to the information by Javellana that there is indeed danger to his
life if he is placed in the </span>Provincial Jail <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">of </span>Antique.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">This </span>perception of the court is
premised on what appears to be a <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">subversion</span>
of the order of the court placing custody of accused Javellana with the
Provincial Commander of Antique.  The
court, however, allowed, on motion of the Provincial Commander, that Javellana
be transferred to the Binirayan Rehabilitation Center.  But, on motion of Javellana for reasons of
health, <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>the same center is
too far away and no adequate (sic) transport facilities at certain time of the
day and night are available to convey accused should an emergency occur,
accused was ordered confined at the Angel Salazar Memorial Hospital in San
Jose, Antique for check-up.  Because of
the incomplete results of the examination, order was issued for his complete
check-up in a hospital in Iloilo.  The
court ordered the Station Commander of San Jose, Antique to provide police <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">escorts and security to prevent escape of
accused in conducting check-up.  Before
the accused and his escorts could depart, on August 3, 1989 for Iloilo City,
the INP Station Commander of San Jose begged the Presiding Judge </span>of this
Court to allow him to recall the security personnel he has assigned and ordered
to conduct accused Javellana to Iloilo City.  It left the court with no choice and no enforcers.  The court, however, had to be assured on the
physical condition of accused Javellana that he will be able to face trial
against him.  Accordingly, the court
ordered the Provincial Probation Officer, to whom the custody of accused
Javellana was entrusted, to escort the latter to Iloilo City for the medical
check-up.  The Probation Officer earlier
this morning manifested that there was opportunity for accused Javellana to
escape but despite such opportunity he came back to court today to face the
trial against him.  This, to the mind of
the court <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">is </span>to be considered
in his favor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The aforesaid movements directed to compel the court to place
Javellana in the Provincial Jail, is (sic) to the mind of the court, as (sic)
indication that should (sic) be place there, something may happen to him and
this court will not allow that thing to happen.  And as it is the considered view of the court that justice maybe
better served to deputize, as the lawyers of accused Javellana have been
deputized, as deputies of the court.  As
such they are now drawn from the status of private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">individuals but </span>are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">now </span>the
deputies of the court.  In the matter of
facilities, accused Javellana is to be confined at the San Jose residence of
Atty. Deogracias Del Rosario, the son of Atty. Amelia Del Rosario who happens
to be the Clerk of Court of the Regional Trial Court of Antique.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There may be truth to the Prosecutor's contention that there
will be nothing to prevent the other accused from following suit in asking that
their custody likewise (sic) be transferred to their respective lawyers.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"But, such is only to request.  The grant or denial thereof is a matter altogether different.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the present incident it is the findings (sic) of the court
that indeed the life of Javellana will be imperilled if confined elsewhere
other than the place above directed."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Considering the foregoing, the Court finds and so holds that
respondent Judge did not commit grave abuse of discretion, i.e., that he did
not act "arbitrarily", "capri­ciously" or
"despotically" amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction in issuing
the questioned orders of 3, 7 and 8 August 1989.</p>

<p class="BODY">Coming now to the 1 September 1989 order of respon­dent Judge,
denying the prosecution's motion to discharge accused Oscar Tianzon, the Court
reiterates the rule <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">that, </span>for a
writ of <i>certiorari</i> to issue, it must not only be shown that the board,
tribunal or officer acted without jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of
discretion, but also that there is no appeal or other plain, speedy and
adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn36" href="#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup></span></span></a> Thus,
before filing a petition for <i>certiorari</i> in a higher court, the attention
of the lower court should generally be first called to its supposed error and
its correction should be sought.  The
reason for the rule is that issues which the lower courts are bound to decide
should not summarily be taken from them and submitted to an appellate court
without first giving such lower courts the opportunity to dispose of the same
with due deliberation.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn37" href="#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup></span></span></a> In
other words, all available remedies in the lower court must first be exhausted
before filing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a
</span>petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the higher courts.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the petitioner had filed a motion for
reconsideration of the order of 1 September 1989 which is still pending
resolution by respondent Judge.  A
petition for <i>certiorari</i> may not be granted where there is an appeal or
other adequate remedy, like a motion for reconsideration, which is still
pending in the court below,<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn38" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a> as
in the present case.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court, however, holds that respondent Judge committed grave
abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction when he
insisted in continuously hearing private respondent's petition for bail and in
ordering the arrest and commitment of the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor. </p>

<p class="BODY">It is well to recall that in the restraining order issued on 31
August 1989, this Court ordered the respondent Judge to cease and desist from
continuing the hearing on private respondent's petition for bail until after he
had resolved the motion for discharge of Oscar Tianzon as state witness.  Although the aforesaid motion had already
been denied in the order of 1 September 1989, nevertheless, the prosecution had
filed a motion to reconsider the said order which is still pending resolution.  Hence, the said motion has not yet been
resolved with finality.  When respondent
Judge, therefore, denied the prosecution's motion for defer­ment of the
scheduled hearings on private respondent's petition for bail and in proceeding
to hear the said motion, by ordering the prosecution to present its evidence --
which precipitated the walk-out of the Assistant Provincial Prosecutor and his
consequent arrest and commitment to the Provincial Jail -- he (respondent
judge) was acting in violation of the restraining order issued by this Court.  Had the respondent Judge granted the
prosecution's <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">motion </span>for
deferment, or at least, cancelled the hearings on 14 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">and </span>15 September 1989, and instead, resolved the prosecution's
motion for reconsideration of the order of 1 September 1989, this unfortunate
incident could have been avoided.</p>

<p class="BODY">Although the matter of adjournment and postponement <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">of </span>trials is within the sound
discretion of the court, such discretion should always be predicated on the

Crim. Cases </span>Nos. 3350-3355, Section 1, Rule 137 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">of the Rules of Court provides:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"SECTION 1.  <u>Disqualification
of judges</u>. -- No judge or judicial officer shall sit in any case in which
he, or his wife or child, is pecuniarily interested as heir, legatee, creditor <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">or </span>otherwise, or in which he is
related to either party within the sixth degree of consanguinity or affinity,
or to counsel within the fourth degree, computed according to the rules of the
civil law, or in which he has been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">executor,
administrator, guardian, trustee or counsel, or in which he has presided in any
inferior court when his ruling or decision is the subject of review, without
the written consent of all parties in interest, signed by them and entered upon
the records.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"A judge, may in the exercise of his sound discretion,
disqualify himself from sitting in a <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">case,
</span>for just or valid reasons other than those mentioned above."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the reason relied upon for inhibition or
disqualification of respondent Judge, i.e., manifest partiality to private
respondent, is not based on any of the grounds enumerated in the first
paragraph of Section 1, Rule 137 which <u>per</u> <u>se</u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> </span>disqualifies a judge from sitting in <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">a </span>case, but on the second paragraph
thereof.  The settled rule is that the
judge is left to decide for himself whether he will desist, for just or valid
reasons, from sitting in a case.  Respondent Judge has not as yet decided whether or not he will inhibit
himself from further hearing Criminal Cases Nos. 3350-3355 in the face of the
prose­cution's motion to disqualify or inhibit him.  It would be premature for the Court at this stage to rule on the
matter.</p>

In his comment on the petition, private respondent claims that at the time of
the filing of the original infor­mations on 29 October 1986, he was in Metro
Manila, and upon learning of the filing of the said informations, he filed with
the Department of Justice, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:
italic">a </span>petition for review which was resolved against him on 10 July
1987; that on 20 July 1987, the "Philippine Daily Star" carried a
news item on its front page written by reporter Renato Reyes, which states
among others that Sr. State Prose­cutor Aurelio Trampe recommended to Justice
Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez the dropping of the charges against him.   Believing that something was wrong somewhere,
he decided never to surrender and opted to be a fugitive from injustice (<i>Rollo</i>,
pp. 169-170, 183).</p>
