<p class="BODY">Petitioners appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The appellate court however, dismissed the
same and the decision of the trial court became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1970</st1:date>,
the Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Leyte</span> issued a writ of
execution of the final judgment in <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Civil
</span>Case No. 839.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1970</st1:date>,
the deputy sheriff levied upon the real properties of <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span> for the satisfaction of the judgment
debt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Thereafter, he submitted to the court on March 14, 1970 </span>a return
of the writ stating as follows:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>that
when defendant <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>
was served with the writ, the latter refused to sign for acknowledgment thereof
alleging that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">he will first consult his
lawyer; that in the presence of <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>, tenants of <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>, the Chief of Police of this municipality and many
others, the parcels of land described in sub-paragraphs 1, 2 and 5 under
paragraph VI of the complaint were divided among the </span>children of <span class="SpellE">Alejandra</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span> and <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>; that the latter
failed to show up during the time of partition despite personal and written
notice; and that the money judgment against the defendant is still unsatisfied
but the sheriff was already at the stage of levying the properties of defendant
<span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="17" month="3">March 17, 1970</st1:date>,
the deputy sheriff registered the notice of levy on execution with the Register
of Deeds of the <st1:place><st1:placetype>province</st1:placetype> of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Leyte</span></st1:placename></st1:place>.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, the defendant <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>
remained in actual possession of the properties subject of the partition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, private respondents on <st1:date year="1970" day="29" month="6">June 29, 1970</st1:date>, filed a petition for
contempt of court against him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span> filed an opposition to the petition.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1970" day="25" month="7">July 25, 1970</st1:date>,
the respondent judge denied the petition to declare defendant in contempt on
the ground that the execution made by the sheriff was not valid because of the
lack of specifications as to which portions of the parcels of land were to be
delivered to prevailing parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
judge also ordered all the parties to agree upon a project of partition, and in
case of disagreement, the deputy sheriff is thereby commissioned to conduct an
inspection of the property and submit to the court a project of partition for
approval and upon notice to all parties (pp. 41-42, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1971</st1:date>,
defendant <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>
died and he was substituted by petitioners herein as his legal heirs.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1971" day="14" month="9">September 14, 1971</st1:date>,
private respondents filed a motion for issuance of an alias writ of execution
for the satisfaction of the money judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The court granted the motion on <st1:date year="1971" day="18" month="9">September
 18, 1971</st1:date> and issued an alias writ of execution on <st1:date year="1971" day="5" month="10">October 5, 1971</st1:date> (pp. 44-45, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
deputy sheriff filed with the Registry of Deeds of <span class="SpellE">Tacloban</span>
City on <st1:date year="1971" day="15" month="11">November 15, 1971</st1:date>
a subsequent notice of levy on execution upon the real properties of the
deceased defendant for the satisfaction of the money judgment plus sheriff’s
fees and other expenses incidental to the execution.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1972" day="3" month="4">April 3, 1972</st1:date>,
the petitioners filed a motion to set aside the alias writ of execution and the
levy on execution, alleging that insofar as the money judgment is concerned,
the same could no longer be executed due to the fact that the judgment-debtor <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span> was already
dead.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court denied the motion on the
ground that it failed to disclose to the court the identities of the <span class="SpellE">movants</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners
moved to reconsider the order of denial.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the meantime, petitioners filed a petition for repartition
contending that there were actually only three (3) parcels of land to be partitioned
instead of four (4) <span class="SpellE">parcles</span> as reported in the first
execution on February 11, 1970, and that repartition would be just and
equitable to both parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, on <st1:date year="1972" day="21" month="10">October
 21, 1972</st1:date>, granted the petition and directed deputy sheriff <span class="SpellE">Vivencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Fallore</span> as commissioner
to conduct another ocular inspection of the properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter submitted the commissioner’s
report with the corresponding sketches of the partition.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This was approved by the court in the absence
of any objection thereto from the parties during the hearing on the report.</p>

<p class="BODY">On April 18, 1973, the court denied petitioners’ motion to set
aside the alias writ of execution and/or to annul the levy on execution, and
their motion for reconsideration, holding that the levy on the real properties
of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span> made on March 13, 1970, for
the satisfaction of the money judgment against him is valid and enforceable by
sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, on <st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1973</st1:date>,
the deputy sheriff sold at public auction the properties levied upon on <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1970</st1:date> to private respondent <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>, who was the
only bidder during the execution sale.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The sale was evidenced by the Sheriff’s Certificate of Sale dated <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1973</st1:date> (pp. 71-73, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">After the instant petition was filed, this Court issued a temporary
restraining order on <st1:date year="1974" day="26" month="8">August 26, 1974</st1:date>
to prevent public respondents from executing final deed of conveyance and
possession of the properties mentioned in the sheriff’s certificate of sale on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="7">July 17, 1973</st1:date> in favor of respondent <span class="SpellE">Gertrudes</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that the levy on the properties by the sheriff
on <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1970</st1:date> for the
satisfaction of the money judgment was not valid since it was made pursuant to
a void writ of execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They allege
that the order of respondent judge on July 25, 1970 which dismissed the
petition of respondents to declare <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span> in contempt of court, declared that the delivery
made by the sheriff of any portion pursuant to the judgment would be invalid
because of the lack of specifications therein as to which portions of the land
were to be delivered to the prevailing parties, and that the violation of such
execution would not legally constitute contempt of court, because in the eyes
of the law, there was no valid execution that was violated.</p>

<p class="BODY">This is the first time that petitioners raised the foregoing
argument.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Records show that petitioners
never questioned before the trial court the validity of the writ of execution
dated <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1970</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What the petitioners sought to annul or set
aside before the trial court was the subsequent or alias writ of execution, on
the ground that it was issued after the death of the judgment debtor on June 6,
1971 and therefore, cannot be enforced by levy on the properties of the
deceased debtor pursuant to Rule 39 of the Rules of Court.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioners having failed to challenge the
order of the court directing the issuance of the first writ of execution, they
are now <span class="SpellE">estopped</span> from asserting that the said writ
was null and void.</p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, the jurisdiction and power to entertain motions to
quash writs of execution and to correct errors and mistakes in the execution
properly belongs to the court which issued the execution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no question that the court which
rendered the judgment has a general supervisory control over its process of
execution, and this power carries with it the right to determine every question
of fact and law which may be involved in the execution (<span class="SpellE">Seavan</span>
Carrier, Inc. v. GTI Sportswear, No. 65953, July 16, 1985, 137 SCRA 580).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court should first be given the opportunity
to correct the errors of its ministerial officers and to control its own
process.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Failure of the petitioners in
not promptly filing a motion to annul the prior writ of execution issued by the
court is fatal to their cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">Even if <span class="GramE">We</span> were to disregard the
technicalities of this case, petitioners cannot just rely on declaration made
by the court as to the invalid execution and delivery by the sheriff of
portions of the disputed land to the parties, to justify their contention that
the writ is null and void.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The court’s
statement refers only to the improper implementation of the writ by the sheriff
with regard only to the delivery of the partitioned portions of the
property.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of this, the court,
declared the enforcement erroneous and ordered measures to ensure the proper
implementation of the writ (pp. 41-42, <span class="SpellE"><u>Rollo</u></span>).</p>

<p class="BODY">To justify the quashing of a writ of execution, there must, of
course, be sufficient ground <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A writ may be quashed or recalled only when
a) it appears that it has been improvidently issued, b) that the writ is
defective in substance, or c) is issued against the wrong party, or d) that the
judgment debt has been paid, or e) that the writ has been issued without
authority, or f) there is a change in the situation of the parties which makes
such execution inequitable, or g) the controversy was never submitted to the
judgment of the court (International School, Inc. v. Minister of Labor and
Employment, G.R. No. 54243, July 21, 1989).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Clearly, petitioners failed herein to allege or to sufficiently show in
their petition the existence of any ground to justify the setting aside of the
writ.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find that the order of
execution of the trial court on <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="1">January
 20, 1970</st1:date> is valid where it merely enforces the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> judgment in the
partition case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Consequently, the levy
made on the real properties of the judgment debtor <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>
on <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1970</st1:date> should
also be considered valid and regular in the absence of any showing that the
requisites <span class="SpellE">therefor</span> had not been complied with.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners submit that the trial court acted whimsically in
refusing to set aside the alias writ of execution and levy <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">on </span>execution for having been issued
after the death of the <span class="GramE">deceased</span> defendant <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Section 7, Rule 39 of the Rules of Court
provides:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“Execution in case of death of party.</span> -- ­Where
a party dies after the entry of the judgment or order, execution thereon may
issue, or one already issued may be enforced in the following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">“x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.</span></blockquote>

<blockquote>“c<span class="GramE">)<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In</span> case of the death of the judgment
debtor after execution is actually levied upon any of his property, the same
may be sold for the satisfaction thereof, and the officer making the sale shall
account to the corresponding executor or administrator for any surplus in his
hands.”</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">If the levy had been made before the
death of the judgment debtor, the sale on execution could be carried to
completion in accordance with the <span class="SpellE">aforequoted</span> rule
which provides that in case the judgment debtor dies after execution is actually
levied upon any of his <span class="GramE">property,</span> the same may be sold
for the satisfaction of judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Py</span> Eng <span class="SpellE">Chong</span>
v. Herrera, G.R. No.</span> <span class="GramE">L-31299, </span><st1:date year="1976" day="25" month="3"><span class="GramE">March 25, 1976</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 70 SCRA 130).</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In
the instant case, the order of execution was issued on <st1:date year="1970" day="20" month="1">January 20, 1970</st1:date> and the levy on the properties
was made on <st1:date year="1970" day="13" month="3">March 13, 1970</st1:date>,
prior to the death of <span class="SpellE">Quiterio</span> <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span>
on <st1:date year="1971" day="6" month="6">June 6, 1971</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, the properties levied upon by the
sheriff may be sold for the satisfaction of the money judgment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The subsequent issuance of the alias writ of
execution and levy after the death of <span class="SpellE">Ibatan</span> did not
affect the validity of the first writ and levy thereon.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It has been held that the issuance of
subsequent writs of execution does not operate as abandonment or waiver of a
prior writ of execution (Government v. <span class="SpellE">Echaus</span> and
Gonzales, 71 Phil. 318).</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, with respect to the partition of the parcels of land
subject of the decision in Civil Case No. 839, We believe that the repartition
made by the court on January 13, 1973 (p. 67, <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rollo</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">) </span>approving the commissioner’s report
by the sheriff upon the instance of petitioners herein and without objection
from private respondents has cured whatever defects or irregularities attended
the execution and delivery of the parcels of land to the prevailing parties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With respect to the levy and execution sale
held <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">on </span><st1:date year="1973" day="28" month="6">June 28, 1973</st1:date> for the satisfaction of the money
judgment against the judgment debtor, petitioners have not clearly and
sufficiently shown to this Court legal and justifiable grounds upon which the
foregoing incidents should be nullified and set aside.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>ACCORDINGLY</b>, the instant petition is hereby
DISMISSED.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The temporary restraining
