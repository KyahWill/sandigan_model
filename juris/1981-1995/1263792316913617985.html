Milagros P. Areola, the Provincial Fiscal of Cagayan charged Reynaldo de la
Cruz y Beria, alias Boy, before the Court of First Instance of Cagayan of the
crime of rape in an information which reads as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"That on or about June 27 and 28, 1973, in the municipality of
Ballesteros, province of Cagayan, and within the jurisdiction of the Hon­orable
Court, the said accused, Reynaldo B. de la Cruz, alias Boy, with lewd design
and by means of force and intimidation and having deprived of reason or
otherwise rendering unconscious the offended party, did then and there
wilfully, un­lawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with one Milagros
P. Areola, against her will and consent."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">When arraigned on November 20, 1973, the accused, assisted by a
counsel <u>de</u> <u>oficio</u>, pleaded not guilty.  However, judgment was rendered on July 24, 1974, convicting him
of the crime charged; sentencing him to suffer the penalty of <u>reclusion</u> <u>perpetua</u>;
and ordering him to pay the costs of suit.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Hence, this appeal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The prosecution's version
of the facts, as stated in the People's brief, is as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"Milagros Areola, the complainant herein, had her first assignment
as a public school teacher at Barrio San Juan, Ballesteros, Cagayan (p. 25,
t.s.n., Jan. 7, 1974, morning session).  Being her first time to go to barrio San Juan, she, accompanied by her
mother and Mr. Anso, Mr. Viloria and Maria Alonzo, went to the said barrio on
June 20, 1973 before as­suming her position to orient herself of the place and
to look for a suitable boarding house (id.).  The nearest house to the barrio school where she was to teach was the
house of Mrs. Miling Bermudez about 100 meters away (p. 26, id.).  There were only two houses near the school,
the other one being the house of the accused, Reynaldo de la Cruz, which was
about 40 meters away from the house of Mrs. Bermudez (id.).  Of these two houses, the group chose the
house of Mrs. Bermudez, aunt of Reynaldo, as the boarding house of Milagros
Areola (pp. 26-27, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Milagros reported to school for the first time on June 21,
1973 (p. 27, id.).  On that same day,
Mrs. Bermudez introduced to her the accused (her nephew) and his parents and
sisters (pp. 27-28, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon of June 22, 1973, Milagros, accompanied by
Herminia de la Cruz (Reynaldo's younger sister), went back to the Centro of
Balles­teros to get her school supplies, to submit her report of enrollment,
and to procure her basic needs (p. 28, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On June 24, 1973, Milagros and Herminia went to market and
while they were there, Herminia saw her brother Reynaldo and asked him to go
with her and Milagros (pp. 29-30, id.).  In keeping with <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Filipino
courtesy and hospitality, Milagros requested </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">Herminia to invite Reynaldo to take his lunch at her (Milagros)
parent's house in Centro, Balles­teros (p. 18, 30, id.).  Although Reynaldo obliged by going to the
house of Milagros, he, however, did not eat his lunch there because he left
while Milagros was preparing lunch (id.).<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"After lunch, Milagros and Herminia went to the market to wait
for a ride to Nararagan on their way to San Juan.  While waiting for a ride, Milagros saw Virgie, her boardmate, and
the mother of Rey­naldo (id.).  They
told her that they had not eaten their lunch yet (id.).  Milagros invited them to her house but they
declined (id.).  Milagros then invited
them for snack in the market and there they ate halo-halo and cake (p. 31,
id.).  After taking half of her
halo-halo, Milagros went to pay the refreshment parlor owner about five meters
away.  Upon her return to the table, her
companions told her to eat her halo-halo, otherwise, they will not also eat
theirs.  Milagros obliged and finished
her halo-halo, saying, 'I have to eat it, because I have paid for it.' (p. 32,
id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Thereafter, the group, unable to wait for the Herminia
Transit, hired two tricycles to bring them to Nararagan (pp. 32-33, id.).  They arrived in Barrio San Juan between 4:00
and 5:00 o'clock in the afternoon (p. 33, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Although she had headache and felt dizzy since the night of
June 24 after coming from Centro, Mila­gros reported for school on June 25,
1973 (pp. 33-34, id.).  During recess,
Reynaldo went to give her coffee.  She
was surprised because it was the daughter of her land-lady who used to serve
her coffee at recess time.  (id.).  After drinking her coffee, her condition
became worse.  (p. 35, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On June 26, 1973, despite her worsening con­dition, Milagros
continued to go to school.  During
recess, Reynaldo was again the one who brought her coffee.  Noticing bubbles in her coffee, Milagros
became suspicious and asked Reynaldo why there were bubbles.  The latter explained that the water was
boiling when he poured it on the coffee (id.).  After drinking the coffee, she felt her body becoming heavier (id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On June 27, 1973, Milagros again went to school, this time,
with much difficulty.  Like the previous
days, Reynaldo again brought her coffee during recess (pp. 35-36, id.).  Unable to endure her condition any longer,
Milagros went home at 11:00 o'clock in the morning before the regular dis­missal
time (p. 36, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Upon arrival at her boarding house, Milagros changed her
clothes, ate a light lunch and, after telling Virgie, Delia and Myrna, her
companions in the house, not to make any noise because she wanted to rest, she
went to bed (pp. 36-37, id.).  While
resting, she noticed someone entered her room.  Thinking that it was one of her housemates, she paid no heed.   Then she heard someone asked her if she had
already eaten her lunch.  Noticing that
the person who made the inquiry was Reynaldo, Milagros requested him to go out
of the room be­cause she was sickly and she wanted to rest (p. 37, id.).  When she was about to catch her sleep, Rey­naldo,
without a shirt on, suddenly went on top of her.  She struggled against and wrestled with Rey­naldo, pleading to
him to desist from doing what he intended to do.  She shouted for help but nobody went to her succor.  With her state of health - ­feeling very
weak and dizzy -- Milagros was easily overpowered by Reynaldo who succeeded in
having sexual intercourse with her (pp. 37-39, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the afternoon, Reynaldo threatened and forced Milagros to
go with him to his house.  Her will
overpowered by the intake of drugs administered to her by the accused,
Milagros, acting like a robot, followed the wishes and orders of Reynaldo (Q
&amp; A, No. 16, Exh. B).  Her
helplessness became greater when, upon reporting the incident to her landlord,
she received the following advice, 'If I were you, Ma'am, I would follow him
because something wrong might happened (sic) to you if you do not follow him
and his wishes.' Still deprived of reason, coupled with the threats and
intimidation of Reynaldo and her helplessness, Milagros went with the
accused.  Reynaldo, through the use of
force, succeeded in having other sexual intercourses with Milagros who was
still weak and deprived of her mental faculties because of the drugs previously
administered to her (pp. 41-42, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the evening of June 28, 1973, Milagros saw the barrio
captain and told him that Reynaldo forced her to follow him under threats and
intimi­dation, to which the barrio captain answered, 'Do not think of that
anymore my daughter, what you should think is how you would settle down.' (p.
42, id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On June 29, 1973, Mr. Anso and a policeman fetched Milagros
from the house of Reynaldo and brought her to the District Supervisor's Office
where her mother and the Supervisor were waiting.  She related to her mother and to the Supervisor her harrowing
experience.  She told them that she was
ravished by the accused.  (pp. 43-46,
id.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On June 30, 1973, Milagros and her mother went to the
Ballesteros Emergency Hospital but the doctor, a Sabatist, was not there,
hence, they had to go back the following day, July 1, 1973.  Dra. Ester Arafiles, a Resident Physician of
said hospital, examined Milagros and found her to be weak and disoriented,
probably drugged with the use of barbituates, opium and seconal.  She also found the hymen of Milagros
lacerated at 3:00, 6:00 and 9:00 o'clock positions.  (pp. 11, 47, id.; pp. 6-14, t.s.n., Jan. 24, 1974; Exh. D).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Having been ravished by the accused against her will and
consent, Milagros filed a complaint for rape before the Municipal Court of
Ballesteros, Ca­gayan (Exh. A, p. 1, rec.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>"<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">During </span>the
pendency of the present case the appellant was indicted and convicted for
kissing and fondling the breast of a married woman who is the wife of his
friend (pp. 3-5, 50-51, t.s.n., July 24, 1974).  (Brief for the Appellee, pp. 3-9.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused does not deny
having had sexual intercourse with the complainant on June 27 and 28,
1973.  He however insists that the same
were consummated not only with the consent of the com­plainant but upon her own
initiative.  His version of the facts is
as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The accused and the
complainant came to know of each other </span>when he went to the school where
the complainant was teaching and helped the latter sweep the classroom.  He did not know the date as he was
illiterate.  After they had swept the
floor and arranged the chairs, the complainant sat beside him and asked him of
his real name.  He gave his name as
"Reynaldo de la Cruz" and in turn asked the complainant of her
name.  The complainant answered:  "I am called Mila at home, and I am
called Milagros Areola here in school." After that short conversation, he
went home.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At noontime of the same
day, Reynaldo saw Milagros at her boarding house which was near his house.  He was then sitting beside the stairs when
Milagros also saw him and waved her hands at him.  He then went to her boarding house where she offered him a cup of
coffee.  At first he refused to drink
the coffee but he drank it never­theless because Milagros said:  "Since this is my first time to offer
you, why do you displease me."<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The next time Reynaldo
saw Milagros was when the former was walking in their yard while the latter was
peeling a pineapple </span>in the kitchen of her boarding house.  When Milagros saw Reynaldo, she again waved
her hands at him.  Milagros then invited
Reynaldo to share the pineapple.  Shortly after they had eaten the pineapple, the landlady of Milagros
prepared the table.  Milagros refused to
eat if she could not invite Reynaldo to eat with her.  Milagros then poured soup on a plate of rice and mixed it.  She said to Reynaldo:  "Let us see if you can eat this mixed
rice and soup I prepared." She then took a spoonful of the mixture and fed
it to Reynaldo.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Not to be outdone, Reynaldo got the spoon, filled it with the mixed </span>rice
and soup and fed it to Milagros, saying:  "If you really care for me, then try also eating the same kind of
food that you gave me." The owners of the boarding house who were in front
of them commented that they were like a newlywedded couple.  And to such comment Milagros responded:  "Would there be anything wrong, brother
and sister, if I can be pitted against Boy?"</p>

<p class="BODY">The following day, Milagros again called for Reynaldo to ask for
the latter's permission for his younger sister, Herminia, to accompany her to
Ballesteros.  Reynaldo replied that
while he was the eldest in the family, they still had their parents so it would
be better for Milagros to get the permission from their parents.  Milagros agreed to get the permission from
the parents of Reynaldo.  She then
requested Reynaldo to accompany them to Nararagan where they could get a ride
for Ballesteros.  On their way to Nararagan
Milagros asked Reynaldo:  "Why,
Boy, are you not still going to marry?" Reynaldo replied:  "I am very eager Ma'am, but nobody
would like me because I am so wardly and I am difficult in life."  Milagros said:  "It is only because you do not want it." Reynaldo then
commented:  "If I could only be
pitted against you, then it would be very good." Milagros then told Rey­naldo
to go to Ballesteros the coming Sunday.  And Reynaldo re­plied:  "I
will come, Ma'am."</p>

<p class="BODY">It was still dark when Reynaldo started from their house in going
to Ballesteros.  Upon reaching
Ballesteros, he stayed in front of the plaza where Milagros and his sister,
Herminia, saw him.  Milagros invited
them to eat their lunch in her house.  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">He agreed but not before Milagros assured him
that she had no sisters in the house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Milagros' mother and grandparents were in their house when they
arrived.  Milagros told Reynaldo to wait
in the sala while she cooked their lunch.  But when Milagros was about to finish cooking, her sisters arrived.  Since Reynaldo felt uncomfortable, he begged
to be excused.  Milagros allowed him to
leave when he promised that he would return for lunch.  But Reynaldo did not return; instead he went
to a restaurant where he was invited by some male teachers for a drinking
spree.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sometime thereafter, Reynaldo's sister, Herminia, arrived and
told him:  "Come now, Manong, said
Manang Mila.  She did not even take her
lunch because you were not there." Reynaldo answered:  "Just go ahead.  I could not now come along with you because
I am already drunk." Herminia then left and went to the tricycle where
Milagros was waiting.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Shortly thereafter,
Reynaldo's mother arrived and told him:  "You come at all costs, because she would not like to come and
teach if you do not come with me now." Reynaldo replied:  "You go ahead and I will follow."
A barrio councilman then pushed Reynaldo so the latter was forced to follow his
mother.  They went to the parking place
for trucks and there they met Milagros who invited them to a place where she
ordered "halo-halo".<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After they had eaten
their "halo-halo", Milagros hired a tricycle where she, Reynaldo and
Herminia rode in going to </span>Nararagan.  Upon reaching Nararagan, Reynaldo unloaded the school supplies and
placed them on the sled of his younger brother who met them.  The three of them then walked home.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon reaching a muddy portion of the path leading to their
houses, Milagros taunted Reynaldo by saying:  "Will you carry me if you could really carry me." Reynaldo
however refused to carry Milagros saying that he was ashamed because Milagros'
uncle, Alejandro Areola, was then south of them bulldozing.  Milagros just said:  "Oh, yes, it is really shameful."
And they continued walking.</p>

<p class="BODY">When they arrived at the boarding house of Milagros, Rey­naldo
asked her to let him see her pictures.  Milagros then gave Reynaldo her album.  But when Reynaldo was scanning the album, Milagros grabbed it and
entered the room saying:  "If you
want to see my pictures, come into the room." Reynaldo entered the room
and sat on a divan.  Milagros then gave
him the album.  While Reynaldo was
looking at the pictures, Milagros changed her clothes and sat near
Reynaldo.  She then told him:  "Let us see if you can carry
me."  Reynaldo accepted the
challenge and carried Milagros.  He then
kissed her on the face.  Milagros then
said:  "You go and see those things
that you placed on the sled and find out if they are wet or not.  You will be responsible for them if they are
wet." Reynaldo ran to meet his younger brother who was pulling the sled
and saw that the articles were not wet.  But he ran back to Mila­gros and told her:  "Mila, your belongings are wet." Milagros <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">hurriedly went down to see her things and
when she saw that they were not wet, she slapped Reynaldo on the waist and
said:  "Liar, they are not
wet." Reynaldo then carried the things upstairs and bade Milagros
goodbye.  Milagros allowed him to go but
shortly, thereafter, she overtook him and gave him her picture with the
following inscription at the back:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"6-26-73</blockquote>

<blockquote>To Boy,</blockquote>

<blockquote>Let me know how much you may remember me.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Sisterly,<br>
Mila"</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Reynaldo next saw Milagros when he was fetching water and she was
taking a bath.  That same day, Milagros,
thru Danny Bermudez (the son of her landlord), summoned Reynaldo to her
boarding house and once there requested him to wash her clothes <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">and </span>to press her pant suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Then came the fateful noon of Wednesday.  Reynaldo was sitting on the stairs of his
house when Milagros waved at him from the window of her boarding house.  Responding to the call, Reynaldo went to
her.  Milagros was already crying when
she said:  "Tsk, your smoking is
even more precious than I am." Reynaldo replied:  "You have to excuse me.  It is not easy for me to remove my vice." <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">He </span>then promised to stop smoking but when Milagros did not seem <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">to </span>believe him, he said:  "So that I will be able to prove to
you, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">I will </span>throw away this pack
of Marlboro cigarettes in my pocket." Milagros then invited him to go
inside her room.  And after they entered
the room, Milagros spread a mat, lay down and said:  "Will you fan me?" Reynaldo was fanning Milagros when
the latter's landlady (an aunt of Reynaldo) entered and left the room.  Milagros then said to Reynaldo:  "Come, let us sleep." Milagros
kissed Reynaldo when the latter lay down beside her.  Aroused and emboldened by Milagros' aggressiveness, Reynaldo
likewise kissed her and suggested that they had sexual intercourse.  Milagros asked Reynaldo:  "Will you not forsake me?"
Reynaldo answered: "At any time, I am ready to marry you." Milagros
then said:  "Before we do these
things, I am going to tell you one thing.  There was another man ahead of you and I am telling you so that you will
know." Reynaldo replied:  "It
is better that you tell me frankly, rather than concealing the same for after
all I will be able to detect it." Rey­naldo then asked Milagros to pull
down her panty.  He then went on top of
her.  After consummating the act,
Reynaldo said:  "Let us get up and
eat." And they ate at the kitchen of the boarding house.</p>

<p class="BODY">After eating, Milagros said:  "I do not want to go and teach anymore.  It is not easy to be walking there like a duck." But
Reynaldo dissuaded her from missing her class so she dressed and went to school
while he proceeded home.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the evening of that day, Reynaldo went to the boarding house
of Milagros to ask Milagros' permission to go to Olongapo.  Mila­gros did not want him to go despite his
assurance that he would stay in Olongapo only for a short while.  She even got a scissor and tried to stab
herself.  Reynaldo grabbed the scissor
and pa­cified Milagros.  He then told
her to wait for a while as he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">just
going to urinate.  But Milagros grabbed
him by the tail of his shirt and did not let him go.  She then got her things and went with Reynaldo to the latter's
house.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Upon arrival at the house, Reynaldo's mother asked Milagros:  "Why did you come, my daughter, we may
be blamed for this.”  Milagros
answered:  "No, mother, I will be
responsible for this, perhaps we are destined for each other."</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, the barrio captain (an uncle of Reynaldo),
along with some members of the council, arrived.  The barrio captain told Milagros about the consequences of her
decision to live with Reynaldo.  But
Milagros said:  "Never mind, that
might have been already my destiny.  Even my aunties, all of them got married.  One of them was married to a farmer, and the other is married to
a drunkard, how much more with Boy." For his part, Reynaldo said:  "I did not yet want to settle down, Mr.
Captain, but because she was going to kill herself, I could not do anything.  I have to bring her home already." The
barrio captain then told Milagros:  "You should know better, ma'am." The visitors then left and
Reynaldo and Milagros then slept together.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The following morning,
Milagros told Reynaldo:  "Let us
have a secret marriage." Reynaldo asked:  "Where?" He then suggested Aparri but Milagros said:  "I am afraid in Aparri be­cause I have
an uncle there." They then agreed to have their secret marriage in Laoag.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">They were about to leave
for Laoag when Reynaldo's parents told Milagros:  "Even if that was the way things have gone, give </span>us
the opportunity to talk with your parents so that they will not blame us."
On that same morning, Reynaldo's parents went to Ballesteros to talk to
Milagros' parents about the matter.  Rey­naldo
and Milagros put off their plan to go to Laoag.  Instead, Reynaldo brought Milagros, first, to the house of his
uncle, Jose Beria, and then to the house of younger brother, Rogelio.  When the parents of Reynaldo arrived from
Ballesteros they said they would return to Ballesteros the following Saturday
and wait for Mila's father before they get married.</p>

<p class="BODY">The plan to go to Ballesteros the following Saturday did not
materialize because Mr. Anzo (a co-teacher of Milagros), along with Mr. Rebanal
(a policeman), arrived to fetch Milagros.  "We learned that you have already married, my daughter", Mr.
Anzo said.  "Yes, sir, this could
be the place where I am destined to meet my fate", Milagros replied.  Mr. Anzo then said:  "You had a seminar last Thursday and
you did not come, that is why we came here to get you." Milagros agreed to
go with Mr. Anzo who then said:  "Get all your clothings." Milagros got some of her clothes but
left her other things.  Mr. Anzo then
said to the sister of Reynaldo:  "Herminia, you lend us a bag and I will place the clothings which
could not be contained in the suit case and I will carry them." But
Milagros said:  "No more, sir, I
was able to get all of it. "</p>

<p class="BODY">Shortly thereafter, the parents of Reynaldo arrived.  Mila­gros went to the kitchen and said:  "Mother, father, you better come along
with us because it seems that they are taking me away.  I do not care if Boy and I would be punished
for, after all, we did what we wanted." Reynaldo then said:  <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">"Yes,
</span>but how could I come along when I have no money.  My younger brother got the money I have to
buy merchandize." Milagros then gave Reynaldo P25.00 saying:  "Get this and use it in paying the fare
of those whom you will bring along to talk with my parents."</p>

<p class="BODY">Reynaldo told Mr. Anzo that they should eat first before leaving
but the latter refused and left with Milagros and the policeman.  Reynaldo ran following them and was able to
over­take them -- as they were then trying to wait for him — at the road going
to barrio Cabayu.  Milagros then told
Reynaldo to buy some biscuits and soft drinks as she was already hungry.  Reynaldo bought some biscuits and a bottle
of Royal Tru Orange and offered them to Milagros.  But Mr. Anzo started his motor­cycle and Milagros boarded
it.  When Reynaldo tried to give the
bottle of Royal Tru Orange to Milagros, Mr. Anzo said:  "No more, never mind the royal."
And Milagros was able to get only the biscuits.</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence for the defense is not clear as to what transpired
thereafter except that it shows that Reynaldo, ac­companied by his father and
uncle (the barrio captain), followed Milagros, Mr. Anzo and the policeman, and
that, subsequently, Reynaldo received a letter (Exh. "2") from
Milagros which was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">written in
Ilocano.  It reads: <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Of the two conflicting
versions, the trial court found that of the complainant to be more
credible.  It reasoned out as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"First, Milagros Areola is a public school teacher.  By reason of her education, she is expected
to be possessed of that character that would set as an example to be emulated
by the people she comes in contact with.  Her character were things that have not been destroyed by the defense.  The presumption stands that she is a reputable
woman and possessed of virtuous character.  Such being the case, it is not ex­pected that she would accuse falsely a
man like the accused to have abused her honor.  She would not stand public trial, come to Court and expose herself to
embarassment, public ridicule and probably censure.  Among all these, if the act complained of was not committed, it
would not be easy to think of a provinciana taking the value of her honor
lightly and telling publicly that she has been abused several times by a man
whom she did not love.  The frankness
and candor under which she testified in Court are indicative of her intention
and purpose in filing this case, prosecuting the accused and testifying
publicly as to what happened to her.  By
so doing, she has exposed herself to the indignation of members of the fairer
sex.  If she would have done so on
fabricated charges for after all she had everything to lose and nothing to gain
by running after a man like the accused.  As aptly observed and rated by the highest magistracy of the land that
not­withstanding the modern and western culture, the amiability of the Filipino
womanhood has still been retained.  There may have been a modification of the early Maria Clara but most of
the virtues have remained.  By reason
hereof, the testimony of the offended party must be viewed in the light of
their purpose in bringing before the bar of justice the man who destroyed her
honor.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On second analysis, the Court would now venture on the
defense of the accused.  As stated at
the threshold of this decision, it was the accused alone, who testified in his
own behalf.  He pre­sented a version
which tried to establish that he was a very shy man.  His shyness springs from the fact that he is an unlettered
individual.  He had the highest respect for
the complainant, being a public school teacher in their barrio.  As proof thereof, he was only too willing to
help the com­plainant whenever she would ask him to do so or he found a need
for it.  Because of his respect,
whenever the complainant would wave at him and beckon to him to go near her, he
would readily run to her.  As a matter
of fact, it was for this respect for the complainant that he rejected the
original plan for her to board in their house to avoid any pos­sible
repercussion of him and her living together under the same roof.  Were it not for the com­plainant's daring
attitude, the encouragement given to him and the attention that were showered
upon him, the affairs between them could have been avoided.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"This version of the accused makes the Court feel its unique
character.  It was a story, too good to
be true.  Unless of course the Court has
to stretch human credulity to change human behavior by making a woman after a
man but whatever it was, the fact remains that the accused never had any
intention or any desire to court the love of the complainant.  He was only too willing to say that he is
ready to marry her.  Such a statement
made clearer the ambition of the accused.  If the accused's condition were to be equated with the position of the
woman, his looks equated with her personality, then it would not be surprising
why the incident actually happened.  Any
man with such inordinate ambition would be willing to assume any risk and
gamble everything, after all he offers himself to be ready to answer for what
he does by marching to the aisles and bring her to the altar.  The incident complained of was not a remote
possibility." (Decision, pp.  21-24; <u>rollo</u>, pp. 23-26.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It
then proceeded to rule that the crime of rape was committed by the
accused.  This, despite its factual
findings that "(t)here </span>was no force or intimidation used" and
that "(t)here was no physical resistance on the part of the
complainant" (Decision, p. 25; <u>rollo</u>, p. 27).  Its rationalization runs as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x (T)he lack of physical resistance has been explained by
the victim by saying that even if she wanted to resist, she could not do so be­cause
there was that unexplained influence which overpowered her will.  She was therefore sub­jected to some kind of
control which she could not explain.  She could not express resistance and re­fusal to submit thereto.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The sexual intercourse was therefore com­mitted in the state
of unconsciousness or sub­conscious mind which adversely affect the will of the
offended party.  Consequently, the Court
feels and finds that the crime of rape on the per­son of the complainant
Milagros Areola has actually been committed." (Decision, p. 26; <u>rollo</u>,
p. 28.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The legal conclusion
reached by the trial court was that the accused was guilty of rape when he had
sexual intercourse with the complainant while the latter was deprived of
reason.  Such legal conclusion was
premised upon its factual finding that the complainant was then under the
influence of drug which the ac­cused placed in the coffee which the complainant
took on the 25th, 26th and 27th of June, 1973.  Thus, the main issue to be resolved in this appeal is whether or not the
trial court erred in making such factual finding.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">We have reviewed
carefully the evidence on record and found that the prosecution failed to prove
beyond reasonable doubt that at the time the accused had sexual intercourse
with </span>the complainant, the latter was under the influence of drug which <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the accused placed in the coffee taken by the
complainant on the 25th, 26th and 27th of June, 1973.  The only bases of the trial court in concluding that the accused
placed some drug in the coffee of the complainant are:  (1) the bubbles allegedly noticed by the
complainant on the coffee served to her by the accused on June 26, 1973; and
(2) the headache and dizziness allegedly felt by the complainant on June 25, 26
and 27, 1973.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Even assuming that the complainant had indeed noticed some
bubbles in the coffee served to her by the accused on June 26, 1973, the same
has been sufficiently explained by the com­plainant herself when she testified
as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"q - And because of that, what did
you do?</blockquote>

<blockquote>  a - I asked him why, and he told me the
water was boiling when he poured the coffee and it looked like that.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>(t.s.n.,
Areola, January 7, 1974, p. 35.)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Solicitor General's contention that "the bubbles created
by the boiling water could have been blown to nothingness by the time the
appellant arrived in school" has no factual basis.  By the prosecution's own account, the
complainant's boarding house was only 100 meters away from her school.  And it can easily be observed that the time
necessary to negotiate such distance is much shorter than what it takes for the
bubbles in a cup of coffee with boiling water to completely disappear.</p>

<p class="BODY">With respect to the headache and dizziness allegedly felt by the
complainant on the 25th, 26th and 27th of June, 1973, to attribute the same to
the coffee taken by her on said dates would be unreasonable, to say the least.  The complainant her<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">self admitted that her headache and dizziness started even before June
25, 1973 -- the day when the accused started to serve her coffee.  Thus, she testified as follows:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>(t.s.n.,
Areola, January 7, 1974, pp. 33-35. )</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">Since the headache and dizziness of the complainant
started on the 24th while the accused began serving her coffee only on the
25th, to attribute said headache and dizziness to the coffee served by the
accused would be to postulate the existence of the effect ahead of the cause.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court's finding that the condition of the complainant
became worse everytime she took the coffee served by the accused cannot be
sustained.  For, why would the
complainant continue taking the coffee if indeed her condition worsened
everytime she took the same?  Besides,
the claim that complainant's headache became worse on the 25th and her health
poorer on the 26th and 27th is belied by her own testimony that while she took
Medicol on the 24th, on the succeeding days, she stopped taking the same <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">or any medicine for the relief of headache
and dizziness.  Further­more, she
likewise testified that she continued going to school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">There are other facts and circumstances of weight and substance
which the trial court overlooked and which make the version of the accused appear
more credible than that of the com­plainant.</p>

</span><!--[endif]-->The complainant testified that the accused did not immediately
leave her boarding house but had fanned her for sometime after he had allegedly
forced her to their first sexual intercourse at noontime of June 27, 1973.  Such testimony evokes the following
questions:  Is it the natural tendency
of a guilty person to stay by the side of his victim for sometime after
sexually as­saulting her?  Or was the
complainant merely giving a ready excuse or explanation why it happened that
the accused had fanned her for sometime without her objection?  Was she afraid that the defense would expose
her scheme of seduction by presenting a person who saw the accused fanning her
inside her room without her objection?  She knew very well that there were other persons in the boarding house
at that time, and, according to the accused on cross-examination, the
complainant's landlady even entered the room while the accused was fanning the
complainant.</p>

tab-stops:list .55in"><!--[if !supportLists]-->2.<span style="font:7.0pt " times="" new="" roman""="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->While complainant's self-serving testimony that she was merely
forced to go with the accused to their house was not corroborated by any single
piece of evidence, the accused's version that the complainant voluntarily went
with him because she did not want him to leave for Olongapo finds some
corrobora­tion in the letter (Exh. "2") which the complainant
admittedly wrote and gave to the accused.  For, as heretofore quoted, the letter states, among others, that the
complainant learned that the accused was "planning <u>again</u> to
leave."</p>

</span><!--[endif]-->The contents of the letter itself reveal that there was indeed
a relationship of intimacy existing between the complainant and the accused, as
the latter claimed.  For despite the
fact that the letter was written by the complainant in the presence of her mother
and, consequently, she had to conceal whatever intimate relationship she had
with the complainant, nonetheless, words of endearment abound in said
letter.  She even addressed the
accused's mother as "Nang" or "Mother".</p>

</span><!--[endif]-->The testimony of the complainant herself reveals the special
attention she gave to the accused on the days prior to their sexual interlude
despite the fact that they had known each other only for less than a week.  Milagros testified that she was introduced
to Reynaldo on the 21st of June, 1973; that she invited him to her own house
for lunch on the 24th; and that she gave him her picture on the 26th.</p>

tab-stops:list .55in"><!--[if !supportLists]-->5.<span style="font:7.0pt " times="" new="" roman""="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><!--[endif]-->The circumstances under which the complainant first claimed
that she was raped by the accused were such that to have acted otherwise would
have been more prejudicial to her reputation as a teacher and her honor as a
single woman.  For, it must be noted
that by the prosecution's own account, the first time that the complainant
claimed that she was merely forced by the accused was when she was confronted
by her mother in the presence of her District Supervisor, a co-teacher, and a
policeman.  In such a situation, to
admit that the complainant voluntarily went with the accused to the latter's
house where they lived together as husband and wife without first getting
married was much more damaging to her honor than to claim that she was raped
and was merely compelled by the accused to live with him in his house.  The trial court's observation that "if
the act complained of was not committed, it would not be easy to think of a
provinciana taking the value of her honor lightly and telling publicly that she
has been abused several times by a man whom she did not love" would have
been valid had it been possible for the com­plainant to keep away from public
knowledge the fact that she had already slept with the accused in the latter's
house.  But such was not the case.  For it was already of public knowledge that
the complainant and the accused had already been living in the latter's house
as husband and wife without the benefit of marriage; and the complainant was
apparently left with no alternative but to claim that she was merely forced by
the accused.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, that the complainant was merely using the criminal
complaint as leverage to compel the accused to marry her is not a remote
possibility.  For while the accused had
verbally declared his willingness to marry the complainant, his actuations
revealed his hesitation to do so.  On
the very day that the accused and the complainant had their first sexual
intercourse (June 27, 1973), the accused had already attempted to leave their
place.  And as the letter of the
complainant reveals, the accused was again planning to leave at the time said
letter was written (July 5, 1973) and the complainant was thus pleading for him
not to leave.</p>

<p class="BODY">The foregoing facts and circumstances do not only show the
innocence of the accused; they show without doubt in Our mind that he was the
victim of a scheming seductress who tried to destroy him rather than let him
go.  Indeed, life imitates fiction for
"Play Misty for Me" with Clint Eastwood recently shown on Channel 7
has a scenario similar to the case at bar.</p>
