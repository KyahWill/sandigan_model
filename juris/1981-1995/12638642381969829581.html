Manila.</p>

<p class="BODY">The case originated from a complaint for acknowledgment and
partition filed on September 8, 1960 with the then Court of First Instance of
Manila by the herein private respondent, a minor, 18 years of age, assisted by
his mother, Andrea <span class="SpellE">Jongco</span>, as his natural guardian,
against the herein petitioners (Record on Appeal, pp. 2-8).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In the said Complaint, private respondent
alleged, in substance, that in 1941 his alleged father, Antonio C. Alberto, and
his mother, Andrea <span class="SpellE">Jongco</span>, lived together as husband
and wife and as a result of which, he was born on September 10, 1942; that
during the time that his alleged father and mother lived together as husband
and wife and up to the time of his birth, both were single and had no legal
impediment to marry each other; that after his birth, his father and mother
continued living together as husband and wife, his father supporting them and
introducing him to the public as his natural child; that even the family of his
father recognized him as such; that on or about the year 1944, his father and
mother separated, and subsequently, his father married herein petitioner <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> del Rosario; that as a result of the marriage,
two (2) children were born - herein petitioners Lourdes Alberto and Antonio
Alberto, Jr.; that although his father was separated from his mother, he
continued to support him and recognized him as his own child; that on July 3,
1949, his father died, and without notice to him, petitioner <span class="SpellE">Natividad</span> del Rosario <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>. de
Alberto, on July 17, 1949, instituted before the then Court of First Instance
of Manila an intestate proceedings for the estate of his deceased father,
docketed therein as Special Proceedings No. 9092; that in the said intestate
proceedings, petitioners deliberately omitted him as one of the heirs and for
this reason they succeeded in having the properties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">of </span>his deceased father adjudicated and parti<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">tioned among themselves; that the said intestate
proceedings were terminated on November 9, 1953; that his father left
properties valued at P74,963.81, and accordingly, as a natural child of his
father, he is entitled to at least P18,000.00; and that he had absolutely no
previous knowledge of the intestate proceedings and came to know about it only
recently and thereupon made a demand from the petitioners </span>who <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">refused to </span>give <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">him his share.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, he prays that the petitioners be
ordered to acknowledge him as the natural child of Antonio C. Alberto; that his
one-fourth share be turned over to him; and that petitioners be sentenced to
pay him the sum of P5<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">attorney's fee and the cost of suit (Record

explanation for the surprising delay in the filing of the complaint in the case

Antonio Alberto, private respondents were receiving support until the latter

until September 8, 1960 before they filed the present action to assert their
rights despite Andrea <span class="SpellE">Jongco's</span> allegation that they
stopped receiving support after Alberto, Sr.'s death.</p>

them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Private respondents could have
filed the action in 1944 when Andrea <span class="SpellE">Jongco</span> learned

supposed father's lips had been sealed by death and possible witnesses <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">like </span>Antonio Alberto, Sr.'s mother had
become too old to give coherent testimony.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this connection, it must be stated that in the case of Reyes
vs. Court of Appeals, 135 SCRA 439 (1985), this Court, citing the cases of <span class="SpellE">Bercilles</span> vs. GSIS, 128 SCRA 53; People vs. <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Villeza</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, 127 SCRA 349; </span>Cid <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">vs. <span class="SpellE">Burnaman</span>, 24
SCRA 434; <span class="SpellE">Vudaurrazaga</span> vs. C.A., 91 Phil. 492; and
Capistrano vs. <span class="SpellE">Gabino</span>, 8 Phil. 135, ruled that a
birth certificate not signed by the alleged father therein indicated, like in
the instant case, is not competent evidence of paternity.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In casting doubt upon the
credibility of petitioner <span class="SpellE">Natividad's</span> testimony, the
Court </span>of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Appeals pointed out her
serious inconsistency on material points such as her claim that she was married
to the deceased in 1941 and her later admission in the answer that they were
married in 1944.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The record shows,
however, that both admissions were </span>correct, the first marriage was a
secret civil marriage celebrated in <span class="SpellE">Pililla</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span> while the second was a religious ratification of the
former.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The lack of marriage certificate
as evidence was also considered by the Court of Appeals <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as an </span>impairment of credibility
despite a certification to the effect that all pre-war records in the <st1:place><st1:placetype>Municipality</st1:placetype>
 of <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Pililla</span> <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
were destroyed during the last war.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Said
Appellate Court is of the view that if they did plan to marry secretly at that
time, they could have chosen a city or municipality near Manila and that <span class="SpellE">Pililla</span> must have been chosen as the place of the supposed
marriage so that petitioners could have an apparent good reason for the
non-presentation of the marriage certificate.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">As aptly argued by the
petitioners, such </span>conclusion is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">purely
conjectural.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Besides petitioners'
reasons for the choice of that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">place,
</span>the celebration of the marriage was positively confirmed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by <span class="SpellE">Damaso</span> Herrera, </span>one
of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sponsors thereof.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In any event, it is a fundamental rule that conclusions and
findings of fact by the trial court are entitled to great weight on appeal and
should not be disturbed unless for strong and cogent reasons because the trial
court is in a better position to examine real evidence, as well <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">as </span>to
observe the demeanor of the witnesses while testifying in the case (People vs.
Pimentel, 147 SCRA 29, 30 [1987]; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Grefiel</span>,
125 SCRA 108 [1983]; Chase vs. <span class="SpellE">Buencamino</span>, 136 SCRA
381 [1985]; People vs. Fernandez, 124 SCRA 248 [1983]; <span class="SpellE">Olangco</span>
vs. C.F.I. of <span class="SpellE">Misamis</span> Oriental, 121 SCRA 338 [1983]; <span class="SpellE">Minuchechi</span> vs. C.A., 129 SCRA 479 [1984]).</p>

<p class="BODY">After a careful review of the records and the evidence presented
by the contending parties, no cogent reasons could be found to justify the
reversal of the findings of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In view of the foregoing, there appears to be no need to discuss
the last two assignments of errors.</p>
