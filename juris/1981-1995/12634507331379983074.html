was filed by Leonardo Babatio, Municipal Mayor of Motiong, Samar, against Municipal
Judge Jose Z. Tan of said town, with the following charges and specifi­cations:</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.3in;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">"1. For:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Grave Coercion and Unprofessional Conduct<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>On or about December 7, 1974 at about 9:00 o'clock at the
basketball court of Motiong, Samar, when TRANSITO BERMEJO was working at the
damaged portion of the basketball court fronting the municipal hall, Judge Jose
Z. Tan without legal basis arbitrarily forced Transito Bermejo to enter the
municipal jail and against the consent of said Transito Bermejo but due to the justified
resistance of said Bermejo, Judge Tan was not able to put him in jail.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.3in;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“2. For:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Unprofessional Conduct and Reproachable
Personal Behavior<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>On or about August 6, 1974 at the municipality of Motiong, Samar,
Judge Jose Z. Tan in a display of haughtiness, unprofessional conduct and
reproach­able personal behaviour arrogantly threw the fish for sale of Fernando
Java into the ground for the simple reason that the fish Judge Tan bargained
for was not granted by said Fernando Java.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.3in;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“3. For:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Partisan Politics<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>That on or about the 1st day of August, 1974 at Motiong, Samar,
Judge Tan had actively partici­pated in partisan politics in the elections (of)
barangay heads particularly Alfonsa Tan and he was the active promoter of said
Alfonsa Tan, one of the candidates for barangay head.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>That as a consequence of the loss of Alfonsa
Tan to Vicente Bermejo, her stenographer and typist who voted for Vicente
Bermejo was forcibly made to resign.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.3in;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“4. For:<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span><u><span style="font-size: 11pt;">Unprofessional Conduct and Reproachable Behavior<o:p></o:p></span></u></p>

<blockquote>On or about the 6th day of August, 1974, Judge Tan accosted Felix
Rondina, a municipal janitor and told said Felix Rondina, that since you are
the "tuta" (puppy) of the Mayor, you tell him to come and anytime I
will challenge him to a fist fight in the public market or in the plaza.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Tan disregarding his position in the
government called the mayor as an animal like his master Marcos (referring to
President Marcos).</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.3in;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“5. For:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Usurping the functions of the Office of
the Chief of Police of Motiong<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>Judge Jose Z. Tan in a case filed against Glicerio B. Eufracio,
Jr., for Grave Slander by Deed with intent and his full knowledge of the extent
of his authority as municipal judge was the one who personally prepared the
affidavits of the alleged aggrieved party and same complaint was filed in his
Sala.</blockquote>

<p class="OTHERHEADING" style="margin: 15pt 0in; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.3in;" align="left"><span style="font-size: 11pt;">“6. For:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Ordering the arrest without warrant of
arrest<o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<blockquote>On or about the 4th day of July, 1975, in the Poblacion of Motiong,
Samar, Guillermo Lagbo, Fernando Tan and Basilio Lagbo, were illegally arrested
without warrant of arrest and arbitrarily clapped in the municipal jail before
any formal com­plaint was filed upon order of Judge Tan."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">This case was first referred to Judge Segundo Zosa of the Court
of First Instance, Branch I, Catbalogan, Samar, for investigation, report and recommendation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge Zosa conducted several hearings and
when he was transferred to the Court of First Instance, Branch XXXVI at Makati,
Metro Manila, District Judge Wenceslao M. Polo who replaced Judge Zosa took over
the investigation, and submitted the following report dated August 31, 1981:<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>"Evaluating the whole evidence on record, your investigator
finds and is of the honest opinion that of the six (6) charges against the
herein respondent, five (5) counts had been fully substantiated.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In Charge No. 3, for Partisan Politics, to the effect that on
August 1, 1974, the respon­dent promoted the candidacy of Mrs. Alfonsa Tan as
barangay chairman, proof is wanting along this line.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Assuming that such act is prohibited and
therefore a ground for an admi­nistrative action, the only proof adduced
against respondent is that in the morning of July 29, 1974, while in the house
of Marianito Tan at Motiong, Samar, respondent called for Lamberto Pacanza,
Judith Pacanza, Vedasto Dasmarinas, Jr. and his wife, and thereat, the
respondent told them to vote for his candidate, Alfonsa Tan and Vedasto
Dasmarinas, Jr.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This sounds true but
improbable, because Alfonsa Tan is the wife of Marianito Tan, the incumbent
Vice-Mayor who is himself a politician and Vedasto Dasmarinas is also a
candidate for that office and therefore there was no necessity for the
respondent to campaign for their candi­dacy.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, during that day of the voting, it was clearly shown that
respondent was out of his station.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He
was in Catbalogan, Samar.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>To the
assertion that Judith Pacanza, a clerk of the Municipal Court was made to
resign by the respondent on the ground that she did not vote for the candidate
of the latter, the declaration of the two (2) witnesses presented to prove or
establish this point has no leg to stand for the reason that Judith Pacanza
herself was not pre­sented as a witness.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"For Charge Nos. 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 however, the evidence is
preponderant and convincing against the herein respondent.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"When the complainant and his witnesses were presented, they
testified in a natural manner, they declared without hesitation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Your Investigator found no circumstance which
would impeach their <span style="">truthfulness nor
conditions which would render their narration inherently improbable.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Besides, in the absence of a convincing proof
which would tend to show that these witnesses had any ulterior motive to
testify against the respondent, their assertions or declarations could be
relied upon, more especially the policemen of Motiong, Samar, as witnesses for
the complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They, being merely
municipal officials or employees who testified as to what transpired in the
performance of their duties, were neutral and disinterested and has no reason
therefore to falsely testify against the respondent.<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>"Analyzing the evidence supporting the defense presented by
the respondent, Your Investigator found that the declarations of the respondent
and his witnesses do not deserve credibility for lack of sufficient proof to
peg the holes of weak recollections.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
assertion of the respondent that he did not actually stop Transito Bermejo and
his two (2) laborers from working on the damaged portion of the cemented
basketball court and the municipal auditorium but merely explained to him that
they were destroying government property and also did not force Bermejo to
enter the municipal jail, as a result his T-shirt was torn; that he did not
arrogantly throw the fish for sale at the market of the vendor Fernando Jaba
and that, he did not utter a challenging remark to a fight to the municipal
mayor while at the public market on that day, cannot prevail over the positive
decla­rations of the witnesses of the complainant who testified on the
matter.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As a municipal judge, it is not
a part of his duty nor incumbent upon him to call the Philippine Constabulary
to main­tain peace and order during the celebration of the fiesta of that town,
much less to check on the projects of the municipal government on whether or
not they are being undertaken according to specifications.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is a function of the head of the local
government of that town.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>By doing so,
the respondent stooped too low and even went to the level of a laborer and a
fish vendor and, pre­sumably has forgotten that he was holding a position
invested with public trust and confidence principally charged with the
administration of justice in that area.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"On the claim that the case against Glicerio Eufracio, Jr. for
Slander by Deed filed by Francisca Gaviola on March 10, 1975, the pleading and
affidavit <span style="">was prepared by Atty. Manuel
Torrevillas, Jr. on </span>that day, the same cannot prevail over the
declaration of Acting Chief of Police Bermejo who saw respondent himself
preparing the papers after which accompanied the complainant to his office for
his (Bermejo's) signature.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the
record or the docket of that Court does not show that Atty. Torrevillas
appeared as private prosecutor in that case.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"The same is true to Charge No. 6.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Precisely, the respondent presumably cons­cious
of the fact that the three (3) accused (Basilio Lagbo, Guillermo Lagbo and
Fernando Tan) were already detained at the municipal jail, after Acting Chief
of Police Bermejo refused to sign that criminal complaint for Slander by Deed,
already prepared for his signature, for the reason that he had no hand in the
investigation of the case, the respondent even admitted that he assisted or
guided the complainant Vedasto Dasmariñas, Jr. in his office or chamber in
preparing the complaint and affidavit to be signed by the said complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>After this complaint was finished that
evening, the same was filed and docketed by the respondent after which a
warrant of arrest was issued.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Considering the nature of the case and that day being a
holiday, the respondent acted precipitately in accepting the complaint and
issuing the bench warrant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He even went
beyond the call of duty by assisting if not preparing the pleadings for the
complainant.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>He should have been more
prudent and circumspect in the discharge of his duties so as to obviate the
suspicion that he was in cahoots with the offended party in that case for the
purpose of using the strong arm of the law against the accused."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The Investigating Judge found that respondent failed to live up
to his sworn duties and is guilty of grave misconduct in office, despite which,
however, he recommends that respondent judge be only reprimanded and admonished
that a repetition of the same offense will be dealt with more severely,
considering that his transfer to the Municipal Court of Sta. Rita, Samar, a far
distant town which is sometimes not accessible by road and saturated by NPAs
may already be regarded as sufficient punishment to him.</p>

<p class="BODY">Deputy Court Administrator Arturo Buena disagrees with the Inves­tigating
Judge and recommends that he be separated from the service.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We agree with Deputy Court Administrator
Buena considering that from the established facts and findings of the
Investigating Judge five of the six (6) serious charges against respondent
judge have been fully substantiated.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
acts attributed to him and duly proven constitute serious misconduct and want
on abuse of authority prejudicial to the judiciary and to public interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">As borne out by the records, respondent judge has miserably
failed to conduct himself within the confines of propriety.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We deplore his use of the power of his office
without restraint, which to Our mind, not only demeans his judicial office but
also erodes the confidence of the people in the Bench, making him unfit to
continue in the service to which the people take recourse for their protection
and comfort.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>His actuations placed the
court in danger of disrepute, which We must zealously guard against, if We have
to maintain the confidence of the people in the whole judicial machinery.</p>

<p class="BODY">At this point, it is well to quote the exhortation of the Canons
of Judicial Ethics:</p>

<blockquote>A judge's official conduct should be free from appearance of
impropriety, and his personal behavior not only upon the bench and in the
performance of judicial duties, but also in his everyday life, should be beyond
reproach.<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><b>Accordingly</b>, respondent judge is hereby separated from the
service, as recommended, for serious misconduct with forfeiture of all
retirement benefits and pay and with prejudice to reinstatement to any position
in the national or local government, including government owned or controlled
corporations, agencies or instrumentalities.</p>
