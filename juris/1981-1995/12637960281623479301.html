				<H3>IN THE MATTER OF PROCEEDINGS FOR DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST ATTY. WENCESLAO LAURETA, AND OF CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS AGAINST EVA MARAVILLA-ILUSTRE IN G. R. NO. 68635, ENTITLED "EVA MARAVILLA-ILUSTRE VS. HON. INTERMEDIATE APPELLATE COURT, ET AL." <br /><br />R E S O L U T I O N</H3>

				<BR><BR><p align="justify">In almost identical letters dated 20 October 1986, personally 
sent to Justices Andres R. Narvasa, Ameurfina M. Herrera, and Isagani A. Cruz, 
and a fourth letter, dated 22 October 1986 addressed to Justice Florentino P. 
Feliciano, all members of the First Division of this Court, (incorporated herein 
by reference), and in feigned ignorance of the Constitutional requirement that 
the Court's Divisions are composed of, and must act through, at least five (5) 
members, and in a stance of dangling threats to effect a change of the Court's 
adverse resolution, petitioner Eva Maravilla Ilustre wrote in part:<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
"Please forgive us for taking the liberty of addressing you this letter which 
<em>we do hope you will read very carefully</em>.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is important to 
call your attention to the dismissal of Case No. G. R. 68635 entitled '<em>Eva 
Maravilla Ilustre vs. Hon. Intermediate Appellate Court, <em>et al.</em>'</em>, 
by an untenable minute-resolution although an extended one, dated 14 May 1986 
which we consider as an unjust resolution deliberately and knowingly promulgated 
by the First Division of the Supreme Court of which you are a member.</p>

May 1986; the second, dated 9 July 1986; and the third, 3 September 1986, 
railroaded with such hurry/promptitude unequalled in the entire history of the 
Supreme Court under circumstances that have gone beyond the limits of legal and 
judicial ethics.</p></blockquote>

<em>There is nothing final in this world.&nbsp; We assure you that this case is far 
from finished by a long shot.&nbsp; For at the proper time, we shall so act and bring 
this case before another forum where the members of the Court can no longer deny 
our action with minute resolutions that are not only unjust but are knowingly 
and deliberately promulgated</em>.&nbsp; The people deserve to know how the members 
of the highest tribunal of the land perform in the task of decision making by 
affixing their respective signatures on judgments that they render on petitions 
that they themselves give due course.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please understand that we are 
pursuing further remedies in our quest for justice under the law.&nbsp; We intend to 
hold responsible members of the First Division who participated in the 
promulgation of these three minute-resolutions in question.&nbsp; For the members 
thereof cannot claim immunity when their action runs afoul with penal sanctions, 
even in the performance of official functions; like others, none of the division 
members are above the law.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In our quest for justice, we wish to 
avoid doing injustice to anyone, particularly the members of the First Division, 
<em>providing that they had no hand in the promulgation of the resolution in 
question</em>.&nbsp; That is why we are requesting you to inform us your 
participation in the promulgation of these resolutions in question.&nbsp; Even we who

our poverty by sheer power and influence.&nbsp; We shall then wait for your reply.&nbsp; 
If, however, we do not hear from you after a week, then we will consider your 
silence that you supported the dismissal of our petition.&nbsp; We will then be 
guided accordingly.&nbsp; (Emphasis supplied).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The letter also attacked the participation in the case of 
Justice Pedro L. Yap, Chairman of the First Division in this wise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"As Division Chairman, Associate Justice Pedro Yap, as a copy 
of Resolution dated 14 May 1986 we received indicate, did not even have the 
elementary courtesy of putting on record that he voluntarily inhibited himself 
from participating in the promulgation of this minute-resolution, although an 
extended one, which he should have done consistent with judicial decorum and the 
Canons of judicial Ethics.&nbsp; After all he is the law partner of 'Atty. Sedfrey A. 
Ordonez, counsel for respondents, now the distinguished Solicitor General x x x 
indicative that even at this stage of the proceeding in point of time, the 
Supreme Court still recognizes Atty. Sedfrey A. Ordonez as counsel for 
respondents, even as he is already the Solicitor General.&nbsp; For not withdrawing 
from the case formally Atty. Ordonez has manifested his unmitigated arrogance 
that he does not respect the Canons of Professional Ethics, similar to the 
actuation of his law partner, Associate Justice Pedro Yap, Chairman of the First 
Division of the Supreme Court, <em>an act that further aggravates the growing 
wrinkles in the domain of judicial statesmanship, impressed as it is, with very 
serious and dangerous implications</em>.</p>
<p align="justify">"(9), By 11 April 1986, date of the reorganization of the First 
Division, Atty. Sedfrey A. Ordonez already became the Solicitor General.&nbsp; With 
such <em>amazingly magical coincidence</em>, Dr. Pedro Yap, law partner of Atty. 
Sefrey A. Ordonez in the law firm Salonga, Ordonez, Yap, Padlan became the 
Chairman of the Division.<br></p></blockquote>

<p align="justify"><em>Was it possible for Chairman Yap to have convinced the 
Division members that Maravilla petition is without merit</em>, and since the 
members — the new ones knew nothing about the case, readily agreed to the 
dismissal of the petition by a minute-resolution — an extended one.&nbsp; After all, 
this was the case of the Solicitor General.&nbsp; If this is what happened, then we 
are sorry to say that <em>you were deliberately 'had'</em>.<br><br>After all, 
the 14 May 1986 untenable minute resolution although an extended one, does not

letter to the authorities concerned so that they will know where to look, when 
it becomes necessary</em>." (Emphasis supplied)
<p></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The aforesaid letters were included in the Agenda of the First 
Division of 22 October 1986, were "Noted", and referred <em><em>en consulta</em> 
</em>to the Court <em><em>en banc</em></em>.<br><br>On 28 October 1986, the 
Court <em>en banc</em> took up the background and history of the case, found no 
reason to take any further action, and referred the case back to the First 
Division "as set forth in the latter's resolution of October 27, 1986".&nbsp; In this 
Resolution, the First Division traced the history of the case, clarified that 
Justice Yap assumed his position in this Court only on 2 May 1986; that when the 
resolution of dismissal was issued on 14 May 1986, Justice Abad Santos was the 
incumbent Chairman of the First Division, and that Justice Yap was unaware that 
Atty. Ordonez was private respondents' counsel; that upon realization thereof, 
Justice Yap inhibited himself from further participation in the case; and that 
Justice Yap was designated Chairman of the First Division only on 14 July 1986, 
after the compulsory retirement of Justice Vicente Abad Santos on 12 July 1986.&nbsp; 
The Resolution of the First Division (incorporated herein by reference) 
concluded thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<div align="justify">"The dispositions in this case were arrived at after careful 
study.&nbsp; Because a case is resolved against the interests of a party, does not 
mean that it is an 'unjust decision' or that it has been 
'railroaded'.<br><br>"This Division declares without hesitation that it has 
consistently rendered justice without fear or favor.&nbsp; YAP, J., took no 
part."<br><br>On 3 November 1986, petitioner again addressed similar letters to 
Justices Narvasa, Herrera, and Cruz, (incorporated herein by reference), 
excerpts from which follow:<br><br>"It is rather amazing that when we wrote you 
our previous letter, we never dreamed that you would rush, as you did rush for 
assistance <em>en consulta</em> with the Honorable Court <em>en banc</em>.&nbsp; The 
unfortunate part of it all is the fact that the Court <em>en banc</em> had to 
promulgate its resolution dated 28 October 1986 which to us when considered in 
its entirety, is <em>just as untenable </em>as the First Division extended and 
unsigned minute-resolution of 14 May 1986.<br><br>"Evidently you misunderstood 
our point of inquiry, to wit:&nbsp; '<em>Did you or did you not approve the dismissal 
of our petition under</em> ?<br><br>"1)&nbsp; The 14 May 1986 minute resolution?&nbsp; 
<em>Yes or No</em>.<br><br>2)&nbsp; The 9 July 1986 minute resolution?&nbsp; <em>Yes or 
No</em>.<br><br>3)&nbsp; The 3 Sept. 1986 minute resolution?&nbsp; <em>Yes or 
No</em>.<br><br>"That was all we asked.&nbsp; The other matters contained in our 
letter were intended merely to give you the highlights of our case.&nbsp; This is 
what we wanted to know to properly guide us when we finally bring our case 
<em>to the other forum of justice</em>.<br><br>"Did it ever occur to you that 
when you and the other members of the First Division referred our letters to the 
Honorable Court <em>en banc</em> <em>en consulta it was all your fault that the 
Court en banc had to promulgate its unsigned extended minute-resolution that 
unfortunately exposed the distinguished members of the newly reorganized Supreme 
Court and, at the same time, convicted themselves as guilty of distorting facts

Court, petitioner filed on 16 December 1986 an Affidavit — Complaint before the 
Tanodbayan, totally disregarding the facts and circumstances and legal

Division and <em>en banc</em>.&nbsp; Some Members of this Court were maliciously 
charged with having knowingly and deliberately rendered, with bad faith, an 
unjust, extended Minute Resolution "making" her opponents the "illegal owners" 
of vast estates.&nbsp; Some Justices of the Court of Appeals were similarly 
maliciously charged with knowingly rendering their "unjust resolution" of 20 
January 1984" through manifest and evident bad faith", when their Resolution had 
in fact and law been upheld by this Court.&nbsp; Additionally, Solicitor General 
Sedrey Ordonez and Justice Pedro Yap of this Court were also maliciously charged

members of the First Division of this Court into promulgating their "unjust 
extended Minute Resolution of 14 May 1986".<br><br>All the foregoing, in 
complete disregard of the Resolutions of this Court, as the tribunal of last

<p align="center">(1) </p>
<p align="justify">In her Compliance-Answer filed on February 9, 1987, wherein Eva 
Maravilla Ilustre prays that the contempt proceedings against her be dismissed, 
she contends, in essence, that:&nbsp; (1) "there was no intention to affront the 
honor and dignity" of the Court; (2) the letters addressed to the individual 
Justices were private in character and were never meant for anybody, much less 
the Supreme Court <em>en banc</em>, "there (being) a constitutional mandate 
affording protection to privacy of communications;" (3) if her statements in 
those letters were really contemptuous, the Court "should have immediately taken 
disciplinary proceedings" against her, and not having done so, the Court has 
"forfeited" that right and is now "estopped" from doing so; this citation for 
contempt is a "vindictive reprisal" for her having filed the complaint before 
the Tanodbayan, "an action that lacks sincerity, taken not in the spirit of 
judicial statemanship"; (4) she instituted the complaint before the Tanodbayan 
"in my honest belief that I lost my case before the Supreme Court not because of 
lack of merit or of its own merits, assisted by attorneys who offered their 
services in the prosecution of my case"; (5) the newspaper publicity of this 
case "was no fault of mine; neither is it the fault of my former counsel Dean 
Wenceslao Laureta", who prevailed upon her to call off the press conference with 
TV and radio coverage; that she is not a "disgruntled litigant" who thrice lost 
before the Court, rather, she has challenged the validity of the resolutions of 
the Court "containing distortion of facts, conjectures and mistaken inferences" 
particularly, in that (a) there is no <em>res judicata</em>, (b) the Court of 
Appeals in its decision declared that the judgment of the trial Court had long 
attained finality, so that it can no longer be set aside, (c) her "opponents", 
clients of Atty. Ordoñez, are not entitled to own her aunt's "vast properties" 
whether under the law of testate or intestate succession or mixed succession", 
(d) that the statement in this Court's Resolution that the Court of Appeals had 
denied intervention is an "unadulterated distortion of the facts"; (6) the 
statement in the <em>en banc</em> Resolution that some Justices of the Court of 
Appeals were similarly maliciously charged with knowingly rendering their 
"unjust resolution" of 20 January 1984 is a bit "premature, a pre-judgment over 
a case over which this Court does not have jurisdiction;" (7) Atty. Laureta is 
not her counsel in the case before the Tanodbayan; (8) before the latter body, 
she has "established not only probable cause but has also proved the collective 
culpability (of the Justices concerned) as charged"; (9) and that her 53-page 
Motion for Reconsideration before the Tanodbayan is made an integral part of her 
Answer.</p>
<p align="center">(2) </p>
<p align="justify">In his own Answer, Atty. Laureta maintains substantially that:&nbsp; 
(1) he is not respondent Ilustre's counsel before the Tanodbayan and that she 
has consulted and/or engaged the services of other attorneys in the course of 
the prosecution of her case, like Atty. Edgardo M. Salandanan and Atty. Vedastro 
B. Gesmundo; that he just learned from other sources that respondent Ilustre was 
planning to bring her case to the Tanodbayan with the assistance of other 
lawyers who offered her their legal services; (2) it was he who dissuaded her 
from calling her intended press conference and from circulating copies of her 
complaint "not only in the performance of duty as an officer of the court, but 
also as a former president of Manila III Chapter of the Integrated Bar of the 
Philippines and as a professional lecturer in Legal and Judicial Ethics in some 
Manila law schools in his desire to protect and uphold the honor and dignity of 
the Supreme Court as the highest tribunal of the land." He should, therefore, be 
given "a little bit of credit for what he did" instead of taking this 
disciplinary proceeding against him; that Ms. Ilustre is not a "disgruntled 
litigant" who "lost her case thrice in this Court"; (3) he did not prepare 
respondent Ilustre's letters to the individual Justices, "appearances to the 
contrary notwithstanding"; that these letters were "never, at any time, 
considered as constituting contempt of court" in the resolutions of this Court, 
otherwise, "it would have taken immediate disciplinary action as it is doing 
now"; the Court has lost its right to consider the statements in the letters as 
constituting contempt and it is now "estopped" from proceeding with this 
disciplinary action; (4) by doing so, this Court has "unmistakably revealed the 
intent and character that underlie its present action as a vindictive judicial 
vengeance, inconsistent with the spirit of judicial statesmanship by hiding 
behind the well-recognized fact that the Supreme Court is supreme in the domain 
of the administration of justice"; (5) "there was no disregard intended to the 
Resolution of the Honorable Court, as the tribunal of last resort, relative to 
its upholding the judgment of the Court of Appeals"; he is just doing "his duty 
as an officer of the court to put the records in this regard in their proper 
light"; particularly (a) that the judgment of the trial court had attained its 
finality long ago, (b) the doctrine of <em>res judicata</em> is inapplicable, 
otherwise, this Court would not have remanded the case to the Court of Appeals 
for review, (c) the observation in the First Division's extended Resolution of 
14 May 1986 that Justice Yap was unaware that Atty. Ordoñez was private 
respondents' counsel "defies every vestige of human understanding"; that Justice 
Yap had forthwith inhibited himself from participating in the case is not borne 
out by the record of this case.&nbsp; Justice Yap had "never voluntarily entered on 
the record his inhibition" when he should have done so when respondent Ilustre's 
petition was taken up; Justice Yap's partner, Atty. Ordoñez, continued to be 
recognized by this Court as counsel for private respondents even as he was 
already the Solicitor General; (6) finally, "appearances to the contrary 
notwithstanding, he has not committed acts unworthy of his profession.&nbsp; The 
truth of the matter is, he should at least be credited in whatever small way for 
his acts and efforts taken by him to protect and uphold the honor and dignity of 
the Honorable Court".<br><br>We find the explanations of both Ms. Ilustre and 
Atty. Laureta unsatisfactory.&nbsp; Their claims that they had done nothing that 
could constitute an affront to the honor and dignity of this Court dissipate in 
the face of attendant facts and circumstances and "defy every vestige of human 
understanding", to use their own language.&nbsp; Indeed, they should not "think that 
they will win a hearing by the sheer multiplication of words." (Mathew 
6:7).<br><br>Respondents' reliance on the "privacy of communication" is 
misplaced.&nbsp; Letters addressed to individual Justices, in connection with the 
performance of their judicial functions become part of the judicial record and 
are a matter of concern for the entire Court.&nbsp; The contumacious character of 
those letters constrained the First Division to refer the same to the Court 
<em>en banc</em>, <em>en consulta</em> and so that the Court <em>en banc</em> 
could pass upon the judicial acts of the Division.&nbsp; It was only in the exercise 
of forbearance by the Court that it refrained from issuing immediately a show 
cause order in the expectancy that after having read the Resolution of the Court 
<em>en banc</em> of October 28, 1986, respondents would realize the unjustness 
and unfairness of their accusations.<br><br>The Court is far from "estopped" in 
initiating these proceedings.&nbsp; The Chief Justice had promptly announced in his 
Statement, dated December 23, 1986, that "the Supreme Court will take 
appropriate steps on the matter upon its resumption of sessions on the first 
working day of the year."<br><br>There is no vindictive reprisal involved.&nbsp; The 
Court's authority and duty under the premises is unmistakable.&nbsp; It must act to 
preserve its honor and dignity from the scurrilous attacks of an irate lawyer, 
mouthed by his client, and to safeguard the morals and ethics of the legal 
profession.<br><br>We are not convinced that Atty. Laureta had nothing to do 
with respondent Ilustre's letters to the individual Justices, nor with the 
complaint filed before the Tanodbayan.&nbsp; In the Motion for Reconsideration, dated 
June 11, 1986, filed by Atty. Laureta in the main petition, he stressed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"10.&nbsp;&nbsp; The composition of the First Division was reduced to 
five members.&nbsp; Strangely enough, about one month later, the Honorable Court 
promulgated its extended resolution with such promptitude in the entire history 
of the Supreme Court, unequalled in a manner of speaking.&nbsp; x x 
x"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">In the Manifestation and Motion, dated June 25, 1986, filed by 
Atty. Laureta (p. 311, <em>Rollo</em>), the same phrases were incanted:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"the promptitude with which the Resolution of 14 May 1986 was 
promulgated (par. 9, Motion for Reconsideration, p. 5) unequalled in the entire 
history of the Supreme Court in so far as petitions given due course is 
concerned x x x" (Emphasis given) </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Those same terms are reproduced verbatim in the letters 
ostensibly authored by respondent Ilustre addressed to the individual Justices 
whom respondents have charged.&nbsp; Thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"We consider the three minute resolutions x x x railroaded with 
such hurry/promptitude unequalled in the entire history of the Supreme Court 
under circumstances that have gone beyond the limits of legal and judicial 
ethics" (Ltr. to Justice Narvasa, p. 2; ltr. to Justice Herrera, p. 2; ltr. to 
Justice Cruz, p. 2).</p></blockquote>

history of the Supreme Court" (Ltr. to Justice Narvasa, p. 5; ltr. to Justice 
Herrera, p. 5; ltr. to Justice Cruz, p. 5)."
<p></p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The same terminologies are reiterated in the Complaint and in 
the Motion for Reconsideration filed before the Tanodyan (p. 2).<br><br>Further, 
in his Manifestation &amp; Motion, dated June 25, 1986, Atty. Laureta 
stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"counsel for petitioner personally inquired from Division Clerk 
of Court Corazon Serevo the following:<br><br>(1)&nbsp; When was the above-entitled 
case deliberated by the First Division?<br><br>(2)&nbsp; Are there recorded minutes 
of such deliberation?<br><br>(3)&nbsp; Who among the members of the Division voted 
for dismissal of the petition to be promulgated by resolution and who did not, 
if any?<br><br>(4)&nbsp; Who prepared the Resolution?" (p. 312, 
<em>Rollo</em>).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Atty. Laureta's obsession to receive the answer to his queries 
surfaces again in the second letters dated November 3, 1986 to the individual 
Justices under the supposed signatures of respondent Ilustre, thus:</p>
<p align="justify">"Evidently you misunderstood our point of inquiry in our first 
letter.&nbsp; It is a very simple inquiry, to wit <em>Did you or did you not approve 
the dismissal of our petition under</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">1) The 14 May 1986 minute resolution? <em>Yes or 
No</em><br><br>2) The 9 July 1986 minute resolution? <em>Yes or 
No</em><br><br>3) The 3 Sept. 1986 minute resolution? <em>Yes or 
No</em>."<br><br>(Underscoring original) (Ltr. to Justice Narvasa, p. 1; to 
Justice Herrera, p. 1; to Justice Cruz, p. 1)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Additionally, the disparaging remarks like:&nbsp; exertion of 
"undue" and "powerful influence" by Atty. Ordoñez and Justice Yap; "distortion 
of facts, conjectures and mistaken references"; "untenable minute resolution 
although extended"; "unjust minute resolution" repeated by Atty. Laureta in his 
several pleadings, echoed and re-echoed in the individual letters to the 
Justices, as well as in the Complaint and the Motion for Reconsideration before 
the Tanodbayan, reveal the not-too-hidden hand of Atty. Laureta.<br><br>The 
foregoing is bolstered by the reports received by the members of the Court that 
copies of the complaint filed with the Tanodbayan were distributed to the 
editors of the metropolitan newspapers in envelopes bearing the name of 
respondent Laureta, who was heard over the radio speaking on the same complaint, 
and that he was following up the complaint and the motion for reconsideration of 
the order of dismissal of the Tanodbayan.<br><br>Furthermore, respondent Laureta 
as his co-respondent Ilustre's lawyer had control of the proceedings.&nbsp; As 
stressed by this Court in an early case, as such lawyer, "Whatever steps his 
client takes should be within his knowledge and responsibility.&nbsp; Indeed, Canon 
16 of the Canons of Legal Ethics should have reminded him that '(a) lawyer 
should use his best efforts to restrain and to prevent his clients from doing 
those things which the lawyer himself ought not to do, particularly with 
reference to their conduct towards courts, judicial officers, jurors, witnesses 
and suitors.&nbsp; If a client persists in such wrongdoing the lawyer should 
terminate their relation.'" (In Re:&nbsp; <em>Contempt Proceedings in Surigao Mineral 
Reservation Board vs. Cloribel</em>, 31 SCRA 1, 23) Respondent Laureta 
manifestly failed to discharge such responsibility.&nbsp; For all intents and 
purposes, he appears to have encouraged and abetted his client in denigrating 
the members of the First Division of this Court, by baselessly charging them 
with rendering an "unjust" resolution with "deliberate bad faith," because of 
his stubborn insistence on his untenable arguments which had been rejected as 
without merit by the Court's First Division, whose Resolution was upheld by the 
Court <em>en banc</em>.&nbsp; Worse, the dissemination in the print and broadcast 
media in bold captions falsely depicting the Justices as "FAC(ING) GRAFT 
CHARGES" instead of the baseless rantings of a disgruntled litigant appear to 
have been timed to place them in a bad light at the height of the Christmas 
season.<br><br>We come now to the specific accusations of 
respondents.<br><br>They charge Associate Justices Vicente Abad Santos (retired) 
then Chairman of the First Division of the Supreme Court as of May 14, 1986, 
Andres Narvasa, Ameurfina M. Herrera, and Pedro Yap for knowingly and 
deliberately rendering their "unjust, extended Resolution of May 14, 1986" 
dismissing their petition in this case with manifest and evident bad faith to 
make the clients of Atty. Sedfrey A. Ordoñez (now the Solicitor General) the 
"illegal owners" of the estates of Digna Maravilla, thereby causing the heirs of 
Ponciano Maravilla (Digna's eldest brother) undue injury by depriving them of 
their rights over the estates of Digna Maravilla (Charge No. Three before the 
Tanodbayan).&nbsp; They further charge Justice Yap (and Atty. Sedfrey Ordoñez) of 
having "persuad(ed), induc(ed) and influenc(ed) the members of the newly 
organized First Division into promulgating their "unjust, extended minute 
Resolution of 14 May 1986" (Charge No. One before the Tanodbayan), which 
Resolution, (the "Division Resolution", for short) is herewith attached as Annex 
"A".<br><br>Preliminarily, respondents deny that respondent Ilustre lost three 
times in this Court.&nbsp; It cannot be denied, however, that, as stated in the 
Resolution of October 28, 1986 of the Court <em>en banc</em>, this is the third 
time (in fact, the fourth, if we include <em>Fernandez, <em>et al.</em> vs. 
Maravilla</em>, L-18799, 10 SCRA 589 [1964]) that a controversy involving the 
estate of the late Digna Maravilla is elevated to this Court.&nbsp; The first was in 
G. R. No. L-23225 (37 SCRA 672 [1971], where this Court ruled:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"IN VIEW OF THE FOREGOING, the decree of the court below 
denying probate of the 1944 will of Digna Maravilla (Exhibit 'A') is reversed 
and the said testament is hereby ordered probated.&nbsp; Let the records be returned 
to the Court of origin for further proceedings conformable to law.&nbsp; x x x 
"</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">As stated in the <em>en banc</em> Resolution of October 28, 
1986 (hereto attached as Annex "B", and hereinafter referred as the 
"<em>Banc</em> Decision") while respondent Ilustre was not a party in that case, 
upon remand of the case to the probate Court, she and other children of the 
deceased brothers and sisters of the testatrix filed two Motions for 
Intervention.&nbsp; Respondent Ilustre's participation in the estate involved, 
therefore, harks back to that first case.<br><br>The Court of Appeals resolved 
the issue of intervention in CA-G.R. No. 05394, entitled "<em>Heirs of Pastor 
Maravilla, <em>et al.</em> vs. Hon. Ernesto S. Tengco, <em>et al.</em></em>" in 
a Decision penned by Justice Venicio Escolin (hereinafter referred to as the 
"Escolin Decision") wherein it was categorically ruled that there was no point 
to allowing intervention on the part of respondent Ilustre, et als., "for 
failure to show any right or interest in the estate in question." Thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As heretofore stated, private respondents, in their 
counter-petition for <em>mandamus</em>, seek this Court's resolution on the 
petitioners' motion for intervention in Sp. Proc. No. 4977.&nbsp; In their respective 
pleadings and memoranda, the parties have lengthily discussed the issue of 
whether or not petitioners may be allowed to intervene; and the same may as well 
be determined in the present case, if only 'to avoid or, at least, minimize 
further protracted controversy' between the parties (<em>PCIB vs. Hon. 
Escolin</em>, 56 SCRA 266).&nbsp; A resolution of this issue should render moot and 
academic the question anent the disqualification of respondent Judge.<br><br>We 
agree with private respondents that petitioners' motions far intervention are 
devoid of merit, for failure on their part to show any right or interest in the 
estate in question.&nbsp; There is no dispute that the last will and testament of the 
late Digna Maravilla had already been admitted to probate in a final judgment 
which the Supreme Court promulgated on March 2, 1971 (G.R. No. L-23225).&nbsp; In the 
said will, Digna instituted her husband Herminio Maravilla as —</p></blockquote>

<p align="justify"><br>The above testamentary provision for the universal heirship 
of Herminio Maravilla over the residue of the decedent's present and future 
property legally and completely excluded the petitioners, as collateral 
relatives of the testatrix, from inheriting any part of the latter's estate 
through intestate succession or mixed succession.&nbsp; Having no forced or 
compulsory heirs, except her husband, the testatrix had the absolute freedom to 
institute the latter as her sole, universal heir, and such freedom is recognized 
by the Article 842 of the Civil Code, which provides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">'ART. 842.&nbsp; One who has no compulsory heirs may dispose by will 
of all his estate or any part of it in favor of any person having capacity to 
succeed. </p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">One who has compulsory heirs may dispose of his estate provided 
he does not contravene the provisions of this Code with regard to the legitime 
of said heirs."<br><br>There is therefore no point in allowing the petitioners, 
who clearly appear to have no interest in the estate, to intervene in the 
proceedings involving the settlement thereof.</p>

<p align="justify">The aforesaid Decision was affirmed by this Court in G. R. No. 
L-46155 on November 9, 1977 and has become final.&nbsp; That was the second case 
involving the estate filed before this Court.<br><br>Respondents' contention, 
therefore, that the statement in the Banc Resolution "that the Court of Appeals 
had denied intervention" is an "unadulterated distortion of the facts" is 
obviously erroneous and intended to mislead.<br><br>The "Escolin Decision" (in 
CA?G.R. No. 05394-R), which had become final, also finally foreclosed any claim 
that respondent Ilustre, and those who sought to intervene with her, may have 
had on the estate of Digna Maravilla.&nbsp; In unmistakable terms, what the Court of 
Appeals held in that Decision, affirmed by this Court, bears repeating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The above testamentary provision for the universal heirship of 
Herminio Maravilla over the residue of the decedent's present and future 
property legally and completely excluded the petitioners, as collateral 
relatives of the testatrix, from inheriting any part of the latter's estate 
through intestate succession or mixed succession.&nbsp; x x x "</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">To circumvent that judgment, however, two years later, or on 
February 29, 1979, respondent Ilustre, with respondent Laureta as counsel, filed 
a complaint for partition of Digna Maravilla's estate and for damages against 
the heirs of Digna Maravilla's husband, who had then passed away (docketed as 
Civil Case No. X-404), before the Court of First Instance of Negros Occidental, 
San Carlos City, Branch X, presided over by Judge Antonia Corpuz Macandog.&nbsp; That 
Court, after declaring defendants therein (private respondents in the petition 
under review) in default, ordered "all properties of Digna Maravilla mentioned 
in this case to go back to their trunk of origin, the plaintiffs herein who are 
represented by Eva Maravilla Ilustre and Eva Maravilla Ilustre herself" 
(hereinafter referred to as the "Macandog Decision").&nbsp; In addition, the judgment 
awarded damages to the respondent Ilustre, et als., (the plaintiffs therein), 
and the sum of P100,000.00 to their counsel, respondent Laureta.<br><br>A 
special civil action for certiorari was filed by the defeated parties (private 
respondents in the petition under review) before this Court, docketed as G. R. 
No. L-58014, praying that the lower Court's declaration of default in Civil Case 
No. X-404 and all other actions or decisions taken thereafter be declared null 
and void and that the dismissal of the complaint be ordered.&nbsp; On January 21, 
1982, this Court resolved to refer the case to the Court of Appeals in aid of 
its appellate jurisdiction, questions of fact being involved.<br><br>In a 
Decision dated January 14, 1983, the Court of Appeals (Fourth Division),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> in AC-G.R. SP No. 13680 (hereafter called 
the "Busran Decision"), dismissed the petition and denied certiorari stating in 
one breath that "the judgment subject of assail had long become final" (at p. 
13), and in another "for all we know, the judgment below had already attained 
finality long ago." The reason relied upon was that petitioners therein had the 
remedy of appeal but instead availed of Certiorari, which is not a substitute 
therefor.<br><br>On motion for reconsideration, however, filed by petitioners 
(private respondents in the petition under review), in that appealed case 
(AC-G.R. SP No. 13680), the same Court of Appeals (Fourth Special Cases 
Division)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup> in its Resolution of January 
20, 1984 (the "Javellana Resolution"), reconsidered and set aside the "Busran 
Decision" and entered another one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"1.&nbsp; Annulling the order of default of the Hon. respondent 
Court dated 29 April 1980 and its decision dated 11 August 1981; and<br><br>2.&nbsp; 
Dismissing private respondents' complaint in Civil Case No. X-404 and ordering 
the Hon. respondent Court not to take further action therein."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Respondent Ilustre challenged that reversal in the present 
Petition for Review filed on October 22, 1984.&nbsp; This is the third case brought 
before this Court involving the same estate.&nbsp; Review was denied in an extended 
minute Resolution by the First Division of this Court in the challenged 
Resolution of May 14, 1986, for the following reasons:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The appealed Decision stands on firm legal 
grounds.<br><br>(1)&nbsp; The Order of Default of the Trial Court was issued in grave 
abuse of discretion.&nbsp; The Answer was filed only one day late besides the fact 
that when so filed, the Order of default had not yet been issued by the Trial 
Court.<br><br>(2)&nbsp; While appeal is, indeed, the remedy from a judgment by 
default, Certiorari may be resorted to when a party has been illegally declared 
in default (<em>Omico Mining &amp; Industrial Corporation vs. Vallejos</em>, 63 
SCRA 300-301 [1975]), or where it is necessary to restore order to proceedings 
in the Court below (<em>Lim Tanhu vs. Ramolete</em>, 66 SCRA 462-463 
[1975].<br><br>(3)&nbsp; More importantly, the judgment of the Trial Court in Civil 
Case No. X-404 declaring that the Testatrix's collateral relatives have a 
rightful claim to her estate to the exclusion of the husband who was designated 
her sole and universal heir, nullifies the Will already probated by final 
judgment and overturns the pronouncements of both the Appellate Court and this 
Court on the case.<br><br>There being former judgments on the issues which have 
become final, rendered by Courts having jurisdiction of the subject matter and 
the parties, the said judgments having been rendered on the merits, and there 
being between the prior and subsequent action identity of parties, subject 
matter and substantial identity of cause of action, it is clear that the 
complaint below in Civil Case X-404 is barred by the principle of res 
adjudicata, and whatever transpired therein are null and void <em>ab initio</em> 
and without any legal effect.<br><br>To rule otherwise would upset the 
fundamental issue on which <em>res judicata</em> rests that parties ought not to 
be permitted to litigate the same issue more than once, that when a right or 
fact has been judicially determined, the judgment of the Court, so long as it 
remains unreversed, should be conclusive upon the parties and those in privity 
with them in law or estate (<em>Sarabia vs. Sec. of Agriculture and Natural 
Resources</em>, 2 SCRA 54 [1961]).</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">ACCORDINGLY, the review sought for is denied and respondent 
Court's judgment in CA-G.R. SP No. 13080 is hereby affirmed.<br><br>SO 
ORDERED."<br><br>Respondents decry the fact that the First Division set aside 
the due course Order and denied review in an extended Minute Resolution instead 
of in a signed Decision.&nbsp; They allege that said Resolution was "railroaded with 
such hurry/promptitude unequalled in the entire history of the Supreme Court 
under circumstances that have gone beyond the limits of legal and judicial 
ethics", unduly "persuaded, induced and influenced" by Solicitor General Ordoñez 
and Justice Pedro Yap.<br><br>Nothing is farthest from the truth.&nbsp; As explained 
in the "<em>Banc</em> Resolution"</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The petition for review was assigned to the then First 
Division of seven Justices, which initially gave it due course because the 
resolution of the Intermediate Appellate Court had reversed a decision 
originally rendered by the then Court of Appeals, and in order to have more time 
for further study.<br><br>Pleadings were submitted, the last being on May 3, 
1985, which can be considered as the date when this case was submitted for 
resolution.<br><br>The First Division of seven (7) was not able to act on the 
case up to the February, 1986 political upheaval.&nbsp; The last incident in the case 
was a motion for the early release of decision filed by petitioner on November 
19, 1985.<br><br>When this Court was reorganized in April of 1986, the 
membership of the First Division was reduced to five (5) Justices.&nbsp; Taking 
account of the motion of petitioner for early release of decision, the new First 
Division, then chairmanned by Justice Abad Santos, realizing that the doctrine 
of <em>res judicata</em> was clearly applicable — not only as to the probate of 
the will but also as to the heirship of petitioner, among others, and their 
right to intervene and participate in the proceedings — resolved, on May 14, 
1986 to dismiss the petition through an extended resolution which at the same 
time recalled the due course order.&nbsp; The new Division of 5 acted 
unanimously."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The recall of a due course Order after a review of the records 
of the case is a common occurrence in the Court.&nbsp; Respondents speak as if it 
were only their petition which has been subjected to such recall.&nbsp; They have 
lost all objectivity in this regard.&nbsp; They are hardly qualified, and cannot 
presume to speak of the "entire history" of the Supreme Court.<br><br>As to the 
participation of Justice Yap in the case, the "Banc Resolution" stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"Justice Yap clarified that he was on official mission to 
Switzerland for the Presidential Commission on Good Government after his 
appointment to the Supreme Court on April 11, 1986 and did not assume his 
position in the Supreme Court until his return on May 2, 1986.&nbsp; When the 
resolution of dismissal on May 14, 1986 was issued, Justice Yap was unaware that 
Atty. Sedfrey Ordoñez was private respondent's counsel.<br><br>On June 11, 1986, 
petitioner filed a motion for reconsideration, which was taken up by the First 
Division on July 9, 1986 with Justice Abad Santos still the Chairman.&nbsp; This 
time, Justice Yap, realizing that his former partner, Atty. Ordoñez, had 
submitted the pleadings for petitioner, inhibited himself and Justice Edgardo L. 
Paras was designated under Special Order No. 21, dated July 9, 1986, to sit in 
the Division in his place.&nbsp; The motion for reconsideration was denied with 
finality on July 9, 1986.<br><br>Justice Yap was designated Chairman of the 
First Division on July 14, 1986.<br><br>On August 7, 1986, petitioner asked 
leave to file a second motion for reconsideration, which was denied on September 
3, 1986, entry of judgment of the May 14, 1986 resolution having been made on 
July 28, 1986.&nbsp; Justice Yap again took no part in the deliberation of the 
case."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">But respondents continue to claim derisively that Justice Yap 
could not have been "unaware" of the appearance of Atty. Sedfrey Ordoñez.&nbsp; They 
reacted by saying "tell it to the marines" (Letters of November 3, 1986 to 
Justices Narvasa, Herrera, and Cruz, at p. 8, respectively).&nbsp; But that was the 
true and untarnished fact.&nbsp; With so many cases being handled by the Court, the 
appearances of lawyers during deliberative sessions very often escape attention, 
concentration being centered on the issues to be resolved.<br><br>Respondents 
also fault the Court for "still recogniz(ing) Atty. Ordoñez as counsel" for 
their opponents in the case.&nbsp; In the same "Banc Resolution", it was 
clarified:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"A copy of the resolution, dated May 14, 1986, was sent by the 
Releasing Clerks to Atty. Sedfrey A. Ordoñez as his name still appears on the 
cover page of the <em>Rollo</em>.&nbsp; It was not necessarily because the Supreme 
Court 'still recognizes him as counsel for respondents'" (at p. 
4)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The fact of the matter is that even Atty. Laureta continued to 
recognize Atty. Ordoñez as counsel as shown by his pleadings filed before the 
Court, which inevitably contained the notation "copy furnished Atty. Sedfrey 
Ordoñez".&nbsp; No withdrawal of appearance having been presented by Atty. Ordoñez in 
the main petition, his name continues to be in the <em>Rollo</em> of the case 
and the personnel concerned continue to furnish him with copies of Resolutions 
of this Court.<br><br>In respect of the charge that the Resolutions of the First 
Division of May 14, 1986, July 9, 1986 denying the Motion for Reconsideration 
with finality, and September 3, 1986 denying leave to file a second motion for 
reconsideration since entry of judgment of the May 14, 1986 Resolution had been 
made on July 28, 1986, were "unjust" and were "railroaded", the Banc Resolution, 
adopting the Division Resolution, explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The aforesaid resolutions were by no means 'railroaded'.&nbsp; The 
pleadings filed by the parties, as in any other case, were included in the 
Agenda of the First Division as soon as feasible.&nbsp; The Division acts promptly on 
all Agenda items, and the minutes of its deliberations are released as soon as 
possible after Agenda day.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The dispositions in this case were arrived at after careful 
study.&nbsp; Because a case is resolved against the interests of a party, does not 
mean that it is an 'unjust decision'; or that it has been 'railroaded'.</p>
<p align="justify">This Division declares without hesitation that it has 
consistently rendered justice without fear or favor." (at p. 4)</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Respondents insist that the doctrine of "<em>res judicata</em>" 
is inapplicable.&nbsp; In their own words "the ordered probate of the 1944 Will of 
Digna Maravilla by judgment of the Supreme Court in G. R. No. L-23225 is 
conclusive only as to the genuineness and due execution of said will, but not 
upon the validity of testamentary provision, particularly with the invalid 
designation of Herminio Maravilla as sole and universal heir of Digna 
Maravilla".<br><br>On this point, the "Javellana Resolution", in reversing the 
"Busran Decision" (AC-G.R. SP No. 13680), aptly held:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The then Court of Appeals held that the questioned decision 
does not run counter to the decision of the Hon. Supreme Court in G.R. No. 
L-23225 admitting the will of Digna Maravilla to probate because the latter 
refers to the <em>extrinsic</em> validity of the will, while the former concerns 
its <em>intrinsic</em> validity.&nbsp; We cannot agree with this observation because 
it is quite clear from the questioned decision that the will was in effect 
declared not to have been freely and voluntarily executed by the deceased Digna 
Maravilla but was the result of the evil and fraudulent machinations of her 
husband, Herminio Maravilla, and sets aside said will.&nbsp; The declaration that 
private respondents, as collateral relatives of the deceased Digna Maravilla, 
are entitled to her estate, is an indication that the Hon. respondent Court has 
nullified the will.&nbsp; Private respondents are not compulsory heirs and, in the 
absence of their being named legatees or devisees in the will, they could only 
lay claim to the estate of Digna Maravilla if the latter died without a will, 
pursuant to Art. 1003 of the New Civil Code, to wit:<br><br>'Art. 1003.&nbsp; If 
there are no descendants, ascendants, illegitimate children or a surviving 
spouse, the collateral relatives shall succeed to the entire estate of the 
deceased in accordance with the following articles.'<br><br>"However, assuming 
arguendo, that the matter complained of by private respondents referred only to 
the intrinsic validity of the will, still, it was improper for them to have 
instituted a separate action in a court other than that in which the probate 
proceeding was pending.<br></p>

<p align="justify">'<em>It seems clear from these provisions of the law that while 
the estate is being settled in the Court of First Instance in a special 
proceeding, no ordinary action can be maintained in that court, or in any other 
court, by a person claiming to be the heir, against the executor or against 
other persons claiming to be heirs, for the purpose of having the rights of the 
plaintiff in the estate determined</em>.&nbsp; The very purpose of the trial or 
hearing provided for in section 753 is to settle and determine those questions, 
and until they are settled and determined in that proceeding and under that 
section no action such as the present one can be maintained."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">Considering that the "Escolin Decision", as affirmed by this 
Court on November 9, 1977 in G.R. No. L-46155, had become final, the "Javellana 
Resolution" aptly observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"3.&nbsp; The questioned decision of the Hon. respondent Court dated 
12 August 1981 (referring to the 'Macandog Decision') unsettles and reviews 
issues which had long been laid to rest by the Hon. Supreme Court and the then 
Court of Appeals."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">But respondents ask:&nbsp; if <em>res judicata</em> were applicable, 
why did this Court, in G. R. No. L-50814, refer the case to the Court of 
Appeals?&nbsp; The answer is simple.&nbsp; The issue of whether the remedy of petitioners 
in that case was appeal and not certiorari had to be resolved.&nbsp; If certiorari 
were proper, then the "Macandog Decision" had not become final.&nbsp; If appeal, its 
finality would be the consequence.&nbsp; The "Javellana Resolution", which reversed 
the "Busran Decision", held that <em>Certiorari</em> was proper when a party has 
been illegally declared in default.&nbsp; It follows that the "Macandog Decision" had 
not attained finality.<br><br>Still undaunted, respondents claim that the Court 
of Appeals "deliberately evaded/divaricated" two important issues:&nbsp; (1) that the 
judgment of the Trial Court (in CC No. X-404) had attained finality as in fact 
the Court of Appeals had held that the "judgment of assail had long become 
final"; and (2) that Digna Maravilla's husband could not be instituted as the 
sole and universal heir of the wife on indestructible ground of moral 
impossibility and could not inherit wife's vast estate on the ground of utter 
unworthiness".<br><br>The penchant of respondents for making misleading 
statements is again obvious.&nbsp; It was not in the "Javellana Resolution" that the 
Court of Appeals held that "the judgment of assail (referring to the 'Macandog 
Decision') had long become final".&nbsp; That was in the "Busran Decision", which was 
precisely reversed by the "Javellana Resolution".<br><br>As to the alleged 
unworthiness of the husband to inherit from his wife, the "Javellana Resolution" 
pointedly observed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p align="justify">"The last will and testament of Digna Maravilla which 
instituted her husband, Herminio Maravilla, as her sole and universal heir, was 
admitted to probate, pursuant to a final judgment of the Hon. Supreme Court in 
G. R. No. L-23225, 27 February 1971.&nbsp; This probate foreclosed all questions as 
to the age and mental capacity of the testator, the signing of the document by 
the testator, or by someone in his behalf, and the acknowledgment of the 
instrument by him in the presence of the required member of witnesses who affix 
their signatures to the will to attest the act.&nbsp;<em> In re</em> Estate of 
Johnson, 39 Phil. 156, 168).&nbsp; Yet, more than ten years later, the Hon. 
respondent Court would nullify the effects of the probate by declaring that 
Digna Maravilla did not voluntarily and sanely execute the probated last will 
and testament, nullifying the institution of Herminio Maravilla as her sole and 
universal heir, and ordering the return of the properties of Digna Maravilla to 
the trunk of origin."</p></blockquote>
<p align="justify">The soundness of the legal conclusions arrived at in the 
"Escolin Decision" and "Javellana Resolution" commends itself.&nbsp; Only a 
disgruntled litigant and a defeated lawyer would claim that those judgments were 
accepted "hook, line and sinker" by this Court.&nbsp; The doctrine of <em>res 
judicata</em> is inescapably applicable.&nbsp; Thus it was that the First Division, 
in its challenged Resolution of May 14, 1986, found it unnecessary, after 
further study, to have a signed Decision and, instead, recalled the due course 
Order, which it had previously issued to give it "more time for further study" 
(p. 2, <em>Banc</em> Resolution, October 28, 1986).&nbsp; Contrary to respondents' 
claim, the Court is not "duty bound" to render signed Decisions all the time.&nbsp; 
It has ample discretion to formulate Decisions and/or minute Resolutions, 
provided a legal basis is given, depending on its evaluation of a 
case.<br><br>But obdurately enough, respondents have seen fit to take their case 
to the Tanodbayan charging the members of the First Division of this Court 
collectively with having knowingly and deliberately rendered an "unjust extended 
minute Resolution" with deliberate bad faith in violation of Article 204 of the 
Revised Penal Code<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> and for 
deliberately causing "undue injury" to respondent Ilustre and her co-heirs 
because of the "unjust Resolution" promulgated, in violation of the Anti-Graft 
and Corrupt Practices Act.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>Respondents' action is brazenly 
unjustifiable.&nbsp; Nor can they plead ignorance.&nbsp; As aptly declared in the Chief 
Justice's Statement of December 24, 1986, which the Court hereby adopts <em>in 
toto</em>, "(I)t is elementary that the Supreme Court is supreme — the third 
great department of government entrusted exclusively with the judicial power to 
adjudicate with finality all justiciable disputes, public and private.&nbsp; No other 
department or agency may pass upon its judgments or declare them 'unjust.'" It 
is elementary that "(A)s has ever been stressed since the early case of 
<em>Arnedo vs. Llorente</em> (18 Phil. 257, 263 [1911]) 'controlling and 
irresistible reasons of public policy and of sound practice in the courts demand 
that at the risk of occasional error, judgments of courts determining 
controversies submitted to them should become final at some definite time fixed 
by law, or by a rule of practice recognized by law, so as to be thereafter 
beyond the control even of the court which rendered them for the purpose of 
correcting errors of fact or of law, into which, in the opinion of the court it 
may have fallen.&nbsp; The very purpose for which the courts are organized is to put 
an end to controversy, to decide the questions submitted to the litigants, and 
to determine the respective rights of the parties.'" (<em>Luzon Brokerage Co., 
Inc. vs. Maritime Bldg., Co., Inc.</em>, 86 SCRA 305, 
316-317)<br><br>Respondents should know that the provisions of Article 204 of 
the Revised Penal Code as to "rendering knowingly unjust judgment" refer to an 
individual judge who does so "in any case submitted to him for decision" and 
even then, it is not the prosecutor who would pass judgment on the "unjustness" 
of the decision rendered by him but the proper appellate court with jurisdiction 
to review the same, either the Court of Appeals and/or the Supreme Court.&nbsp; 
Respondents should likewise know that said penal article has no application to 
the members of a collegiate court such as this Court or its Divisions who reach 
their conclusions in consultation and accordingly render their collective 
judgment after due deliberation.&nbsp; It also follows, consequently, that a charge 
of violation of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act on the ground that such 
a collective decision is "unjust" cannot prosper.<br><br>The Chief Justice's 
Statement of the supremacy of the Supreme Court's judicial power is by no means 
a "display of arrogance" as per respondents' puerile contention, but a 
restatement of the fundamental principle of separation of powers and checks and 
balances under a republican form of government such as ours, viz. that the three 
co-equal branches of government, the executive, legislative and judicial, are 
each supreme and independent within the limits of its own sphere.&nbsp; Neither one 
can interfere with the performance of the duties of the other.&nbsp; (<em>Forbes vs. 
Chuoco</em>, 16 Phil. 534 [1910]).&nbsp; As restated by the late Justice Jose P. 
Laurel in the 1936 landmark case of A<em>ngara vs. Electoral Commission</em> (63 
Phil. 134), our Constitution "as 'a definition of the powers of government' 
placed upon the judiciary the great burden of 'determining the nature, scope and 
extent of such powers' and 'when the judiciary mediates to allocate 
constitutional boundaries, it does not assert any superiority over the other 
departments .... but only asserts the solemn and sacred obligation entrusted to 
it by the Constitution to determine conflicting claims of authority under the 
Constitution and to establish for the parties in an actual controversy the 
rights which the instrument secures and guarantees to them.'"<br><br>As an 
officer of the Court, respondent Laureta, should realize that the cardinal 
principle he would grossly impair and violate is that of the independence of the 
judiciary, which the members of the bar are called upon to defend and preserve.&nbsp; 
The independence of the judiciary is the indispensable means for enforcing the 
supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law.<br><br>To subject to the 
threat and ordeal of investigation and prosecution, a judge, more so a member of 
the Supreme Court for official acts done by him in good faith and in the regular 
exercise of official duty and judicial functions is to subvert and undermine 
that very independence of the judiciary, and subordinate the judiciary to the 
executive. "For it is a general principle of the highest importance to the 
proper administration of justice that a judicial officer in exercising the 
authority vested in him, shall be free to act upon his own convictions, without 
apprehension of personal consequences to himself.&nbsp; Liability to answer to 
everyone who might feel himself aggrieved by the action of the judge would be 
inconsistent with the possession of this freedom, and would destroy that 
independence without which no judiciary can be either respectable or useful." 
(<em>Bradley vs. Fisher</em>, 80 U.S. 335.)<br><br>Indeed, resolutions of the 
Supreme Court as a collegiate court, whether <em>en banc</em> or division, speak 
for themselves and are entitled to full faith and credence and are beyond 
investigation or inquiry under <em>the same principle of conclusiveness of 
enrolled bills </em>of the legislature.&nbsp; (<em>U.S. vs. Pons</em>, 34 Phil. 729; 
<em>Gardiner, et al. vs. Paredes, et al.</em>, 61 Phil. 118; <em>Mabanag vs. 
Lopez Vito</em>, 78 Phil. 1) The Supreme Court's pronouncement of the doctrine 
that "(I)t is well settled that the enrolled bill ... is conclusive upon the 
courts as regards the tenor of the measure passed by Congress and approved by 
the President.&nbsp; If there has been any mistake in the printing of the bill before 
it was certified by the officers of Congress and approved by the Executive [as 
claimed by petitioner-importer who unsuccessfully sought refund of margin fees] 
— <em>on which we cannot speculate, without jeopardizing the principle of 
separation of powers and undermining one of the cornerstones of our democratic 
system</em> — the remedy is by amendment or curative legislation, not by 
judicial decree" is fully and reciprocally applicable to Supreme Court orders, 
resolutions and decisions, mutatis mutandis.&nbsp; (<em>Casco Phil. Chemical Co., 
Inc. vs. Gimenez</em>, 7 SCRA 347, 350.&nbsp; (Citing <em>Primicias vs. Paredes</em>, 
61 Phil. 118, 120; <em>Mabanag vs. Lopez Vito</em>, 78 Phil. 1; <em>Macias vs. 
Comelec</em>, 3 SCRA 1)<br><br>The Court has consistently stressed that "the 
doctrine of <em>separation of powers</em> calls for the <em>executive, 
legislative and judicial departments being left alone to discharge their duties 
as they see fit</em>" (<em>Tan vs. Macapagal</em>, 43 SCRA 677).&nbsp; It has thus 
maintained in the same way that the judiciary has a right to expect that neither 
the President nor Congress would cast doubt on the mainspring of its orders or 
decisions, it should refrain from speculating as to alleged hidden forces at 
work that could have impelled either coordinate branch into acting the way it 
did.&nbsp; The concept of separation of powers presupposes mutual respect by and 
between the three departments of the government.&nbsp; (<em>Tecson vs. Salas</em>, 34 
SCRA 275, 286-287)<br><br>To allow litigants to go <em>beyond the Court's 
resolution</em> and claim that the members acted "with deliberate bad faith" and 
rendered and "unjust resolution" in disregard or violation of the duty of their 
high office to act upon their own independent consideration and judgment of the 
matter at hand would be to <em>destroy the authenticity, integrity and 
conclusiveness </em>of such collegiate acts and resolutions and to disregard 
utterly the presumption of regular performance of official duty.&nbsp; To allow such 
collateral attack would destroy the separation of powers and<em> undermine the 
role of the Supreme Court as the final arbiter of all justiciable 
disputes</em>.<br><br>Dissatisfied litigants and/or their counsels cannot 
without violating the separation of powers mandated by the Constitution 
relitigate in another forum the final judgment of this Court on legal issues 
submitted by them and their adversaries for final determination to and by the 
Supreme Court and which fall within the<em> judicial power</em> to determine and 
adjudicate exclusively vested by the Constitution <em>in the Supreme Court</em> 
and in such inferior courts as may be established by law.<br><br>In resume, we 
find that respondent Ilustre has transcended the permissible bounds of fair 
comment and criticism to the detriment of the orderly administration of justice 
in her letters addressed to the individual Justices quoted in the show-cause 
Resolution of this Court <em>en banc</em>, particularly the underlined portions 
thereof; in the language of the charges she filed before the Tanodbayan quoted 
and underscored in the same Resolution; in her statements, conduct, acts and 
charges against the Supreme Court and/or the official actions of the Justices 
concerned and her ascription of improper motives to them; and in her unjustified 
outburst that she can no longer expect justice from this Court.&nbsp; The fact that 
said letters are not technically considered pleadings, nor the fact that they 
were submitted after the main petition had been finally resolved does not 
detract from the gravity of the contempt committed.&nbsp; The constitutional right of 
freedom of speech or right to privacy cannot be used as a shield for 
contemptuous acts against the Court.<br><br>We likewise find that Atty. Laureta 
has committed acts unbecoming an officer of the Court for his stance of dangling 
threats of bringing the matter to the "proper forum" to effect a change of the 
Court's adverse Resolution; for his lack of respect for and exposing to public 
ridicule, the two highest Courts of the land by challenging in bad faith their 
integrity and claiming that they knowingly rendered unjust judgments 
(<em>Montecillo vs. Gica</em>, 60 SCRA 234 [1974]); for authoring, or at the 
very least, assisting and/or abetting and/or not preventing the contemptuous 
statements, conduct, acts and malicious charges of his client, respondent 
Ilustre, notwithstanding his disclaimer that he had absolutely nothing to do 
with them, which we find disputed by the facts and circumstances of record as 
above stated; for totally disregarding the facts and circumstances and legal 
considerations set forth in this Court's Resolutions of the First Division and 
<em>en banc</em>, as the Tribunal of last resort; for making it appear that the 
Justices of this Court and other respondents before the Tanodbayan are charged 
with "graft and corruption" when the complaint before the Tanodbayan, in 
essence, is a tirade from a disgruntled litigant and a defeated counsel in a 
case that has been brought thrice before this Court, and who would readily 
accept anything but the soundness of the judgments of the Courts concerned, all 
with the manifest intent to bring the Justices of this Court and of the Court of 
Appeals into disrepute and to subvert public confidence in the 
Courts.<br><br>Atty. Laureta should be reminded that his first duty is not to 
his client but to the administration of justice; to that end, his client's 
success is wholly subordinate; and his conduct ought to and must always be 
scrupulously observant of law and ethics.&nbsp; For like the Court itself, "a lawyer 
is an instrument or agency to advance the ends of justice." (<em>Surigao Mineral 
Conservation Board vs. Cloribel</em>, 31 SCRA 1 [1970]; <em>Castañeda vs. 
Ago</em>, 65 SCRA 505 [1975]).<br><br>In assessing the penalty on respondent 
Laureta, the Court notes that "disciplinary proceedings against lawyers are sui 
generis.&nbsp; Neither purely civil nor purely criminal, they do not involve a trial 
of an action or a suit, but are rather investigations by the Court into the 
conduct of one of its officers.&nbsp; Not being intended to inflict punishment, it is 
in no sense a criminal prosecution.&nbsp; Accordingly, there is neither a plaint nor 
a prosecutor therein.&nbsp; It may be initiated by the Court <em>motu proprio</em>.&nbsp; 
Public interest is its primary objective, and the real question for 
determination is whether or not the attorney is still a fit person to be allowed 
the privileges as such.&nbsp; Hence, in the exercise of its disciplinary powers, the 
Court merely calls upon a member of the Bar to account for his actions as an 
officer of the Court with the end in view of preserving the purity of the legal 
profession and the proper and honest administration of justice by purging the 
profession of members who by their misconduct have proved themselves no longer 
worthy to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities pertaining to the 
office of an attorney." Viewed in the light of the demonstrated persistence of 
grave misconduct and undermining public confidence in the honor and integrity of 
the Court and its members (at a time when the Court is exerting every effort to 
regain public confidence in our courts after the trauma and debacle undergone by 
them in the past regime), the Court shall impose upon him an indefinite 
suspension, leaving it to him to prove at some future and opportune time, that 
he shall have once again regained the fitness to be allowed to resume the 
practice of law as an officer of the Courts. (<em>In re</em>:&nbsp; Almacen, 31 SCRA 
562)<br><br><strong>ACCORDINGLY</strong>, (1) respondent Eva Maravilla Ilustre 
is hereby held in contempt, and is hereby fined in the amount of P1,000.00 only, 
mindful that the power of contempt should be exercised on the preservative and 
not on the vindictive principle of punishment; and<br><br>(2) Atty. Wenceslao 
Laureta found guilty of grave professional misconduct, rendering him unfit to 
continue to be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities belonging to the 
office of an attorney, and is hereby suspended from the practice of law until 
further Orders, the suspension to take effect immediately.<br><br>Let copies of
