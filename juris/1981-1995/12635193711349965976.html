assume the position of Director of International Sales at Minneapolis, U.S.A.,

attempted to deny the non-existence of the position.</p>

<p class="BODY">Assuming for the sake of argument that the communication or
letter of Mr. Jenkins was basically a transfer, under the particular and
peculiar facts obtaining in the case at bar, petitioner's inability or his
refusal to be transferred was not a valid cause for dismissal.</p>

<p class="BODY">While it may be true that the right to transfer or reassign an
employee is an employer's exclusive right and the prerogative of management,
such right is not absolute.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The right of
an employer to freely select or discharge his employee is limited by the
paramount police power (Phil. Air Lines, Inc. vs. Phil. Airlines Employees
Association, L-24626, June 28, 1974, 57 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> Â­489)

oppressively against each other (Article 1701, New Civil Code).</p>

<p class="BODY">There can be no dispute that the constitutional guarantee of
security of tenure mandated under Section 9, Article 2, 1973 Constitution
applies to all employees and laborers, whether in the government service or in
the private sector.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that
petitioner is a managerial employee does not by itself exclude him from the
protection of the constitutional guarantee of security of tenure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even a manager in a private concern has the
right to be secure in his position, to decline a promotion where, although the
promotion carries an increase in his salary and rank but results in his
transfer to a new place of assignment or station and away from his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such an order constitutes removal without
just cause and is illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor can the
removal be justified on the ground of loss of confidence as now claimed by
private respondent Northwest, insisting as it does that by petitioner's alleged
contumacious refusal to obey the transfer order, said petitioner was guilty of
insubordination.</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot agree to Northwest's submission that petitioner was
guilty of disobedience and insubordination which respondent Commission
sustained.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The only piece of evidence on
which Northwest bases the charge of conÂ­tumacious refusal is petitioner's
letter dated August 28, 1975 to R. C. Jenkins wherein petitioner acknowledged
receipt of the <span class="SpellE">former's</span> memorandum dated August 18,
1975, appreciated his promotion to Director of International Sales but at the
same time regretted "that at this time for personal reasons and reasons of
my family, I am unable to accept the transfer from the Philippines" and
thereafter expressed his preference to remain in his position, saying:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>"I would, therefore, prefer to remain in
my position of Manager-Philippines until such time that my services in that
capacity are no longer required by Northwest Airlines." From this
evidence, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot discern even the slightest hint of
defiance, much less <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">imply
insubordination on the part of petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

petitioner </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">which is loss of

the contrary, the fact that Northwest wanted to promote petitioner to Director
of International Sales as "the Company feels there is need for an
executive of (his) experience to fill the posiÂ­tion of Director of
International Sales" as well as its Manifestation dated March 23, 1976

Sales with </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">office </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">at Minneapolis, U.S.A." clearly indicate

 15, 1982</st1:date>, Justice de Castro speaking for the Court in <span class="SpellE">Acda</span> v. Minister of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'The findings of the Labor
Arbiter on this point, as upheld by the National Labor Relations Commission,
are quite clear, and We find no reversible error therein the same being
substantiated by evidence of record, aside from the fact that said findings had
already attained the character of finality by the non-perfection of a proper
appeal.' The opinion goes on to state:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>'With
the charges against petitioner found to be unsubstantiated, We are left with no
other alternative but to hold that the so-called 'loss of confidence' is withÂ­out
basis and may not be successfully invoked as ground for dismissal which
requires some basis <span class="SpellE">therefor</span>, such ground never
having been intended to afford an occasion for abuse by the employer of its
prerogative, as it can easily be subject to abuse because of its subjective
nature, to dismiss employees in contravention with the 'protection of labor'
clause of the Constitution.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is this
Constitutional guaranty that accords even to employees employed on a
probationary basis the protection that their services 'may be terminated only
for a just cause or when authorized by existing laws, or when he fails to
qualify as a regular employee in accordance with reasonable standards
prescribed by the employer.'</blockquote>

</span></span></span><!--[endif]--><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>There is
likewise this excerpt from <span class="SpellE">Meracap</span> which calls for
the reverÂ­sal of the assailed order of the SecreÂ­tary of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>'In this suit for <i>certiorari</i> to review the dismissal of an appeal
from a decision of the then Acting Secretary of Labor <span class="SpellE">Amado</span>
G. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span> by respondent <span class="SpellE">Ronaldo</span>
Zamora, Presidential Assistant on Legal Affairs, ordering the dismissal of
petitioner Faustino <span class="SpellE">Meracap</span>, the relevance of such a
provision becomes apparent.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
alleged by petitioner that while the termination of his services was based on
his unauthorized absences, the real reason was due to his union activities.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Respondent <st1:city><st1:place>Zamora</st1:place></st1:city>
ruled otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such a finding of fact
must be accorded deference.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
considering that petitioner <span class="SpellE">Meracap</span> has been in the
employ of the International Ceramics Manufacturing Company, Inc. for eighteen
years, it would appear that the punishment was much too severe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Dismissal was not warranted.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Suspension would suffice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>To that extent, <i>certiorari</i> lies.'
Dismissal, as pointed out in the latest case in point, decided fourteen days
after <span class="SpellE">Acda</span>, in the <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ponencia</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>of Justice <span class="SpellE">Melencio</span>-Herrera
in <span class="SpellE">Visperas</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Inciong</span>, 'is
too harsh a penalty.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A penalty less
punitive should have been proper.' In this case, upon mere suspiÂ­cion, later
found to be unsubstantiated, he was immediately suspended.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A two-year suspension would have sufficed,
not the loss of his job.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The length of
service was accorded due consideration in decisions of this Tribunal ordering
reinstatement, twenty years in De Leon v. National Labor Relations Commission
and Reyes v. PhilipÂ­pine Duplicators and twenty-two years in Union of
Supervisors v. Secretary of Labor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Here
he was in the service for eleven years when suspended."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Accordingly, <span class="GramE">We</span> must emphasize here the
long and faithful years of service that petitioner had rendered to respondent
company, eleven good years, nine of which as Manager with station at <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is plainly abusive of the company and
oppressive to the petitioner that the latter is peremptorily dismissed on the
shallow claim of "resignation without notice", and thereafter
converted to alleged loss of confidence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This unjustified dismissal of the petitioner calls for Our specific
ruling in the cited case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">De Leon
vs.</span> </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">National Labor
Relations Commission</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">, </span>100
<span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 691, 700, wherein the Court speaking through
Justice De Castro said:</p>

<blockquote>"While a Managerial employee may be disÂ­missed merely on the
ground of loss of confiÂ­dence the matter of determining whether the cause for
dismissing an employee is justified on ground of loss of confidence, cannot be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">left </span>entirely <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span>the employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Impartial tribunals do not rely only on the statement made by employer that
there <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">is 'loss </span>of confidence'
unless duly proved or sufficiently substantiated.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We find no reason <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
15.0pt">to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">disturb </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">the findings of the </span>Labor <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">Arbiter </span>that the charges against
petitioner were not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">fully</span> substantiated,
and âthere can be no valid reason for said loss of confidence x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">So must this Court re-enforce the constitutional protection
afforded labor and assure the right of workers to security of tenure.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Justice and equity call for petiÂ­tioner's
reinstatement.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should be so not only <span class="SpellE"><u>secundum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>rationem</u></span>
but also <span class="SpellE"><u>secundum</u></span> <span class="SpellE"><u>caritatem</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="GramE">One last point.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>We reject the holding of the respondent
Commission that <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">petitioner's </span>act
in accepting from the respondent airline several paychecks relative to his
pension fund and the cash value representing an adjustment in the peso amount
of his dollar base by reason of currency fluctuation constitutes an admission,
if not a conformity, of his lawful separation <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
7.0pt">from </span>office on August 31, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>It appears indubitably that the several
paychecks mentioned by respondent <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span> were only
refunds of petitioner's contribution to the pension fund of respondent
airline.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The money refunded was
petitioner's own <span class="GramE">money, that</span> which he personally
contributed to the retirement plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>If
petitioner accepted the cash value representing the adjustment in the peso
amount of petitioner's dollar base, the money was legitimately and legally due
to the petitioner; they are not benefits <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">or
</span>privileges granted by the airline to the dismissed petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There can be no <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
against petitioner's acceptance of the refund of monies legitimately his own,
nor a waiver of his right to question the termination of his services.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(<span class="SpellE">Urgelio</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">OsmeÃ±a</span>, Jr., 10 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 253).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Even employees who receive their separation pay
are <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">not </span>barred from contesting
the legality of their dismissal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
acceptance of those benefits would not amount to <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>
as held in the leading case of <u>Mercury Drug Company vs. CIR</u> as aptly
cited in the decision of the Labor Arbiter.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>(De Leon vs. <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span>, 100 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
691).</p>

<p class="BODY">In <span class="SpellE"><u>CariÃ±o</u></span><u> vs. Agricultural
Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration</u>, 18 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span>
183, the rationale of the Court's ruling rejecting the argument that acceptance
of separation pay and terminal leave benefits by the employees illegally
dismissed by their employer constiÂ­tutes <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>, is
stated thus, which We re-echo as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Acceptance of those benefits would not amount to <span class="SpellE">estoppel</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The reason
is plain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Employer and employee,
obviously, do not stand on the same footing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The employer drove the employee to the wall.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The latter must have to get hold of
money.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">Because, out of
job, he had to face the harsh necessities of life.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He thus found himself in no position to
resist money proffered.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His, then, is a
case of adherence, not of choice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>One
thing sure, however, is that petitioner did not relent on their claim.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They pressed it.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They are deemed not to have waived any of
their rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE"><u>Renuntiatio</u></span></span><span class="GramE"><u> non <span class="SpellE">praesumitur</span></u>."</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">2.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A corporation, being an
artificial entity, cannot exercise its functions except through natural
persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is not easy to specify which
persons in <span class="GramE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">its</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> service are the </span><i>alter ego</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of the corporation, and can be deemed to be
the employers while all others in the same service are the actual
"employees".<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The situation has
given rise to the principle of "employer's agents" who are not to be
considered employees (See 48 Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>., <span class="GramE">2d.,</span> 298).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The </span><i>alter
ego</i> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">of a corporation, or the employer's
agents, can be composed of the Board of Directors and/or a management
team.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Oftentimes, the management team is
dominated by a single indiviÂ­dual, with others in the team serving merely as
conÂ­sultative or recommendatory staff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Below the management "person" or "team",
there are two general classifications of "management employÂ­ees" and
these are the "executive employees" and the "administrative
employees" which, in the United States, are not generally considered
within the jurisdiction of the U.S. National Labor Relations Board (see 48 <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Am. <span class="SpellE">Jur</span>. 2d
1000).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Executive and administrative emÂ­ployees
can also be subdivided into several categories, depending on the extent of each
employee's managerial responsibilities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, I believe that petitioner is a managerial
employee, with both executive and admiÂ­nistrative functions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His transfer and promotion was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a </span>valid exercise of management's
prerogative.</p>

<p class="BODY">Specifically, and for purposes of this dissent, I concur in the
findings of the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span> that the action of NORTHWEST
considering petitioner resigned from his position should be upheld, and that no
prior clearance to terminate under the Labor Code is necessary (<span class="SpellE">Bondoc</span> vs. Peoples <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Bank,
et al., 103 <span class="SpellE">SCRA</span> 599 [1981]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The inter</span>pretation given the Code by
the <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">NLRC</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> is </span>entitled to great weight (Madrigal
vs. <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Rafferty, 38 Phil. 414 [1918]; <span class="SpellE">Verdera</span> vs. HerÂ­</span>nandez, 10 <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">SCRA</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"> 4 [1964]).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Further, I may mention
that petitioner's stateÂ­ment that he is unable to accept transfer from the </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Philippines</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, and that he will continue as </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Manila</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt"> manager of NORTHWEST </span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">until </span>such time as his services are no

declaration that he will remain as </span><st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
 14.0pt">Manila</span></st1:place><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">
manager <i>until </i></span><i>terminated</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">He was indeed terminated, except
that, in <span class="SpellE">NORTHWEST's</span> letter of </span><st1:date year="1975" day="9" month="9"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">September
 9, 1975</span></st1:date><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, he was
separated under the more palatable proposition of being </span><i>considered
resigned</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The view taken by the
Labor Arbiter that petitioner could not be dismissed on the ground of
resignation, because petitioner did not resign, was based on semantics, and not
on the substance of the problem, if problem there actually was.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is for the foregoing reasons that I vote to sustain the
decision appealed from.</p>

<p class="OTHERHEADING">SEPARATE OPINION</p>

<p class="DISSENTINGCONCURRING"><span class="SpellE">TEEHANKEE</span>, <i>J.</i>:<span style="font-weight:normal"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">I am constrained to dissent from the majority decision that would
reverse the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span> decision under review (concurred in
by the Minister of Labor as chairman) and instead reinstate what might be
termed as a "hometown decision" of the Labor Arbiter ordering the
reinstatement of petitioner Helmut <span class="SpellE">Dosch</span> to his former
position of Philippines-Manager of respondent Northwest Airlines, Inc. (where
he had long overstayed for several years) with <span class="SpellE">backwages</span>
and an uncustomary windfall award of 10% of the total monetary benefits as
attorney's fees which puts a premium on litigation.</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">hereinbelow</span> stated, respondent
commission's decision upholding respondent airlines company's free exercise of
its management prerogative to transfer (with promotion yet) petitioner to its
home office in the U.S. (where it had in the first place originally employed
him) and that no prior clearance to terminate him under the Labor Code is
necessary when he refused the transfer assignment since he is a managerial
employee is based on good and settled law and jurisprudence.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>With all due respect, the majority decision
in overturning the same substitutes their judgment and discretion for that
which is exclusively respondent's management prerogative in the transfer and
assignment of its overseas managers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, it improperly disregards the factual findings of respondent
commission which are amply substantiated by the evidence of record and sets
aside respondent commission's decision notwithstanding the absence of any grave
abuse of discretion on its part.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is
undeniably established from petitioner's own letter that "personal reasons
and reasons involving my family" were behind his refusal to accept the
transfer as contractually undertaken by him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The contract is the law between the parties and not even this <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Court </span>can change contractual law and
instead order respondent to indefinitely assign petitioner here in the
Philippines.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner is an American citizen, married to a Filipina, with a
total of eleven years of service with respondent company as of August 18,
1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was first employed in the
United States and assigned to its New York and Washington offices, and
thereafter for nine years in the Orient, the last 7-1/2 years in Manila.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In his application for employment with
respondent, he was informed of and indicated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">conformity to the necessity and probability of transfers and</span>
reassignments of respondent's personnel in consonance with the very nature of
its airline operations in almost all parts of the world.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He indicated therein his "preferred area
of assignment" as the U.S.; and his willingness to "accept employment
at any station" and transfers "from one location to another both
within. . . (and) outside the U.S." and to "travel frequently."</p>

<p class="BODY">On August 18, 1975, respondent received the written notice from
respondent's Vice President for the Orient Region in Tokyo, <span class="SpellE">R.C</span>.
Jenkins, of his promotion as Director of International Sales and transfer to
the General Office in Minneapolis, Minnesota, effective the same date with
promotion in rank and salary and was asked to report to his new assignment on
September 15, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The notice noted
that petitioner's "assignment in the Philippines has continued for several
years longer than is normal for our overseas managers." Respondent
installed a new Philippines-manager, <span class="SpellE">L.J</span>. Gilbert,
Jr., to take over petitioner's functions "in order to effect a smooth
turnover."</p>

<p class="BODY">Ten days later, on August 28, 1975, petitioner wrote resÂ­pondent
expressing his appreciation for the promotion but regretting that "<u>at
this time, for personal reasons and reasons involving my family, I am unable to
accept a transfer from the Philippines</u>" and stating that "(I)
would, therefore, prefer to remain in my position of Manager-Philippines <u>until
such time that my services in that capacity are no longer required by Northwest
Airlines.</u>" He attempted to take over and resume the position of
manager from the duly designated manager, Mr. Gilbert, but was not allowed by
the latter (who changed the key to the office).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Without any reply from respondent, petitioner on September 4, 1975 took
it upon himself to post a notice in respondent's bulletin board announcing his
"resumption of duties as Manager-Philippines." On September 9, 1975,
respondent's Vice President Jenkins wrote petitioner that "in view of the
foregoing, your status as an employee of the company ceased on the close of
business on August 31, 1975 and "the company therefore considers your
letter of August 28, 1975 to be a resignation without notice." Respondent
duly filed with the Labor Department (now Ministry) its verified report on
petitioner's resignation as managerial employee, which was <span class="SpellE">controverted</span>
by petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter's ruling, in upholding petitioner, that
"petitioner did not resign or relinquish his position as
Manager-Philippines" and could not therefore be terminated is patently
shown in Mme. Justice Herrera's separate dissent to be "based on semantics
and not on the substance of the problem, if problem there actually was."
His presumptuous act announcing that he was resuming the <span class="SpellE">managership</span>
of respondent company when he well knew that it had designated a new manager
was a vain blow of defiance and insubordination.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Since he did not want to be promoted nor
transferred back to the U.S</u>., he knew <u>his employment was terminated by
his own act</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He thereafter collected
several pay checks relative to his pension refund (by grace of the respondent
which merely considered him resigned) and cash benefits signifying such
termination of employment.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Labor Arbiter's other justification that "the wide
discretion given to airline companies to transfer and/or promote their
employees considering the nature of their functions . . . . merely refers to
pilots, stewardess, mechanics and other employees occupying similar positions
where the exigencies of the service may require unqualified obedience to
management.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It should not be applied to
herein petitioner, a manager in Manila whose unblemished service for eleven
(11) years, rejected a promotional transfer to a position that remained
unfilled since 1965.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The element of
immediate necessity is definitely wanting" is <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">contrary </span>to </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">law,
logic and jurisprudence</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">, </span>as
will readily be seen from the <span class="SpellE">NLRC</span> decision, as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"<u>The hiring, </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">firing,
transfer, demotion </span>and </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">promotion
of employees has been traditionally identified as a management prerogative</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This
is a function associated with the employer's inherent right to control and
manage effectively its enterprise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
free will of management to conduct its own business affairs to achieve its
purpose can not be denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This exercise
finds support not only in actual management practice but has become a part of
our jurisprudence in labor relations law x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(Note:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Cases quotations and citations omitted)</blockquote>

<blockquote>"There is no intimation in the record of the case that the
transfer of the petitioner was motivated by any unfair labor practice acts
since the petitioner is a manager and the dispute herein has no relation
whatsoever to union activity.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>In truth,
the reason</u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:18.0pt"> </span></u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">given by the petitioner </span>in his </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">refusal to transfer was </span>due </u><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">to </span>'personal reasons and reasons
involving my family</u>.' At this point, it is worthwhile to mention that <u>if
an employee finds himself in a situation where he believes that personal reason
cannot be sacrificed in favor of the exigency of the service, then he has no
other choice but to disassociate himself from his employment</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>"In the light of all the foregoing, we find that <u>petitioner's
transfer and promotion is a valid exercise of management's prerogative.</u><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is our view, therefore, that respondent's
decision to consider him resigned from his job after he defied management's order
to transfer and promote him to a new position at the general office at
Minnesota, U.S.A. is <u>justified and warranted</u>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, the fact that petitioner had accepted
from the respondent several pay checks relative to h<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">is<b> </b></span>pension refund and the cash value representing an
adjustment in the peso amount of his dollar base by reason of currency
fluctuation constitutes an admission, if not a conformity, of his lawful
separation from office on August 31, 1975.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span><u>No prior clearance to terminate him under the Labor Code is
necessary, petitioner being a managerial employee</u>." (Emphasis
supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Finally, I cannot give my assent to the ruling in the majority
decision that "Even a manager in a private concern has the right to be
secure in his position, to decline a promoÂ­tion where, although the promotion
carries an increase in his salary and rank but results in his transfer to a new
place of assignment or station and away from his family.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Such an order constitutes removal without
just cause and is illegal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Nor can the
removal be justified on the ground of loss of confidence as now claimed by
private respondent Northwest, insisting as it does that by petitioner's alleged
contumacious refusal to obey the transfer order, said petitioner was guilty of
insubordination." (Majority decision, at page 10) The same seems to be at
war with the factual findings and settled principles and jurisprudence above
set forth in respondent commission's decision.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>In a nutshell, "if an employee finds himself in a situation where
he believes that personal reason cannot be sacrificed in favor of the exigency
of the service, then he has no other choice but to disassociate himself from
his employment."</p>

<p class="BODY">If we hold that "such an order (of transfer) constitutes removal
without just cause and is illegal" (notwithstanding that there is no
factual basis for the statement therein that such transfer would be "away
from his family"), as the majority decision does, this would be to reverse
the roles of employer and manager and to permit such managers to dictate their
own <span class="SpellE">situs</span> of service or country and place of
assignment in usurpation of the employer's exclusive prerogative and in gross
violation of their contractual undertakings accepting the employer's right to
