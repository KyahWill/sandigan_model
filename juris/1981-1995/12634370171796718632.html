of the National Labor Relations Commission which modified the decision of the
Labor Arbiter in Cebu City by deleting the award of damages to petitioner and
the Leyte Farms Industrial Labor and Driver's Organization for lack of factual
and legal basis.</p>

<p class=BODY>Private respondents were sales employees of petitioner City Fair
Corporation (City Fair) at its store in Ormoc City.  Seven of the private respondents, namely:  Jayme, Sultan, Wenceslao, Argomido, Rubenta,
Pasculado and Bonsilao, were members of the Leyte Farms Industrial Labor and
Driver's Organization (LEFILDO), a labor union with an existing Collective
Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with petitioner.  Private respondents Escabillas, Pimentel, Gomez, Abata and Dayandayan
were members of another union, the Confederation of Labor and Allied Services,
(CLASS), which lost in a certification election in 1987, but had been paying
monthly dues to LEFILDO.</p>

<p class=BODY>On the last week of May 1989, private respondents were served
with termination papers by petitioner for retrenchment purposes, to take effect
the end of June 1989.  They were
informer that all regular workers would be terminated together with all other
workers belonging to the unions of LEFILDO and CLASS-TUCP.</p>

<p class=BODY>When efforts to <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt'>come </span>to
an amicable settlement of the case failed, private respondents staged a strike
on June 10, 1989.</p>

<p class=BODY>On June 23, 1989, petitioner filed a complaint against them for
illegal strike with the Labor Arbiter, Dominador Bolok, Jr.</p>

<p class=BODY>On July 5, 1989, private respondents, in turn filed charges for
unfair labor practice, illegal dismissal, money claims and damages against
petitioner.  LEFILDO also filed, on the
following day, a case for illegal strike against private respondents.</p>

<p class=BODY>All three cases were consolidated by the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class=BODY>On July 6, 1989, petitioner filed an urgent ex-parte motion
praying for the removal of obstructions placed by private respondents at the
entrance of the residence of the General Manager.  On July 7, 1989, the Labor Arbiter ordered the dismantling of the
obstructions.  On August 5, 1989, the Labor
Arbiter appeared at the strike area and ordered private respondents to remove
the obstructions but private respondents refused to do so.  An argument then ensued between private
respondents and the Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class=BODY>On August 7, 1989, the Labor Arbiter again issued an order for
the removal of the obstructions.</p>

<p class=BODY>On August 11, 1989, private respondents filed a motion to
disqualify the Labor Arbiter on the ground of bias and conduct unbecoming a
Labor Arbiter.</p>

<p class=BODY>On August 22, 1989, the Labor Arbiter denied the motion to
disqualify him and on September 14, 1989, he issued a decision, the dispositive
portion of which reads:</p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHEREFORE, premises considered, the strike is hereby declared
ILLEGAL.  Respondents are deemed
terminated from their employment with City Fair Corporation, effective 10 June
1989.  All benefits are forfeited.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Furthermore, respondents are ordered to pay jointly and severally:</blockquote>

<blockquote>City Fair Corporation<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>  </span>:<span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>-<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>P820,000.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>LEFILDO<span style='mso-tab-count:1'>        </span><span

style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>         42,000.00</blockquote>

<blockquote>'NLRC-RAB-VIII Case No. 7-0409-89, entitled Lilian Wenceslao, et
al., vs. City Fair Supermart/Patrocinia G. Manalastas, is hereby dismissed for
lack of merit.'</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>On appeal, the NLRC ruled:<span style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;WHEREFORE, premises considered the appealed decision is
hereby modified in the sense that the award of damages to both complainant City
Fair Corporation and Leyte Farms Industrial Labor and Drivers’ Organization are
hereby deleted and set aside for lack of factual and legal basis.  The rest of the decision stands.</blockquote>

<blockquote>SO ORDERED.&quot;</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner moved for reconsideration, which was denied.</p>

<p class=BODY>Hence, this petition.<span style='font-size:5.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>Petitioner questions the deletion by the NLRC of the award of
damages in its favor by the Labor Arbiter.  It claims that the Labor Arbiter's decision was supported by the fact
that its business operations were paralyzed for two (2) months because of the
strike.  Petitioner asserts that these
facts alone are sufficient basis for the enormous award of damages for the
losses <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt'>incurred by them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=BODY>We find petitioner's contentions to he unmeritorious.  The alleged losses suffered by the
petitioners were never substantially proved, as borne out by the fact that no
hearing was conducted and no real evidence was ever presented on the
matter.  The only thing that appears on
record is an <u>unsigned</u> summary of actual and estimated losses, certified
by a certified public accountant that he had examined and reviewed the same.</p>

<p class=BODY>This is not enough.  Considering the very large amount of damages awarded, there is need for
more convincing evidence to be presented in order to justify the same.</p>

<p class=BODY>Lastly, we find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of the
NLRC, as alleged by petitioner, when it entertained the appeal of private
respondents from the decision of the Labor Arbiter, even if it were filed a day
late.  The facts and circumstances of
the case warrant liberality considering the amount and the issue involved.  A greater injustice may occur if the said
appeal is not given due course than if the reglementary period to appeal were
strictly followed.  Moreover,
proceedings before such agencies as the NLRC need not adhere strictly to
technicalities as long as substantive justice is attained.</p>

<p class=BODY>Under Article 218 (c) of the Labor Code, the NLRC may, in the
exercise of its appellate powers, &quot;correct, amend or waive any error,
defect or irregularity whether in substance or in form.&quot;</p>

<p class=BODY>Further, Art. 221 of the Labor Code provides that:<span
style='font-size:5.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:Tahoma'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>&quot;In any proceeding before the Commission or any of the Labor
Arbiters, the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not
be controlling and it is the spirit and intention of this Code that the
Commission and its members and the Labor Arbiters shall use every and all
reasonable means to ascertain the facts in each case speedily and objectively
and without regard to technicalities of law or procedure, all the interest of
due process.  x x x”</blockquote>

<p class=BODY>We have allowed appeals from the decisions <span

Considering that the private respondents in the instant case are mere
salesgirls who were trying to obtain better working benefits for themselves, we
find no grave abuse of discretion on the part of NLRC when it entertained their
appeal from the award of an enormous sum in damages to their employer by the
Labor Arbiter.</p>
