the Armed Forces of the Philippines assigned to the Narcotics Command at San
Fernando, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, as intelligence operative,
testified that at about 1:00 o'clock in the afternoon of December 2, 1986, a
Buy Bust Operation team was organized by Operation Officer Capt. <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> Tomas in view of an informant's (identity
undisclosed) report of an on-going drug trafficking in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Tinajero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bacolor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> de la Cruz, member of the Philippine Army,
Narcotics Command, was to act as poseur-buyer and was given marked money in the
total sum of P50.00 consisting of two (2) P20.00 and one (1) P10.00 bills
(Exhibits "I" to "I-2", "J" to "J­-2"
and "K" to "K-2").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon arrival at the scene of the incident at <st1:time minute="0" hour="15">3:00 o'clock p.m.</st1:time>, the civilian informer intro­duced De la
Cruz to the accused as a friend of said informer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>De la Cruz offered to buy P50.00 worth of
marijuana from the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Accused went
to a corner at the back of a house and came back bringing with him the
marijuana dried leaves contained in one (1) plastic bag measuring one-half foot
in length and four (4) inches in width and which approximately weighed eighteen
(18) grams (Exhibit "G").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
accused gave De la Cruz the marijuana and the latter in turn proffered the
P50.00 marked bills.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>De la Cruz wiped <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">his </span>face with a handkerchief as a
pre-arranged signal to his companions to arrest the accused, which they
did.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Accused's</span>
companion who was with him all the time was able to scamper and ran away but
accused himself was brought to the Police Station at <span class="SpellE">Bacolor</span>,

team had him <span class="SpellE">blottered</span> and searched.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They found the marked money in <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> possession (TSN, pp. 32-59, May 19, 1987; pp.
104-107, September 16, 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
apprehending officers brought the accused to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>

took <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> fingerprints and prepared a Booking
Sheet and Arrest Report (Exhibits "D" to "D-4", TSN, pp.
59-65, May 19, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Eufronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span>,
Jr. who apprehended the accused corroborated Sgt. de la Cruz' statements to the
effect that he saw the accused deliver the marijuana and De la Cruz gave the
P50.00 marked bills.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At Camp <span class="SpellE">Olivas</span>, the accused underwent custodial investigation
without having been informed of his constitutional rights to remain silent, to
counsel and to be informed of such rights and was made to sign a Receipt of
Property Confiscated/Seized (Exhibits "A" to "A-3")
consisting of the 18 grams marijuana dried leaves and the P50.00 marked bills,
a Waiver of Detention under Art. <span class="GramE">125, RPC (Exhibits
"B" to "B-1").</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The arresting officers executed a joint affidavit in connection with the
apprehension of the accused (Exhibits "C" to "C-2", TSN,
pp. 2-21, March 10, 1987; pp. 92-96, June 10, 1987; pp. 165-168, 171-177,
December 9, 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Capt. Marlene <span class="SpellE">Salangad</span>, Forensic Chemist of the Philippine Constabulary
confirmed that the specimen indicated in Exhibit "A" weighs
approximately thirteen (13) grams of marijuana dried leaves contained in a
cellophane pack (Exhibit "G") and which was wrapped with a piece of
bond paper (Exhibit "F").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
physical, chemical and confirmatory tests taken, the specimen proved to be
positive for marijuana, a prohibited drug (Technical Report No. UB-510A-86,
Exhibits "H" to "H-1", TSN, pp. 72-86, <st1:date year="1987" day="10" month="6">June 10, 1987</st1:date>).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, the defense presented the accused <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Yutuc</span> as its lone
witness, who testified that he is 18 years of age having been born on <st1:date year="1969" day="7" month="5">May 7, 1969</st1:date>, single, is a helper of
his mother and a resident of <span class="SpellE">Tinajero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bacolor</span>, <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Pampanga</span></span>
since birth.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On that fateful day of <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1986</st1:date> at about <st1:time minute="0" hour="16">4:00 o'clock</st1:time> in the afternoon, he was at the
road near their house at <span class="SpellE">Tinajero</span>, <span class="SpellE">Bacolor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> about to pay
P230.00 for the rice which his mother purchased at the store located near their
house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The money given to him by his
mother to pay the rice consisted of two (2) P50.00 bills; five (5) P20.00
bills; and three P10.00 bills.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Prior to
the intended payment, a person approached him and inquired about a person whose
name he forgot.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He denied any knowledge
of said person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Another person arrived
and they exchanged signals to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Then PC soldiers came.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The first
person who inquired ran away and the soldiers handcuffed him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>C2C Oscar Imperial manacled him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He asked Imperial the reason for shackling
him but the officer refused to say anything.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>His aunt came, held him in the arms and asked the PC soldiers why they
put handcuffs on the accused and brought him with them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PC soldiers did not answer her questions
but simply drew their guns.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He felt
frightened and his aunt released him from her hold.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was made to board a car and sat in the
middle of two (2) persons.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The PC
soldiers were in civilian clothes and inside the <span class="GramE">car,</span>
he was beaten and boxed several times all over his body by said soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was brought to the Municipal Building of <span class="SpellE">Bacolor</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> and was
subjected to interrogation concerning the sale of marijuana and his personal
circumstances.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He denied having anything
to do with <span class="GramE">a marijuana</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Later, he was brought to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>
but while they were on the way, apprehending officers <span class="SpellE">Villaruz</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Sapad</span>, Imperial, De la Cruz and Baking hit him and
boxed him several times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>While being
maltreated, they asked him the name of the person who ran away and again he
denied knowledge of said person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>They
boxed him for giving such response.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the NARCOM Office, <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>, Imperial, De la Cruz
and <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span> kicked him and he was thrown by the impact
of the assault.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was made to sign
Exhibits "A", "B" and "D" under threats to kill
him if he would not sign them.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because
he could not read the documents presented to him, he asked the soldiers to read
the documents to him, and they replied that he was just a "nobody" to
make such a request.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fearful of his
life, he gave in and involuntarily signed said papers without having been
informed of the contents thereof and without the assistance of counsel in
violation of his constitutional rights.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>He was detained at <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype> <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place> for one (1) month and
seven (7) days.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Fifteen (15) days after
his detention, his mother filed a petition for habeas corpus (Exhibit
"1") but the same was dismissed upon filing of the Information
against him on <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1987</st1:date>
(Exhibit "2").</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">He denied having been
engaged in selling <span class="GramE">marijuana,</span> neither did he smoke

money marked as Exhibits "I", "J" and "K" as part
of the P230.00 his mother gave him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At
the time the money <span class="GramE">were</span> taken from him, no markings

<p class="BODY">Well-entrenched is the rule that trial courts' findings of facts
carry great weight for these courts have the privi­lege of examining the
demeanor of the witnesses while on the witness stand, and therefore, can
discern if these witnesses are telling the truth or not.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The exception lies when (1) the conclusion is
a finding based entirely on specu­lations; (2) the inference made is manifestly
mistaken, absurd or impossible; (3) there is grave abuse of discretion; (4) the
judgment is based on a misapprehension of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">facts;
</span>and (5) the court, in making its findings, went beyond the issues of the
case and the same are contrary to the admission of both the appellant and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> (People v. <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>, 157
SCRA 182 [1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">In its findings of guilt against the accused, the trial court
gave more weight and credence to the evidence of the prosecution, both
testimonial and documentary.</p>

<p class="BODY">It laid stress on the credibility of the testimonies of the
members of the "Buy Bust Operation Team" organized with the duty to
enforce the law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>As such, they were
supposed to be parts and parcels of the law enforcement agencies of the
government which enjoy the presumption of regularity in the performance of
their duties, and added that there being no evil or improper motive in the
minds of all the members of the apprehending team or any of them to make a
false imputation against the accused, the credibility of their declarations is
further strengthened (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 44-45).</p>

<p class="BODY">However, a meticulous scrutiny of the records discloses that the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses are not only fraught with inconsistencies
and contradictions but the actions of the police officers in question
indisputably show a callous disregard of the Constitution and of the law which
would amount to a mockery of justice to impress on their actions the
presumption of regularity and on their testimonies with honesty and good faith.</p>

<p class="BODY">In an <span class="SpellE">unrebutted</span> testimony, the accused
established that he was boxed and maltreated particularly when asked the name
of the person who ran away.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the

and impact of the punishment.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was
threatened and intimidated into signing incriminatory admissions.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was illegally detained from <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="12">December 2, 1986</st1:date> to <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="1">January 9, 1987</st1:date>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1986" day="17" month="12">December
 17, 1986</st1:date>, the <span class="SpellE">accused's</span> mother filed a
petition for Habeas Corpus thereby practically forcing the filing of the
information in the instant case on <st1:date year="1987" day="9" month="1">January
 9, 1987</st1:date> before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In view of the filing of said information,
the Petition for Habeas Corpus became moot and academic and was dismissed by
the Regional Trial Court on that ground but not before it has noted that the
detention of the accused by the NARCOM agents was "without any legal
basis." <span class="GramE">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 75-76).</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Undeniably, the prosecution witnesses <span class="SpellE">Sgts</span>.
De la Cruz and <span class="SpellE"><span class="GramE">Sapad</span></span><span class="GramE">,</span> committed a criminal act, a plain violation of Article 125
of the Revised Penal Code, if not plain arbitrary detention (Article 124 of the
same Code).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span> admitted in open court that he was aware that the detention
of the accused was in violation of the Revised Penal Code (Hearing, December 9,
1987; TSN, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pp. </span>7, 8, 9).</p>

<p class="BODY">Under the circumstances, there is merit in defense counsel's
contention that these prosecution witnesses who are sworn to protect the
citizenry, yet have knowingly violated the Constitution and the law, hardly
deserve to be given any credence at all.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Otherwise stated, there can be no conviction on the basis of their
testimonies (<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, p. 88).</p>

<p class="BODY">Verily, the presumption that official duty has been regularly
performed cannot, by itself, prevail against the constitutional presumption of
innocence accorded an accused person (People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 51 [Oct. 14,
1986]; People <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">v. </span>Fernando, 145
SCRA 151 [Oct. 24, 1986]; People v. Flores, G.R. No. 65647 [Aug. 30, 1988];
People v. <span class="SpellE">Carido</span>, G.R. No. 32242 [Nov. 18, 1988]).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even more categorically, the Court stated that the common <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">modus operandi</span></u> of narcotic agents
of utilizing poseur-buyers does not always commend itself as the most reliable
way to go after violators of the Dangerous Drugs Act as it is susceptible to
mistake as well as to harassment, ex­tortion and abuse (People v. Fernando, <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">supra</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
10.0pt">).<u><o:p></o:p></u></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Still further, full faith and credence cannot be accorded to the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses particularly those of the two
arresting officers, as they are replete with contradictions and tainted with
inaccuracies.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Eufronio</span> <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span>,
Jr., himself the arresting officer, was so confused that even on direct <span class="GramE">examination,</span> he could not even distinguish the accused from
the informer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He testified thus:</p>

<blockquote>"FISCAL LISING:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp; </span>Can you possibly identify this informer who

1987).</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. De la Cruz who acted as poseur-buyer simply declared that
the report came from a civilian informant (TSN, pp. 36-37, May 19, 1987).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The identity of the informer was not
revealed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>For no apparent reason, he was
not pre­sented as a witness, although there appears to be no point in
concealing his identity for as Sgt. de la Cruz testified, the informer was with
him when he arrested the accused and introduced him to the latter (Hearing, May
19, 1987; TSN, pp. 17, 18, 19); giving rise to another disputable presumption
that evidence <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span> suppressed would be adverse if
produced (Rule 131, Sec. 5(e); People v. Ale, 145 SCRA 50 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">As to the number of suspected drug pushers per verbal report from
the alleged informant, Sgt. de la Cruz was not even certain.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At first, he said there was one and then he
said there were two.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He declared as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Question:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What was the purpose of that civilian
informant who went to your office on <st1:date year="1986" day="2" month="12">Decem­ber

<p class="BODY">As to whom the verbal report of the informant was directed, both
NARCOM agents’ statements are at war with each other despite their presence at
the time the report was received, since Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span>
swears that the informant reported the matter of drug trafficking <u>to his
officemates</u> (TSN, p. 7, March 10, 1987) while Sgt. de la Cruz stated that
it was to <u>Operations Officer Captain <span class="SpellE">Honorio</span> Tomas</u>
to whom the information was relayed (TSN, p. 38, May 19, 1987) then amended it
to <u>Commanding Officer Col. Roberto <span class="SpellE">Kalinisan</span></u>
(TSN, pp. 111-112, September 16, 1987, emphasis supplied).</p>

<p class="BODY">Even the physical evidence is suspect since Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span> who was supposed to be the seizing officer affirmed
that the marked money were returned to him and he had them <span class="SpellE">xeroxed</span>
but when asked who returned the same, he replied that the money was on file (TSN,
p. 18, March 10, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">And again as to who placed the dots on the marked money, the
answers of the two soldiers did not jibe.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span> said that <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">all </span>of them</u> placed the dots on the
marked bills (TSN, p. 94, June 10, 1987) while Sgt. de <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
16.0pt">la </span>Cruz stated that Operations Officer Capt. Tomas placed them
(TSN, pp. 118-119, September 16, 1987).</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span> testified that the plastic
bag delivered to Sgt. de la Cruz contained <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">five fingers, dried marijuana leaves weighing approximately 18 grams</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>(TSN, pp. 10-12, March 10, 1987;
Exhibits "A" to "A-3", "E" to
"E-2").<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In contrast, the
Laboratory Examination Report, confirmed by the testimony of Marlene <span class="SpellE">Salangad</span>, Forensic Chemist of the PC Crime Laboratory, who
examined the contents, shows that they consisted exclusively of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">marijuana fruiting tops weighing thirteen
(13) grams</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span></span>This discrepancy finds no explanation
in the record.</p>

<p class="BODY">In contrast, the testimony of the accused is direct, consistent
and devoid of any prevarication.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Contrary to the claim of the prosecution that the defense limited itself
to bare denial, the accused clearly explained that he was arrested when about
to pay for the rice his mother has bought.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>The marked money allegedly used to pay him was part of the two hundred
thirty pesos (P230.00) his mother gave him to pay for the rice.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His testimony remained unshaken despite rigid
cross-examination.</p>

<p class="BODY">The accused maintained that he does not sell nor smoke marijuana
(Decision, Trial Court, p. 16).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His
statement is confirmed by the fact that he has no criminal record unlike in the
case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Boholst</span> (152 SCRA 271 [1987]) whose
doctrine is sought by the Solicitor General to be applied to this case, where
the accused was previously convicted of frustrated murder, robbery, hold-up and
violation of R.A. 6425 as drug pusher.</p>

<p class="BODY">As to documentary evidence, there is merit in the claim that the
trial court erred in admitting the exhibits in question which were taken from
the accused in patent disregard of the latter's constitutional rights.</p>

<p class="BODY">As earlier narrated, after he was arrested and on the way to <st1:place><st1:placetype>Camp</st1:placetype>
 <st1:placename><span class="SpellE">Olivas</span></st1:placename></st1:place>,
he was beaten, boxed, pushed and kicked.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>At the NARCOM Office, without being informed of his right to silence and
of his right not to incriminate himself, he was threatened and/or intimidated to
sign several documents now marked Exhibits "A", "B",
"D", "F", "I", <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">"J" </span>and "K" (Hearing, December 10, 1987;
TSN, pp. 24, 25, 26, 29, 30).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because he
could not read and understand the docu­ments presented to him, he requested
that the said documents be read to him but his request was rudely denied.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He was a "nobody" the soldiers said
(<u>Ibid</u>.; TSN, p.<b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:8.0pt"> </span></b>27).</p>

<p class="BODY">Afraid and thoroughly intimidated, the accused signed the

<blockquote><span class="GramE">(Hearing, December 9,
1987; TSN, pp. 10-12, Record, pp. 171-173; TSN, pp. 13-16; Record, pp.
174-176).</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">These documents were signed by the accused during custodial investigation
without the assistance of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
was not informed of his constitutional right to silence and obviously under
threats of violence and intimidation upon his person.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He might have been informed of his right to
counsel but not that he may be provided with one if he cannot afford the
services of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>More than that, if
it can be assumed that he waived said right, the waiver was not in writing and
not in the presence of counsel.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In any
event, this Court ruled that the written instruments are declaration against
interest and tacit admission of the crime charged, since mere unexplained
possession of pro­hibited drugs is punishable by law.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">These</span> documentary
evi­dence is in the same category as extra-judicial confessions outlawed by the
Constitution (People v. <span class="SpellE">Turla</span>, G.R. No. 70270,
November 11, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">There is, therefore, no question that the admissions of the
accused were <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">taken without strict
observance of Section </span>20, Article IV of the Constitution which provides
in no uncertain terms that "Any confession obtained in violation of this
section shall be inadmissible in evidence."</p>

<p class="BODY">Thus, this Court has ruled that the rights guaranteed during a
custodial investigation are not supposed to be merely communicated to the
suspect especially if he is un­lettered, but must be painstakingly explained to
him so he can understand their nature and significance.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, manhandling of any sort will
vitiate any extrajudicial confession that may be extracted from him and renders
it inadmissible in evidence against him (People v. <span class="SpellE">Opida</span>,
142 SCRA 296 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The evidence as to whether or not <span class="SpellE">Yutuc</span>
participated in the sale of marijuana is not enough to convict him beyond
reasonable doubt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But assuming he did
sell, there remains the issue of whether he was <u>induced</u> to sell or was
merely <u>entrapped</u> into looking for marijuana to sell.</p>

<p class="BODY">Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> <span class="SpellE">dela</span>
Cruz narrated that he approached the accused <span class="GramE">who</span> was
with one <span class="SpellE">Arnel</span> Garcia and told him "<span class="SpellE">iiscore</span> <span class="SpellE">ako</span> <span class="SpellE">ng</span>
marijuana," meaning, he will buy marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The accused then allegedly went inside a
street at the back of a house and came back bringing along with him the
marijuana for which he (Sgt. de la Cruz) paid the marked P50.00 (Hearing, Sep­tember
16, 1987, TSN, pp. 32 to 41).</p>

<p class="BODY">On the other hand, Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Sapad</span> on cross
examination ad­mitted that because of the verbal report of the informant, he
already had a pre-conceived notion, a pre-judgment that there really was
illegal sale of drugs in <span class="SpellE">Tinajero</span> and that accused
was selling marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He admitted
further that he and his companion practically <u>induced</u> the suspect into
the commission of the offense.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He
testified as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Question:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without you having been a buyer or your
companion having been a buyer, you would agree with me that there would not
have been a charge against the accused, is that correct?</blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Yes, sir.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Question:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In other words, you <u>induced practi­cally
the suspect into commission of an offense, is that correct</u>?<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>Yes, sir</u>.<u><o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote>Question:<span style="mso-tab-count:
1"> </span>Mr. Witness, you have been in investigation for so long.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>I am asking you a very important question,
which may redound to the future of this poor boy:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>- you do not know the difference between the
instigation and entrapment, as an investigator, is that correct?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No, sir.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Question:<span style="mso-tab-count:1"> </span>As a matter of fact,
that was not even a subject of your seminar or any other training before you
undergo raiding like this?<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<span style="mso-tab-count:1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not know that,
sir.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Question:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><u>In short, you instigated
the commission of the crime?</u> <o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Answer:<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE"><u>Yes, sir.</u>"</span><o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(Hearing, December 9, 1987, TSN, pp. 18
to 20), Underscoring supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On all fours with the case at bar is the case of People v. <span class="SpellE">Lapatha</span>, et al. (G.R. Nos. 63074-75, November 9, 1988),
where the Court ruled that instigation and not entrapment prevailed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Under similar circumstances, the accused in
said case was not looking for buyers at the time when the poseur-buyer asked
for the drug and practically induced the former to commit the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the same case, the Court distinguished instigation from
entrapment as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"In entrapment, ways and means are resorted to for the purpose
of trapping and capturing the law breakers in the execution of their criminal
plan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, in instigation,
the instigator practically induces the would-be defendant into the commission
of the offense, and himself becomes a co-principal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Entrapment is no bar to prosecution and
conviction, while in <span class="GramE">instigation,</span> the defendant would
have to be acquitted."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In another case, this Court ruled further that entrapment must be
distinguished from inducement or instigation wherein the criminal intent
originates in the mind of the instigator and the accused is lured into the
commission of the offense charged in order to prosecute him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In entrapment, the crime had already been committed,
while in instigation, it was not and could not have been committed were it not
for the instiga­tion of the peace officer (People v. <span class="SpellE">Gatong</span>-o,
G.R. No. 78698, December 29, 1988).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the accused denied having sold marijuana to
the Narcotics Command agents nor had he been engaged at any time in the sale of
marijuana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>His statement is confirmed by
the fact that he has no police or criminal record.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Never­theless, assuming that he did sell the
drug as alleged by the prosecution, it would appear that when Sgt. <span class="SpellE">Juanito</span> de la Cruz approached the accused, the latter was
not looking for buyers of marijuana nor was he in possession of any mari­juana.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was Sgt. de la Cruz who proposed to buy
marijuana from the accused after having been introduced to the latter as a
user.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, the accused is alleged
to have entered an alley at the back of a house and later returned with the
marijuana for which Sgt. de la Cruz paid the accused P50.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Without the proposal and instigation of Sgt.
de la Cruz, the alleged sale of marijuana would not have transpired.</p>

<p class="BODY">It is quite clear that Sgt. de la Cruz suggested the commission
of the crime by offering the accused P50 for the purchase of the prohibited
drug which was not even in the possession of the accused.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Otherwise stated, Sgt. de la Cruz instigated
the accused to look for marijuana which he (Sgt. de la Cruz) would buy or pay
for P50.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>When an employee of the
government, as in this case, encourages or induces persons to commit a crime in
order to prosecute them, such conduct is most reprehensible (U.S. vs. Phelps,
16 Phil. 440, as cited in People v. <span class="SpellE">Lapatha</span>
[supra]).<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Clearly, there was instigation
in the case at bar and the defendant is entitled to acquittal.</p>

<p class="BODY">In any event therefore, the issue as to whether or not the
testimonies of the prosecution witnesses could be believed, is immaterial as
against the fact that instigation transpired in the case at bar and not
entrapment, in which case the accused would have to be acquitted.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, if the <span class="SpellE">inculpatory</span> facts and
circumstances are capable of two or more explanations one of which is
consistent with the innocence of the accused and the other consistent with his
guilt, then the evidence does not fulfill the test of moral certainty and is
not sufficient to support conviction (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Taruc</span>,
pp. 186-187, <u>supra</u>).<u><o:p></o:p></u></p>

<p class="BODY">The scales of justice must hang equal and in fact, should even be
tipped in favor of the accused because of the constitutional presumption of
innocence (People vs. <span class="SpellE">Opida</span>, 142 SCRA 303 [1986]).</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE</b>, the judgment of conviction is REVERSED and SET
ASIDE and accused <span class="SpellE">Estanislao</span> <span class="SpellE">Yutuc</span>
