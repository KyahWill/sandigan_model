<p class="BODY">The antecedent facts that gave rise to this prosecution are
succinctly summarized in the Brief for the Appellee as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"At the time of the incident that gave rise to this
prosecution for Rape, complainant Leticia V. Soria was an 18-year-old barrio
lass residing in a one-story house located at Barangay Danao in Mati, Davao
Oriental (TSN, 6 November 1989, pp. 43-45).  Her companions in the house at that time were her mother Consolacion,
her married sister Julita Soria and her elder brother Mario Soria (ibid., pp.
45, 50, 52; TSN, 23 October 1989, p. 6).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant Domingo Casinillo, on the other hand, was known to
complainant since 1988, he being the uncle of Rosita Dialon, her class­mate and
friend when she was still studying at Iba sometime in 1988 (TSN, 6 November
1989, pp. 46-48; TSN, 13 November 1989, p. 22; TSN, 19 April 1990, p. 23).</blockquote>

<blockquote>At about 8:30 in the evening of 13 May 1989, while complainant,
along with her mother Consolacion, her brother Mario and her sister Julieta,
were resting inside the kitchen of their house in said locality, somebody
suddenly pushed the kitchen door and barged inside the house, followed by two
companions (TSN, 6 November 1989, pp. 45-46, 50, 70; TSN, 13 November 1989, pp.
8-9; TSN, 21 September 1989, p. 22; TSN, 26 October 1989, pp. 58-59).  By the light of the fluorescent lamp in the
kitchen, she recognized the intruders to be appellant, who was armed with a
short firearm and wearing a black T-shirt and pants covered by an orange
jacket, and his co-accused Danilo Valles and Rolando Valles (TSN, 6 November
1989, pp. 46, 48-50, 52, 70-71; TSN, 13 November 1989, pp. 9-10).<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant asked them if other persons were inside the house and,
without waiting <span style="">for </span>an answer,
proceeded to search the rooms (TSN, 6 November 1989, p. 49; TSN, 26 October
1989, p. 61).  When her mother
Consolacion asked appellant why he was searching the house, the latter poked a
revolver at her head and peremptorily told <span style="">her </span>to keep quiet or else he would kill all of them (TSN, 6
November 1989, p. 50; TSN, 21 September 1989, pp. 18-21, 40).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, appellant took a curtain <span style="">inside </span>the house, tore it to pieces and tied her mother <span style="">and </span>brother's hands with it (TSN, 6
November 1989, pp. 51-52).  Thereafter,
when accused Rolando Valles and Danilo Valles brought Mario outside the house,
appellant grabbed her hands and also tied them (TSN, 6 November 1989, pp.
52-54).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Subsequently, appellant forcibly brought complaint <span style="">(sic) </span>outside the house with a gun
poked at her (ibid., pp. 55-56).  Appellant then told her they would go to the house of her neighbor, Emok
Ganabe, and that she would be the one to knock on the door (ibid., p. 57).  Fearful for her life, she went along with
him (ibid.).</blockquote>

<blockquote>On the way and at a distance of about 300 meters away from her
house, appellant suddenly stopped complainant from proceeding further and
dragged her towards the bushes (ibid., p. 58; TSN, 13 November 1989, pp.
47-48).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant suddenly boxed complainant twice in the solar plexus
which caused her to collapse on the ground (TSN, 6 November 1989, p. 58).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereupon, appellant hugged and kissed her, telling her, 'if you
would only agree to what we would do now, then everything would be alright'
(ibid., pp. 58-59).  Complainant tried
to wriggle herself free but then appellant hit her hard on the right thigh with
his firearm (ibid., p. 59).  When she
continued to resist, appellant boxed her thighs several times which made her
feel weak (ibid.).  Appellant poked his
gun at her and ordered her to raise her hands.  Appellant raised her T-shirt and then proceeded to suck her nipples and
to <span style="">kiss </span>her all over the body
(ibid., p. 60).  Vainly, she tried with
all her might to kick appellant but did not hit him (ibid.; TSN, 13 November
1989, p. 43).  Appellant pulled down her
checkered shorts and black panty (Exhs. "C" and "D",
Envelop of prosecution exhibits, Crim. Case No. 1847) which made her struggle
all the more to free herself from his clutches but appellant boxed her again on
both thighs which caused her to feel weaker (ibid., pp. 61, 63).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thereafter, while she cried and begged him to stop, appellant
undressed himself and went on top of her (ibid., p. 63).  When she crossed her legs, appellant
forcibly opened them and inserted his legs between hers (ibid., p. 64).  Appellant then tried to kiss her but she
evaded this by turning her face sidewards.  He boxed her again (ibid., pp. 64-65; TSN, 13 November 1989, p. 44).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant covered complainant's mouth with one hand and pointed the
gun at her throat with the other (ibid.; TSN, 13 November 1989, p. 40).  This time she felt that appellant's penis
was hard (TSN, 6 November 1989, p. 65).  Whenever she resisted or moved her body, appellant would punch her
thighs and body, thereby causing her to feel very very weak (ibid.).  Finally, she felt appellant insert his penis
inside her vagina which caused her <span style="">so </span>much
pain, this being her first sexual experience (ibid., pp. 63, 66; TSN, 13
November 1989, pp. 40, 42).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Afterwards, appellant ordered her to dress up and she angrily
screamed at him, 'How could I dress up when my hands are tied!' (TSN, 6
November 1989, p. 67).  He untied her
hands and while dressing up, she felt pain not only in her vagina but also all
over her body and noticed bloodstains on her T-shirt (ibid., pp. 66-67; TSN, 13
November 1989, pp. 44-45).</blockquote>

<blockquote>Appellant brought her back to her house where she saw her mother,
her elder sister and their neighbors Pacita Dicdican and Libertad Callao (TSN,
6 November 1989, pp. 68-69; TSN, 13 November 1989, p. 46).  Appellant, warned her not to tell anybody
that he raped her and headed downstairs (TSN, 6 November 1989, pp. 68,
76).  After appellant left, however, she
told her mother what happened (ibid., p. 69; TSN, 13 November 1989, p. 46).</blockquote>

<blockquote>The following morning, 14 May 1989, she and her mother, accompanied
by her brothers Danilo, Sanito and Mario, together with their aforenamed
neighbors reported the rape to Barangay Captain Patricio Cabingatan who, in
turn, brought them to the police headquarters in Mati, Davao Oriental (TSN, 6
November 1989, pp. 72-74; TSN, 13 November 1989, pp. 17, 19, <span style="">36).  </span>From
the police station, she proceeded to the Provincial Hospital of Davao Oriental,
where she was physically examined, by Dra. Virginia Landigan issued (sic) her
Medical (sic) Certificate (TSN, 6 November 1989, p. 74).  (Exh. ”A”, F<span style="">older </span>of Exhs., p. 1) which discloses the following findings:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">‘Hymenal laceration at 5:00 o'clock position of bleeding;<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="2Q">Multiple contusion-hematoma at medial aspect of both thighs.'<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>Afterwards, she returned to the police station in Mati, Davao
Oriental, where she gave her Statement relating the incident (TSN, 6 November
1989, p. 75; TSN, 13 November 1989, <span style="">pp.
19-20)."</span><a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Appellant interposed the defense of alibi.  According to him, on 13 May 1989, he was in
his house in Dawan, Mati, Davao Oriental together <span style="">with </span>his wife and son; he alleges that he never left this place.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
His wife (Rosalinda) and father (Guillermo) corroborated his story. </p>

<p class="BODY">In his Brief, appellant claims:</p>

<blockquote>"1.  THAT THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN
FINDING THAT THE PRIVATE OFFENDED PARTY, LETICIA V. SORIA, POSITIVELY
IDENTIFIED THE ACCUSED;</blockquote>

<blockquote>2.  THAT THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN
RULING THAT THE PRIVATE OFFENDED PARTY, LETICIA V. SORIA, IS CREDIBLE AND THAT HER
TESTIMONY IS WORTHY OF BELIEF; AND<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>3.  THAT THE LOWER COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN
DECIDING THAT THE ACCUSED IS GUILTY BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT."<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In his joint discussion of these errors, appellant insists that
the offended party <span style="">was </span>not able
to positively identify him as evidenced by the 14 May 1988 entries in the
Police Blotter<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
which <span style="">show </span>that the<span style=""> </span>persons who committed the crime of
rape were wearing masks of white cloth.  The particular entry reads:</p>

<blockquote>“1020H -- The person of Consolacion Soria y Villamor, of legal age,
married, farmer and a resident of Danao, this municipality, appeared this (sic)
headquarters with the complaint that her daughter was raped <span style="">by </span>two unidentified persons wearing a
mask (sic) (white cloth) at about 8:30 o'clock in the evening of May 13, 1989,
inside their house at the bushy grasses, after, the reporter (sic) both hands
hagtied (sic).  Victim was advised to go
to the provincial hospital.  Case was
referred to Investigation Section.”<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a></blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">There was likewise no positive
identification because the victim failed to inform the barangay captain that it
was the accused who raped her.  She thus
perjured herself when she stated in her affidavit and during the preliminary
investigation before the Municipal Trial Court that she knew and recognized her
assailant.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant also questions the three (3) police "lineups"
of the four (4) accused on the ground that the same were conducted without the
assistance of counsel; moreover, the accused were not informed of their right
to counsel.  He further claims that
these lineups "only help (sic) to underscore the nagging doubts that
plagued the complainants as to the identity of the four accused," and
"were resorted to because complainants Leticia Soria and Pacita Dicdican
were unsure of their respective (alleged) assailants."<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><i><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></i></p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, he maintains that the prosecution deliberately failed to
present P/Sgt. Arnold Malintad, who led the police team that arrested the four
(4) accused, and barangay captain Patricio Cabingatan.<a style="" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">What is then in issue in this appeal is the credibility of the
offended party.</p>

<p class="BODY">Rape is truly a most detestable crime for it involves not only an
intrusion into a woman's privacy, but also a violation of her sensibilities and
an assault on her human dignity.  Its
traumatic consequences on the unfortunate <span style="">victim
</span>and gruesome <span style="">i</span>njury to
the peace and order of the community cannot be ignored.<a style="" href="#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup></span></span></a>
Thus, once established, it must be severely and impartially punished.<a style="" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">However, it is fundamental that an accusation is not synonymous
with guilt;<a style="" href="#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup></span></span></a>
in our legal system, every accused is presumed innocent <span style="">until </span>the contrary is proved.<a style="" href="#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup></span></span></a> It
is therefore, incumbent upon the prosecution to demonstrate the culpability of
the accused and overthrow the presumption of innocence with proof beyond
reasonable doubt.<a style="" href="#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup></span></span></a> In
determining whether or not the prosecution's evidence meets this standard, it
is necessary for the court to scrutinize the same independently of the defense
offered by the accused.  It is only if
and when, upon such a review, the court reaches the conclusion that the crime
charged was committed by the very person standing trial may a judgment of
conviction be correctly rendered.</p>

<p class="BODY">Absolute certainty of guilt is not, however, demanded by law for
a conviction.  The sphere of criminal
law does not call for such degree of proof as would exclude the possibility of
error.  Only moral certainty as to the
presence of the elements constituting the offense, as well as to the identity
of the offender, is required; in short, what is needed is that degree of proof which
produces conviction in an unprejudiced mind.<a style="" href="#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup></span></span></a> The
conscience must be satisfied that on the accused could be laid the
responsibility for the offense charged:  that not only did he perpetrate the act, but that it amounted to a
crime.<a style="" href="#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup></span></span></a>
The strongest suspicion must not be permitted to sway judgment;<a style="" href="#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup></span></span></a>
if a reasonable doubt exists, that doubt must be resolved in favor of the
accused and he must be acquitted.<a style="" href="#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Furthermore, considering the severity of the penalties prescribed
for the offense of rape, courts are enjoined to take<span style=""> </span>extreme care in weighing the evidence in order to avoid an
injustice to the accused.  Thus, this
Court has set three (3) basic guiding principles in reviewing rape cases:  (1) an accusation for rape can be made with
facility; it is difficult to prove, but more difficult for the person accused,
though innocent, to disprove; (2) in view of the intrinsic nature of the crime <span style="">of </span>rape where only two (2) persons are
usually involved, the testimony of the complainant must be scrutinized with extreme
caution; and (3) the evidence for the prosecution must stand or fall on its own
merits, and cannot be allowed to draw strength from the weakness of the
evidence for the defense.<a style="" href="#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Guided by the foregoing principles, this Court undertook a
careful and meticulous review, analysis and evaluation of the evidence <span style="">in </span>this case and reached the
inevitable conclusion that the appellant's guilt has been proven beyond
reasonable doubt.  The findings o<span style="">f fact </span>of the trial court are
supported by convincing and credible evidence upon which Our minds can rest
unburdened by any doubt.  The said court
has not overlooked any fact of substance and value which, if considered, might
affect the result of this case.  We <span style="">find </span>then no reason to disturb such
findings.  This <span style="">is </span>a settled rule in this jurisdiction.<a style="" href="#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, the offended party positively recognized the
appellant from the time he and his companions barged into the kitchen which was
then well lit.  His face was exposed
from the time he dragged her out of the house to the time he raped her by the
bushes and <span style="">brought </span>her back to
the house.  Hence, the appellant was not
only clearly and unmistakably seen <span style="">in </span>the
vicinity of the crime, he was also positively identified by the offended party
as her assailant and ravager.  Aside
from the fact that her testimony is full of sincerity and candor, there is
absolutely no proof that she was improperly motivated to testify against the
appellant.  It is difficult to conceive
of a reason that would have motivated the offended party, a provincial lass, to
undergo the embarrassment and humiliation of a public trial affecting her honor
and submit herself to the examination of her private parts other than for the
purpose of bringing her defiler to justice.<a style="" href="#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup></span></span></a> Her
testimony deserves full faith and credit.<a style="" href="#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup></span></span></a>
Besides, she was able to weather the rigorous <span style="">cross-</span>examination which sought to cast doubt on her
testimony.  She was unwavering in her
identification of the appellant.<span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant's reliance on the police blotter deserves nothing more
than the scantest consideration.  In the
first place, "[t]he entry in the police blotter is not necessarily
entitled to full credit for it c<span style="">ould </span>be
incomplete and inaccurate, sometimes from either partial suggestions or for
want of suggestion or inquiries, without the aid of which the witness may be
unable to recall the connected collateral circumstances necessary for the
correction of the first suggestion of his memory and for his accurate
recollection of all that pertain to the subject."<a style="" href="#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup></span></span></a>
In the second place, the entries relied upon by the appellant are sadly wanting
in material particulars; this clearly shows that no effort at all was exerted
by the policeman on duty to accurately obtain the facts of the reported crime.  Thirdly, as indicated therein, it is not the
offended party, but rather her mother Consolacion, who is alleged to have
personally made the report.  Fourthly,
there is no evidence that the entries were read to the offended party or that
they were presented to her.  Not having
been entered by her and their being no sufficient showing that she actively
participated in their preparation, these entries cannot fairly or logically
bind her.</p>

<p class="BODY">The grievance concerning the police lineups is misplaced.  The trial court's finding as to the
identification of the accused did not even consider the said lineups.  Moreover, in <i>People vs. Olvis,</i><a style="" href="#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup></span></span></a><i>
</i>this Court ruled, in effect, that a police lineup is not encompassed in the
Constitutional right against testimonial compulsion<a style="" href="#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup></span></span></a>
and the right to counsel.  Thus:</p>

<blockquote>"x x x an act, whether testimonial or passive, that would
amount to disclosure of incriminatory facts <span style="">is </span>covered by the inhibition of the Constitution.<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote>This should be distinguished, parenthetically, from mechanical acts
the accused is made to execute not meant to unearth undisclosed facts but to
ascertain physical attributes determinable by simple observation.  This includes requiring the accused to
submit to a test to extract virus from body,<a style="" href="#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup></span></span></a> or
compelling him to expectorate morphine from his mouth,<a style="" href="#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup></span></span></a>
or making her submit to a pregnancy test,<a style="" href="#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup></span></span></a> or a

In each case, the accused does not speak his guilt.  It is not a prerequisite therefore that he be provided with the
guiding hand of counsel."<span style="font-size: 12pt;"><o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">As to appellant's defense of alibi, <span style="">We </span>have time and again ruled that the same remains to be a
patently weak defense when corroborated only by the testimony of the accused's
spouse or parents who would naturally be expected to give statements that would
free their spouse or son from criminal liability.  For <span style="">alibi </span>to be
acceptable, it must be presented with strong corróboration<a style="" href="#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup></span></span></a>
for it is inherently weak and easily fabricated.<a style="" href="#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup></span></span></a> It
cannot prevail over the positive identification of an accused.<a style="" href="#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Moreover, for the defense of alibi to prosper, it is not <span style="">enough </span>to prove that the accused was
somewhere else when the crime was committed.  It must likewise be undisputably demonstrated that it was physically
impossible for him to have been at the scene of the crime at the time the same
was committed.<a style="" href="#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup></span></span></a>
Appellant failed to show such physical impossibility.</p>

<p class="BODY">Equally without merit is appellant's contention that the
prosecution deliberately suppressed evidence by not presenting P/Sgt. Arnold Malintad
and Barangay Captain Patricio Cabingatan.  The suggested reason, of course, is obvious -- their testimonies would
have been adverse to the prosecution if produced.  This rule, embodied in Section 3 (e), Rule 131 of the Rules of
Court, does not apply if the evidence claimed to be suppressed is merely
corroborative,<a style="" href="#_ftn42" name="_ftnref42" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup></span></span></a>
or is equally available to the accused<a style="" href="#_ftn43" name="_ftnref43" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup></span></span></a>
because in the latter case, the evidence would have the same weight against one
party as against the other.<a style="" href="#_ftn44" name="_ftnref44" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup></span></span></a> In
the instant case, the testimonies of Malintad and Cabingatan would have been
merely corroborative;<span style=""> </span>furthermore,
there is no showing at <span style="">all </span>that
they were not available to the appellant even through compulsory process.</p>

<p class="BODY">Presciding from all the foregoing, We thus affirm the decision
appealed from, except as to the moral damages which, taking into account the
bestiality with which the rape was committed -- leaving a perpetual scar in the
memory of the victim which would affect her future and causing untold outrage
to the moral sense of the community -- should be increased to P40,000.00.</p>
