<p class="BODY">Among the properties included in the "donation mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>" in favor of Ursula was Lot 24, Block No. 15 of

<span class="SpellE">Parungao</span> reached </span>the age of majority or on <st1:date year="1976" day="20" month="12">December 20, 1976</st1:date>, she tried to have
the donation registered.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>However, she
found out that the certificate of title was missing from where it was supposed
to be kept, prompting her to file a petition for reconstitution of title with
the Court of First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petition was granted in October 1977.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Parungao</span> registered
the deed of donation with the Register of Deeds of Manila who cancelled
Transfer Certificate of Title No. 17854 and issued in lieu thereof Transfer
Certificate of Title No. 129092 in the name of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She then filed a motion for exclusion in
Special Proceedings No. 73-30-M.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 2, 1978, Benjamin Reyes, private respondent in G.R. Nos.

of deed of title against Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span> and Rosario <span class="SpellE">Duncil</span> with the then Court of First Instance of

<p class="BODY">In their answer with compulsory counterclaim <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span>

</span>On <st1:date year="1978" day="6" month="11">November 6, 1978</st1:date>,

possession <span style="">over the <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>

First Instance of Manila.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The case was
docketed as Civil Case </span>No. <span style="">119359.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In her complaint, <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span>
also alleged that as early as 1973, the defendants occupied two (2) doors of
the apartment situated at the <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span> property by mere
tolerance of the previous owner, Dr. Emilio <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,

<p class="BODY"><span style="">The issues raised in
these petitions are two-fold:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) In
G.R. No. L-45394, petitioner Pedro <span class="SpellE">Dalusong</span> questions
</span>the jurisdiction o<span style="">f the probate
court to exclude the properties donated to Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
in its Order dated </span><st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="8"><span style="">August 1, 1976</span></st1:date><span style="">, and (2) In G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-45262
and G.R. Nos. 73241-42 <span class="SpellE">Ruperto</span> Reyes, Reynaldo C. San
Juan, in his capacity as special administrator of the estate of Emilio <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> (petitioner in G.R. No.</span> L-­45262), Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span> and Rosario <span class="SpellE">Duncil</span>
(petitioners in G.R. Nos. 73241-42) question the appellate court's finding that
the "Donation Mortis <span class="SpellE">Causa</span>" executed by
Emilio <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> in favor of his sister Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> was actually a Donation <u>Inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Vivos</u></span>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We first discuss the
issue on jurisdiction.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The questioned </span><st1:date year="1976" day="1" month="8"><span style="">August 1,
 1976</span></st1:date><span style=""> order of the
then Court of First Instance of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span> in S. P.
Proc. No. 73-30-M categorically stated that the exclusion from the inventory of
the estate of the deceased Dr. Emilio D. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> was
"without prejudice to its final determination in a separate action."
The provisional character of the exclusion of the contested properties in the
inventory as stressed in the order is within the jurisdiction of the probate
court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This was stressed in the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Cuizon</u></span> <u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Ramolete</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(129 SCRA 495 [1984]) which we cited in the
case of </span><u>Morales</u> <u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> <u>Court</u> <u>First</u> <u>Instance</u> </span><u>of</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u><span style="">Cavite</span></u></span><span style="">, <u>Branch</u> <u>V</u> (146 SCRA </span>373
<span style="">[1986]):<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"It is well-settled rule that a probate court or one in charge
of proceedings whether testate or intestate cannot adjudicate or determine
title to properties claimed to be a part of the estate and which are equally
claimed to belong to outside parties.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>All that the said court could do as regards said properties is to
determine whether they should or should not be included in the inventory or <span style="">list </span>of properties to be administered
by the administrator.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If there is no
dispute, well and good; but if there is, then the parties, the administrator,
and the opposing parties have to resort to an ordinary action for a final
determination of the conflicting claims of title because the probate court
cannot do so (<span class="SpellE">Mallari</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Mallari</span>,
92 Phil. 694; <span class="SpellE">Baquial</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Amihan</span>,
92 Phil. 501).</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Similarly, in Valero <span class="SpellE">Vda</span>.</span>
de Rodriguez v. Court of Appeals, (91 SCRA 540) we held that for the purpose of
determining whether a certain property should or should not be included in the
inventory, the probate court may pass upon the title thereto but such
determination is not conclusive and is subject to the final decision in a
separate action regarding ownership which may be instituted by the parties (3
Moran's Comments on the Rules of Court, 1970 Edition, pages 448-449 and 473; <span class="SpellE">Lachenal</span> v. Salas, L-42257, June 14, 1976, 71 SCRA 262,
266)."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">On the second issue, it may be noted that the Court of Appeals
did not pass upon the authenticity of the 1969 donation to <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span>
because of its finding that the 1966 donation to <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>
was inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The petitioners do not press the authenticity of the 1969 donation as
their challenge centers on whether or not the 1966 donation was inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>. However, the trial court has a lengthy discussion
reflecting adversely on the authenticity of the 1969 donation to <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">The petitioners assert that the 1966 donation was null and void
since it was not executed with the formalities of a will. <span class="GramE">Therefore,
the petitioners in G.R. No.</span> L-45262 <span class="GramE">insist</span> that
the donated properties should revert to the estate of Emilio <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> while the petitioners in G.R. Nos. 73241-42 insist
that the donation of real property inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> in
favor of Ofelia <span class="SpellE">Parungao</span> be given effect.</p>

<p class="BODY">The subject deed of donation titled "DONATION MORTIS
CAUSA" duly notarized by a certain Cornelio M. <span class="SpellE">Sigua</span>
states:</p>

<blockquote>"That Dr. Emilio D. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
Filipino, single of age and resident of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, hereinafter called the DONOR and Ursula D. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>, Filipino, single, also of age, resident of and
with postal address at <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>,
hereinafter called the DONEE, have agreed, as they do hereby agree, to the
following, to wit:</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the said DONOR, Dr. Emilio D. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span>,
for and in consideration of the love and affection which he has and bears unto
the said DONEE, as also for the personal services rendered by the said DONEE to
the said DONOR, does hereby by these presents voluntarily GIVE, GRANT, and
DONATE MORTIS CAUSA, unto the said DONEE URSULA D. PASCUAL, her heirs and
assigns, all of my rights, title and interest, in and to the following parcels
of land with all the improvements thereon, situated in the Municipality of <span class="SpellE">Apalit</span>, <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, and more
particularly described and identified as follows:</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

are 41 parcels of land)</blockquote>

<blockquote>Also included in this DONATION MORTIS CAUSA are all personal
properties of the DONOR in the form of cash money or bank deposits and
insurance in his favor, and his real properties situated in other towns of <span class="SpellE">Pampanga</span>, such as San Simon, and in the province of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, San Francisco del Monte and in the City of Manila.</blockquote>

<blockquote>That the said donor has reserved for himself sufficient property to
maintain him for life; and that the said DONEE does hereby ACCEPT and RECEIVE
this DONATION MORTIS CAUSA, and further does express his appreciation and
gratefulness for the generosity of said DONOR;" <span style="">(<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span> </span>of G.R. No. L-45262, pp. 12-16)</blockquote>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">Considering the
provisions of the DONATION MORTIS CAUSA the appellate court ruled that the deed
of donation was actually a donation inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>
although denominated as DONATION MORTIS CAUSA.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">It is, now a settled rule
that the title given to a deed of donation is not the determinative factor
which makes the donation "inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>" or
"mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>." As early as the case of <span class="SpellE"><u>Laureta</u></span> <u>v.</u> <u>Manta,</u> <u>et</u> <u>al</u>.,
(44 Phil. 668 [1928]) this Court ruled that the dispositions in a deed of
donation - whether "inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>" or
"mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>" do not depend on the title
or term used in the deed of donation but on the provisions stated in such deed.
This Court e</span><span style="">x</span><span style="">plained in <span class="SpellE"><u>Concepcion</u></span>
<u>v.</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>Concepcion</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(91 Phil. 823 [1952]) -<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<blockquote>"xxx But, it is a rule consistently
followed by the courts that it is the body of the document of donation and the
statements contained therein, and not the title that should be considered in
ascertaining the intention of the donor. Here, the donation is entitled and
called <span class="SpellE">donacio</span> <span class="SpellE">onerosa</span>
mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>. From the body, however, we find that
the donation was of a nature remunerative rather than onerous. It was for past
services rendered, services which may not be considered as a debt to be paid by
the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> but services rendered to her freely and in
goodwill.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The donation instead of being
onerous or for a valuable consideration, as in payment of a legal obligation,
was more of <span class="SpellE">remuneratory</span> or compensatory nature,
besides being partly motivated by affection.</blockquote>

<blockquote>We should not give too much importance or significance to or be
guided by the use of the phrase 'mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>' in a
donation and thereby to conclude that the donation is not one of inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the case
of De Guzman et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Ibea</span>, et al. (67 Phil. 633),
this Court through Mr. Chief Justice <span class="SpellE">Avanceña</span> said
that if a donation by its terms is inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>, this
character is not altered by the fact that the donor styles it mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>In the case of <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> v. Mata, et al.
(44 Phil. 668), the court held that the donation involved was inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>. There, the donor<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
<span class="SpellE">Severa</span> <span class="SpellE">Magno</span> y <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> gave the properties involved as -</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">“’a reward for the services which he is rendering me, and as a
token of my affection toward him and of the fact that he stands high in my estimation,
I hereby donate `mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>’ to said youth all the
properties described as follows:</p>

<p class="2Q"><span class="GramE">xxx</span><span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>xxx</p>

<p class="2Q">'"I also declare that it is the condition of this donation
that <span style="">the </span><span class="SpellE">donee</span>
cannot take possession of the properties donated before the death of the donor,
and in the event of her death the said <span class="SpellE">donee</span> shall be
under obligation to cause a mass to be held annually as a suffrage in behalf of
my soul, and also to defray the expenses of my burial and funerals.'</p>

<blockquote>It will be observed that the present case and
that of <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> above cited are similar in that in
both cases the donation was being made as a reward <span style="">for </span>services rendered and being rendered, and as a token of
affection for the <span class="SpellE">donee</span>; the phrase 'mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>' was used; the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> to
take possession of the property donated only after the death of the donor; the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> was under obligation to defray the expenses incident
to the celebration of the anniversary of the donor's death, including church
fees.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="GramE">donation in
both cases were</span> duly accepted.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In
said case of <span class="SpellE">Laureta</span> this Court held that the
donation was in <span class="SpellE">praesenti</span> and not a gift in <span class="SpellE">futuro</span>."</blockquote>

inter </span><span class="SpellE">vivos</span> and "mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>" in this wise:</p>

<blockquote>"Did the late Domingo <span class="SpellE">Bonsato</span> make
donations inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span> or dispositions post mortem in
favor of the petitioners herein? If the latter, then the documents should
reveal any or all of the following characteristics:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(1)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Convey no title or
ownership to the transferee before the death of the transferor; or, what
amounts to the same thing, that the transferor should retain the ownership
(full or naked) and control of the property while alive (Vidal v. <span class="SpellE">Posadas</span>, 58 Phil., 108; Guzman v. <span class="SpellE">Ibea</span>,
67 Phil., 633);</blockquote>

<blockquote>(2)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That before his death,
the transfer should be revocable by the transferor at will, ad <span class="SpellE">nutum</span>; but revocability may be provided for indirectly by
means of a reserved power in the donor to <span class="SpellE">dipose</span> of
the properties conveyed (Bautista v. <span class="SpellE">Sabiniano</span>, G.R.
No. L-4326, <st1:date year="1952" day="18" month="11">November 18, 1952</st1:date>);</blockquote>

<blockquote>(3)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That the transfer
should be void if the transferor should survive the transferee."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">These principles were
repeated in the case of <u>Ca</u></span><u>stro</u> <u><span style="">v.</span></u><span style=""> </span><u>Court</u>

<blockquote>"Whether a donation is inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>
or mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span> depends upon the nature of the
disposition made<span class="GramE">. '</span>Did the donor intend to transfer
the ownership of the property donated upon the execution of the donation?<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If this is so, as reflected from the
provisions contained in the donation, then it is inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>;
otherwise, it is merely mortis <span class="SpellE">causa</span>, or made to take
effect after death.' <span class="GramE">(Howard v. Padilla and Court of Appeals,
G.R. No.</span> L?7064 and L-7098, <st1:date year="1955" day="22" month="4">April 22, 1955</st1:date>."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Applying the above principles to the instant <span style="">petitions, there is no doubt that the
so-called DONATION MORTIS CAUSA is really a donation inter <span class="SpellE">vivos</span>.
The donation was executed by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> in favor of
his sister Ursula <span class="SpellE">Pascual</span> out of love and affection
as well as <span class="GramE">a recognition</span> of the personal services rendered
by the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> to the donor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The transfer of ownership over the properties
donated to the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> was immediate and independent of
the death of the donor.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The provision as
regards the reservation of properties for the donor's subsistence in relation
to the other provisions </span><span style="">of </span><span style="">the deed of donation confirms the intention
of the donor to </span>give <span style="">naked
ownership of the properties to the <span class="SpellE">donee</span> immediately
after the execution of the deed of donation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
