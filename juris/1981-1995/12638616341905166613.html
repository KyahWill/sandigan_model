				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On March 15, 1984 at about 5:30 o'clock in the morning Rafael <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> was walking by the Alpha Grocery store along San
Juan Street in <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>, Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>
when he overheard the loud voice of a woman within the store saying, "<span class="SpellE">Pag</span> <span class="SpellE">hindi</span> mo <span class="SpellE">ibinigay</span>
<span class="SpellE">ang</span> <span class="SpellE">hinihingi</span> <span class="SpellE">namin</span> <span class="SpellE">sa</span> <span class="SpellE">iyo</span>
ay <span class="SpellE">papatayin</span> ka <span class="SpellE">namin</span>."
<span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> stopped and peeped into the store through a
slit in the steel accordion door and saw two men holding the Chinese store
owner, Lim Wan, by the arms.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> stood in front
of Lim Wan pointing a finger at him while he was shaking his head.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thereafter, one of the two men released Lim <span class="SpellE">Wan's</span> arm and stabbed the Chinaman on the back.</p>

<p class="BODY">Alarmed by what he saw, <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> ran
across the street.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A few moments later,
he saw two men emerge from the store and run in the direction of the back of
the vice-governor's house.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> then came out
closing the door behind her and hurriedly proceeded in the direction of the
public market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In her haste, she slipped
and fell on the road.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>However, she
recovered and proceeded on her way towards the market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Because <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> had
to see his sister in <span class="SpellE">Calauang</span>, he boarded a passenger
jeep and did not stay to report what he saw.</p>

<p class="BODY">Lim <span class="SpellE">Wan's</span> body was found on that same
morning.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The drawer of his desk was
pulled out and some small change lay scattered about the floor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span> Pimentel,
the business partner of Lim Wan, found out later that some Five Hundred Pesos
left with Lim Wan the night before for settling <span class="GramE">an obligation
were</span> gone.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abarico</span>
later told the authorities what he saw.</p>

<p class="BODY">The municipal health officer of <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>
who conducted an autopsy of the victim's body found three penetrating stab
wounds on the victim's chest and one stab wound on the back that did not quite
penetrate the body because the weapon was blocked by a bone of the spinal
column.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Internal hemorrhage resulted in
the death of the victim.<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn1" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">In due course, the provincial fiscal of <st1:place><span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span></st1:place> filed an information charging <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> y Abu, John
Doe and Peter Doe of the crime of Robbery with Homicide allegedly committed as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about the 15th day of March, 1981, at around 5:30

Oriental <span class="SpellE">Mindoro</span>, Philippines and within the

the use of violence against or intimidation of person, that was, after having
ganged-up and stabbed one Lim Wan, a Chinese business man resulting in his
sudden and unexpected demise, did then and there <span class="SpellE">wilfully</span>,

the two other accused remained at large.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Upon arraignment, she entered a plea of not guilty and thereafter the
trial on the merits proceeded.</p>

<p class="BODY">On May 19, 1983, after the trial on the merits, the trial court
rendered a decision convicting the accused of the offense charged, imposing on
her the penalty of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">reclusion <span class="SpellE">perpetua</span></span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">,

(P51,920.00), as actual and compensatory damages and to pay the costs.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It was further directed in the same decision
that the law enforcing <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">agencies should
exert efforts to locate the two unidentified accused so that they may be held
accountable for their acts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that it is improbable for <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span>
to have been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">at or </span>near the Alpha
Grocery at the time of the commission of the crime since the holy mass began at
5:30 o'clock <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">in </span>the morning and
it <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">lasted </span>for about an hour and
that "it would be unchristian-like for catholic <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span>,
to short-change his obligation to God"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn6" href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup></span></span></a>
by leaving for <span class="SpellE">Calauang</span> before the mass is completed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> testified,
however, that he felt compelled to leave church <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">early </span>because his sister expected him at <span class="SpellE">Calauang</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant then suggests <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">that
</span>there is a possibility that the angry words that <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span>
heard may have been uttered by another woman, <u>i</u>.<u>e</u>. a certain
Anita <span class="SpellE">Abas</span> who, according to defense witness Morita
De la Cruz also resides in the Alpha Grocery.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, the records show that Morita De la <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
9.0pt">Cruz </span>resides in <span class="SpellE">Tondo</span>, <st1:city><st1:place>Manila</st1:place></st1:city>
and that she never stayed in <span class="SpellE">Calapan</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, the testimony of Morita cannot
prevail over that of <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Ubaldo</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>Pimentel, a co-owner of the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">Alpha </span>Grocery, who would have known if
there was indeed another occupant therein besides Lim Wan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, appellant herself asserted that she
did not see any other woman at the time she was in the store.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This fact was also confirmed by <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">during </span>the
<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">trial.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">To further discredit the
testimony of </span><span class="SpellE">Abarico</span>, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">appellant calls the attention of the court to
the fact that his testimony is full of coincidences such that he happened to
pass in front of the store when the slaying occurred and later on, he happened
to overhear two policemen discussing the results of the investigation when he
decided to report what he had witnessed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Appellant argues that it is hard to believe that a witness would just be
at the proper places at those times.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">This contention is bereft of merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The two events mentioned by the appellant
occurred a month apart and should not be taken together.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>What is clear is that <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span>
was an eyewitness to the commission of the crime and that when he <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">learned that the crime had not been solved
for some time, he volunteered the information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Appellant maintains that the shaking of the head of Lim Wan at
the time he was confronted by the three accused including appellant herein,
manifests a willingness on his part to give what his assailants were demanding
from him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, according to appellant,
the charge of robbery with homicide can not prosper since it is unlikely that
the victim would be stabbed after he agreed to yield to their demands.</p>

<p class="BODY">This argument is untenable.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Common experience shows that one nods his head in agreement and shakes
his head as a sign of refusal.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The
argument of the appellant runs counter <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">to
human experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Thus, the court finds no
reason to disregard the testimony of <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> as
proposed by appellant even if he is the sole eyewitness.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Well established is the rule that the
testimony of only one witness, if credible and positive, is sufficient to
convict.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn7" href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> The trial court characterized <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span> as a "fine young boy, intelligent and very
humble in person."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn8" href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> His testimony is positive as he affirmed
that the crime was indeed committed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Furthermore, there appears no underlying motive for <span class="SpellE">Abarico</span>
to concoct such a story.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It is a basic
principle in the law on evidence that in the absence of improper motive to
testify against the accused, the testimony of such a witness must be given full
faith and credence.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The delay in reporting
what he had seen to the police authorities is quite understandable for a young
boy of 16 years.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>He naturally feared for
his own life and did not want his name dragged into a criminal investigation
especially since he </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">is a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ware of what the malefactors are capable of
doing.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>This is consistent with the

witness in revealing to the authorities what he knows about a crime does not
render his testimony false, for the delay may be explained by the natural
reticence of most people and their abhorrence to get involved in a criminal
case.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But more than this, there is
always the inherent fear of reprisal, which is quite </span>understandable
especially if the accused is a man of power and influence in the
community"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn10" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;

<p class="BODY">In contrast, it is the testimony of the appellant which is not
credible.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She alleged that she did not
hear anything unusual while she was inside the toilet since the same is about
10 meters away from the place where Lim Wan was killed.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>An ocular inspection of the crime scene
showed that the distance between the toilet and the table of Lim Wan is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">4 </span>meters only.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>After the incident, appellant stated she lost
her nerve and ran hastily to the public market.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>And yet she first collected her things - a bag and thermos bottle.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>She even changed her clothing before informing
the shops next door about the slaying.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>This is unnatural of a woman in distress.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Her actions in fact betray her complicity in
the crime.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Court affirms the finding of the trial court that there was
indeed conspiracy between the accused <span class="SpellE">Felicisima</span> <span class="SpellE">Basilan</span> and the two other malefactors.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The fact that the appellant uttered the
treacherous remark that the victim would be killed if he did not comply with
their demands while her two unidentified companions held him on both sides;
that the threat she made was accomplished when her two companions stabbed the
victim; and thereafter, the three (3) fled from the scene of the crime; <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">all </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

charged.</p>

existence</span> of a conspiracy,<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> the</span>
trial court committed no error when it held the accused responsible for the
killing of the victim Lim Wan.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although
no person could positively say that he saw the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">With respect to the third assignment of error, this Court agrees
with the appellant that the information does not allege any qualifying
circumstance that would justify a conviction for murder.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The information describes the offense of
robbery with homicide.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Although there
was evidence of such aggravating circumstances that may qualify the crime of
homicide to murder, the appellant cannot accordingly be convicted for murder without
transgressing the constitutional injunction that an accused should be informed
of the nature and cause of the accusation against him.<a style="mso-footnote-id:

companions had the intention of robbing the victim and were bent on resorting
to violent means to attain their devious ends.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It could have been the P500.00 which <span class="SpellE">Ubaldo</span>
Pimentel left with the victim the previous night, or some other valuables, or
perhaps, even some merchandise.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Since
there is no proof or reasonable certainty that anything was successfully taken
from the deceased, the appellant should be convicted only of attempted robbery
with homicide penalized under Article 297 of the Revised Penal Code.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The threat she made is sufficient to
