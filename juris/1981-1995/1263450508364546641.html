<p class="BODY">Plaintiff claimed fulfillment of the conditions for the execution
of the Deed of Confirmation of Sale, namely: the release of the title of the
lot and the approval of the subdivision plan of said lot by the Land
Registration Commission.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>She even
enumerated the titles with their corresponding land areas derived by defendants
from the aforesaid lot, to wit:</p>

<blockquote>(a<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>)TCT 203580 - 30,205 sq. meters</blockquote>

<blockquote>(b)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TCT 203581 - 19,790 sq. meters</blockquote>

<blockquote>(c)<span style="">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>TCT 167568 - 40,775 sq. meters</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In a motion to dismiss, defendants pleaded, <u>inter</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>alia</u></span>, the defenses of lack of jurisdiction of the
court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> over the subject of the action and lack of cause of
action allegedly because there was no allegation as to the date of the approval
of the subdivision plan, no specific statement that the titles therein
mentioned were curved out of Lot I and no clear showing when the demands were
made on the defendants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They likewise
set up the defense of prescription allegedly because the deed of sale was dated
September 28, 1964 and supposedly ratified October 1, 1964 but the complaint
was filed only on January 14, 1974, a lapse of more than nine years when it
should have been filed within five years from 1964 in accordance with Article
1149, New Civil Code.</p>

<p class="BODY">Defendants also claimed that the demand set forth in the
complaint has been waived, abandoned or otherwise extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is alleged that the deed of sale was
"only an accommodation graciously extended, out of close friendship
between the defendants and the plaintiff and her casual business partner in the
buy and sell of real estate, one <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
Cortez;"<a style="" href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup></span></span></a>
that in order to allay the fears of plaintiff over the non-collection of the
debt of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez to plaintiff in various sums
exceeding P2,000.00, defendants, who were in turn indebted to <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez in the amount of P2,000.00, voluntarily
offered to transfer to plaintiff their inexistent but expectant right over the
lot in question, the same to be considered as part payment of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez' indebtedness; that as <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
Cortez later on paid her creditor what was then due, the deed of sale had in
effect been extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants
thereby characterized the said deed of sale as a mere tentative agreement which
was never intended nor meant to be ratified by and acknowledged before a notary
public.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In fact, they claimed that they
never appeared before Notary Public <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span> <span class="SpellE">Landrito</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, defendants alleged that the claim on which the action or
suit is founded is unenforceable under the statute of frauds and that the cause
or object of the contract did not exist at the time of the transaction.</p>

<p class="BODY">After an opposition and a reply were filed by the respective
parties, the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> resolved to deny the motion to dismiss
of defendants. Defendants filed their answer with counterclaim interposing more
or less the same defenses but expounding on them further.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addi­tion, they claimed that the titles
allegedly derived by them from Lot I of Annex A or I were cancelled and/or
different from said Lot I and that the deed of sale was simulated and
fictitious, plaintiff having paid no amount to defendants; and that the deed
was entrusted to plaintiff's care and custody on the condition that the
latter:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) would secure the written
consent of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez to Annex A or I as part
payment of what she owed to plaintiff; (b) would render to defendants true
accounting of collections made from <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> showing
in particular the consideration of P2,000.00 of Annex A or I duly cre­dited to <span class="SpellE">Erlinda's</span> account.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Plaintiff filed a reply and answer to counterclaim and thereafter
a motion for summary judgment and/or judgment on the pleadings on the ground
that the defenses of defendants "either fail to tender an issue or the
same do not present issues that are serious enough to deserve a trial on the
merits,"<a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a>
submitting on a later date the affidavit of merits.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Defendants filed their corresponding
opposition to the motion for summary judgment and/or judgment on the
pleadings.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Not content with the
pleadings already submitted to the Court, plaintiff filed a reply while
defendants filed a supplemental opposition.</p>

<p class="BODY">With all these pleadings filed by the parties in support of their
respective positions, the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> still held in abeyance
plaintiff's motion for summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings pending
the pre-trial of the case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>At the
pre-trial, defendants offered by way of compromise to pay plaintiff the sum of
P2,000.00, the consideration stated in the deed of sale.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the latter rejected the bid and insisted on
the delivery of the land to her.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
the pre-trial pro­ceeded with the presentation by plaintiff of Exhibits A to Q
which defendants practically admitted, adopted as their own and marked as
Exhibits 1 to 17.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In addition, the
latter offered Exhibit 18, which was their reply to plaintiff's letter of
demand dated <st1:date year="1973" day="21" month="12">December 21, 1973</st1:date>.</p>

<p class="BODY">From the various pleadings filed in this case by plaintiff,
together with the annexes and affidavits as well as the exhibits offered in
evidence at the pre-trial, the Court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> found the following
facts as having been duly established since defendant failed to meet them with
countervailing evidence:</p>

<blockquote>"In February, 1964, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>, owner of a parcel of unregistered land with an
area of approximately 220,000 square meters in Barrio <span class="SpellE">Sampaloc</span>,
<span class="SpellE">Tanay</span>, <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, hired
Attorney Andres F. Santos "to cause the survey of the above-mentioned

deducting all expenses from the total area of the property," <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> would assign and deliver to <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city>
"one-half (1/2) share of the whole property as appearing in the

last three assail the summary judgment itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Accordingly, the Court of Appeals, with whom the appeal was filed, certified
the records of the case to this Court for final determination.</p>

<p class="BODY">For appellants herein, the rendition of summary judgment has
deprived them of their right to procedural due process.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They claim that a trial on the merits is
indispensable in this case inasmuch as they have denied under oath all the
material allegations in <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> complaint which is
based on a written instrument entitled "Deed of Sale", thereby
putting in issue the due execution of said deed.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants in their opposition to the motion for summary judgment
and/or judgment on the pleadings, how­ever, do not deny the genuineness of
their signatures on the deed of sale.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>(Par. 3 of said Motion, p. 101, Record on Appeal).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They do not contest the words and figures in
said deed except in the acknowledgment portion thereof where certain words were
allegedly cancelled and changed without their knowledge and consent and where,
apparently, they appeared before Notary Public <span class="SpellE">Florencio</span>
<span class="SpellE">Landrito</span> when, in fact, they claimed that they did
not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In effect, there is an admission of
the due execution and genuineness of the document because by the admission of
the due execution of a document is meant that the party whose signature it
bears admits that voluntarily he signed it or that it was signed by another for
him and with his authority; and by the admission of the genuineness of the
document is meant that the party whose signature it bears admits that at the
time it was signed it was in the words and figures exactly as set out in the
pleading of the party relying upon it; and that any formal requisites required
by law, such as swearing and acknowledgment, or revenue stamps which it
requires, are waived by him.<a style="" href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">As correctly pointed out by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, the
alleged false notarization of the deed of sale is of no consequence.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For a sale of real property or of an interest
therein to be enforceable under the Statute of Frauds, it is enough that it be
in writing.<a style="" href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup></span></span></a>
It need not be notarized.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But the vendee
may avail of the right under Article 1357 of the New Civil Code to compel the
vendor to observe the form required by law in order that the instrument may be
registered in the Registry of Deeds.<a style="" href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup></span></span></a>
Hence, the due execution and genuineness of the deed of sale are not really in
issue in this case.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
assigned error I is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">What appellants really intended to prove through the alleged
false notarization of the deed of sale is the true import of the matter, which
according to them, is a mere tentative agreement with <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As such, it was not intended to be notarized
and was merely entrusted to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> care and
custody in order that:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>first</u>, the
latter may secure the approval of one <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez
to their (appellants') offer to pay a debt owing to her in the amount of
P2,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> instead of paying directly to
her as she was indebted to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in various
amounts exceeding P2,000.00; and <u>second</u>, once the approval is secured, <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> would render an accounting of collections made
from <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> showing in particular the consideration
of P2,000.00 of the deed of sale duly cre­dited to <span class="SpellE">Erlinda's</span>
account.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to appellants, they intended to prove at a full dress
trial the material facts:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(1) that the
aforesaid conditions were not fulfilled; (2) that <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
Cortez paid her total indebtedness to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> in the
amount of P14,160.00, the P2,000.00 intended to be paid by appellant included;
and (3) that said <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> decided to forego, renounce
and refrain from collecting the P2,000.00 the appellants owed her as a counter­vailing
reciprocity of the countless favors she also owes them.</p>

<p class="BODY">Being conditions which alter and vary the terms of the deed of
sale, such conditions cannot, however, be proved by <span class="SpellE">parol</span>
evidence in view of the provision of Section 7, Rule 130 of the Rules of Court,
which states as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Sec. 7.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Evidence of
written agreements. - When the terms of an agreement have been reduced to
writing, it is to be considered as containing all such terms, and, therefore,
there can be, between the parties and their successors in interest, no evidence
of the terms of the agreement other than the con­tents of the writing, except
in the following cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote>(a) Where a mistake or imperfection of the writing, or its failure
to express the true intent and agreement of the parties, or the validity of the
agreement is put in issue by the pleadings;<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>(b) When there is an intrinsic ambiguity in the writing.<o:p></o:p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The term "agreement" includes wills."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule forbids any
addition to or contradiction of the terms of a written instrument by testimony
purporting to show that, at or before the signing of the document, other or
different terms were orally agreed upon by the parties.<a style="" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">While it is true, as appellants argue, that Article 1306 of the
New Civil Code provides that "the contracting parties may establish such
stipulations, clauses, terms and conditions as they may deem convenient,
provided that they are not contrary to law, morals, good customs, pub­lic
order, or public policy" and that consequently, appel­lants and <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> could freely enter into an agreement imposing as
conditions thereof the following:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>that <span class="SpellE">appel­lee</span> secure the written conformity of <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez and that she render an accounting of all
collections from her, said conditions may not be proved as they are not
embodied in the deed of sale.</p>

<p class="BODY">The only conditions imposed for the execution of the Deed of
Confirmation of Sale by appellants in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
are the release of the title and the approval of the subdivision plan.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, appellants may not now introduce other
conditions allegedly agreed upon by them because when they reduced their
agreement to writing, it is presumed that "they have made the writing the
only repository and memorial of truth, and whatever is not found in the writing
must be understood to have been waived and abandoned."<a style="" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can appellants invoke any of the exceptions to the <span class="SpellE">parol</span> evidence rule, more particularly, the alleged failure
of the writing to express the true intent and agreement of the parties.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Such an exception obtains where the written
contract is so ambiguous or obscure in terms that the contractual intention of
the parties cannot be understood from a mere reading of the instrument.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In such a case, extrinsic evidence of the
subject matter of the contract, of the relations of the parties to each other,
and of the facts and circumstances surrounding them when they entered into the
contract may be received to enable the court to make a proper interpretation of
the instrument.<a style="" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a>
In the case at bar, the Deed of Sale (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. A or 1) is
clear, without any ambiguity, mistake or imperfection, much less obscurity or
doubt in the terms thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We,
therefore, hold and rule that assigned errors III and IV are untenable.</p>

<p class="BODY">According to the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>, "(s)<span class="SpellE">ince</span> Santos, in his Opposition to the Motion for Summary
Judgment failed to meet the plaintiff's evidence with counter-<span class="SpellE">vailing</span> evidence, a circumstance indicating that there are
no serious factual issues involved, the motion for summary judgment may
properly be granted." We affirm and sustain the action of the trial court.</p>

<p class="BODY">Indeed, where a motion for summary judgment and/or judgment on
the pleadings has been filed, as in this case, supporting and opposing
affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such facts as
may be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is
competent to testify as to the matters stated therein.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Sworn or certified copies of all papers or
parts thereof referred to in the affidavit shall be attached thereto or served
therewith.<a style="" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">Examining the pleadings, affidavits and exhibits in the records,
We find that appellants have not submit­ted any categorical proof that <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez had paid the P2,000.00 to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, hence, appellants failed to substantiate the
claim that the cause of action of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> has been
extinguished.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>And while it is true that
appellants submitted a receipt for P14,160.00 signed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
appellants, however, have stated in their answer with counterclaim that the
P2,000.00 value of the property covered by the Deed of Sale, instead of being
credited to <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez, was conspicuously
excluded from the accounting or receipt signed by <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
<span class="SpellE">totalling</span> P14,160.00.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The aforesaid receipt is no proof that <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span>
Cortez subsequently paid her P2,000.00 debt to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As correctly observed by the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
it is improbable that Cortez would still pay her debt to <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
since <st1:city><st1:place>Santos</st1:place></st1:city> had already paid it.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants' claim that their P2,000.00 debt to <span class="SpellE">Erlinda</span> Cortez had been waived or abandoned is not also
supported by any affidavit, document or writing sub­mitted to the court.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>As to their allegation that the <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim is barred by prescription, the ruling of
the trial court that only seven years and six months of the ten-year
prescription period provided under Arts. 1144 and 1155 in cases of actions for
specific perfor­mance of the written contract of sale had elapsed and that the
action had not yet prescribed, is in accordance with law and, therefore, We
affirm the same.</p>

<p class="BODY">The action of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> in rendering a summary
judgment has been taken in faithful compliance and conformity with Rule 34,
Section 3, Rules of Court, which provides that "the judgment sought shall
be rendered forth­with if the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file
together with the affidavits, show that, except as to the amount of damages,
there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is
entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."</p>

<p class="BODY">Resolving assignments of errors V, VI, and VII which directly
assail the summary judgment, not the pro­priety of the rendition thereof which
We have already resolved to be proper and correct, it is Our considered opinion
that the judgment of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u> is but a logical consequence
of the failure of appellants to present any <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> defense to <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Said judgment is simply the application of the law to the undisputed
facts of the case, one of which is the finding of the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
to which We agree, that appellants are owners of one-half (1/2) interest of Lot
1 and, therefore, the fifth assignment of error of appellants is without merit.</p>

<p class="BODY">By the terms of the Deed of Sale itself, which We find genuine
and not infirmed, appellants declared them­selves to be owners of one-half
(1/2) interest thereof.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>But in order to
avoid <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> claim, they now contend that Plan
Psu-206650 where said Lot I appears is in the exclusive name of <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> as the sole and
exclusive owner thereof and that the deed of assignment of one-half (1/2)
interest thereof executed by said Teof<span class="SpellE">ilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Cus­todio</span> in their favor is strictly personal between
them.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding the lack of any
title to the said lot by appellants at the time of the execution of the deed of
sale in favor of <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>, the said sale may be valid
as there can be a sale of an expected thing, in accordance with Art. 1461, New
Civil Code, which states:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1461.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Things
having a potential existence may be the object of the contract of sale.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The efficacy of the sale of a mere hope or expectancy is deemed
subject to the con­dition that the thing will come into existence.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The sale of a vain hope or expectancy is void."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the expectant right came into existence or
materialized for the appellants actually derived titles from <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
I.</p>

<p class="BODY">We further reject the contention of the appellants that the lower
court erred in ordering the appellants to execute and convey to the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> 20,000 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>. of land to
be taken from the southeastern portion of either their <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
4, Pcs-5273, which has an area of 40,775 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>.,
described in T.C.T. No. 167568 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>. 9 or I), or from
their <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> No. 5-A, with an area of 30,205 <span class="SpellE">sq.m</span>. described in T.C.T. No. 203580 (<span class="SpellE">Exh</span>.
11 or K), the expenses of segregation to be borne equally by the appellants and
the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> and the expenses of execution and registration
to be borne by the appellants.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Their
argument that the southeastern portion of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> 4 or <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
5-A is no longer the southeastern portion of the bigger <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
I, the latter portion belonging to the lone registered owner, <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span>, is not impressed
with merit.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The subdivision of <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
I between the appellants and <span class="SpellE">Teofilo</span> <span class="SpellE">Custodio</span> was made between themselves alone, without the
intervention, knowledge and consent of the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>,
and therefore, not binding upon the latter.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Appellants may not violate nor escape their obligation under the Deed of
Sale they have agreed and signed with the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> by
simply subdividing <st1:place>Lot</st1:place> I, bisecting the same and
segregating portions to change their sides in relation to the original <st1:place>Lot</st1:place>
I.</p>

<p class="BODY">Finally, considering the trial court's finding that the
appellants compelled the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span> to litigate and
they failed to heed <span class="SpellE">appellee's</span> just demand, the order
of the court awarding the sum of P2,000.00 as attorney's fees is just and
lawful, and We affirm the same.</p>

<p class="BODY"><b>WHEREFORE, </b>IN VIEW OF ALL THE FOREGOING, the judgment
appealed from is hereby AFFIRMED <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span>,
with costs against the appellants.</p>
