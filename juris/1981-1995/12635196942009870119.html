the crimes of murder and frustrated murder before the then Circuit Criminal
Court of <span class="SpellE">Rizal</span>, in CCC Case No. VII-973-Rizal, in <span class="GramE">an information</span> which reads:</p>

<blockquote>"That on or about October 22, 1970, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the said accused while
then confined at the said institution, conspiring, confederating and acting
together and each armed with improvised deadly weapons, did then and there
willfully, unlawfully and feloniously with intent to kill assault and wound

stab wound which could have also caused his death had it not been <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:17.0pt">for </span>the timely medical attention extended
the latter; the persons injured being then unarmed and unable to defend
themselves from the assault launched <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">by
the </span>accused, the said accused performing all the acts of execution which
produced the crime of murder and frustrated murder and in the latter did not
produce the offense by reason of the said timely medical attention extended by
the NBP Hospital." (p. 1, Record)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Upon being arraigned, both accused, duly assisted by counsel <u>de</u>
<span class="SpellE"><u>oficio</u></span>, <span class="GramE">pleaded</span>
guilty to the crimes charged. In view <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:16.0pt">at
the gravity </span>of the offense, the trial court ordered the prosecution to
present evidence to determine the guilt and degree of culpability of the
accused. Thereafter, the trial court <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">found
</span>both accused-appellants guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crimes of
murder and frustrated murder as charged, and imposed upon both the penalty of
death and both to pay jointly and severally the heirs of the deceased <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>, the following
amounts: P24<span class="GramE">,000.00</span> for indemnification, P20,000.00
for moral damages, P20,000.00 for exemplary damages; and, the costs of the
suit.</p>

<p class="BODY">Prosecution evidence <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">shows
that </span>on October 22, 1970, at about 8:50 in the morning, appellant <span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> Jose, then confined at Brigade "3D" of
the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prisons and serving sentence for
murder, and his co-appellant <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Bajao</span>, also confined at the same brigade and serving
sentence for murder and frustrated murder, together with several other
prisoners numbering more than 600, were at the waiting shed of the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prisons in <span class="SpellE">Muntinlupa</span> for
a final check-up preparatory to their departure for the <span class="SpellE">Davao</span>
Penal Colony where they were to be transferred. Upon arrival thereat, appellant
<span class="SpellE">Bajao</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">sat at
the center </span>of the waiting shed beside <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span>
<span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, while appellant Jose stood at the door and
waited for <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>,
also an inmate <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of </span>the same
institution. When <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> arrived, appellant Jose drew
a <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">bladed weapon </span>which was tucked
inside <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">a mat and, <span class="SpellE">therefrom</span>,
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> several </span>times at the right side
of his chest, following which he ran away, threw his weapon into a canal and
then laid flat on the ground.</p>

<p class="BODY">When appellant <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Bajao</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>saw
that appellant Jose had already stabbed <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>, he too
stabbed <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>
with an ice pick hitting the victim at the stomach. <span class="SpellE">Bajao</span>
then ran away until he was overtaken <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
</span>beaten by the prison guards.</p>

<p class="BODY">The victims, <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span> and <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, were rushed to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
6.0pt">the </span>New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> Prisons' Hospital for
emergency medical treatment. Notwithstanding, <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>
died at about <st1:time minute="45" hour="11">11:45</st1:time> that same
morning. <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span>, who suffered stab wounds and
lacerations in the abdomen as found by Dr. <span class="SpellE">Avelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Alcantara</span>, Supervising Physician of the New <span class="SpellE">Bilibid</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">Prisons, </span>was
confined at the NBP Hospital for eleven (11) days.</p>

<p class="BODY">Appellants Jose and <span class="SpellE"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">Bajao</span></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span>were
investigated and they executed sworn statements, admitting that he (Jose)
stabbed prisoner <span class="SpellE">Marciano</span> <span class="SpellE">Sulit</span>
and that he (<span class="SpellE">Bajao</span>) stabbed prisoner <span class="SpellE">Crisanto</span> <span class="SpellE">Fajardo</span> (Exhibits
"G" <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and "H", </span>respectively).</p>

<p class="BODY">As <span class="SpellE">aforestated</span>, appellants were both
sentenced to suffer the supreme penalty of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">death. </span>Thus, this case is now before <span class="GramE">Us</span>
on automatic review, pursuant to Section <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">9,
</span>Rule 122 of the Revised Rules of Court.</p>

<p class="BODY">In this appeal, appellants, assisted by counsel <u>de</u> <span class="SpellE"><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">oficio</span></u></span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:19.0pt">, </span>contend that the trial court erred
(1) in convicting appellants Jose and <span class="SpellE">Bajao</span> of murder
and frustrated murder on the basis of their extrajudicial confessions and their
pleas of guilty which suffer from constitutional and legal infirmity; (2) <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">in </span>finding that there was conspiracy
when in truth and in fact the prosecution failed to establish the existence of
conspiracy other than on the basis of appellants' involuntary extrajudicial
confessions and improvident pleas of guilty; and, (3) in convicting appellants
of murder and frustrated murder on the basis of evidence which is consistent
with their innocence.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Dioscoro</span> Jose died on <st1:date year="1975" day="6" month="4">April 6, 1975</st1:date> (p. 100, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), and, this Court, in its resolution of <st1:date year="1975" day="27" month="5">May 27, 1975</st1:date> (p. 103, <span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>), dismissed the case against him "but only
insofar as his criminal liability is concerned." Hence, this appeal refers
to <span class="SpellE">Dominador</span> <span class="SpellE">Bajao</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">only.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span class="SpellE">Bajao</span> assailed the extrajudicial
confession assert<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">ing </span>that he
executed the same in voluntarily as at the time he was questioned, he was <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">in </span>the hospital suffering from painful
multiple injuries, and overcome by fear, he has resigned to all the <span class="SpellE">proddings</span>, promptings and insinuations, if not directions,
either wittingly or unwittingly given by the prison guard investigator; that
there were no witnesses when he was being investigated by Prison Guard De la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>; and that the latter insisted on getting his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span>. (p. 24, Appellants' Brief)</p>

<p class="BODY">We cannot sustain appellant <span class="SpellE">Bajao's</span>
contention. He suffered only minor injuries and it was already on the fourth
day of his confinement when he was investigated by Prison Guard De la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span>. Neither are <span class="GramE">We</span> persuaded that
he did not sign the extrajudicial confession (Exhibit "H") because
his <span class="SpellE">thumbmark</span> appears thereon, together with the
signatures of the witnesses, Evelyn <span class="SpellE">Peneyra</span> and <span class="SpellE">Renato</span> <span class="SpellE">Banaag</span>. On the other hand,
there is the presumption that Prison Guard Buenaventura de la <span class="SpellE">Cuesta</span> and Supervising Prison Guard <span class="SpellE">Filomeno</span>
<span class="SpellE">Mencero</span> performed their official duties regularly. Nothing
in the record reveals any motive on the part of said prison officers to testify
falsely against appellant. Finally, <span class="GramE">We</span> cannot agree
with the contention of appellant that the questioned extrajudicial confession,
which was executed before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New
Constitution on <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>,
is inadmissible, pursuant to Section 20, Article IV thereof. In <span class="SpellE">Magtoto</span> vs. <span class="SpellE">Manguera</span>, 63 SCRA 4, the
Supreme Court made it clear that:</p>

<blockquote>“A confession obtained from a person under investigation for the
commission of an offense, who has not been informed of his right (to silence
and) to counsel, is inadmissible in evidence if the same had been obtained after
the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Constitution on January
17, 1973. Conversely, such confession is <u>admissible</u> in evidence against
the accused, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">if </span>the same had
been obtained <u>before</u> the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">the New Consti</span>tution, even if
presented after <st1:date year="1973" day="17" month="1">January 17, 1973</st1:date>,
and even <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">if </span>he had not been
informed of his right to counsel, since no <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
14.0pt">law </span>gave the accused the right to be so informed before that
date."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">In the case at bar, the c<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">onfession
of <span class="SpellE">Bajao</span> was given by </span>him before the <span class="SpellE">effectivity</span> of the New Constitution.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The claim of appellant <span class="SpellE">Bajao</span> that he was not assisted by counsel during the
arraignment and that his plea of </span>guilty was improvidently entered and
therefore suffered from constitutional and legal infirmity is untenable because
during the arraignment, the following transpired:</p>

<p class="BODY">While <span class="GramE">We</span> admit the admissibility of the
