the Government and wholly convinced that the imputations against him are bereft
of factual bases, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">private respondent
availed himself of a mode of discovery sanctioned by Rule 26 which he followed
with a motion for summary judgment when the answer to the request for admission
contained a major explicit admission.  The Second Division of the Sandiganbayan, through Justice Escareal with
whom Justices Balajadia and Grospe concurred, entertained the same perception
and granted private respondent's motion for summary judgment (pp. 82 and 100,
Rollo).  Hence, the petition at bar.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">The inculpatory allegations lifted from the amended complaint
pertinent to private respondent read:</p>

<blockquote>2. The wrongs
committed by Defendants, acting singly or collectively and in unlawful concert
with one another, include the misappropriation and theft of public funds,
plunder of the nation's wealth, extortion, blackmail, bribery, embezzlement and
other acts of corruption, betrayal of public trust and brazen abuse of power,
as more fully described below, all at the expense and to the grave and

<p class="BODY">On March 8, 1988, private respondent Moreno submitted his Answer,
traversing the expanded complaint by contending <u>inter</u> <u>alia</u> that
Section 4 of Presidential Decree No. 655 permits the importation of Virginia
Tobacco pursuant to the exigencies of the tobacco industry, and that there is
no law which curtails the purchase of local Virginia tobacco.  At any rate, private respondent continued,
his role as Chairman of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration was then
limited to submitting requests for importation to the President of the
Philippines for approval (p. 60, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">Of particular significance too, are documents which private
respondent wanted the Republic to admit <u>via</u> a request for

bear then President Marcos' written approval (Exhs. 2-A, 3-A, 4-A, and 5-A) are
reproduced hereunder.</p>

<p class="BODY">The Republic reacted by admitting the genuineness of Exhibits 5-A
and 5-B although it offered the <u>caveat</u> that it was not in a position to
deny or admit the varacity of the tenor thereof inasmuch as it has no access to
files of the National Tobacco Administration and the Philippine Virginia
Tobacco Administration (p. 64, Rollo).  This development triggered the submission by private respondent of a
motion for summary judgment which posited the thesis that there is no factual
issue against him <u>vis</u>-a-<u>vis</u> the sole query of whether he had
supervised, approved, or permitted importations of tobacco in favor of Northern
Tobacco Redrying, Co., Inc., considering the general and broad averments in the
expanded complaint (p. 68, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">In the course of the hearing on the motion for summary judgment
on August 6, 1991, private respondent's counsel initially manifested that he
was withdrawing said motion but changed his mind when Commissioner Mario C.
Jalandoni of the Presidential Commission on Good Government declared that the
Republic is <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">admitting </span>the
genuineness and due execution of the documents containing President Marcos'
handwritten approval <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">(p. </span>1, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Resolution; p. </span>82, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">An exchange of pleadings ensued and on October 21, 1991, the
impugned Resolution was promulgated which decreed the dismissal of the
complaint against private respondent, but without prejudice to the continuation
of the case against the other defendants, thus:</p>

<blockquote>Plaintiff's admission, through counsel (Com. Jalandoni) as to the
genuineness and due authenticity of then President Marcos' handwritten
notations approving the questioned transactions on Exhibits 3-a, 4­-a and 5-a
of defendant Moreno's Pre-Trial Brief practically removed or destroyed any
factual or legal bases to implicate defendant Moreno therein.  From the time plaintiff started compiling
its evidence, testimonial as well as documentary, to support the filing of its
original Complaint, up to the amendment thereof by an expanded Complaint on
January 25, 1988, no amplification or further specification of defendant
Moreno's alleged participation or involvement in the questioned transactions
had been made.  Even after defendant
Moreno had filed his Pre-Trial Brief and, later, his "Request For
Admission", plaintiff could not admit or deny the truthfulness of relevant
matters of fact, or genuineness of documents marked as Exhibits 1, 2, 3, 4 and
5, inclusive, together with their sub-markings, alleging the following reasons,
to wit:  (1) it has no access to the
files and records of the National Tobacco Administration (NTA) and the
Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration (PVTA); (2) it has not completely
and thoroughly examined all other possible sources of information especially
defendant Moreno's involvement; (3) it cannot determine with certainty the
genuineness and due execution of defendant Moreno's marked exhibits and the
truth of relevant allegations therein since these pertain to matters which may
have extrinsic circumstances involving private and/or undocumented transaction
between and among the defendants in this case; and (4) it needs more time to
make a complete and thorough verification through other possible documentary
and testimonial evidence it may present during the trial.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Thus, defendant Moreno's motion for summary judgment, viewed from
the context by which plaintiff made its answers to the request for admissions,
present a classic case for the affirmative application of Section 1, Rule 34 of
the Rules of Court.  Even if We are to
take a view of the evidence most favorable to the plaintiff, giving it the
benefit of all favorable inferences, the fact still remains that plaintiff had
not successfully made out any <u>bona</u> <u>fide</u> issue or a genuine
triable issue of fact which would warrant the denial of the instant motion and
necessitate trial thereof.  The test is
whether the plaintiff had, in its original and Expanded Complaints, as well as
in its Answer to the Request for Admission, set out, and maintained the
existence of, any genuine issue of fact.</blockquote>

<blockquote>As above-stated, plaintiff had admitted a vital fact which
defendant Moreno had offered for admission - that then President Marcos had
approved the implementation of the transactions in question.  Coupled with defendant Moreno's averment in
his Answer that no specific act of illegality had been committed by him, more
particularly when he denied that he had any dealing with Northern Tobacco
Redrying Co, Inc.; that the latter was ever authorized to import Virginia
Tobacco; and that he had any acquaintance with his co­-defendants Celso C.
Ranola, William T. Wong, Ernesto B. Lim and Benjamin T. Albacita, which
plaintiff has not, REPEAT, has not directly or indirectly controverted or
overthrown, either in its Expanded Complaint or in its Answer To The Request
For Admission, then defendant Moreno's claim that no genuine triable issue of
fact exists must be upheld.  Furthermore, plaintiff has admitted that it has not dug up or found any
document or record to blunt or destroy the allegations of Minda C. Gapuz, PVTA
Market Development and Regulations Department Manager, that defendant Moreno
had ever supervised, approved and/or permitted any tobacco importation or
purchase of imported blending tobacco and that PTA and PVTA records do not show
any authority granted to Northern Tobacco Redrying Co., Inc. to import foreign
blending tobacco during defendant Moreno's incumbency as General Manager of
PVTA.  If at all, his admitted referral
of applications for such importations to the Office of the President, which
acts and approves such application through Pres. Marcos' handwritten notations
on the referral letters themselves, and confirmed by memoranda of Pres. Exec.
Assts. Tuvera and Venus, only shows that the specific averments of supposed
irregularities on the part of defendant Moreno do not support plaintiff's cause
of action based on alleged breach of public trust.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Again, even if we accept plaintiff's contention that the
"Answer To The Request For Admission" was filed on the last day of
the extension period granted by the Court, as shown by the Registry Notice
dated July 8, 1991 evidencing the mailing of a copy thereof to counsel for
defendant Moreno, and overlook the actual filing of said Answer with the Court
on July 17, 1991, still we do not consider such facts decisive anymore for the
purpose of sustaining the instant motion for summary judgment, inasmuch as our
justifications therefor are based on the admissions and denials reflected in
all of plaintiff's pleadings which are material, pertinent and relevant to the
issue involved.</blockquote>

<blockquote>The query is posed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">- </span>should
the forms of law be gone through, and the time of the court, the parties and
counsel be wasted on the facts and circumstances standing incontrovertible on
the record?  Our answer is in the
negative.  The summary judgment
procedure is intended to "defeat the laws' delays" by giving prompt
relief to those having a clear-cut claim or defense, to provide a more adequate
and elastic procedure for the protection of the rights of the parties and the
prompt dispatch of litigation, and does not contemplate that a party must
follow his case through the lights and shadows of the evidence in it.  All that the rules require, or is meant to
require, is that the party must furnish the court with proof of the highest
testimony or verification within his power, and thus eliminate any and all
issues which have no basis in fact, no matter how well pleaded in form, by
allowing the moving party to pierce the allegation of fact in the
pleadings.  In the case at bar, the
incident involved in the motion for summary judgment brings to the fore and
positively accentuates the blatant lack, or bankruptcy, in the Expanded
Complaint as to any cause of action against defendant Moreno.  The facts or combination of facts which
would afford plaintiff a right to judicial interference for the purpose of
holding defendant Moreno <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">liable in this
case is totally wanting.  There being no
genuine fact in issue, much less any cause of action against defendant Moreno,
further proceedings against him would be sheer waste of time and effort.  (pp. 12-17, Resolution; pp. 93-98, Rollo)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">Following the denial of the motion for reconsideration (p. 100,
Rollo), petitioner ascended the judicial ladder through the present petition
for <i>certiorari</i> ascribing wanton exercise of discretion on the part of
public respondent in declaring extinct the cause of action against Moreno.  The Republic argues that instead of
disapproving Fortune Tobacco Corporation's application geared towards
importation of tobacco, private respondent recommended approval thereof to
President Marcos thereby suggesting that private respondent acted in concert
with President Marcos and Lucio Tan albeit private respondent knew that the
importations had already surpassed the ceiling fixed by Section 4 of
Presidential Decree No. 655.  Even then,
the Republic was frank in representing that no triable issue of fact exists as
regards the importations by Northern Redrying Co., Inc. (p. 9, Petition for
Review; p. 13, Rollo), which admission <u>in</u> <u>judicio</u> was amplified
in the Republic's Reply to private respondent's Comment (p. 170, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">For his part, private respondent persists in advancing the idea
that there is no intrinsic worth which can be gathered from the bare and
general statements of petitioner's amended complaint (p. 106, Rollo).</p>

<p class="BODY">At this juncture, one cannot gainsay the efforts exerted by the
Republic, through the collective action of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government and the Office of the Solicitor General, in the quest for recovery
of alleged ill-gotten wealth accumulated by certain individuals identified with
the past regime.  We must hasten to add,
however, that insofar as the instant petition is concerned, we are of the opinion
that the premises set forth in the principal pleading in the court <u>a</u> <u>quo</u>,
only with respect to private respondent's participation, suffer a congenital
deficiency considering that the allegations there­of fail to spell out the <u>ultimate</u>
<u>facts</u> constitutive of the Republic's cause of action (<u>Section</u> <u>3,</u>
<u>Rule</u> <u>6,</u> Revised Rules of Court).</p>

<p class="BODY">Paragraphs 2 and 15 of the Amended Complaint, earlier quoted, it
cannot be overstressed, are mere conclusions of law unaccompanied by factual
and categorical propositions.  Verily,
the allegations herein involved bear a striking <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">resemblance to the </span>assertions treated in <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Tantuico,</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

which prompted Justice Padilla to require the PCGG to file a bill of
particulars, in the process elucidating:</p>

<blockquote>As quoted above, paragraph 9(a) of the complaint alleges that
"Defendant Ferdinand E. Marcos, together with other Defendants, acting
singly or collectively, and/or in unlawful concert with one another, in
flagrant breach of public trust and of their fiduciary obligations as public
officers, with gross and scandalous abuse of right and power and in brazen
violation of the Constitution and laws of the Philippines, embarked upon a
systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth." In the light of the rules
on pleading and case law cited above, the allegations that defendant Ferdinand
E. Marcos, together with the other defendants "embarked upon a systematic
plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth" and that said defendants acted
"in flagrant breach <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">of public
trust and of their fiduciary obligations as public officers, with gross </span>and
scandalous abuse of right and in brazen violation of the Constitution and laws
of the Philippines", <u>are</u> <u>conclusions</u> <u>of</u> <u>law</u> <u>unsupported</u>
<u>by</u> <u>factual</u> <u>premises.<o:p></o:p></u></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Nothing is said in the
complaint about the petitioner's acts in execution of the alleged
"systematic plan to accumulate ill-gotten wealth", or which are
supposed to </span>constitute "flagrant breach of public trust",
"gross and scandalous abuse of right and power", and "violations
of the Constitution and laws of the Philippines".  The complaint does not even allege what
duties the petitioner failed to perform, or the particular rights he abused.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Likewise, paragraph 15
avers that "defendant Francisco Tantuico, taking undue advantage of his
position as Chairman of the Commission on Audit and with grave </span>failure
to perform his constitutional duties as such Chairman, acting in concert with
Defendants Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos facilitated and made
possible the withdrawals, disbursements and questionable use of government
funds as stated in the foregoing paragraphs to the grave and irreparable damage
and injury of Plaintiff and the entire Filipino people." In like manner,
the allegation that petitioner "took undue advantage of his position as
Chairman of the Commission on Audit," that he "failed to perform his
constitutional duties as such Chairman," and acting in concert with
Ferdinand E. Marcos and Imelda R. Marcos, "facilitated and made possible
the withdrawals, disbursements, and questionable use of government funds as
stated in the foregoing paragraphs, to the grave and irreparable damage and
injury of plaintiff and the entire Filipino people", <u>are</u> <u>mere</u>
<u>conclusions</u> <u>of</u> <u>law.</u>  Nowhere in the complaint is there any allegation as to how such duty
came about, or what petitioner’s duties were, with respect to the alleged
withdrawals and disbursements or how petitioner facilitated the alleged
withdrawals, disbursements, or conversion of public funds and properties, nor
an allegation from where the withdrawals and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">disbursements came from, except for a general allegation that they came
from the national treasury.  On top of
that, the complaint does not even contain any factual </span>allegation which
would show that whatever withdrawals, disbursements, or conversions were made,
were indeed subject to audit by the COA.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In this connection, it may
well be stated that the Commission on Audit (COA) is an independent,
constitutional commission, which has no power or authority to </span>withdraw,
disburse, or use funds and property pertaining to other government offices or
agencies.  This is done by the agency or
office itself, the chief or head of which is primarily and directly responsible
for the funds and property pertaining to such office or agency.  The COA is merely authorized to audit,
examine and settle accounts of the various government offices or agencies, and
this task is performed not by the Chairman of the COA but by the COA auditors
assigned to the government office or agency subject to COA audit.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Thus, in each agency of the
government, there is an auditing unit headed by an auditor, whose duty is to
audit and settle the accounts, funds, financial transactions, and resources of
the agency under his audit jurisdiction.  The decision of the auditor is appealable to the Regional Director,
whose decision, is in turn, </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">appealable
to </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">the COA Manager.  Any party dissatisfied with the decision of
the COA Manager may bring the matter on appeal to the Commission proper, a
collegiate body exercising quasi-judicial functions, composed of three (3) COA
Commissioners, with the COA Chairman as presiding officer.  It is only at this stage that the COA
Chairman would come to know of </span>the matter and be called upon to act on
the same, and only if an aggrieved party brings the matter on appeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">In other words, the
Chairman of the COA </span>does not participate in or personally audit all
disbursements and withdrawals of government funds, as well as transactions
involving government property.  The
averments in the particular paragraph of the complaint merely assume that
petitioner participated in or personally audited <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
5.0pt">all</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span>disbursements
and withdrawals of government funds, and all transactions involving government
property.  Hence, the alleged
withdrawals, disbursements and questionable use of government funds could not
have been, as held by respondent Sandiganbayan, "within the peculiar and
intimate knowledge of petitioner as Chairman of the COA."</blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The complaint further avers
in para­graph 17 that "(t)he following Defendants acted as dummies,
nominees and/or agents by allowing themselves (i) to be instruments in
accumulating ill-gotten wealth through government concessions, orders and/or
poli­cies prejudicial to Plaintiff, or (ii) to be </span>incorporators,
directors, or members of corporations beneficially held and/or controlled by
Defendants Ferdinand E. Mar­cos, Imelda R. Marcos, Benjamin (Kokoy) T.
Romualdez and Juliette Gomez Romualdez in order to conceal and prevent recovery
of assets illegally obtained:  <u>Francisco</u>
<u>Tantuico</u> xxx." Again, the allegation that petitioner acted as
dummy, nominee, or agent by allowing himself "to be used as instrument in
accumulating ill-gotten wealth through government concessions, orders and/or
policies prejudicial to Plaintiff" or "to be (an) incorporator,
director, or member of corporations beneficially held and/or controlled"
by the Marcoses and Romualdezes, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">is <u>a</u>
<u>con</u></span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt">clusion</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:5.0pt"> </span><u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
12.0pt">of</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"> <u>law</u> <u>without</u>
</span><u>factual</u> <u>basis.</u></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The complaint does not
contain any allegation as to how petitioner became, or why he is perceived to
be, a dummy, nominee or agent.  Besides,
there is no averment in the complaint how petitioner allowed himself to be used
as instrument in the accumulation of ill-gotten wealth, what the </span>concessions,
orders and/or policies <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">prejudicial to
plaintiff are, why they are prejudicial, and what petitioner had to do with the
granting, issuance, and or formulation of such concessions, orders, and/or
policies.  Moreover, Annex "A"
of the complaint lists down sixty-one (61 corpora­tions which are supposed to
be beneficially owned or controlled by the Marcoses and Romualdezes.  However, the complaint does not state which
corporations petitioner is supposed to be a stockholder, director, member,
dummy, nominee and/or agent.  More
significantly, the petitioner's name does not even appear in Annex
"B" of the com­plaint, which is a listing of the alleged
"Positions and Participations of Some De­fendants".<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">The allegations in the
complaint, above-referred to, pertaining to petitioner are, therefore,
deficient in that they merely articulate conclusions of law and presumptions
unsupported by factual prem­ises.  (at
pp. 444-447)<o:p></o:p></span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">What about Paragraph 14(h) which inculpates private respondent
when he supposedly "supervised, approved and/or permitted such
importations and purchases"?  It
may be recalled that it was this portion of the Amended Complaint which was the
thrust of private respondent's defense that elicited the corresponding
admission from the Republic on the genuineness and due execution of Exhibits
5-A and 5-B.  In so responding, the Republic
failed to realize that it practically pursued a diametrically opposed and fatal
posture because the candid statement carried with it the express acknowledgment
that it was President Marcos, not private respondent, who approved the assailed
importations.  Withal, the language of
Exhibits 2-A, 2-B, 3-A, and 3-B show that private respondent, as the Chairman
of the Philippine Virginia Tobacco Administration, had no authority or
discretion to deny, much less to approve, the <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">corresponding license to import tobacco without referring the matter to
the President.  Indeed, there would have
been no need to submit every application for the President's action if private
respondent were clothed with the appropriate faculty to decide on the </span>propriety
of importation.  Consequently, Paragraph
14(h) of the expanded complaint can hardly serve as legal basis to inculpate
private respondent.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">At any rate, the
Republic's propensity to admit statements from the opposing party with
prejudicial repercussions is easily discernible and can be con­firmed from the
pleadings submitted to us which contain the candid acknowledgment that there is
no genuine triable issue of fact insofar as Northern Redrying Co., Inc. is
concerned (p. 9, Petition for Review, p. 13, </span>Rollo; pp. 5-7, Reply to
Private Respondent's Comments, pp. 170-172, Rollo).  Notwithstanding said categorical admission <u>in</u> <u>judicio</u>,
petitioner offers the excuse that the scenario is different as to Fortune
Tobacco Corporation.  Yet, we have
already said with sufficient emphasis that in view of the admission in the
Answer to the request for admission (p. 64, Rollo) as to the genuineness and
due execution of the handwritten approval of President Marcos on private
respondent's letter <u>vis</u>-a-<u>vis</u> Fortune Tobacco's request for
importation (Exhibit 5-A; p. 126, Rollo), petitioner's efforts to press an
imaginary issue on this point must be brushed aside on account of the legal
axiom against vacillating postures (<u>Article</u> <u>1431</u>, New Civil Code;
<u>Section</u> <u>4,</u> <u>Rule</u> <u>129</u>; <u>Section</u> <u>2(a),</u>
Rule 131, Revised Rules on Evidence; <u>Caltex</u> (<u>Philippines),</u> <u>Inc.</u>

<u>Co.,</u> <u>Inc.</u> <u>vs.</u> <u>Mangaliman</u>, 72 Phil. 524 [1941]).</p>

<p class="BODY">The Sandiganbayan, therefore, correctly rendered the summary judgment
in view of the self-defeating representations of petitioner, for such recourse
is well within the purview of Section 3, Rule 34 of the Revised Rules of Court
that:</p>

<blockquote><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt">" . . . </span>After the
hearing, the judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings,
depositions, and <u>admissions</u> on file together with the affidavits, show
that, except as to the amount of damages, there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter
of law."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent:0in">apart from the fact that the expanded
complaint was not crafted with enough significant and substantial allegations
of ultimate facts to warrant continuation of the trial against private
respondent (1 <u>Martin</u>, Rules of Court in the Philippines, Revised ed.,
1989, p. 329).</p>
