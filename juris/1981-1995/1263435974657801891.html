immediate injury resulting from the acts or measures complained of.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn12" href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> Petitioners PASEI and PEEPA allege that
their member agencies, which enjoy </span>protection against competition by new
licensees pursuant to LOI 1190, will suffer irreparable injury with the repeal
of LOI 1190 by EO 450, considering further that there is no additional demand
for Filipino workers abroad.  Hence, any
gain made by the new agencies on the supposed exclusive preserve of existing
agencies necessarily results in the latter's loss.</p>

<p class="BODY">But, as regards petitioner Association of Filipino Overseas
Workers, Inc. (AFOWI), we are not persuaded that the proliferation of recruitment
agencies will necessarily result in exposure of workers to exploitation by
unscrupulous recruiters, for the stiffer competition may even compel these
agencies to seek better terms and <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">conditions
</span>for overseas workers.  Hence, the
petition being founded on mere speculation insofar as it affects AFOWI, the
same should be dismissed for want of a valid cause of action.</p>

<p class="BODY">On the issue raised by intervenors that the petition can be
decided without touching on the validity of EO 450, we cannot find any other
way but to meet the question squarely since petitioners<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
13.0pt">'</span> relief depends on its validity.</p>

<p class="BODY">The central thesis of the petition is that LOI 1190 was issued
pursuant to the law-making power of the President under Sec. 6 of the 1976
Amendments to the 1973 Constitution in response to <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">"a grave emergency </span>which cried for immediate and decisive
action," hence, should be considered part of the law of the land.  Petitioners argue that because of its
repealing or modifying effect on Art. 25 of the Labor Code, LOI 1190 could be
valid only if treated <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as a law, </span>and
that a contrary interpretation that would render LOI 1190 invalid could not
have been intended by the then incumbent President.</p>

<p class="BODY">As we view it, LOI 1190<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn13" href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup></span></span></a>
simply imposes a presidential review of the authority of the Minister of Labor
and Employment to grant licenses, hence, directed to him alone.  Since this is undoubtedly an administrative
action, LOI 1190 should properly be treated as an administrative issuance.  Unlike Presidential Decrees which by usage
have gained acceptance as laws promulgated by the President, Letters of
Instruction are presumed to be mere administrative issuances except when the
conditions set out in <i>Garcia-Padilla v. Enrile</i> exist.  Consequently, to be considered part of the
law of the land, petitioners must establish that LOI 1190 was issued in
response to "a grave emergency or a threat or imminence thereof, or
whenever the interim Batasan Pambansa or the regular National Assembly fails or
is unable to act adequately on any matter." The conspicuous absence of any
of these conditions fortifies the opinion that LOI 1190 cannot be any more than
a mere administrative issuance.</p>

<p class="BODY">In arguing that LOI 1190 was issued to cope with "a grave
emergency," petitioners point to the 3rd "Whereas" clause which
speaks of the concern of the state against cut­-throat competition seriously
affecting the integrity and viability of the overseas recruitment industry, and
the difficulty in the regulation and supervision of agencies and the protection
of the welfare of the workers.  The
petitioners' appraisal that the 3rd "Whereas" clause manifests a
grave emergency situation is as good as anybody else's contrary view.  Moreover, even if we treat <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">as </span>emergency the "situation which
has seriously affected the integrity and viability of the overseas employment
industry," there is no indication that in the judgment of the President it
is grave.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners argue that since the repeal of Art. 25 of the Labor
Code could not be done through an administrative issuance, LOI 1190 must of necessity
be a law.  This reasoning is flawed.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is nothing in the LOI which repeals or runs counter to Art.
25 of the Labor Code, as amended.  Instead, contrary to the perception of petitioners, LOI 1190 does not
actually ban the grant of licenses nor bar the entry of new licensees since
anybody could still apply for license with the Minister of Labor and
Employment, although the grant thereof is subject to the prior authority of the
President.  In fact, the LOI did not
modify the rule-making power of the Minister of Labor and Employment under the
Labor Code; it only added another tier of review.</p>

<p class="BODY">Neither can petitioners consider this additional review by the
President as an amendment of Art. 25, for this is within the scope of the
exercise of his constitutionally sanctioned control over the executive
departments of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">government.</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn14" href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Implicit in that power of control is the
President's "authority to go over, confirm, modify or reverse the action
taken by his department secretaries."</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:
ftn15" href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> Moreover, if we discern the intent of LOI
1190 from the manner it was enforced, the unrebutted allegation of respondent -
that 319 private employment agencies secured administrative presidential
approval from 1982 to 1989</span><a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn16" href="#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup></span></span></a><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> - shows that then President Marcos merely
intended to regulate, and not ban altogether, new applications for
licenses.  For this reason, Marcos could
not have contemplated repealing Art. 25 of the Labor Code.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY" style="tab-stops:130.5pt"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Petitioners
advance a rather outrageous interpretation of LOI 1190 when they claim that
"[t]he then President was in effect saying that </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">'</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Art.

maintain stability in the polity, laws have a certain degree of permanence such
that they are not intended to be repealed one hour after their enactment, then
re-enacted the following hour, and so on.  If the law has to be applied on a case to case basis, as in the case of
Art. 25 of the Labor Code, it does not have to undergo the tedious process of
repeal and re-enactment every time its application is warranted.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioners would impress upon us the interpretation that LOI
1190 suspended the effectivity of Art. 25, which could not be done because the
chief executive is constitutionally bound to "ensure that the laws be <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">faithfully executed.</span>"<a style="mso-footnote-id:ftn18" href="#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size:8.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:

suspend the enforcement of Art. 25 of the Labor Code; it merely added another

<p class="BODY">The discussion on whether the word "I" in the phrase
"except <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:7.0pt">as </span>I may otherwise

meaningless, for the correct interpretation would ultimately depend on whether
the LOI is a law or an administrative issuance.</p>

under Section 1 of the Presidential Decree No. 1412 promulgated June 9, 1978,
Article 25 of the Labor Code which among other things provided for the phaseout
of all private fee charging recruitment agencies by October 31, 1978, was
amended so as to allow the continued participation of the private employment

<p class="FOOTNOTES" style="margin-left:12.15pt;text-indent:23.85pt">"WHEREAS,
the proliferation of recruitment agencies has resulted in cut-throat

seriously affected the integrity and viability of the overseas employment
industry and has rendered more difficult the regulation and supervision of
private <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:6.0pt">sector </span>participation,
