				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">Petitioner Development Bank of the Philippines seeks the
nullification of an order dated July 29, 1987 and issued by the Undersecretary
of Labor and Employment, affirming that of National Capital Region
Officer-in-Charge Romeo A. Young, directing the petitioner to deliver the
properties of Riverside Mills Corporation (RMC) which it had in its possession
to the Ministry (now Department) of Labor and Employment (MOLE) for proper
disposition in Case No. <span class="GramE">NCR-LSED-7-334-84 pursuant to Article
110 of the Labor Code.</span></p>

<p class="BODY">Labor Case No. NCR-LSED-7-334-84 involves a complaint for illegal
dismissal, unfair labor practice, illegal deductions from salaries and
violation of the minimum wage law filed by private respondents herein against
RMC.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>On <st1:date year="1985" day="3" month="7">July 3, 1985</st1:date>, a decision was rendered by Director <span class="SpellE">Severo</span> M. <span class="SpellE">Pucaan</span> of the National
Capital Region, MOLE, ordering RMC to pay private respondents <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and separation benefits.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A corresponding writ of execution was issued
on October 22, 1985 directing the sheriff to collect the amount of ONE MILLION
TWO HUNDRED FIFTY-SIX THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY-EIGHT PESOS AND SEVENTY SIX
CENTAVOS (P1<span class="GramE">,256,678.76</span>) from RMC and, in case of
failure to collect, to execute the writ by selling the goods and chattel of RMC
not exempt from execution or, in case of insufficiency thereof, the real or
immovable properties of RMC.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, on <st1:date year="1986" day="23" month="5">May 23, 1986</st1:date>,
the writ of execution was returned <span class="SpellE">unserved</span> and
unsatisfied, with the information that the company premises of RMC had been
padlocked and foreclosed by petitioner.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>It appears that petitioner had instituted extra-judicial foreclosure
proceedings <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">as </span>early as 1983 on
the properties and other assets of RMC as a result of the latter's failure to
meet its obligations on the loans it secured from petitioner.</p>

<p class="BODY">Consequently, private respondents filed with the MOLE a
"Motion for Delivery of Properties of the [RMC] in the Possession of the
[DBP] to the [MOLE] for Proper Disposition," stating that pursuant to
Article 110 of the Labor Code, they enjoy first preference over the mortgaged
properties of RMC for the satisfaction of the judgment rendered in their favor
notwithstanding the foreclosure of the same by petitioner as mortgage creditor
[<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">pp.16-17.]
Petitioner filed its opposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

private respondents still enjoyed a preferential lien for the payment of their <span class="SpellE">backwages</span> and separation benefits over the properties of
RMC which were foreclosed by petitioner [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp.
21-22.]</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Petitioner then filed its
motion for reconsideration on December 24, 1986 contending that Article 110 of
the Labor Code finds no application in the case at bar for the following
reasons:<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>(1) The properties sought to be
delivered have ceased to belong to RMC in view of the fact that petitioner had
foreclosed on the mortgage, and the properties have been sold and delivered to
third parties; (2) The requisite condition for the application of </span>Article
110 of the Labor Code is not present since no bankruptcy or insolvency
proceedings over RMC properties <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">and
assets have been undertaken [<span class="SpellE">Rollo</span>, pp. 24-28.] In an

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Hence, petitioner filed

</span>After considering the allegations made and issues raised in the
petition, comments thereto and reply, the Court, on March 14, 1988, resolved to
give due course to the petition and to require the parties to submit their
respective memoranda.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Petitioner and
private respondent submitted their memoranda, while public respondent adopted
as its memorandum the comment it had previously submitted.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:4.0pt"><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">After a careful study of
the various arguments adduced, as well as the legal provisions and
jurisprudence on the matter, the Court finds the petition impressed with
merit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed, the assailed Order
suffers from infirmities which must be rectified by the grant of a writ of <i>certiorari</i>
in favor of petitioner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Firstly, public
respondent acted with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of
jurisdiction in enforcing private respondents' right of first preference under
Article 110 of the Labor Code notwithstanding the absence of bankruptcy,
liquidation or insolvency proceedings against RMC.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY">Article 110 of the Labor Code and Section 10, Rule VIII, Book III
of the Omnibus Rules Implementing the Labor Code provide the following:</p>

<blockquote><span class="GramE">Section 10.</span><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="GramE">PAYMENT OF WAGES IN CASE OF

declaration of bankruptcy or judicial liquidation of the employer's business
shall be given first preference and shall be paid in full before other
creditors may establish any claim to a share in the assets of the employer.</blockquote>

<p class="BODY">It is clear from the wording of the law that the preferential
right accorded to employees and workers under Article 110 may be invoked only
during bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings against the
employer.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The law is unequivocal and
admits of no other construction.</p>

<p class="BODY">Respondents contend that the terms "bankruptcy" or
"liquidation" are broad enough to cover <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>situation where there is a cessation of the operation of the
employer's business as in the case at bar.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>However, this very same contention was struck down as unmeritorious in
the case of <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Development</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt"> </span><u>Bank</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">Philippines</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

involving a group of RMC employees which sought to enforce its preference of
credit under Article 110 against DBP over certain RMC real properties.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In that case, the Court laid down the ruling
that Article 110 of the Labor Code, which cannot be viewed in isolation of, and
must always be reckoned with the provisions of the Civil Code on concurrence
and preference of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">credits, may not </span>be
invoked by employees or workers of RMC, like private respondents herein, in the
absence of a formal declaration of bankruptcy or a judicial liquidation order
of RMC.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">The rationale for making
the application of Article 110 of the Labor Code contingent upon the </span>institution
of bankruptcy or judicial liquidation proceedings against the employer is
premised upon the very nature of a preferential right of credit.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>A preference of credit bestows upon the
preferred creditor an advantage of having his credit satisfied first ahead of
other claims which may be established against the debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Logically, it becomes material only when the
properties and assets of the debtor are insufficient to pay his debts in full;
for if the debtor is amply able to pay his various creditors in full, how can
the necessity exist to determine which of his creditors shall be<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span>paid first or whether they shall be
paid out of the proceeds of the sale of the debtor's specific property?<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Indubitably, the preferential right of credit
attains significance only after the properties of the debtor have been
inventoried and liquidated, and the claims held by his various creditors have
been established [<span class="SpellE">Kuenzle</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Streiff</span>
(Ltd.) v. Villanueva, 41 Phil. 611 (1916); <span class="SpellE">Barretto</span>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">In this jurisdiction,
bankruptcy, insolvency and general judicial liquidation proceedings provide the
only proper venue for the enforcement of a creditor's preferential right such
as that established in Article 110 of the Labor Code, for these are in <span class="SpellE">rem</span> proceedings binding against the whole world where all
persons having any interest in the assets of the debtor are given the </span>opportunity
to establish their respective credits [<span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">Philippine
Savings Bank v. <span class="SpellE">Lantin</span>, <b>supra</b>.; Development
Bank of the Philippines v. Santos, <b>supra</b>.]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;</span>Secondly, public
respondent's Order directing petitioner to deliver to the MOLE the properties
it had foreclosed from RMC for the purpose of executing the judgment rendered
against RMC in Case No. NCR-LSED 7-334-84 violates the basic rule that the
power of a court or tribunal in the execution of its judgment extends only over
properties unquestionably belonging to the judgment debtor [Special Services
Corporation v. Centro La Paz, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-44100, </span><st1:date year="1983" day="28" month="4"><span class="GramE">April 28, 1983</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 121 SCRA 748; National Mines and Allied Workers' </span><st1:place><span class="GramE">Union</span></st1:place><span class="GramE"> v.

295.]</span></p>

<p class="BODY">It appears on record, and remains undisputed by respondents, that
petitioner had extra-judicially foreclosed the subject properties from RMC as
early as 1983 and purchased the same at public auction, and that RMC had failed
to exercise its right to redeem.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus,
when Officer-in-Charge Young issued on December 11, 1986 the order which
directed the delivery of these properties to the MOLE, RMC had ceased to be the
absolute owner thereof [<u>See</u> <span class="SpellE">Dizon</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Gaborra</span>, G.R. No. <span class="GramE">L-36821, </span><st1:date year="1978" day="22" month="6"><span class="GramE">June 22, 1978</span></st1:date><span class="GramE">, 83 SCRA 688.]</span> Consequently, the order was directed against
properties which no longer belonged to the judgment debtor RMC.</p>

<p class="BODY">However, respondents, in citing the case of <u>PCIB</u> <u>v.</u>
<u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt">NAMAWU-MIF</span></u><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:9.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">[supra],
</span>argue that by virtue of Article 110 of the Labor Code, an
"automatic first lien" was created in favor of <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:15.0pt">private </span>respondents on RMC properties
-- a "lien" which pre-dated the foreclosure of the subject properties
by petitioner, and remained vested on these properties even after its sale to
petitioner and other parties.</p>

<p class="BODY">There is no merit to this contention.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>It proceeds from a misconception which must
be corrected.</p>

<p class="BODY">What Article 110 of the Labor Code establishes is not <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt">a </span>lien, but <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
11.0pt">a </span>preference of credit in favor of employees [<u>See</u>
Republic v. Peralta, G.R. No. 56568, May 20, 1987, 150 SCRA 37.] This simply
means that during bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation proceedings involving
the existing properties of the employer, the employees have the advantage of
having their unpaid wages satisfied ahead of certain claims which may be proved
therein.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">It bears repeating that a
preference of credit points out solely the order in which creditors would be
paid from the properties of a</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:11.0pt"> </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:13.0pt">debtor inventoried and appraised during
bankruptcy, insolvency or liquidation proceedings.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Moreover, a preference does not exist in any
effective way prior to, and apart from, the institution of these proceedings,
for it is only then that the legal provisions on concurrence and preference of
credits begin to apply.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike a lien, a
preference of credit does not create in favor of the preferred creditor a
charge or proprietary interest upon any particular property of the debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Neither does it vest as a matter of course
upon the mere accrual of a money claim against the debtor.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Certainly, the debtor could very well sell,
mortgage or pledge his property, and convey good title thereon, to third
parties free from such preference [<span class="SpellE">Kuenzle</span> &amp; <span class="SpellE">Streiff</span> v. <span class="SpellE">Villanuena</span>, </span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">supra</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:

<p class="BODY">Incidentally, the Court is not unmindful of the 1989 amendments
to the article introduced by Section 1, R.A. No. 6715 [<st1:date year="1989" day="21" month="3">March 21, 1989</st1:date>].<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

concurrence and preference of credits; they do not affect the issues heretofore
