were subjected to inhuman punishment by the investigating officers of the

time that they subscribed to their affidavits of admission, they were in the
custody of the said officials who extracted from them their confession.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>That alone has engendered in the mind of the

<span class="SpellE">Sadicon</span>, was right in the barracks itself and accused
<span class="SpellE">Sadiwa</span> was helpless, being a detainee thereat, if he

</span>The same is true as in the case of accused <span class="SpellE">Alab</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>The Court is aware that the defense of threat
and intimidation in the execution of voluntary confessions is a modus operandi
of defense lawyers, but in the instant case, there is no gainsaying the fact
that the accused are unlettered, not even a registered voter at that and
therefore should be given the benefit of the doubt, with respect only to their
admission taken by PC soldiers. <span class="GramE">" (</span>Decision, pp.

offered for sale and an agreement was reached to visit the land the following
day, so that at 4 o'clock in the after­noon as agreed upon, they proceeded to
visit the land, together with Geronimo Largo, Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>

who was by the right of <span class="SpellE">Pabling</span> Chavez, both of them
holding guns which looked like carbine, his distance to the two being more or

breast, and having placed the arms of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>
around his shoulders, he pulled him, covering approximately a distance of
fifteen meters when he heard another shot and as far as he could remember,
there were three successive shots, after which he and Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>

price for the land and the latter told him that he would be willing to sell his
land for P13<span class="GramE">,000.00</span>.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;

<p class="BODY">The foregoing shows that the defense of the appellant is
alibi.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But such alibi, which is a weak
but often invoked defense, has been destroyed <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:
8.0pt">by the </span>testimony of <span class="SpellE">Nenita</span> <span class="SpellE">Cahilig</span> and Bernardo <span class="SpellE">Ola</span> who
positively iden­tified him as present and holding a long firearm at the scene
when Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> was fatally shot several
times.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span><span class="SpellE">Cahilig</span>
and <span class="SpellE">Ola</span> had no reason to testify falsely against the
appellant.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Hence, their credibi­lity
cannot be seriously questioned.</p>

<p class="BODY">The question of motive has been satisfactorily answered in the
People's brief as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"As for the possible motive for the killing, the evidence
discloses that appellant was bent on getting <span class="SpellE">Visitacion</span>
<span class="SpellE">Cahilig</span> to sell her property to his buyer, thereby,
making for himself some money from the transaction.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>But upon learning that the owner had already
committed the land to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span>, appellant
must have thought that the only way to stop the sale to Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> was to liquidate him.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>Of course, this may not be <span class="GramE">cause</span>
enough for most individuals to kill another but persons have been known to
commit crimes for lesser reasons than this.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp;
</span>Besides, the question of motive is only important in cases where there
is doubt as to whether the accused is or is not the person who committed the
act (U.S. vs. <span class="SpellE">M'Mann</span>, 4 Phil. 561, 563; People vs. <span class="SpellE">Divina</span> <span class="SpellE">Gracia</span>, G.R.

though they did not actually see the shooting, heard the firing of shots and
imme­diately thereafter saw appellant standing nearby with a carbine in hand,
proof of motive is not indis­pensable." <span class="GramE">(Pp. 12-13.)</span></blockquote>

<p class="BODY">The killing of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> was
qualified by treachery because the attack was sudden and gave him no chance to
defend himself.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court held that the murder was aggravated by evident
premeditation and <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Both the appellant and the <span class="SpellE">appellee</span>
agree that there was neither premeditation nor <span class="SpellE"><u>despoblado</u></span>
and they are right.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>There is no evi­dence
that the killing of Atty. <span class="SpellE">Venturanza</span> was the result
of meditation, calculation, reflection or persistent attempt.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>And there is likewise no evidence that the
site of the killing was purposely selected so that succor would not be available.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>In fact, the victim was with several persons
