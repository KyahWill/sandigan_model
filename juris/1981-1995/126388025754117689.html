				<BR><BR><div align="justify"><p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1982" day="5" month="4">5 April 1982</st1:date>,
respondent spouses Rafael and <span style="">Refugio <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> </span>pledged certain shares of
stock to <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place>
Investment House, Inc. ("State") in order to secure <span style="">a </span>loan of P120,000.00 designated as
Account No. IF-82-0631-AA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Prior to the
execution of the pledge, respondent spouses, <span style="">as </span>an accommodation to and together with the spouses Jose and <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, signed an
agreement (Account No. <span style="">IF-82-­</span>1379-AA) with <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place> for the latter's purchase of
receivables amounting to P375,000.00. When Account No. IF-82-0631-AA fell due,
respondent spouses paid the <span style="">same </span>partly
with their own funds and partly from the proceeds of another loan which they
obtained also from <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place>
designated <span style="">as
</span>Account No. IF-82-0904-AA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
new loan was secured by the same pledge agreement executed in relation to
Account No. IF-82-0631-AA.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>When the new
loan matured, State demanded payment.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Respondents expressed willingness to pay, requesting that upon payment,
the shares of stock pledged be released.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span><st1:place><st1:placename>Petitioner</st1:placename> <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place>
denied the request on the ground that the loan which it had extended to the
spouses Jose and <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
(Account No. IF-82-1379-AA) had remained unpaid.</p>

<p class="BODY">On <st1:date year="1984" day="29" month="6">29 June 1984</st1:date>,
Atty. Rolando <span class="SpellE">Salonga</span> sent to respondent spouses <span style="">a </span>Notice of
<span class="SpellE">Notarial</span> Sale stating that upon request of State and
by virtue of the pledge agreement, he would sell at public auction the shares
of stock pledged to State.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This prompted
respondents to file a case before the Regional Trial Court of <span class="SpellE">Quezon</span> City alleging that the intended foreclosure sale was
illegal because from the time the obligation under Account No. IF-82-0904-AA
became due, they had been able and willing to pay the same, but petitioner had
insisted that respondents <span style="">pay </span>even the loan account of Jose and <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span>
<span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> which had not been secured by the pledge.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It was further alleged that their failure to
pay their loan (Account No. IF-82-0904-AA) was excused because the <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place> itself had prevented the
satisfaction of the obligation.</p>

<p class="BODY">The trial court, <span style="">in </span>a decision dated <st1:date year="1984" day="14" month="12">14 December 1984</st1:date> rendered by Judge <span class="SpellE">Willelmo</span> <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>, initially
dismissed the complaint.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent
spouses filed <span style="">a
</span>motion for reconsideration praying for a new decision ordering <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place> to release the shares upon
payment of respondents' loan <span style="">"<u>without
</u></span><u>interest</u>," <span style="">as </span>the latter had not been in delay in the
performance of their obligation.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>State
countered that the pledge executed by respondent spouses also covered the loan extended
to Jose and <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
which too should be paid before the shares may be released.</p>

<p class="BODY">Acting on the motion for reconsideration, Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> set aside his original decision and rendered a new
judgment dated <st1:date year="1985" day="29" month="1">29 January 1985</st1:date>,
ordering State to immediately release the pledge and to deliver to respondents
the shares of stock "upon payment of the loan under Code No.
82-0904-AA."</p>

<p class="BODY">On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed <u>in</u> <span class="SpellE"><u>toto</u></span> the new decision of the trial court, holding
that the loan extended to Jose and <span class="SpellE">Marcelina</span> <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>, having been executed prior to the pledge was not
covered by the pledge which secured only loans executed subsequently.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, upon payment of the loan under Code No.
IF-82-0904-AA, the shares of stock should be released.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The decisions of the Court of Appeals and of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> became final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Upon remand of the records of the case to the trial court for
execution, there developed disagreement over the amount which respondent
spouses Rafael and Refugio <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> should pay to
secure the release of the shares of stock -- <st1:place><st1:placename>petitioner</st1:placename>
 <st1:placetype>State</st1:placetype></st1:place> contending that respondents
should also pay interest and respondents arguing they should not.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Respondent spouses then filed a motion with
the trial court to clarify the <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> decision praying
that an order issue clarifying the phrase "upon payment of plaintiffs'
loan" to mean upon payment of plaintiffs' loan in the principal amount of <span style="">P110.000.00 </span>alone, <span style="">"<u>without interest, penalties </u></span><u>and
other charges</u>."</p>

<p class="BODY">On 17 February 1989, the trial court, speaking this time through
Judge <span class="SpellE">Perlita</span> <span class="SpellE">Tria</span> <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span>, rendered a decision purporting to clarify the
decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> and ruling that petitioner
State shall <span style="">release
</span>respondents' shares of stock upon payment by respondents of the
principal of the loan as set forth in PN No. 82-0904-AA in the amount of
P110,000.00, <u>without interest, penalties and other charges</u>.</p>

<p class="BODY">Petitioner State appealed Judge <span class="SpellE">Tirona's</span>
decision to the Court of Appeals; the appeal was dismissed.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The Court of Appeals agreed with Judge <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span> that no interest need be paid and added that the <span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> (<span class="SpellE">Tirona</span>) decision
of the trial court merely restated what had been provided for in the earlier (<span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>) decision; that the <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span>
decision did not <span style="">go </span>beyond what
had been adjudged in the earlier decision.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>The motion for reconsideration filed by petitioner was accordingly
denied.</p>

<p class="BODY">Hence, this Petition for Review contending that no manifest
ambiguity existed in the decision penned by Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>;
that the trial court, through Judge <span class="SpellE">Tirona</span>, erred in
clarifying the decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>; and that the
amendment sought to be introduced in the <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>
decision by respondents may not <span style="">be </span>made
as the same was substantial in nature and the <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>
decision had become final.</p>

<p class="BODY"><span style="">We
</span>begin by noting that the trial court has asserted authority to issue the
<span class="SpellE">clarificatory</span> order in respect of the decision of
Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>, even though that judgment had become
final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span>.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>In <u>Reinsurance Company of the Orient, Inc. v. Court of Appeals</u>,<a style="" href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup></span></span></a>
this Court had occasion to deal with the applicable doctrine to some <span style="">extent:</span></p>

<blockquote>"- - - (E)<span class="SpellE">ven</span> a judgment which has
become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> may be clarified under
certain circumstances.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion of the judgment may, for instance,
contain an error clearly clerical in nature (perhaps best illustrated by an
error in arithmetical computation) or an ambiguity arising from inadvertent
omission, which error may<span style=""> </span>be
rectified or ambiguity clarified and the omission supplied by reference
primarily to the body of the decision itself.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>Supplementary reference to the pleadings previously filed in the case
may also be resorted to by way of corroboration of the existence of the error
or of the ambiguity in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the
judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In <span class="SpellE"><u>Locsin</u></span><u>,
et al. v. <span class="SpellE">Paredes</span>, et al.</u>, this Court allowed a
judgment which had become final and <span class="SpellE">executory</span> to be
clarified by supplying a word which had been inadvertently omitted and which,
when supplied, in effect changed the literal import of the original
phraseology:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span>it clearly appears from the <span style="">allegations
</span>of the complaint, the promissory note reproduced therein and made a part
thereof, the prayer and the conclusions of fact and of law contained in the
decision of the respondent judge, that the obligation contracted by the petitioners
<span style="">is </span>joint
and several and that the parties as well as the trial judge so understood
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><u>Under the juridical rule that the
judgment should be in accordance with the allegations, the evidence and the
conclusions of fact and law, the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of
the judgment under consideration should have ordered that the debt be paid
'several­ly' and in omitting the word or adverb 'severally' inadvertently, said
judgment became ambiguous.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>This
ambiguity may be clarified at any time after the decision <span style="">is </span>rendered and even after it had
become<span style="">&nbsp; </span>final</u> (34 Corpus <span class="SpellE">Juris</span>, 235, 326).<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>This respondent judge did not, therefore, exceed his jurisdiction in
clarifying the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the judgment by
supplying the omission.' (Underscoring supplied)</p>

<blockquote>In <u>Filipino Legion Corporation vs. Court of Appeals, et al.</u>,
the applicable principle was set out in the following terms:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q">'[W]here there is <u>ambiguity caused by an omission or mistake in
the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion</u> of <span style="">a </span>decision, the <u>court may clarify
such ambiguity</u> by an amendment <u>even after the judgment had become final</u>,
and for this purpose it may resort to the pleadings filed by the parties, the
court's findings of facts and conclusions of law <span style="">as </span>expressed in the body of the decision.' (Underscoring
supplied)</p>

<blockquote>In <u>Republic Surety and Insurance Company, Inc. v. Intermediate
Appellate Court</u>, the Court, in applying the above doctrine, said:</blockquote>

<p class="2Q"><span style="">'x x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
</span>We clarify, in other words, what we did affirm.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What is involved here is not what is
ordinarily regarded <span style="">as a </span>clerical
error in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> part of the decision of the
Court of <span style="">First </span>Instance, <span style="">x <span class="SpellE">x</span> <span class="SpellE">x</span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span></span>At the
same time, what <span style="">is </span>involved
here is not a correction of an erroneous judgment or <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of a judgment.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>What we believe
is involved here is in the nature of an inadvertent omission on the part of the
Court of First Instance (which should have been noticed <span style="">by </span>private respondents' counsel who had prepared the complaint),
of what might be described as a logical follow-through of something set forth
both in the body of the decision and in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion thereof:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>the inevitable
follow-through, or translation into, operational or behavioral terms, of the
annulment of the Deed of Sale with Assumption of Mortgage, from which
petitioners' title or claim of title embodied in TCT 133153 flows.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(Under­scoring supplied)' "<a style="" href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup></span></span></a>
(Underscoring in the original; citations omitted)</p>

<p class="BODY">The question we must resolve is thus whether or not there is an
ambiguity or clerical error or inadvertent omission in the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
portion of the decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> which may be
legitimately clarified by referring to the body of the decision and perhaps
even the pleadings filed before him.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The
decision of Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> disposing of the motion for
reconsideration filed by respondent spouses Rafael and Refugio <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> consisted basically of quoting practically the whole
motion for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In its <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span> portion, Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun's</span>
decision stated:</p>

<blockquote>"WHEREFORE, plaintiffs' 'Motion for Reconsi­deration' dated
January 3, 1985, is granted and the decision of this Court dated December 14,

<p class="BODY">Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> evidently meant to act
favorably on the motion for reconsideration of the respondent <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span> spouses and in effect accepted respondent spouses'
argument that they had <u>not</u> incurred <span class="SpellE"><u>mora</u></span>
considering that their failure to pay PN No. IF-82-0904-AA on time had been due
to petitioner State's unjustified refusal to release the shares pledged to
it.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is not, however, clear to what
precise extent Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> meant to grant the motion
for reconsideration.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The promissory note
<span style="">in Account No. IF-82-0904-AA </span>had
three (3) components:<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">(a) </span>principal of the loan in the
amount of P110,000.00; (b) regular interest in the amount of seventeen percent
(17%) per annum; and (c) additional or penalty interest in case of non-payment
at maturity, at the rate of two percent (2%) per month or twenty-four percent (24%)
per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In the <span class="SpellE">dispositive</span>
part of his resolution, Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> did <u>not</u>
specify which of these components of the loan he was ordering respondent
spouses to pay and which component or components he was in effect
deleting.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>We cannot assume that Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> meant to grant the relief prayed for by respondent
spouses in all its parts.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For <span style="">one </span>thing,
respondent spouses in their motion for reconsideration asked for "at least
P50,000.00" for moral damages and "at least P50,000.00" for
exemplary damages, as well <span style="">as </span>P20,000.00
by way of attorney's fees and litigation expenses.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>
granted respondent spouses only P10,000.00 as moral damages and P5,000.00 as
exemplary damages, plus P6,000.00 as attorney's fees and costs.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>For another, respondent spouses asked Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> to order the release of the shares pledged
"upon payment of [respondent spouses'] loan under Code No. 82-0904-AA <u>without
interest</u>, as plaintiffs were not in delay in accordance with Article 69 of
the New Civil Code ---" (Emphasis supplied).<span style="">&nbsp; </span>In other words, respondent spouses did not
themselves become very clear what they were asking Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>
to grant them; they did not apparently distinguish between regular interest or
"monetary interest" in the amount of seventeen percent (17%) per
annum and penalty charges or "compensatory interest" in the amount of
two percent (2%) per month or twenty-four percent (24%) per annum.</p>

<p class="BODY">It thus appears that the <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>
decision was ambiguous in the sense that it was cryptic.<span style="">&nbsp; </span><span style="">We </span>believe that in these circumstances, we
must assume that Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span> meant to decide <u>in
accordance with law</u>, that <span style="">we </span>cannot fairly assume that Judge <span class="SpellE">Fortun</span>
was grossly ignorant of the law, or that he intended to grant the respondent
spouses relief to which they were not entitled under law.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, the ultimate question which arises
is:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>if respondent <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
spouses were <u>not</u> in delay, what should they have been held liable for <u>in
accordance with law</u>?</p>

<p class="BODY">We believe and so hold that since respondent <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
spouses were held not to have been in delay, they were properly liable only
for:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) the principal of the loan or
P110,000.00; and (b) regular or monetary interest in the amount of seventeen
percent (17%) per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>They were <u>not</u>
liable for penalty or compensatory interest, fixed by the promissory note in
Account No. IF-82-0904-AA at two percent (2%) per month or twenty-four (24%)
per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It must be stressed in this
connection that under Article 2209 of the Civil Code which provides that</p>

<blockquote><span style="">"x <span class="SpellE">x</span>
<span class="SpellE">x</span> </span>[I]f the obligation consists in the payment
of <span style="">a </span>sum of money, and the
debtor incurs in delay, the indemnity for damages, there being no stipulation
to the contrary, shall be the payment of the interest agreed upon, and in the
absence of stipulation, the legal interest, which is six per cent per
annum."</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">the appropriate measure for damages in
case of delay in discharging an obligation consisting of the payment of a sum
of money, is the payment of penalty interest at the rate agreed upon; and in
the absence of <span style="">a </span>stipulation of
a particular rate of penalty interest, then the payment of additional interest
at a rate equal to the regular monetary interest; and if no regular interest
had been agreed upon, then payment of legal interest or six percent (6%) per
annum.<a style="" href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup></span></span></a></p>

<p class="BODY">The fact that the respondent <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>
spouses were not in default did <u>not</u> mean that they, as a matter of law, <span style="">were </span>relieved from the payment not
only of penalty or compensatory interest at the rate of twenty-four percent
(24%) per annum but also of regular or monetary interest of seventeen percent
(17%) per annum.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The regular or monetary
interest continued to accrue under the terms of the relevant promissory note
until actual payment is effected.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The payment
of regular interest constitutes the price or cost of the use of money and thus,
until the principal sum due is returned to the creditor, regular interest
continues to accrue since the debtor continues to use such principal
amount.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>The relevant rule is set out in
Article 1256 of the Civil Code which provides as follows:</p>

<blockquote>"Art. 1256.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>If the
creditor to whom tender of payment has been made refuses without just cause to
accept it, the debtor shall be released from responsibility <u>by the
consignation of the thing or sum due</u>.</blockquote>

<blockquote>Consignation alone shall produce the same effect in the following
cases:</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(1)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->When the creditor is absent or unknown, or does
not appear at the place of payment;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(2)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->When he is incapacitated to receive the payment
at the time it is due;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(3)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->When, without just cause, he refuses to give a
receipt;</blockquote>

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(4)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->When two or more persons claim the same right to

<blockquote><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style=""><span style="">(5)<span style="font: 7pt &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><!--[endif]-->When the title of the obligation has been
lost." (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>

<p class="BODY" style="text-indent: 0in;">Where the creditor unjustly refuses to
accept payment, the debtor desirous of being released from his obligation must
comply with two (2) conditions:<span style="">&nbsp; </span>(a) tender
of payment; and (b) consignation of the sum due.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Tender of payment must be accompanied or
followed by consignation in order that the effects of payment may be
produced.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>Thus, <span style="">in </span><u><span style="">Llamas v. <span class="SpellE">Abaya</span></span></u><span style="">,</span><a style="" href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class="MsoFootnoteReference"><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup></span></span></a><span style=""> </span>the Supreme Court stressed that <span style="">a </span>written tender of payment alone,
without consignation in court of the sum due, does not suspend the accruing of
regular or monetary interest.</p>

<p class="BODY">In the instant case, respondent spouses <span class="SpellE">Aquino</span>,
while they are properly regarded <span style="">as </span>having made a written tender of payment
to petitioner State, failed to consign in court the amount due at the time of
the maturity of Account No. IF-82-0904-AA.<span style="">&nbsp;
</span>It follows that their obligation to pay principal-<u>cum</u>-regular or
monetary interest under the terms and conditions of Account No. IF-82-0904-AA
was <u>not</u> extinguished by such tender of payment alone.</p>

<p class="BODY">For the respondent spouses to continue in possession of the
principal of the loan amounting to P110,000.00 and to continue to use the same

would constitute unjust enrichment on the part of the respondent spouses at the
expense of petitioner State even though the spouses had not been guilty of <span class="SpellE"><u>mora</u></span>.<span style="">&nbsp; </span>It is

by requiring, in addition to tender of payment, the consigna­tion of the amount
due in court which amount would thereafter be deposited by the Clerk of Court
in a bank and earn interest to which the creditor would be entitled.</p>
